    "text": "thank you everyone for joining us tonight um the purpose of this session is to provide a information back to the community in result of our investigation of water stability and in particular around the issue of copper pipe corrosion in the gloucester water system we have in the past had some concerns being raised they have been referenced back because our water supply does largely comply with the drinking water quality standards but in the more recent times myself and my colleagues at council who i 'll introduce shortly um have been looking at those at that history and what we wanted to do is make sure that we fully understand the background and history of the issue and that we 're better positioned to one provide information to the community in the future but also to look at how we can improve what it is that we 're doing that will hot that will benefit everything into the future so without too much of further due um i 'd like to introduce tonight or welcome tonight chenzi zhang our manager of water treatment and and water management um engineering um similar to myself my background i 'm robert scott i 'm council 's director of infrastructure and engineering services i have a background in civil and environmental engineering and an extensive experience in water also joining us tonight is our colleagues who from our consultant city water technologies um he 's mr bruce murray our engineering director for city water technologies and we 're probably the start of our implementation today which is the engineering manager with city water technologies jess in particular holds a bachelor of science in biology and biology as well as postgraduate diploma in a master of engineering in chemical and biomolecular she 's worked extensively through all of eastern australian states applying her special skills and knowledge to water and wastewater systems for many different clients um i 'd also like to acknowledge special guests that we had which is councillor catherine bell and what we 're hoping the session will be able to do is run for about 30 minutes with a presentation on the report that was provided to the council meeting back on last month we 'll then have a at the end of question time be able to talk about what our plans are for the future and where to from here importantly we have chosen um due to the covert restrictions to work off our um our zoom platform we would have rather be in person but uh it 's still an important issue that we really want to communicate back out with those people who are interested so we 're really keen to make this zoom session work what we 'd appreciate people doing is remain muted um where they can if they 've got a question don 't hesitate to pop it into the chat button at the bottom so if you click that bottom you can um chat you can send a question to us and as we 're going through the presentation if it 's appropriate we 'll we 'll answer them if not we can save them to the end and answer them then um there 's also an opportunity that if your connection for whatever reason gets a bit fuzzy um turn off your camera that will help to to get us welcome jess to take control of the presentation thanks rob so i had my little intro on who i am and what i do but i think you covered that pretty well so senior um uh chemical process engineer um chartered engineer um but in my time working in uh with city water technology i have been seconded to a few roles and i 've actually worked in a few offices with councils working with like gympie regional council uh queensland urban utilities and tasman and actually sat with them in their offices and worked with them so i 'll just get straight into the presentation so today we 're talking about the gloucester water treatment plant and water stability um these are the topics we 'll cover and one should feed into the other so first of all a bit of background context why we are having this talk um and what are the concerns then i want to walk you through the water treatment plant which originally we were hoping to do this on site in person um and and maybe there 's possibility for that later but individual steps work in order to convert that water that we pull out of the barrington river into the water that arrives at your tap then i want to go into what is water stability and corrosivity potential and once we we have some measures some numbers about the the corrosivity potentials what do those numbers mean and a good way to get a bit of an understanding about what the numbers mean is to compare them to other local government areas so if you ever hear me drop into the words lda which i tend to do because we speak about them all the time that just means your local government government areas um in the last three slides if you didn 't get bored during the presentation or you did get bored in the presentation the last three sides will just really bring together everything that we 've talked about and where council plans to go from there before we jump into the q a so the background so the barrington river from where the gloucester water treatment plant gets the water it 's typically low in ph this presentation the ph alkalinity hardness if it 's low water tends to be corrosive so that water um the irony with the barrington river is it 's a good water quality source it 's clean and clean water tends to be corrosive water so um what uh this is pretty consistent with a lot of raw water sources across the east coast of australia and tasmania the walls the water has low ph alkalinity and hardness so these waters they can be corrosive to metals such as copper and brass pipes and fittings and they can leach minerals out of your cement pipes or cement reservoirs so they just pull out the minerals and that gets carried into the water body so water quality complaints have arisen in gloucester and barrington which may be attributed to several factors including water age and the water corrosivity and pipe replacements in homes around gloucester and barrington have been partially mapped uh there 's just an excerpt of one of the maps um that 's just the gloucester region and council 's been working together with plumbers in the area to to are issues caused by corrosive water now generally speaking water quality is considered the main contributing factor so that is the constituents in the water rather lack thereof so like i was saying before water is a pure water or distilled water actually is acidic um it 's corrosive in nature and it 's a lack of having those minerals alkalinity harness in there that does make it uh corrosive but there are other factors like in uh all engineering problems and in life in general it 's never one cause for everything so uh organisms on pipe walls are a key one that 's not anything to worry about it 's pretty normal to have biofilm on your pipe walls reticulation design and layout the pipe materials and the quality of manufacture in fact i 'll talk a little bit um later about copper manufacturing how that 's evolved um through the ages in order to be more resilient to corrosion um the life of your asset obviously the older something gets the less well it works so for a copper asset it 's usually 50 to 80 years um but again it depends on how that asset is used and the water use characteristics that could be is it in a hot water system do you use it frequently etc etc so some of the problems that you get from corrosive water um high ph at the extremities of the reticulation that just means at your top so if you do have cement lime pipes and so on the water 's corrosive as it travels through the pipe it strips out the minerals and what you end up with with a higher ph at the end of the network now that 's not bad for you necessarily but it does affect your disinfection chlorine disinfection performance so how well that chlorine will then attack bacteria and viruses in water is reduced if our ph is too high and i 'll go more into that later because there 's a bit of an interplay between wanting to keep our ph high enough that the water 's not corrosive but not too high that the disinfection doesn 't work and then as we all know one of the other key corrosion and blue water from copper pipes so just to expand quickly on those last two this is a blown up image of what a pitting in copper pipes or copper assets looks like and it is basically localized non-uniform corrosion they form pits or holes which rupture um and they can begin and they usually do concentrate around points of microbiological mass so that 's what i was talking about before the biofilm um and where they grow or they have the propensity to grow where water may remain stagnant um they can cause this as well so also too this was a really recognized issue the pitting corrosion such that in 1996 they brought out a standard in europe it 's the bsen 1057 to improve the manufacture of copper in such a way to minimize this pitting and that standard there is called the copper and the copper alloys seamless round copper tubes for water and gas and blah blah blah but basically what this standard done was in the manufacturing process removal of carbon films from the board of the copper pipes so since the introduction incidences of so since 1996 um post installation they 've been finding the incidences of pitting have greatly reduced and that that pipeline is much more resilient to water corrosion the other thing uh that may be noted with your copper acids is blue waters and you tend to see this in your um your bathrooms in the shower around the toilet that that blue stain there um and that 's uh to do with the release of copper that 's you 're actually seeing copper there in in the sink on the right um there are many uh the one of the key ways to control this um the recommended is to flush the pipes by flushing the pipes you 're drawing chlorine residual that 's offered at the water treatment plant through the pipe and that actually attacks any biofilm that is leading to the corrosion of this of the copper pipe to mitigate it so we 'll talk about that more in mitigation strategies so just in the last slide to do with the context of this presentation so what we were asked by council um to took 10 years of data we wanted to be our most relevant what how we 're performing at the moment so we looked at 10 years of data we measured the corrosivity potential of that treated water just as it left the plant before it was uh delivered to the reticulation and onwards to the customers and and once we got the numbers around that we wanted to say how did they compare to the other local government areas so there will be a section on benchmarking but before i go into the particulars on corrosion i 'll just go through the water treatment plant process and how we get your water to your tub so basically a water treatment plant is essentially a factory for making drinking water and they 're specifically designed so every water treatment plant is unique to the raw water source that it 's taken from so you can take water from balls you can take it from rivers lakes you can take it from the ocean and that water treatment plant is designed to treat that specific water with its own characteristics and then broken up into stages of treatment and each of those treatment stages whether they 're physical treatment like filtration or chemical treatment like chlorination they 're each designed to remove constituents from water or add constituents to water to convert it into that drinking water so i 'll just go into a little bit about the water first before we get to the plant what does the water look like in barrington river so we 've already said it 's low in ph alkalinity and hardness and here are some graphs um they 've been put together by council so you probably can 't see the text along the bottom it 's quite small but the navy blue is gloucester the dots on the bottom is bulladella um mening is in yellow and shroud is in green and you can just see relatively speaking the gloucester ph is quite low um or the barrington river i should say raw water ph is quite low so it 's corrosive compared to your other sites that 's for alkalinity again that navy blue dots there shows that the alkalinity is on average calcium hardness so we pretty much established we know that the water there um is characteristically more corrosive so the water treatment plant so when the water arrives at the plant it 's received at rapid mix tents and this rapid mix tank it consists of four compartments and they 're each installed with vertical mixers the idea of those vertical mixers is they beat up the water and they want to ensure that when you put chemical in chemical being denser than water that it can 't sink to the bottom and that by being rapidly mixed it is um it 's been dispersed through the water column and not um collecting at the bottom of the tank so these are the chemicals that we dose at the rapid mix tank so the first is soda ash so soda ash is the key one in improving water stability we talk about proving water stability we 're also talking about improving water corrosivity and it 's really about raising that ph raising that alkalinity and hardness to get the water more passive rather than corrosive after that we just ach heard this um before particularly if you take aspirin or waterfront medication you 've got blood clotting illness a coagulant is anything that clots something so what the ach does is takes all that particulate the dirt and all the dirty stuff in water and it makes it clump together the polymer follows and that polymer basically gets all those clumps or we call them flock in the industry get so all that flock makes those stick together and they get heavier and then you 're able to settle them out of your water stream and leave clean water behind now that happens downstream after the rapid mixing tank we go to the flocculation tank so in the top right is just um the top view down are the water traveling underneath those grills there through the compartment and in the bottom right um there 's a flow plan and we 're in the yellow section of that flow plant of the plant um so from the rapid mix tank water flows to the flocculation tank they 're designed for about 10 minutes and during that 10 minutes these flock floppy particulate in the water at the end of the flocculation tank the operators will take grab samples for ph and the reason they do this is they want to verify that they 're meeting their target ph um in order to minimize that corrosivity so if the ph is too high they will wind back their soda ash dosing and if it 's too low they 'll do the inverse so that 's considered a control point that is basically somewhere where you take a measurement you make a um you make a call about the performance of of a certain treatment and you make adjustments accordingly so from the flocculation tank water then goes to the clarifier that 's there in the top right so as the the name sort of implies the clarifier clarifies the water and this is where all those flock that we talked about they get settled out so they 're made heavy by the polymer they are made to sink to the bottom and the clarified water that 's left behind floats over the top of the weir and downstream then the sludge and taken out of the water stream now the clear water so you can see we 're moving down in that flow plan on the right hand side we 're moving down um into now the filters so the clarified water is split between two media filters each media uh filter contains filter sand so at the bottom of that filter media where the sand is sitting there is what they call a plenum floor and it contains 480 nozzles what happens the water comes in um it passes through that filter bed and this is where all the polishing is done any leftover flock particularly it gets caught up in the sand bed and the clear water falls below out the bottom through those nozzles now all that particulate that 's caught up that gets washed out of those filters periodically usually about twice a week or in response to climbing turbidity turbidity is just a measure of the water clarity this is measured downstream in the process so whenever you hear me talk about a turbidity meter or turbidity we 're talking about how clear the water is that turbidity meter um which is located off the clearwater tank uh downstream and if that starts to climb up there we 'll instigate another backwash so again that 's a monitoring point and we call it that filtration critical control point and we want to keep that turbidity within measures to guarantee the quality of the turbidity of the water i should say um it 's also really important um i suppose measure for the removal of crypto if we 're achieving usually uh about a point three ntu we 're effectively removing um enough cryptosporidium from your water so after we leave those filters um water collects in a pipe where sodium fluoride um like in your toothpaste um is dosed for dental hygiene again like with the other critical control points or operational control points a fluoride meter is constantly measuring online the fluoride residual if it gets too high they will don 't ramp back the fluoride dose_._1115.76 it gets too low they 'll ramp it up so we 're always trying to target um the range that 's set out by the uh um the falls into a um into an inspection pit where sodium hypochlorite or you probably know it as chlorine is dosed for disinfection of pathogens and this is a real key step here for removing bacteria and viruses so that sodium hypo it 's dosed and then the water travels into the clear water tank or clear water reservoir which provides necessary contact time so we usually have to allow about 30 minutes for that chlorine and that water to mix in and to inactivate bacterium viruses from that tank the water is then transferred um via two uh suction pumps to the gloucester and barrington reticulations again the chlorine analyzer also located off this tank and that measures the performance of that chlorination system the chlorine is too high the sodium hypochlorite dosing will be ramped back and vice versa once we leave the plant the water either travels off to barrington or it is fills one of three reservoirs in the gloucester system before being on supply to customers in the area and this is basically the process all on one page um showing the water entering the plant ash um to minimize corrosion the ach and the polymer for flock formation um through the flocculation tank that flock forms it gets settled out in the clarifier water gets polished in the filters we dose fluoride then when a hypochlorite or chlorine for disinfection it 's then stored in the clear water tank and supplied onwards to town so that 's the water treatment plant and basically how it works so now i 'm just going to dive into the more technical uh part of the presentation about water stability and corrosivity potential so water stability and corrosivity potential can be measured many ways we can look at ph in isolation alkalinity harness uh and a few other indices i 'm just going to go through the key ones so ph is a number that expresses the acidity or the alkalinity of the solution on a logarithmic scale which just means 10 to the power of something but i just put to make it more interesting in the bottom right corner there just to give you an idea of different ph 's so there we 've got our water clean clean water is actually more towards the left of that it 's about six point six point seven six point five i 'd have to get the exact numbers but it 's actually corrosive by nature um and for any of you that drink coca-cola that 's about 2.7 not far off from your stomach acids and on the other end of the extreme your highly alkaline solutions are pretty much what you find under your bathroom sink so that is ph the lower the ph as we 've been talking about the higher the corrosivity now the australian drinking water guidelines this is just the guidance in australia if this is the water um this is the quality that it should be they recommend a ph range anywhere between 6.5 and 8.5 now this is very broad and usually a more acceptable narrow range is targeted and what we tend to target in reality is something around 7.6 and this is very important and i 'll explain more later on why we go for this number but if we go higher whilst we 're minimizing our corrosivity whilst opposite of corrosion it 's where sediment forms and it can actually protect your assets what happens at the higher end is your disinfection stops working so you can put as much chlorine as you want in there it 's about 40 times less effective at a ph of eight versus a ph of seven so we have to usually go for a trade-off somewhere between uh maximizing uh the water stability making it stable less corrosive as possible while not affecting the disinfection potential that 's the barrington river um the median value for ph is 7.4 when it arrives at the plant after soda ash dosing passing through the plant council achieves medium average of 8.1 so that again that 's that 's more on that higher end and the objective here is we want to deal with that corrosive raw water um add the soda ash and aim for the higher end now i 'll go into why we are quite high compared to that 7.8 target now alkalinity alkalinity is another key measure um and it 's basically the capacity for uh for the water to for anyone that 's out there that 's maybe a bit more chemical minded it 's the sum of hydroxides carbonates bicarbonates these are just your minerals in water and what those chemicals do or compounds do is they take the hydrogen atoms which is what makes something acidic takes them out of the water and then therefore lowers the acidity or raises the ph so a water utilities um we tend to target more than 40 milligrams per liter to avoid corrosivity this is where we sit so the barrington river median alkalinity is 25 by the time it leaves the plant is 33. so we actually are a bit below target um and that is interesting what we could do to mitigate this is to dose more so to ash as we were talking about earlier but if we do a small soda at your ph will go even higher and then your disinfection is compromised so we aim for the middle ground of about a 33 milligrams per liter now what are the other measures of corrosivity potential so in industry these are highly um used indices so there is two things the calcium carbonate precipitation potential and i 'll just call it ccpp and the langlier saturation index which is the lsi and you calculate you put numbers in about the ph the alkalinity sulfate hardness etc etc water into a model they call this the rothbang tamborini windsor model it 's just a computational analysis in excel and out spits a ccpp number and an lsi so the beauty of these measures is it doesn 't just look at ph and it doesn 't just look at alkalinity it looks at a whole suite of water quality parameters to give you a most accurate view of the whole picture so on the right hand side i 've just put a key there now depending on what number ccp p we end up with an lsi number will tell us something about our final water untreated water now if it is below zero sorry higher than zero it 's scaling if we want to be for ccpp we want to be somewhere between minus five and zero and if as we head into the more negative what is modeled um i will talk about scenario selection so when you model you can do one thing you can put in one set of ph number one set of alkalinity on one certain day etc etc or you can look at like we did a period of data 10 years of data because we want to see the full suite of what happened over those 10 years so we look for scenarios so we take a worst case scenario and we look at what was the worst ph the worst alkalinity and these are the low ones uh west phh alkalinity hardness and there 's other um other uh parameters that going into it like sulfides and we plug those into our rothberg tamborini model to calculate than the ccpp and lsi we also looked at typical case and best case so here 's a bit of a visual in the middle there that 's the rtw model there 's a lot of background calculations that i haven 't_''_1625.84 included here but it does it automatically i can 't take credit for it i just put the numbers numbers for the ph when it was at its worst case the alkalinity hardness temperature and sulfates and the model does all the work for me it brings out it spits out that ccpp and lsi i tabulated those numbers i repeated the same thing for scenario two which is the typical case what you would expect to have at your tap most of the time and the best case and this is what we found so that table there below the three columns the column colored column on the left minus 5.51 and minus 1.68 represented the worst case ccpp and lsi that the model came and what this told us is under the worst case conditions uh the water was mildly corrosive according to the ccpp and corrosive according to the lsi under your typical case that is most of the time your ccpp um is indicated that the water is stable so it 's neither scaly or corrosive but the lsi um we still indicated that it was mildly corrosive and then under the best case we 're heading towards a scenario where we have stable water mean well we know we 've got slightly corrosive water um and under the worst case condition we 've we 've got even more corrosive water but how do we compare so i went back into our records cwt just to do a bit of a benchmarking exercise to see how we 're performing compared to other water utilities and what mitigation strategies we might want to put in place so in 1999 the department of land water and conservation engaged city water technology to collect data from 128 local councils in country new south wales at the time and it was to do this for the purposes of minimizing corrosion so it was a recognized issue along a lot of water utilities or local government areas and the department wanted to learn more about it so they are city water uh technology to collect all the data um and come up with some strategies so of the 128 local council areas that were contacted we got 59 responses so almost half of them responded and the following was found so the top three are probably the most interesting 32 corrosion and of those 32 42 um identified that copper corrosion through pitting and through blue water so we then looked at the ccpp numbers the lsi and the ph and according to those numbers 60 of these local government areas this is just in new south wales 60 potentially have corrosive water so that is actually more than than the ones reporting it so then i took the numbers that we we got out of the rothberg tamborini windsor model for the ccpp and lsi and i wanted to compare them to a whole lot of other studies that we have done um in the last 10 years or so um and some of them very recently for other local water um local governments um now it should be stated that with the different studies that we compared for the other corrosivity projects that we 've done there is um different raw water sources of course a different water treatment plant going back to what i said originally the water treatment plants are designed for water sources some are more sophisticated than other um also the methodology used to may have vary depending what available data we had and then the size of the the sample set um was would vary as well so in some instances we 'd have a thousand data points and in others only 20._''_1862.88 and this is what we found so there is an image on the right those data points in blue show what they indicate the size of those data points indicates how big the sample size is or was so as we say in science repeatability is the key so the bigger the sample size the more evidence you 've got for something the more reliable we find that data so i just aim to show here the reliability of the data in terms of the size of those uh circles there so the zones the green zone on that graph indicates that water is stable and performed really well the um the yellow background uh zone indicates that water is either not corrosive or mildly corrosive and then in the red zone and by the way we 're talking about average average conditions here and in the red zone we and so glossy they 're showing in the green uh fluorine in the green in the red um is how it compared to the other sites so performing uh better than some and worse than others so uh this is the last few sites i said if you didn 't uh take anything in from the previous slides maybe uh these three will basically summon up for you so we know barrington river clean water source typically low in ph alkalinity and hardness this is very consistent with raw water sources along the east coast of australia and tasmania so we do soda ash um that soda ash drives up that ph in alkalinity to reduce the overall corrosivity potential from the tree to water data or set we looked at which was almost about 500 data points under the typical conditions we found the water was passive or it wasn 't corrosive um where as the lsi so sorry it was passive or not corrosive when we looked at ccpp value however the lsi indicated the water was typically corrosive so overall basically um based on the range of set and from that modeling it 's reasonable surmise that the supply water is periodically corrosive from the benchmarking exercise we found with the other local government areas um we showed that um for the ccpp which tends to be the more reliable measure of corrosivity um the glossary performed better than the other sites in terms of the lsi gloucester perform marginally worse but then corrosivity or water quality it 's not the whole story and given the fact that the water is not definitively highly corrosive um there are there can be and there usually is other factors that um an interplay of other factors so what are our recommendations for the customers so um as with any and i 'm sure most we ensure that any new pipe installations and manufacturing installed in accordance with relevant plumbing codes and i 've just put a link down there that 's publicly accessible information on the web and not too difficult to navigate through and understand um the other is where we do recognize uh that water can be corrosive is considering the installation of a sacrificial anodes um on hot water heaters um and what they are is they 're um they are little devices that will corrode more readily than the metal that you are trying to protect in this instance the copper um you do have to replace them according to your manufacturing instructions and depending on the the degree of uh degradation of that anode now where you are doing copper replacements in home it can be recommended that you replace that pipe with p e x pipe or similar um this is a good substitute for copper and is highly resistant to corrosive water and periodically flush pipes this is a key one um particularly where we may get pinning um corrosion or blue water from biofilms and they tend to like i said they tend to propagate in pipes where the water is stagnant where there might be dead ends in your system um where they grow they can cause proper pitting corrosion and so what we ask is that you flush the pipe that draws in hot water and or chlorinated water and that chlorine will help mitigate some of their growth we submitted our findings to council and in response to that council and they may be talking more on this later so i 'll just be brief councilman will be investigating potential options and costs for interim and long-term modification of your treatment process to get even better water quality so um some of these options in the immediate term maybe or the interim term maybe modification of the existing chemical configurations and improving the online water quality feedback so if you cast your mind back when to we were talking about the um process description and we have online instrumentation that was continuously monitoring the chlorine the fluoride the ph um improving this instrumentation allows operators to respond quickly to changes in the water quality to ensure that the treated water coming out the plant is uh optimized in the longer term um council is looking to pilot potentially new chemical delivery systems such as instead of soda ash lime and carbon dioxide now these two are great together because what they 'll do is they 'll allow us to draw our p to target a lower ph to that additional alkalinity to improve on the condition of the water and overall reduce the corrosivity potential so thank you everyone for listening um and now i 'll hand it back to you rob thank you very much jess um i really appreciate that on behalf of council in the community we appreciate your time tonight and unfortunately couldn 't_''_2236.88 be there in person because it would have been great to have you host you in gloucester ourselves but um yeah we appreciate your time to deliver um the results of your findings i will throw it open to anyone who has a question if you 'd like to unmute yourself we don 't have anything in the chat to to ask but if you 'd like to unmute yourself um there is an opportunity now for some questions of any of the um the council staff i 've introduced or the cwt team um about the work about the presentation or any other question that 's hot on people 's minds tonight while people are thinking about that um i might just add and that was that was great the electricians do is is connect earth some of the electrical systems to the copper pipes and um that can also set up some galvanic cell corrosion in copper so it 's also best to remind the electricians to put their separate earthing rods in rather than use the copper pipe water system yeah that 's certainly something that i 've come across part in the past before as well bruce where we 've found a an earth to be crossed with the copper pipe or where we 've had dissimilar metals used uh particularly copper pipe and the old gal services that also um cause some problems in water services themselves related to that material and it 's a bit different from the water quality the issues that we 're talking about more generally there but they can be causes as well yeah and the old gal pipes uh they created pretty fast in most of the areas where they were put in so not many of those left unfortunately as jess was saying i think that 's a that 's a consequence of having a really good quality a lot in it to start off with a lot of the time uh and we 're very fortunate i think particularly on the mid north coast councils that i 've worked for they largely have um you know very good water quality you get good clarity for it and you can see really well in the natural water down to depths which is a very good indicator of of the quality of the water that we 've got um if we don 't have any other questions by all means people feel free to ask questions you can always email council after afterwards myself and chansey as well at any point in time we 're more than happy to and one of the things we would like to do in the future as we alluded to earlier is actually have an open day and hosted at the plant um where we can take people through and actually show you it 's one thing to talk about it and see a picture that jess had but it is a total thing separate for that to walk through and talk with why um we 're really proud of the the work that we 've been able to do over all of our plants and um and certainly we wouldn 't hesitate to have a discussion with anyone around that so it 's something we look forward to any questions are you there yeah is that for david yeah yeah okay look i built a set of units in denison street set of four units 15 years ago i have recently had two leads with major damage to the units um from copper pipe pitting um uh these are the main in the unit that is leaking so far it was the main inlet line um so it 's not a stagnant issue it 's a high flow pipe which then feeds into the smaller pipes throughout the units and this is just in one unit so i 'm waiting for a potential for all the other units to have the same problem i think the um i talk my plumber is bruce mckechnie he he has said that he has done a lot of um re-piping of houses in town so think the problem is far greater than council realizes a lot of it doesn 't get reported i never reported mine i was too disgusted so i think you have a huge problem and the damage is probably already done that 's too late um what are you how are you going to address this issue well i think from from that perspective we were probably talking about these options um through jess 's report for property owners to consider how they deal with this in the long term particularly around making sure that their systems well designed or well plumbed to to counter some of the natural occurrences of water corrosion and softness there we 're also in a situation on the back end of the information we 've got from this to look at what we can do both in the short term and the longer term you 're right in a sense there isn 't a lot that we can do to rectify you know the gloucester water supply system has operated in the current situation for quite some time the plant the plant originally was constructed a major augmentation for a fair while and um there isn 't a lot we can do to wind back the time in relation to that however what i must stress to it is that the water that has come out of that plant and that even this year we have 100 compliance with the australian drinking water guidelines so um largely the plant itself has been producing good quality water obviously the source helps that because the source itself is fairly clear and good quality water as jess was damaged was documenting earlier it it really the hardness and the natural occurrence of the water does control the impact that it has on water services across the area so we 'd be more than pleased to talk about your individual circumstances and then happy that you raised them today as well thank you thanks jess oh sorry now you go man you 're first okay i 'm bob thanks jess for that uh really informative presentation um don 't you think it 's a statistical improbability that 300 homes as reported to me by the promise by a plumber readings over 10 years is there one time when the dosage went up too high so you are you 're able to finger put your finger on that the dosage went up too high on sodash or on yeah to corrode our pipes you know 300 300 homes sorry that in relation to the chlorine incident in 2015 uh i wouldn 't think it 'd be that because this is 2021 where it all happened yeah um i 'm just wondering if something happened in 2021 which caused all this to look you know 300 homes to have these big problems uh i 'm not sure because when i look i looked at the plant from the perspective of the water that came into the plant the water that left the plant where it arrives in a geographical area it might be an interesting question about the geography of where certain houses were established uh and the asset itself well if i can i am going to if i can just add i think um you know corrosion is a long-term problem um it doesn 't really you know ever for 40 years on particular short-term incidents um even you know the chlorine incident of 2015. um that 's a very short term it it you know it probably doesn 't help the situation but it 's unlikely to do any major damage it really takes several to several years to decades for this sort of stuff to occur and it 's often microbiological um so you know that management is just a gradual slow thing you know unfortunately um water as jess has pointed out is corrosive um you know the purer the water the more corrosive it is it 's um the universal solvent so it does just slowly work away and the microbes add to that problem it usually takes a fair bit of time at least 10 years and probably more like 20 30 40 years just vincent pecks pipes are they the plastic pipe spruce yeah well that 's what all the plumbers are using these days it just takes out that risk you know copper is an imperfect material and um we don 't really use it so much anymore that you know the you probably know and um just get rid of this problem so that 's what everybody 's doing now and if you are going with the copper pipes i think they do come with a stamp um i don 't know if it 's the the uh the is the bsen 1057 will be in that slide it does come with a stamp that says it 's as per that standard if you do stay with the copper pipes you said flush the pipes um does that mean turn all your taps on at once yes right fine thank you thank you so much i really appreciate it especially if you 've got a section of your um pipe that goes out to right out to the very backyard and you hardly ever use the tap that 's the target area that jess was really sort of referring to so and again through design of systems if the pipe layout actually ended at things like a shower or toilet that we know gets regularly used that 's going to help improve the situation overall as well and i might just degree of manufacturing quality and um that available and certainly prior to the establishment of the standard there as jess indicated um a lot of the um the carbon film that was on through the manufacturing process also um was detrimental to the presence of copper pipe corrosion in systems and and often the worst cases are you know big buildings um so traditionally uh you know hospitals and apartment blocks and those sort of things that were built especially you know more than 20 years ago have this problem quite commonly and also uh where they 've been you know holiday houses or unoccupied units or houses um that the water just sits there for a long time it 's just corrosive water sitting on a material that isn 't perfect is you know over a long time it seems to be the main problem rob can i jump in and ask a question you certainly cannot we 're up to the next question so that 's all right um the report is quite detailed but in simple terms what do i tell residents as to the reason for pipes i 've had that through my house with one of the leaking in four or five different spots as well and they 're used all the time but in simple terminology what is the answer what do i tell residents who have had the plumber come back to them four or five times that if anyone else wants to jump in let me know bruce or jess or kenzie um [Music] is that there 's a there is a variety of influences over copper pipe corrosion and the um the raw water or the water chemistry is just one of them what we do know of the barrington is that the it is largely free of all sorts of things in it which is which is a very um you know a more aggressive thing and it has and it has um that potential around it overall though we know that marking were better than some and not as good as others um and copper pipe is prone to pitting corrosion in a in a large number of circumstances so again it 's probably hard to answer the question different situations and scenarios that people ask you about um but there is a lot that goes into it and it 's it 's not necessarily just the water and i suppose you can add that um you know unfortunately you 're not alone it 's the whole east coast of australia has this problem we you know they 're both blessed and cursed that the water 's pretty good and so one of the fortunate things that we have and there 's a large project underway at the moment dealing with our reservoirs and our the direct connection of the treatment plant to the system and improving the overall pressure plus the water quality in the reticulation system but in the we 've also got a large a further program investment plan for both replacing the sewer treatment works which our team is working on the detailed design of at the moment and ultimately the addressing the long-term water security which includes an opportunity for us to look at uh major improvements for the water treatment plant or in fact even potentially retire reflecting the water treatment plant where look at the options that jess presented for changing the way that we dose and what chemicals we use and in particular lime and co2 which i 've experienced that other supplies that i 've been involved in in the last few years particularly at white water treatment plant where most support macquarie 's water is treated with that system because it had a very similar thing up until just recently so may i ask a question please yes um back to the issue of the homes in gloucester now i believe it 's actually over 400 homes so this happening in this period of time would be unprecedented i would think can you tell me has the water chlorination that 's caused the pitting been in any other towns that are in our council and if it hasn 't been then why has this happened now in gloucester our home is 13 years old and yet we 've had three parts of our pipes had to be cut out because they are pitted now that 's quite incredible when the pipes are used um it 's not like it 's presentation thank you jess and i appreciate the work that the council was doing going forward however this doesn 't assist us we 're still waiting i think my first visit to council was the 26th to the fourth at 1 30. um that 's some months ago we 're still waiting to have our pipes replaced they have had to put three sections in it so i think this is just incredible that a town can have so many issues in such a short period of time there has to be a reason for this what would that reason be um one thing i would add there whilst we 've anecdotally um got reports and we 've we 've um part of the work that we did was actually to map where those reports of the copper corrosion were working with the plumbers in town on what they could recall where they 've had incidents or whether that we certainly don 't have um whilst it might be circulating out there of three or four hundred we haven 't seen the report the actual um information to suggest though is that there is a number of copper pipe corrosion issues that have gone out there are largely they don 't in some supplies get reported to us or where they 've been reported to us in the past or historically we haven 't captured that information so it 's very difficult for us now to compare on the relativities of it between our water supplies um what we do know is that the data that jess walked through is this thing that it is potentially um more aggressive than the water in a lot of the other systems that we do have but i do know that other systems and other council areas do do also have similar or have had um similar problems as is suggested by the benchmarking um it 's essentially i just want to add a little bit for the water um we do find probably um like the natural wood is low in alkalinity harness eccentric but these conditions get worse since 2014 probably around that year so i did check the previous starter so probably one of just chart you can see harness is lower harness that things is higher and then job bait since 2014 and um i think this one is associated with the rainfall how much rainfall we receive in the catchment because approximately yeah yeah growth is in the upper catchment so you can see oh just that that chart you so that thank you yeah so in 2012 you you can see the trend is higher so it 's always oh this one 's alkalinity probably high is even more clear yeah so tucson earns 11 to 13 you have them on higher venue is around 30 and 30 above and then lower is probably 15 close to 20 but this one dropped in 2014 so your lowest one job to something line right and the highest one is only just above 20. so this one 's continue for a few years and then go back to 2020 so it 's january you can see a big spike on there and calcium harness that spike is come from rainfall we receive in january so during that um basically if the rainfall is not enough so if we they don 't get a chance to absorb um items when they flow through so they generally have even lower and harness harness our communities so that 's that 's probably um yeah definitely didn 't help this situation not at all not at all because i mean we 've had a drought for four years and we all know that um our water supply was exhausted um you know i appreciate the efforts that to get the water brought in here to us um but you know i i just as i said i grateful for all the information i can see that you know moving forward that you 're trying to fix things and knowing that we don 't i assume have to have pop up pipe now from the meter to our house will be great because we won 't have to deal with that issue but to have so many homes in one area um to be subjected to this is quite incredible and you know the expense to their homeowners is going to be astronomical yeah yeah i understand that situation that 's that 's can make problems is we 're definitely going to investigate the option and then we 're not saying we 're going to do it in two or three years we will get investigation down in six months we definitely go through all the option analysis and then provide the cost so i will have another council report report back to council and then to say that will be the cost for us to make improvement and then get a control screw or to say when we 're going to take action so i think these things we will continue to communicate back to um every people attend today 's meeting or even people is registered and then i i think i want to improve our communication between us and then community members so that 's why like rob indicated we hope in future we can have some open days and then bring people to the treatment plan i think i i for my part i really want to show the people how the treatment plan works and how do we control the water quality because it 's always my first so you drink water and you definitely don 't get our illness from our water so sometimes that 's clean water didn 't not really help with this kind of situation because more cleaning water and water could be more crosstalk yes exactly i know it 's damned if you do damned if you don 't but again as i said it 's certainly something has made this happen during this short period of time i know um the cluster diagram is on there but that certainly hasn 't covered those homes i have spoken with um some plumbers and you know they said oh yes we did get together and we did try and put dots on the on the map but then we thought oh no we 've forgotten all these different people i mean it 's not what they do they 're not diagnostic people as far as doing that sort of thing but um it just is astounding that this has happened and um our catherine smith who lives here locally i mean she 's a person who will cop the brunt of people speaking with actually what you can do to assist us having to pay we 're looking at thousands of dollars to have our pipes renewed in a 13 year old home why should this be the case there probably a couple of things relevant to that one thing we do have is a concealed leak rebate scheme which for people because often you cut often these sorts of things happen underground or in walls over a period of time they result in water lossage loss as well as the cost of repair or replacement um and we do look at offsetting the um the costs associated with the water usage but one of the big things or i guess the most important thing that we 've got to put forward from our point is that we do have a very large plan of capital work for that that that that plan is is in the order of 50 to 60 million dollars including it 's underway um that is all reflected in our pricing path for water which we 're trying to hold very much at this at the same level and similar to a household budget at the end of the day we 've got to recover what it costs to run the water supply and the sewer systems from the users of the system so if there 's any more costs associated with that it just translates into higher higher charges where we can keep that down we 're trying to keep downwards pressure on that so that we 're not increasing any more than what we have to because the intention is not to make a profit over time it 's purely to cover those costs but also to deliver benefits to the community which is one of the benefits that the gloucester community has been in the mid coast area is our ability to resource the financial value of those projects now than what we would have previously been able to do potentially because we do have a lot more users and we do rationalize the cost over those uses so that 's where if you look at our um our program over the current years we 're certainly investing a substantial and plan to invest a substantial at 60 million dollars is probably the most expensive infrastructure in investment in gloucester um that i 'd say would see over the next 10 years certainly so it is probably really timely that we 've had this discussion that we 've done the investigation because it certainly provides a lot of motivation and i 'm sure councillor smith would agree that when we bring back muscle opportunities and options to both help in the short term but also address it in the longer term we 'll get a lot of support from the council to proceed into that as part of our plans and um that 's that 's what we 're really looking forward to but we do take on board that you know it has it adversely and will continue to impact some residents there um quite extensively and you know as we know it is it isn 't it isn 't a deliberate thing it is has been natural result of the water quality in that area it 's also influenced by a lot of other factors that vary from the property and that 's why oh sorry i was just going to say just on the technical side of it it 's also how much control you have when you do have water of a certain quality i mean you 've got at the moment we discussed the soda ashdocine you can get your ph up you can get that alkalinity almost up not quite to where we get it but if we keep dosing it this is our only strategy to deal with this water you keep dosing it then we 're compromising public health through the emergence of bacterias and viruses that that chlorine can 't treat so it 's trying to find like that that sweet spot in between and that 's why we talk about doing these superior lyme and co2 it is a more expensive dosing system but that 's because it works works better it 's more sophisticated and you we won 't be compromising the disinfection by getting the water corrosivity down especially when you have these periods of drought and yeah which it 's been extensive yes no i get that i get that but i think treatment plant and then hadn 't had a major upgrade or had one in 1980 um since 2016 replacement renewal of age mechanical value valves chemical dosing system electrical equipment etc has been undertaken and you know that 's been happening but it 's 40 years you know it 's um and this town in itself has grown dramatically um everything has to be monitored when you let a town increase in size you have to have the infrastructure put in place to cater for that um i 'm relatively new here um well three and a half years so that 's very new um according to locals but um it 's it 's a wonderful town um there 's certainly a lot of forethought going into moving forward and what we need to have put in there so in the systems to have a good water supply that 's drinkable um jess i 'm not sure if you 've tasted our water but i uh i boil it and then put it through a filter um you know coming from port stevens uh it 's it 's very different move and that 's because the water comes from the river and i i understand that but i do find it very difficult to accept the fact that um people will be hurt financially here and it 's dreadful for our whole country at the moment i understand that but we can 't_''_3878.72 let this go because there 's too many people it 's happened too can i just uh add a question in there just on top of it all sorry i 've just been listening um two points would it be reasonable to clarify the extent of the issue by with council actually contacting the half dozen or eight plumbers that are in gloucester and actually try and get some accurate numbers because you 're sort of sitting there saying we we haven 't had reports it 's only anecdotal um i 'm a bit the same i 've got two properties that are affected um and both with feed in lines not to do with dead ends or anything like that so it 's and it 's happened all of a sudden the second question 's on long-term um wear and tear on pipes whatever you like to call it could then have a super hit at a small and over a short period that could exacerbate those long term issues all of a sudden is there any research that would back that up so if you all of us haven 't had a flood event and you have a high dosing of whatever in the system that that would exacerbate already in line issues that are there and then that that would cause you a broader problem all of a sudden a lot of properties well look up maybe i can answer that um the the only the only suspects there are you know we 've sort of established that the water is a bit corrosive and there are times when it 's more corrosive than others and you know there are some targets we have for calcium hardness and alkalinity and all the rest of it and if cancer goes down the root of phloem carbon dioxide dosing well those things can be targeted the only other possible culprit is microbes so micro microbially induced in some towns um and maybe uh could be looked at a little bit further and you know that is about having a bit more chlorine in the system to manage it which is um which introduced taste and odors and what chlorine tastes so you know that 's not always ideal so again it 's it 's balancing a whole lot of factors which um it 's hard to deliver all things to all people so um but all these things are being looked at as as she explained um and is worth considering is this presentation going to be available online for people of you that is our plan and it has been recorded so could we could we have that and also i don 't know what the concealed leak program could we have a link to that on that same page and some questions and answers um uh attached and i guess the proposed open days i think that 's a fantastic idea i know the staff work really hard especially with the old um treatment plant that that we have so i think that 's information together to direct residents to um i think that would be worthwhile we could just put all that together i 'll just also i would like to go back to one of the questions earlier a lot of the work we 're doing at the moment um associated with the new reservoir at cemetery road um the new rising mains through town is is really focusing on the first property making sure that we have enough pressure and volume to support the growth of the town from both now and well and truly into the future it 'll also take ease a lot of the pressure on our operators to deal with fluctuations in raw water quality simply by the fact that they will have more storage available within the reticulation system so they can get so that has been our priority um that then is then translating into the sewer treatment works which is also an aged asset um from comparing the water treatment and the sewer treatment it 's probably the sewer treatment definitely needs some more work first and then ultimately um we 're also planning treatment together as part of the last phase of our of our investment in the um in the area so hopefully you guys in the gloucester community get so sick of seeing myself and chansey and the rest of the team on all our projects we 've got coming forward um that um you love to see the back of us one day in about 10 years time when we 've um we 've been able to help and sort out a lot of these issues so we 're going to be very there very regularly and working with our team and our consultants like cwt and a lot of the other specialists that we use and rely upon to do work as well as our contractors like fb contracting at the moment that are in town to deliver better outcomes for the community so it 's a um exciting times ahead we 'll work on getting that information up on to our website also we 've got everyone 's email addresses so we can um both prompt you with um letting you know when things are up there and down there um if there aren 't any more direct questions we are a little bit over time and i appreciate again everybody 's attendance tonight um we 'll certainly have some open days in the future as soon as the covert restrictions lift and we 'll welcome the opportunity to to meet and talk with everyone at any point in time um if everyone if there aren 't any more questions what i will do is firstly thank jess and bruce both for joining us tonight and also the work that they 've done looking into the background i think kenzie and her team for the work that they have done as well in supplying the information but also in the general day-to-day operation of our system um and thank you i guess you guys again for showing an interest and wanting to be involved and bringing this issue to us so that we can have a discussion and further and and get to better outcomes i really appreciate it yeah and we definitely have follow-up emails to everyone who registered and james and send the link once this link over there information and you required and also keep you updated once we 'll be able to do open open days in future so i hope finger crossed just in a couple months to be able to ride really looking forward to meet someone face to face from the community okay thank you everyone have a great year thank you thanks everybody thank you thanks thanks rob it 's been great good thank you okay _"

came out in august of this year so welcome to both of you thanks me so our first guest is sandy docker who grew up in coffs harbour not far from us here on the mid north coast but is joining us tonight from sydney sandy 's father introduced her to books as a teenager and her go-to genre was fantasy but she grew a love for women 's fiction when she studied jane austen for her hsc whilst sandy studied mandarin at university a lecturer suggested she might have a knack for writing and a seat back of her mind while she lived overseas and traveled the world sandy writes about love lost family and small country towns since 2018 sandy has had four books published the kookaburra creek cafe the the cottage at rosella cove the banksia bay beach shack and most recently the waddle island book club so if you have any questions for sandy be sure to pop them into the chat function and we 'll get to them i 'll also pop in a link to sandy 's website so i 'll now hand you over to sandy to tell us a little bit more about her books and what books we should be reading next thanks annie thank you so much kenina and thank you chris and trish for having me as well i was actually supposed to be doing an in-person event with mid coast libraries but for the obvious reasons that got scuttled and i 'm very thrilled that you would have me here tonight instead and as kanina said i grew up in coffs harbor so i 'd like to think of myself as a nearly local to me and hopefully fingers crossed at the end of this month i 'll be able to get up there and see my family haven 't seen them since january because i am as canine said in sydney and i have been stuck in lockdown for what feels like forever uh although not as bad as the poor victorians so um thankfully we 're out now and as kamina said i am here tonight to talk about my fourth book the wattle island book club and the three others you can see behind me and it still feels a little surreal that i 'm on my fourth book in the same number of years as kanina said kookaburra creek came out in 2018 and while that 's been a book a year and seems like a really kind of fast-paced overnight success story it took me about 18 years to get to that point um and kanina will know and so will mary lou and annie who i can see in the chat here tonight that there 's an awful lot of long-suffering pain and rejection and many manuscripts that that the shelf but to tell you a little bit about the wattle island book club it is the story of grace who is a young librarian and she 's battling some personal trauma and chris just did a little cheer there let 's celebrate the librarians chris um and she 's contacted by anne who is an octogenarian matriarch of bottle island who wants to restart the wattle island book club the book club had been running for about 60 years before it stopped suddenly about seven years ago and as grace gets to know and she discovers that there 's something big that the island inhabitants just don 't speak of and she 's determined to uncover what that mystery is and to help the book club reignite so she travels to wattall ireland uh which is part of her ticking off her bucket list which are a feature of the book in the hope to uncover the truth and they form a really beautiful friendship and they have to work together to each come overcome their traumas and to help the town and the book club find their that celebrates new beginnings and the power of literature and community and that it 's never too late to write your story and it was actually inspired by a real life librarian from nearly up your way i was doing a tour for my debut novel the bar creek cafe and i was at port macquarie library doing an event and the gorgeous librarian leanne there and i were chatting at the end of the event and we were talking about how book clubs had really taken off in the hastings area and that they even had a book club on lord howe island and that she would send a box of books from the library over on the supply ship to lord howe island for the book club over there and she also told me a fair bit about her personal story and i won 't go into any spoilers at this point in time but she very much informed the character of grace and i was driving then to my next event which was impossible and my brain was just pinging with these ideas boxes of books on on an island there 's got to be a story in that so i contacted leanne afterwards and said i think there 's a story here do you mind if i write this and she was really helpful giving me so much information about not only her personal story but also what it 's like to be a librarian and yeah she was really instrumental in bringing this story to life so it is a celebration not only of book clubs but of libraries and librarians and and just how big a part of the community they are and it kind of seems fitting i guess to be here tonight talking about book clubs in a book and then going on to talk about recommendations which i think is just fantastic and one of the books i brought along with me tonight is actually featured in the wattle island book club and it 's the book that our librarian grace chooses to try to bring this new wattle island book club together it 's a really disparate group of people with a broad range of interests and age groups and so the book she chooses for them to gel is one of my favorite books of all time and it 's the very first book i ever did in my very first ever book club that i 'm a part of and it is the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society and this book has stayed with me for i think 2011 we read this in book club so that 's quite a while now that has stayed with me and it 's just such a gorgeous story again celebrating books set just after world war ii but the interesting thing is i started that book club with the kindergarten mums at the time and i chose the first ever book and i chose it purely based on the title i knew nothing about it and when i picked up the tub of books from my local library to then deliver to the ladies in book club i sort of had a sneaky little look at it you know a bench outside the library and i realized the entire thing was written in letters and i thought oh god i 'm going to hate it this whole book club thing is going to be a disaster um but as i said one of my favorite books of all time i loved it loved it loved it and so did most of the ladies in the book club so that 's the first recommendation that i have tonight the second one is another old one i 've got two old and two new tonight and that is the red tent by need to diamond it has a different cover now this is about 20 years old this one um it has a very different cover now and it is the story of dina who is one of the daughters of jacob in the bible and it 's not a biblical story it 's taking and imagined their uh variation of her life and what it was like and this is the first book i think that i read where the power of words really hit me the prologue in this is simply to die for so this is one i would highly recommend and it 's one that when people christmas or what should i give to my mum for christmas i always recommend this one and it 's always a hit so the first of the newer books uh is from an author who is local to me in sydney joanna nell and it 's the tea ladies of saint jude 's hospital now this cover is the advanced reading cover so the actual cover of the book looks more like that i hope that 's clear enough to see if you 're looking for it on the shelf and joanna nell is a wonderful storyteller she writes the most beautiful and engaging characters and this story follows um three women who seem to have nothing in common at all and they 're trying to save the cafeteria at the hospital that they 're working in when it go um when the hospital undergoes a refurbishment and joanna has a really wonderful take on particularly on older characters and how she writes them and the problems that they face so if you haven 't checked out joanna nell before this is her newest one which i think came out yeah i think i think you 're right yeah and then the last one i have and i did not know that mary lou was going to be here tonight is mary lou 's the last of the apple blossom sorry to embarrass you mary lou um mary lou and i met earlier this year i think it was mary lou only virtually we haven 't met in person yet and this is um mary lou 's debut fiction novel and it 's set in tasmania after the great fires there and what happened in the apple orchards and it follows catherine and annie who are women that are trying to save their family businesses in a time where it wasn 't really the woman 's job to save their family business um the thing that i loved the most about this is the actual writing the prose in this and and prose is not something i tend to get too excited about other than the prologue in the red tent um it 's usually story for me and character that really kicks it off but this is just so you and she 's crying you 're supposed to cry when you read my books mary lou not when i 'm talking about your books um the pros is just gorgeous and it 's a really wonderful sweeping saga so do yourselves a favor i feel like molly mildred uh and get yourselves a copy of the last of the apple blossoms and they are my four recommendations and all four of them would make wonderful book club books uh and as i said water island have done the guernsey literary and potato pool of pie society and i 'd like to think that they would study these other ones as well thank you so much sandy um for those of you talking in book club books we mine were clubbed in um the kookaburra creek cafe one of sandy 's books a few years ago and everyone loved it so if you are a book club member there is one of the big plastic box kits uh that you can get sandy 's sandy 's book and because you were talking about book clubs i contacted meredith who deals that we currently have 75 active book clubs in the area and 268 book club sets which is pretty amazing yeah that 's just they 've gone gangbusters haven 't they lately yeah there 's so many and it 's fantastic to see i at the weekend saw two book clubs just meeting in the park which was lovely um i also wanted to say to you sandy that leanne the lovely librarian from port macquarie she often joins us tonight so she 'll be um disappointed that she hasn 't heard you give her a big beautiful shout out we did a virtual event um with port macquarie that was one of the ones i was supposed to go to as well on my tour up the coast so we did a virtual event there and i got to give her a virtual hug i 'm hoping if i do get up um to see mum at the end of the month i 'll be able to actually stop in the pool on the way and give her a great big hug because yeah without her this book wouldn here some comments um fiona has recommended her click and collect book mellie windy so hey pronounce it right malawindi by joy detman that 's a book that she 's gotten from the library annie seton 's written i was a librarian too marie 's written yay for all the librarians um narelle has written yes a great great book i must read it and i think that was for the guernsey potato peel book which i must say is one of the best film adaptations too which is really rare usually i 'm heavily heavily disappointed when a book i always have great anticipation that i want it to be as good as the book and then i 'm disappointed but i think they did a really good job with that adaptation yeah they stayed pretty true to the book which was really good so i wanted to ask you sandy do you find it hard coming up with a new idea that will fit into the same parameters of your work that the publishers are keen to keep you within that kind of same uh story setting so use the evil term brand brand that 's your brand which is huge your brand uh and i have obviously if you can tell by the covers behind me a very key brand that the publisher is working to the titles are all very similar and it is uh small town australia some sort of secret or mystery in the past and the dual timeline and dual narrative that i work to the ideas uh come i find relatively easily turning those ideas into a fully fledged story i think is the trick you know i have a book of ideas just jotted down of what might become a story but it 's turning those into you know a story that can be sustained for you know 90 000 words that 's the hard part and i 'm in the middle of that right now kanina knows from our writing group on fridays um my book for next year is due very soon into my publisher and that 's the red gun river retreat so as you can see very similar style of title uh and yeah i 'm frantically to flesh out that story the idea is i think fantastic fleshing it out is is the real trick there 's so much anticipation to sandy what color cover you 'll get because they 're all such beautiful colored covers and they all sit so pretty together so it 's always a bit exciting when you do the big reveal yeah yeah i had a competition for the water island book club on my socials you know what color will it be and a lot of people went yellow which is kind of obvious i guess for for wattle but um yeah we 'll see what the next one is you 'd i would think red because of the red gum but maybe not i don 't know i know we don 't get a state we don 't get a saying so it 's as much a surprise for me as it is for the readers well thank you very much sandy and if any of our viewers tonight have questions be sure to pop them into the chat and we 'll get to them um so now i avila who have been practicing his surname um who joined us tonight from the from northern new south wales so i don 't think you 're that far away from us either in terms of location jake no sort of between ballina and lismore yeah so just just up the road yeah we haven 't been able to go up the road for quite a long time oh yeah absolutely jake is a full-time writer with a bachelor of arts in writing and information technology he has a background in freelance journalism writing on politics culture technology and sport he also taught secondary english for 10 years and in 2019 he won the adventure writers competition that clive kusler grand master award for for cave diver that 's a very big mouthful isn 't it and then he went on to win the wilbur smith adventure writing prize for the same book in 2020 so jake 's book cave diver has been classified as a thriller adventure mystery suspense historical fiction and war story so it 's clearly got a lot going for it so once again if you 've function and we 'll get to them so i 'm now going to hand you over to jake to tell us a little bit more about cave diver along with what book recommendations he 's got thanks jake hi kanina thanks thanks for having me and hi everybody really pleased to be here um yes my novel uh cave diver um a bit like sandy it was a had a long genesis i first had the idea for the story around 2000 and it literally just came to me like a vision i just thought of this i was fascinated by popular always been interested in world war ii and i knew that artifacts were turning up and i thought imagine if something really big was hidden in the jungle so you know simple idea jotted down a few pages just to capture it and then it basically sat on my hard drive for the next 16 years and it wasn 't until i got long service leave and teaching that i sort of thought right i 'm gonna really try and knock this book out and that 's what and then uh and then that turned into this um you know journey of trying to get published and like sandy just really stressful and funnily enough uh in the early naughties i 'd submitted a few um you know much less quality novels and had got agent interest you know and so when i wrote this i thought oh this has got to get somewhere and so i was really devastated when it got absolutely nowhere and thank goodness for those competitions um particularly the wilbur smith which led to manuscript development as part of the prize and uh and and and consideration for being published it wasn 't automatic they had to like it enough to publish it so what 's cavediver about well it 's essentially the story of an acclaimed underwater explorer lost his way um his wife died in a controversial diving accident and that sort of destroyed all his sponsorship deals and he 's living in shame and uh surfing the big waves off western australia and essentially just wishing he was dead uh and then it 's a sort of a family crisis from a indonesian television crew to go looking in this cave in papua a bottomless cavern where they need a expert cave diver to plum its depths but what rob doesn 't know is that they 're actually a criminal syndicate looking to salvage tons of gold bullion so it very quickly turns into a white knuckle journey of survival going up the sepik river and uh and and i guess there 's a deeper level story here than that is that rob doesn 't really know what his problem is until he 's confronted with it and so he sort of finds himself in this battle for survival and and has to heal that way so it 's some fairly full-on action if you like clive kusler and wilbur smith you 'll you 'll definitely enjoy it i do find that some you know lovers of that genre occasionally go it 's a little bit serious isn 't it and that was sort of a choice i made that i wanted it to be gritty realism i grew up with lynn dayton alistair mclean ham and dennis those sort me to alternate realities and made me suspend my disbelief so whilst it does get you know uh someone described it to me the other day as you know action adventure on steroids um i sort of you know i sort of like to pride myself on technical veracity and one of the ways that i achieved that was a very generous man the president of the australian cave diving association at the time helped me with all the technical aspects of the diving because i 'm definitely not a cave diver i 've done scuba diving but you 'll never get me in a cave i 'm slightly claustrophobic which help with the imagination and uh feeling the terror so um yeah so it 's a it 's a it 's a it 's a bit of a page turner and um [Music] it 's sort of yeah it 's been um been quite a journey to get it done uh so that 's cave diver um so i thought i 'd talk a little bit about my recommendations i thought long and hard about this and i actually me that all my selections were the youngest one was at least 20 years old or 30 years old so that might be giving away a bit about my reading styles but um i did come up with a more recent one so i thought i 'd start with that and that 's called the um the offing by benjamin myers he 's a british writer and it was a present from my sister-in-law who 's an avid reader and book club member and the offing is essentially a coming-of-age story it 's said in post-war britain it 's about a young man robert appleyard who comes from a coal mining family and to avoid his fate of going down pit he sort of leaves home at 16 and goes wandering through yorkshire and ends up at the coast essentially just looking for work um and there he meets dulce this extremely unusual woman who 's three times his age living in a tumbled down ramshackle cottage overlooking the sea and she essentially gives robert food and board because he 's he 's driven to create order in her you doesn 't she want to look at the the sea you know why she why is it covered up so he spends his time uh you know pruning uh and but and i guess one of the beautiful things about this story is that it 's a coming-of-age story where he actually helps her as well she 's got a deep tragedy that she hasn 't faced and in the journey of them getting to know each other um she helps him heal and uh one of the reasons that i particularly love this book is because his writing is very different to mine mine 's extremely fast and he sort of dives in almost like a photo real newspaper sorry photo real painting just want to read you a tiny little burst just to give you a sense he talks about following an ancient network of paths in the countryside and he says deep down in the cool dark throat of one such subterranean route i saw a badger set burrowed into the dirt bankside and surrounded by mounded heaps of impacted soil these sculpted slopes led into a claw marks here were hieroglyphics a wordless poetry of sorts and close by clear patterns of tunneling runs led away through hedge gaps and into the long grass of the surrounding pastures so having been you know i was born in england i love going to england and i often felt as if i was literally lying in an english field and he was taking me there and i could smell it i could i could see it i could feel the butterflies landing on my nose it was just a fantastic and moving story so highly recommended another story i thought was really timely and and i hope that it 's been a long time since you read it 1984 by george orwell probably not surprising that an english teacher would want to talk about that i first encountered it when i was in year 10. these days they don 't teach it except in advanced english um it could even be extension now in year 12. but i thought what a story in this era where we 're confronting the post-truth very briefly it 's the story of ministry of truth which is highly ironic and his job is to fabricate history to make it fit in with the current propaganda narrative of the totalitarian party running the state um meanwhile he 's living this wonderful secret life of rebellion in his mind and that leads him down a path where he 's just desperate for truth he 's just desperate that two and two can equal four not five and and it 's just such a powerful story informed by orwell 's own experiences he um as you know was a burmese policeman went to burma with the imperial police service there he showed his sort of anti-anti-establishment uh persona he sort of eschewed the expat community learned to speak burmese and learned about the culture through the monks um when he came home he realized that poverty was what was interested in interesting to him and so he went and became a down and out in london and paris uh the road to wigan pier these were the things that interested him that culminated in going to the spanish civil war where he fought on the he wasn 't a communist he was democratic socialist but it was there he respected the communists but it was there that he became totally disillusioned with all forms of totalitarianism and essentially he was tried in absentia by uh communist groups and declared a fascist and so that was where he came up with his wonderful allegory animal farm and then in 1948 he wrote 1984 which i only learned the other day he wrote on the island of jura in scotland i learned that from watching joanna lumley 's lovely little trip around the uk and when he was dying of tuberculosis and he just wrote this incredible story that the last line i won 't do a spoiler alert but the last lines i i remem i would i didn 't need to pick up the book to remember them it was just that powerful so um uh uh and one more thing about it is one of the things i love about this book having studied um english and literature at university is his understanding of the way language creates thought that if you debase language can feel without words we think we intellectualize with words and when you take them away you lose that capacity to think and to question which is of course why the party comes up with newspeak and you know double plus ungood and all that kind of stuff so yeah if you haven 't read it for since you were a teenager go back to it he 's an incredible writer there 's virtually no figurative language it 's just sparse prose but it 's just beautiful in its simplicity got four minutes left so i thought i 'd talk now about i thought i 'd talk about this one lynn dayton 's bomber um for me this is one of the seminal world war ii novels first encountered it as an 11 year old but it was published in 1970 and it essentially tells the story of a fictional bombing raid over germany in 1943 and it 's told from the perspective of the british bomber crew but also the germans who are bombed and the german fighter pilots who are fighting him in the skies over germany um are no winners it 's about the tragedy and the futility of war um it 's it 's also a story where um i think it was highly controversial at the time because you may not have known that bomber command was one of the despised services it sort of reminds me bit of the vietnam veterans predicament where the general public was sort of horrified by the war they 'd fought and with bomber command because over 350 000 german civilians were killed directly from their raids there was a sense of we don 't really want to go there and they actually didn 't get a memorial until 2012. it took that long for them to be acknowledged even though they had a 40 casualty rate and over 55 000 of them died um so it was a it was a terrible war the air war and lynn dayton he 's i think he 's an underrated novelist he 's sort of he 's extremely intelligent and he uses dialogue extremely well like that 's one of my challenges as a writer to become to better at getting in this sort of effortless way that just makes you just drive into the characterization um it has a sort of a documentary style he manages to weave in all that technology um but it 's that human story that tragedy and it 's interesting that both the british pilot sort of ends up in disgrace even though by any measure he 's an incredibly courageous individual and the german fighter pilot who we sort of think of as a nazi but ultimately ends up being executed which is probably no surprise but it 's actually a hard book to get i actually i located a copy years later after i lost my original copy and i made the mistake of lending it to someone and i won 't do that again when i find another version because that 's actually a photocopy i stuck on the front of a book just for the illustrative purposes i just couldn 't i just like every second-hand bookshop i go into i look for that and it isn 't there so um i could talk more but i 'm almost out of recommendations hope hope they 're interesting to you oh thanks so much jake um i 've got a question for you i wanted to know whether you find it hard to come up with continual pacey plot with the kind of stories that you like to write yeah look at that i i have had plot demons for sure kanina i remember um you know like you know the index cards sometimes all spread out over the floor um trying to kind of work out where the story is it is you know my story i guess it is plot driven um but by the same token i 'm trying to inject humanity into it because if it 's not there i you know you tend to get bored so it 's sort of like i guess it 's like a lot of conjecture if that happened would this happen and then it 's like the more research i do so for the current novel i 'm writing i 've managed to track down a volcanologist who spent time on in the southern ocean on a volcano and um so was saying with her inspiration they they give you suddenly new directions to go down things that you wouldn 't even think of so my original plot always changes it 's always quite different when i get to where i ultimately arrive at oh that 's fantastic um i also wanted to ask what is it that you love about the adventure genre i think it 's i think i 'm an armchair adventurer so for me like something we all are at the moment yeah like i mean i i have i came to surfing late and i had my moments of sheer terror and and occasional moments of bravery but i 'm not a real adventurer but i love reading about adventures and that kind of about people who do things that i can 't do and i mean and i just find it endlessly fascinating and i guess so i like to kind of use all my skills of score storytelling to give to give people like me that experience i think um sandy might be able to relate to that when she 's just put grace other adventurous activities uh so that did you partake in many of those sandy [Laughter] no i i am adventurous in that i love to travel and i 've traveled you know quite extensively throughout the world you know back when we could um but i am not adventurous in terms of bungee jumping or jumping out of planes that 's something else that grace does on her bucket list um we see grace 's bucket list from the time she 's seven right through to now as a 30-something year old and the evolution of those bucket lists so you know in her first bucket list when she has seven she wants to eat cupcakes for breakfast you know as a seven-year-old would and then you know as a 30 year old at her like this change and yeah um we we the very first scene we see is grace bungee jumping um i had to do my research for that vicariously so i put a call out to facebook and said is anyone being bungee jumping has anyone been skydiving tell me what it 's like because there any of those activities yes i wouldn 't i wouldn 't do them either i 'd like to think that i would but the the um armchair adventurer sounds like a good phrase jake i 'm going to use that in the future um and he 's also written lol i 'm with you sandy now i 've got a comment here from fiona that has said hi jake did you say that you read the bomber as an 11 year old and do you think it would be okay for other 11 year olds or have you always liked more dark and serious reading i probably have liked more dark and serious reading i know the version i read first was the reader 's digest condensed version of my grandmother 's but i found the real book pretty soon after i i don 't think i think it 's it is serious i mean it 's obviously war and it 's quite well written so yeah probably a bit of parental guidance but i suspect it 's it 's probably okay depending on the child thanks jake also if more about how to get a book club together or more information about it there 's an email address in the uh little chat where you can contact marriage for more information um now i 'm also just going to pop in my newsletter link because each month um i have a giveaway which highlights our guests for tonight so i 've got a giveaway of both sandy and jake 's books to give away to two lucky readers um if you sign up overnight i 'll send it out it 's already gone out but i will send it out to those people who haven 't yet received it and tomorrow night i will draw two winners which is always very exciting for the winners so i 'm going to move on to my book recommendations now which i had to smile when sandy 's recommendation came through as i also was going to give a shout out to mary lou 's debut which was the last of the apple blossoms which came out earlier this year um it 's a sweeping beautiful family a saga set in tasmania the human valley immediately you 're catapulted into the panic and fear as the fires close in young teacher catherine returns to her family 's apple orchard to find devastation at a neighbouring orchard mother of six annie is worried for her family 's livelihood her brood of sons and her newborn daughter the story intertwines between the two women 's lives over many years we 're taken on a journey of heartache friendship desire love and secrets as you quickly fall in love with the characters mary lou has clearly done a great deal of research to ensure the accuracies of accuracies of tasmania 's history she captures key figures and cultural events the reader learns so much about the apple industry the demands are put on the orchard farms and the techniques used such information is woven into the story in an interesting and captivating way so this one is a tender and heartfelt read especially those that are interested in historical fiction so congratulations to you mary lee i 'm glad that you 're here to see that tonight and chris i 'm going to really quickly our latest book club read which probably many people have read but it 's the nowhere child by christian white who actually saw at port macquarie library a couple of years ago um it came out with a lot of hype around it and everyone i 've ever spoken to had really enjoyed it i have previously on here recommended his second book the wife and the widow which i 'd listened to on audio and so with this one i read it within a matter of days the main character kim is approached by a total stranger um and the stranger says to her that he thinks that she might be sammy wendt who 's a little girl who went missing after her second birthday 26 years ago so it 's got a great hook at the start uh imagine if you were told that the your whole life 's not what you think it is um so it 's a fast-paced thriller and it will have you guessing along the way i didn 't predict the twist at all a couple of my book club guest elements of author builds into the world of pentecostal fundamentalist group in kentucky which who handle poisonous snakes as a part of their work um work their work their worship and faith so that really added to the eerie atmosphere and for those of you that are christian white fans he 's got a brand new book which came out last week called wild place so i 'm going to quickly ask another question before i hand over to you chris i wanted to ask both sanji and jay what 's your favorite part of the writing process sandy do you want to go first the favorite part of the writing process is the part that i 'm not in at the moment so at the moment i 'm writing the red gun river retreat and i am thinking god i can 't wait till i get to edit this when i get into the editing process i will be like gee i wish i was back in the writing process um i 'm yeah the grass is always greener when i 'm writing so whatever part that i 'm in um to anything else at the moment i 'm wishing i could get to the editing and then when i 'm in editing i like the dream of being you know blank page and starting the story fresh and new again because that 's you know what i like yeah the freedoms yeah it 'd be so nice to have so many freedoms when you 've got all the freedoms you think oh i wish i knew a little bit more about this character so i knew what they 'd do in this situation yeah and so now i 'm in that freedom part where the story can be anything that wants to be before i get to the editing and i 'm like oh i just wish i knew i just wish i knew what was going to happen so yeah i 'm i 'm not very faithful to the moment that i 'm in what about you jake yeah i 'm i 'm similar i 'm i really enjoy i mean i i i love i mean i wouldn 't do it if i didn 't want to do there 's a lot of you know like i wish i was doing something else feelings i i saw a good quote from harlan coburn where he said when you 're a writer you 're essentially imagining a world while the real one 's going outside your window so sometimes you do feel a bit cut off especially if he 's writing slowly so and my i guess my challenge is to sort of try to stay in the writing mode because i especially with i 'm looking you know i 'm thinking oh what 's the descent rate of a c-17 aircraft oh i 'll just look it up and all of a sudden you 're doing research and what happened to the story so you know it 's really tricky with the internet i mean i look at those old school writers from the you know the 19th century and how um prolific they were and i 'm thinking their concentration i mean they didn 't have you know they were amazing so yeah i would like to be more focused thank you all right well now i or two for tonight thank you canada and um thank you sandy and jake and also kanina uh for the recommendations and i 'm very keen to read the novels i will have a confession i have a confession to make i haven 't actually chose mary lou 's book as a recommendation um but clearly i need to uh i should add it on my own list for next time i um i 'm gonna do two uh well uh kanina only because i 'm sort of reading and researching on one level and reading on another level so i 'm going to i don 't know that i 'll make this a recommendation but i have to say that when jake was saying he 'd gone back to the old classics i 'm currently i got fascinated by uh researching viking mythology actually going back to the source documents now the last um last book club i spoke about reading the prose editor which is the original sort of text but there 's alongside it there 's this uh thing called the poetic edda and this is all that really really interesting to read through and uh the language and and i just find myself going seriously i wonder what the hell that message is but just for today because if he 's saying that oh you went back to the classics i have to say this was um the poems of the power together have their roots in the cold brutal world of medieval scandinavia during the viking so-called viking age roughly id 800 to 1100 so probably a little older jake and and the writing style is certainly it 's a bit dated i 'd have to say the um the the other book that i read and this is classically what happens with me anyway because i don 't do anything near as much reading as i 'd like to is my other book is always whatever my book club is reading because we do a book a month and that seems to be about about how much time i find uh disappoints me because as a child when i was a young adult i used to read voraciously and i have to i 'm chris i just sort of jump here and say to so that our viewers know that you are you do have a reputation for walking the streets and reading a book though which i don 't think many people can do that 's a like you 've mastered that art i 'm sure i 'd get run over it is true and my face is clear of bruises at this stage um but yeah i read in about half hour of work morning or something like that while i 'm out walking and love it actually it 's my favorite and when people say oh why aren 't you observing the world like i am and i could be sitting at home in a lounge chair reading or i could be outside reading and i reckon i 'm an absolute winner being outside so um so the book book my book club is reading is uh it 's the actually latest uh miles franklin award-winning novel by amanda lowery called the labyrinth now i definitely enjoyed this novel the um it 's perhaps not um it doesn 't have perhaps 's there 's um or action 's perhaps not the right word but really um events within it but it 's clearly um reveals fascinating characters it 's based around erica marsden and she she as it unfolds she realizes she has a son in prison and i 'm not giving too much away because you encounter this very early on and her son is quite a disturbed individual and she moves to an era where she can be close and visit him but as as she does show so she enters this whole south um sort of the south coast of of new south wales community and the characters she encounters and also the revelations of her her um her childhood and what she 's been through it 's a field of complex individuals that i always find rewarding i i like the characters it 's based around the title is based around the building of a labyrinth and that 's actually important because her um her father who who was a psychiatrist had said to her at one point that it 's really important to for the mind with your hands to build something and so bivaria this means she comes at a labyrinth which i didn 't realize the differences between amazing labyrinth and the novel gives you a bit of background on that and it 's it 's about that journey that the labyrinth takes you on rather than trying to solve a puzzle to get to the middle which is what the maze is about so and and the imagery is really really effective you feel yourself within that south coast area it 's got a real beach sort of windswept beach feel about it and as i said interesting characters that come and go the um the plot and it has a really good ending but like a a good cohen brothers movie often you don 't have the hollywood style of the plot 's going to do this and the plot 's going to do that and whatever you 're not really sure where the plot 's going to take you or where the characters are going to take it and i i really do enjoy that journey or that uncertainty of where think my book club will have really enjoyed this almost invariably there 'll be somebody who couldn 't stand it and there 'll be somebody who absolutely raves about it and says it 's the best novel they 've ever read but that 's the wonder of um you know yeah that 's right that 's why you all belong to book clubs we we often write our um our discussion afterwards uh alongside the book itself and that people often find they 've changed their writing based on what others have said around it and so so i think there 's the value of being in a book club is that richness of uh discussion and and perspectives and the wine too of course so um so that 's my recommendation amanda lowery i hope i 've pronounced the surname right the labyrinth and if you can find the poetic edda somewhere yeah i 'm enjoying it um it 's probably not everyone 's taste but i 'm enjoying it so thank you thank you chris i 've just read here that fiona 's written i 've run into on the lanyard and his phone sitting on the side of the book he isn 't reading so he can look at the words if he needs to i 'll look up the words if you need to it 's it 's absolutely true fiona 's also said um this is to sandy and jake i 'm amazed that you can both had you both had an idea nearly two decades ago and somehow sit on it then have it come to fruition and finally publication that 's so amazing which it is also amazed that you didn 't get much say on the cover um that 's just one of the downsides isn 't it jake did you get much say on your cover i got asked if i liked it yeah that 's about it yeah it is one of the downsides but it is also um you know i 'm not an artist so you know i had no idea what i would have done if i was coming up with the cover and you know you 've got to trust the publisher that they know what a marketing decision because that 's the first thing that people see um so yeah but it is scary the first time you know when kookaburra creek was was being printed and i had no idea what the process was and i didn 't know what it was going to be she said i was going to do an illustration so i pictured a cartoon and i was horrified and i was really scared but when they came out with the cover they came out with i was really really happy the only input i have now is um so they 've asked me about you know what are the elements in red gum river that might make an interesting part of the cover and there 's a lot of music in red gum river so you know there might be a cello or something like that that 's the only input i have the rest of it is is up to them and um you know thankfully um they 've been really good but yeah like jake says basically we get the email saying we hope you love this got another question for both of you so what well i know that you 've spoken specifically cindy about the water island but feel free to to move between books so generally what comes first for you when you 're writing the characters the setting or the complication for me what comes first is a particular scene in the book it 's nothing to do with the plot or the characters or anything else so with waddle island it was picturing those books in a box on a boat heading to an island and that was the first thing in my head with um the other novels it was the same thing so banksy bay beach hack which was last year 's novel i was homing costs it had just rained and i was walking on the beach and you know the cold that can seep through sand that 's like really icy cold it goes right through to your bones i had this flash of a girl sitting on the sand and the cold seeping through her in the middle of the storm and that became a scene in one picture of a scene and then i 'm like okay what does this mean who are these people why are they there you know in banksy bay why is this girl sitting in a storm and she 's not getting out of it you know and that 's where i start and then i write my way into the story and characters yeah that 's really interesting thanks sandy what about you jake uh well i 've i had that original uh vision of the submarine but i didn 't get my protagonist till about three years later when i was doing a a freelance journalist piece for inside sport on cave diving and i was i went i climbed down a ladder in this uh field in mount gambia out this long metal ladder and was in this sort of hunched over in this little cave watching people disappear in this muddy slot and i just thought um this is horrifying and but i thought you know it just got me thinking who would what sort of person does this what motivates them what can go wrong you guess yeah it 's more that it 's more it 's more an instinct for uh what 's at stake of you know a feeling an emotion um it 's usually some form of inspiration that then it starts to filter out sort of permeates your consciousness yeah it 's i love hearing how everyone comes to their books and from such a tiny little seed as well in so many cases that you know turns into a hundred thousand words or roughly so before i let you go i wanted to tell you about the pacific palms riders festival just going to pop the link into the chat it was initially supposed to be an in-person event scheduled for last year however it had to be cancelled like so many things over the last 18 months um but they are doing a virtual event this year so to find out more you can click on the link it 's it 's a free event too at this stage well for this year a huge thank you to both sandy and jake for joining us today what fabulous guests you to tell us about your own books and what books you 'd love to read and thank you to all you viewers for joining us as well all the books that have been mentioned by sandy jake chris and myself are all available on the midcoast libraries catalogue i don 't know if the poet poetic editor is so quick i suspect not not because he throws his recommendations in suddenly um alternatively if you want to purchase any we encourage that you contact your local bookstore and anyone in our local area you should head out to the sitting wombat at foster so we hope you have a wonderful month ahead hopefully you 'll get your hands on some of the recommendations that have come through tonight and if you 're wanting to double check the titles i 'll be popping it up onto my social media accounts at kanina maywriter along with the midcoast library 's facebook page they 'll also share the um post as well so we are going to squeeze in one more session for this year which is in four weeks time on the joining us will be carly lane whose brand new book won burnt twice shy uh along with annie satan whose brand new release osprey reefer who 's checking us out tonight so i look forward to chatting to both annie and carly next month so thanks again sandy and jake and um have a wonderful month thanks kanina thank you thank you very much thank you thanks well done bye you _"

    "text": "good morning and welcome to the manning river turtle art project this is a very special project and your teachers have nominated you to be involved today today is world wildlife day it is a day where we celebrate animals and all living things so it 's a really great day for you to hear about this art project and our focused animal the manning river helmeted turtle my name is alicia and i 'm a catchment officer for midcoast council a catchment officer cares for the land waterways animals and communities that live in a catchment this is an area where water is collected by the natural landscape and drains to the lowest point the catchment i work in is and our focus today is the manning river i 'll be your host and our first speaker today is wildlife expert tim faulkner he 'll be teaching you about this precious little turtle found only in the creeks and rivers in our region in the manning river our second guest is an artist and her name is shona wilson she will be telling you about how art can be i 'm thrilled to introduce our first guest wildlife expert tim faulkner tim is the director of the australian reptile park which some of you may have been lucky enough to visit he was australian geographic 's conservationist of the year in 2015 and he has helped establish aussie arc which is a wildlife sanctuary for endangered native animals located nearby in the barrington tops tim is here to talk all about the turtle so i 'll pass it over to tim good morning good morning hi everyone and thank you very much for having me along this is one of my favorite things to talk about so the manning river helmet and turtle and just think about the start of this name the manning river and that should tell you that it only lives in one spot in the world and it 's done that for about the last 80 million years that 's earlier than the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago but that means it 's really fragile and the reason for that is because they only live in that one spot if they 're if big flood or an extinction event in one of ten spots you would still have nine spots that the turtles remain but because they live in one spot it really means we need to protect them so they live in what are called the headwaters of your creek and the headwaters are right up where the creek begins at the furthest now why they live there is because that 's where the best fresh water is they 're a fresh water turtle so they used to be found in a lot more of the river further downstream however because of some of the threats that they face and i 'll explain them to you but because of some of the freshness they now live in the best part of the creek right up where the forest is like the barrington forest or dingo top spores and the water that comes off the hill is clean and fresh now they live there partly because they 're the best parts of the river but also because of what they eat and where they met so they 're a short neck turtle and just popped on my deck and if you 're patient enough for a few minutes i 'll get it out at the very end and show you what it is that you 're going to take care of so what they eat we all might have seen especially where you live a long neck turtle now they 're the ones that you 'll find on the road crossing the road a long neck turtle is also called a snake neck turtle and it has a long neck left by arm because it hurts okay strike that hump but many with the helmeted turtles are short neck turtles they don 't humpty they 're basically garbage cleaners but in the best way so they clean all of the fallen fruits and leaves if the fish dies in the river system they eat it but they keep the river clean because if they didn 't need it it would rot and that would make the water dirty so they also live there because that 's where they breed so a female turtle will develop eggs inside her she mates with a male year when one of those big summer storms come come along she waits for the storm to bring rain and the rain softens the earth when it whips it and that means that she can climb out and dig a hole with her back feet and lay her eggs this is a good point for me to talk about stress they have lots of threats there 's lots of um siltation which is when the rain comes and the dirt washes off all the padding and instead of the creek or river being rocky and beautiful on the bottom with weeds and things that the turtles live in the filth of dirt clogs up the river and so the turtles lose their underwater habitat now also you 've got erosion of nesting sites and erosion is when either cattle or rain or a vent can scour it out so the dirt what was a really nice standing nesting bag is now all right and the turtles can 't_''_363.68 lay their eggs in it but one of the biggest threats is the feral fox now the fox was introduced to australia to here it 's not found here but the fox has learnt turtles lay their eggs in october or november and the fox runs up and down the riverbank because it 's trying to sniff out totally i have seen so many many river turtlenecks the female the mum had laid her eggs that night and before i got there the next morning the fox had already eaten all of the eggs so what we 've got now is your species a manning with a turtle and all the turtles in the river are old they 're 30 to 50 years old and there 's no little turtles and it 's a real problem so that comes in with what do i do what 's the zombie after and what can you do so what we have done now is we have gone into the wild and we 've collected a small number of turtles twelve six males and six females and we 've brought them into a captive breeding population we 've also made them safe from an extinction threat so there 's another turtle just a little bit called the bellinger river turtle there used to be thousands of them and about 10 years ago they got a disease there 's only 120 left now 120 there are billions of people on earth and there 's only 120 of those turtles so by having turtles at aussie r if an extinction event like that comes through we 've got the mistake that we can put them back but in the meantime we 're going to breed them and we 're going to breed hundreds of them and one day thousands of them and we will be able to reintroduce those turtles back into the river and by doing that the fox couldn 't eat their eggs and we cut the fox out and got the babies back into the river and basically that means it 's a captive breeding insurance population and a wild breeding program so we are creating a future for the turtle but enough talking about me or ozzie because we can 't_''_518.88 do that without partners and heroes so we have uh partnerships with community groups and local land services and government groups but are the future of this species that you are learning about because you know about it the hope is that you will care about it it means a lot to me right now but i think that there 's a young group of heroes that will come through and learn about this turtle and not just this turtle but other species that are in your backyard in your region that need help so before i go and i know that you are creating art and i really like that because you 're going to learn every detail of the turtle how its tail looks how its shell protects it whether it 's charlie now charlie he 's an adult male a boy a helmet manny river turtle now i think they 're australia 's prettiest freshwater turtle now sea turtles have slippers the charlie here has feet with little claws on the end and toes and this beautiful yellow stripe is something that there 's only one other species that has this stripe like the manning river turtle it 's very beautiful at a shell listen to this it 's that would swoop them out of the water if you 're an eagle you can 't exist especially when the turtle sticks his head and legs in and we 've got a little tail at the back now to identify a manning river turtle you use this stripe you look at the bottom of the shell called the carapace and can you see these black markings so you 've got your yellow scales but in between them the dark lines they 're the only turtles that have that like this and that 's how you 're able to tell them from other turtles so you 've got to think when tyrannosaurus rex was on earth and went extinct charlie was already living in your creeks and rivers and that 's a very very special thing and for me that 's why we have to protect them they need our help and i hope that you all grow up knowing a little bit more about charlie and his species and try and help them so thank you very much for having me and i hope i meet you all one day amazing and thanks for showing us charlie he 's absolutely beautiful we are so fortunate to have our second speaker with us today shona shona wilson is a sculptor she has been sculpting or making art for 30 years she uses natural materials in all of her creations shona is going to tell us a little bit about the baby manning river turtle weavings that you will be creating and she 's also going to talk about how your baby manning river turtles will be used to send a message to the world hi shona and welcome hello everyone and i 'm so excited to be here and be involved in with this project and thank you tim for being such an exuberant hero for the turtle and showing us charlie it was just fantastic art is a seriously fun way to communicate it can be used to communicate any idea feeling or message in a profound way because it can connect all those things together at once art is about imagination imagination leads to creation what sort of world do we want to create this art project imagines a years working with natural found materials all that time these are my art materials nature is the catalyst and the content of my art practice i make artworks with nature in nature i call my work collaborations with nature i have an indoor studio practice and an outdoor ephemeral art practice outdoor ephemeral art is art that doesn 't last long in nature it can be blown away in five minutes or last a day or maybe a week i was inspired by this at art school by artist andy goldsworthy you might like to look him up this turtle art project is an ephemeral artwork ephemeral art can be made with any material not just natural ones your turtle weavings from wool and wood will be arranged on the ground on the 22nd of may this year to make a really large image of the turtle this will then be photographed by a drone and uploaded to share in the worldwide event called with nature 2020 this how did this event come about so in 2019 before our fires i was introduced to a british artist called emma thomas says we aim to engage people with the vital need to protect the diversity in our local ecosystems wherever they are and to create a visually memorable mass event in an effort to convince world leaders that people care about nature like many of us i was brokenhearted by the effect of the fires and the massive loss of so many plants and animals and i was compelled to bring an australian voice to this event as i didn 't have the resources to make this happen by myself i approached manning regional gallery and then the council and the manning river turtle group became involved too due to covert 19 the event was postponed to this year in 2021 but that 's why it 's still called with nature 2020 it 's to align with the un biodiversity conference cop 15. cop 15 will set targets for the protection of biodiversity worldwide for the coming critical decade with nature 2020 has some no notable supporters such as dr david suzuki and australian artist janet lawrence and you may like to look them up too this event was originally planned endangered species but now as we can 't assemble in large numbers other groups from around the world will be using clothing or other materials to draw their chosen animal or plant this created the creative solution we found was to collaborate with you to make thousands of woven turtles to create our image of the manning river turtle the ephemeral art installation you will be contributing to tells a very important story about our local world to the international world it is a sad story but a hopeful story about the loss of so many species that make our world biodiverse healthy and beautiful this affects all of us every day even though we may not stop to think about it the health of the manning river turtle even though it 's small tells a bigger story about the health of its whole environment our little turtle installation in little tyree will be sending a big message story to the world we are one of only two locations in australia contributing to this project the other one is in arnhem land with an indigenous school by making this artwork show how much we value our amazing manning river helmeted turtle and its environment the love and the time that you put into creating your woven turtles will speak to the world this is a multi-team and community effort thank you so much for being part of this nature restoration project with art and i hope you have a lot of fun doing it thank you thanks so much shona for bringing this project to life and for bringing the idea to tyree so that our students can participate it 's going to be awesome okay soon your teachers and your fellow students will be given a art pack and inside that art pack will be your resources to create your baby manning river turtles so next week and maybe the following week we will be going around to schools and um you will receive some paddle pop sticks and wool and an information sheet on how to create your turtles so there 's also a demonstration video that goes along with this i 'm not going to go into that today but that the video will explain exactly how once they 're finished they will be gathered and placed to create a giant manning river turtle maybe about the size of your classrooms um that 's out of the thousands of baby turtles that students are creating in the mid coast region um once that giant turtle is created we are going to take a drone video from the sky and we 're going to post that online around the 22nd of may as part of the international with nature 2020 event and the international day of biological diversity so keep an eye out for more information of that video and also again keep an eye out for us next week at school where we 'll be dropping off those art packs to you i 've just also included some links here to shona shona 's work so her instagram facebook page um i 've got tim tim faulkner 's link to his um the organization aussie arc and the manning river turtle linked to the australian reptile park oh okay i 've got a question from one of the students here it says and this one 's for at aussie arc at the moment we have 25 25 okay 25 and that 's a small number at the moment because i would like to be breeding 250. put a zero on that 25 250 babies every year to be releasing back into the system this year the ones that we 've brought in to start the the insurance captive breeding population they 're adults and they haven 't read yet but each turtle female can have up to 20 eggs each so if we can bring every female in the short term that 's 120 babies every year the ones that we have this year one of the clutches it 's a clutch of eggs they 're called so one of the clutches was made by one of the females but she already had those eggs inside her when she came to us so we didn 't really freeze her the other clutch was rescued from an area because you remember we had that really big drought when all the bushfires were out and some of the female turtles not many did but some that still ladies uh laid their eggs right down in the spots that when the first rain came they were going to fly and they wouldn 't normally do that because we wouldn 't be having such a severe drought and the water wouldn 't normally be that low so we 've rescued that question and those hatchlings are now growing they 've gone up four times their size from 10 grams to and they 'll be released back into the wild really soon i 've just got another i 'm just going to choose one more question in the interest of time um this is from mrs hob sue hobbs she she 's asking how old is charlie okay it 's a really interesting thing with turtles because they can live as long as humans in fact i have galapagos tortoises at the reptile park and one of my mates down there 's hugo he 's like what we would call a teenager but he 's 70 years old and he can live with 200 now manning river turtles can probably live to somewhere between 60 and 80 years now the reason i 'll tell is is because turtles are difficult to age sometimes you can 't just tell how old they are because if they were in a really good environment with perfect food they grow faster than turtles that are in a fan environment with less food so i have to get but would you believe that the child is probably already 10 or 15 years old and they don 't start breeding until they 're 8 to 10 years old so charlie now at the size that you saw is what i would call a sub adult or almost an adult so you 'll get a little bit bigger but it takes a long time there are very long-lived species so my best death is 10 to 15 years and something that 's also really exciting and that 's why we talk about your future watching the turtles this species every turtle that we collect in the wild through surveys is then identified we can put a little marking shell and we know who it is the rest of the flight and every turtle that we bring that goes back mark in itself so when i 'm old and gray and one of youtube are 40 or 50 years old you could be working in that river system and catch a turtle that we released this year in 2021. imagine that in 50 years that would be success thanks tim thanks for your questions and i will note them down um to the other teachers um i just have to wrap it up here for time 's sake but i will say thank you to our partners and thank you to the presenters tim and jonah for being with us today and for your time and efforts on this project um also just shouting out to the manning river turtle group and the manning regional art gallery for all your efforts getting this project underway and teachers please um reach out to myself or allie hey at the gallery if you have any questions about the project there was an email with information and we 're constantly updating our web page with information on how to be involved and what 's happening so thanks for joining today kids good luck what they look like when they 're finished okay have a great day everybody bye _"

her books and i 'll hand you over to lee now to tell us a little bit more about her in writing her books and her book recommendations thanks lee thanks thanks very much hi everybody i 'm very happy to be here tonight um yes i have three books out of them here so i 'll just hold them up um because my banner there at the bottom of my banner but you can 't see the other two so this is charlotte pass that was um published in 2020 by alan and unwin second book kraken back 2021 and just last month dead horse gap um so i that almost completes the crime series although um we 're not quite sure whether there 'll be any more books published in the series that 's sort of up in the air so stay tuned [Music] for that um yeah why did i set books in the snowy mountains that 's a question that a lot of people ask me and i think it 's because i love that particular area and i have visited the snowy mountain since i was about eight years old my daughter became a ski instructor she loved the snow so much but i also travel down there during the summer as well so um i 've spent lots of time down there both in summer walking to the the kosciuszko summit hiking around dead horse jazz festival so and of course the more that i have um uh researched the area and published the books um and have gone down there for more research i 've learned more about the area as i have gone so um dead horse gap is the latest in the uh in the series and dead horse gap i went a bit different with this one because with charlotte pass it was very contained in the snowden village in charlotte in charlotte pass which is completely cut off in wintertime and the second book dead horse gap was mainly set in a very isolated lodge in threadbow village but with this one i wanted to go wider across the snowy mountains logistically and take in some of the surrounding areas so the books can be read as stand-alones but they do have common characters throughout and they are the police force the sydney homicide squad so each book has an individual crime and and it 's probably optimal to read them um you know in order but it certainly doesn 't matter you don 't have to um but it develop over those um three books so um with dead horse gap as i said um it takes in the the town of ken cobin a lot of scenes are set in can coven a lot of scenes are set in threadbow and jinderbein again so i 've kept that even though i 've gone wider into the almost the foothills um there 's a lot of i 've kept that snowy setting i guess is what i 'm trying to say with dead horse gap um because readers have really responded to that and i think it 's because the setting becomes almost like another character so as well as um fighting off you know the human threat uh you 're also battling against the elements um because there 's a threat from outside with the snow and the black ice on the road and you know um you can you can die out there so um dead horse gap is is the latest one uh the latest release and um some of the um i guess emotions and themes in the book are just themes of um you past i guess making commitments and family obligations whether those obligations are ones that you 've taken on yourself or those that are thrust upon you um so i have a family feud i knew i wanted a family feud and i knew i wanted um i wanted the alpine huts in there and i knew that i wanted the snow leases where the cattlemen used to bring their their um their cattle up to the high country to the cooler climbs during summer so they 're just uh that 's just a little bit about dead horse gap um third book in my snowy mountains crime series um as far as my book recommendations go the third first book that i 'd like to talk about and i 'm not sure how many we 're doing whether it 's actually three or four or so just um um let me know whatever you feel comfortable with okay well the first one that i 'm going to talk about is fleur mcdonald 's deception creek i 've read a lot of fleur 's books and and this one is absolutely and it features her very um um uh popular character detective dave burrows the story centers around joel hammond and it 's a historical prime book um joel has returning to barker after a stint in jail and he 's been jailed for a white collar crime that he 's always denied he 's always professed his innocence he also was involved in another crime earlier on and when he was a teenager where he and a friend climbed a silo and his friend died um so some locals want him to leave the town while others think that he has done his time and deserves a chance at a new life and he moves back to barca and is living in the house that he has inherited from his parents who died while he was in prison um the the book also has uh centers around a character called emma cameron who was recently divorced and she runs her own property single-handedly and years ago emma was the first on the scene in a tragic car accident and where the the wife was killed she was in the passenger memory of the accident and from time to time he keeps coming back and seeing her and they meet and she sort of tells him what she remembers about that the accident and and he he sort of professes to have no um no recollection so all of these things the book starts where all of these things happen at the same time so joel hammond is released from prison this guy who keeps in contact the driver with emma cameron he 's just about to land in town and you have this cast of interesting characters locals who know things from the past and you kind of know that it 's all going to come together but you 're trying to work out how so um fleur mcdonald weaves an excellent story and deception creek is absolutely a cracker so that 's my first recommendation is blue mcdonald the deception creep um i don 't think it 's one of the actual dave burrows books but he is like a side character or its features that 's featured him and i love that when that happens when you are comes in so um yeah so i really enjoyed that one that 's my first recommendation and i have a bit of a theme going here because a lot of my three stories are you know historical um uh missing persons case or a cold case and then something happens and you know they 're digging into the past and when i was reading fleurs i was thinking yeah it 's the same these are things historical events um but again that intrusion into the past as they 're dragged up again so my next author who i love and i have loved for years is sandra brown um the american writer and i 've read so many of sandra 's books and absolutely she 's been one of my influences um and said they 're always a page turner and this one is no different um what i liked about this one and i 'll just tell you a bit about it it 's the it 's the bombing of a hotel and a mother and a little girl again this is historical information but a mother and a um the mother is dying and she hands the little three-year-old girl to this fellow who 's in uniform major franklin trapper and he becomes a hero um of the of that day when he saves a lot of people but he saves this little girl and there 's a photo that 's published it goes worldwide on the front of every newspaper around the world of major frank trapper running out of this building with this little girl clutch to his chest to into his shoulder and the sort of bond burning building in the background it 's sort of one of those photos that you know has become becomes instantly recognizable of that day and it reminded me of um 911 where you know that those photos of people coming out of the twin towers and covered in ash and stumbling down the street you only have to see one of those photos and you instantly know that it 's 9 11. so i think she was like kind of clever sandra brown putting that in that that that became um you know just a photo synonymous with starts um centers around this woman called kiera bailey and she is the little girl in the story and she 's grown up to be a journalist so you know she can get nosy about a lot of things i guess and and the there 's always a romance in sarah brown 's um books which i always like and i always put there 's always a romance in mind romantic elements because i think the more that you um the more people care about each other then um you know the it just heightens that that suspense it raises the it just raises the stakes to another level um so the story is about the journalist and major frank trapper 's son and so we find out as we go through this book that not only did kyra bailey lose her her mother in that hotel bombing but in many ways john trapper lost his father as well even though he didn 't die he became a national hero so he was on the celebrity circuit circuit he was doing television and radio interviews and so from that time father was virtually no longer available to him so it sort of this book starts when the journalist basically knocks on um a major franklin trapper 's son 's door and it goes from there and these two have a lot to work through um and as they investigate who and what more was behind this hotel bombing so a riveting story are really really enjoyed that so that 's my second recommendation um is and i 'll just put it up again sandra brown seem red being red that that was published in 2017 so that 's a while ago um now but you know i did pick my favorites um so have i got time to do another yes yes okay i 'm not right let me know if i 'm running out of time um my next author who i just absolutely admire is taina french or tana french i don 't have the copy of the book because it was a hard cover and my daughter-in-law um lent it to me and so i gave it back to her so that 's she 's an irish and the likeness and i 've also read the witch elm and searcher so but the ones that i 'm going to talk about tonight uh is in the woods which is the first one so for those of you who might have seen the dublin murders um the bbc series uh that was tana french 's um they actually took her first those two novels in the dublin murder series in the woods and the likeness and actually combined them into that tv series which was about six parts i think but in the woods starts with the story of rob riley and cassie maddox and they are detectives with the dublin murder squad um so i 'm really into detectives and and historical crimes cold cases um the squad gets called to a murder which has taken place in a village outside where rob was born and where he lived as a child um so he goes back to this village where years ago a group of children disappeared into the woods or in the woods pretty soon we learned that rob was one of those children he remember what happened or what happened to his friends where they went but because he came under so much pressure from the village as to was he involved what did he know his parents moved him away from this village outside of dublin and took him to england and he was only about he was a youth at the time and so when he comes back he 's grown now in his 20s maybe early 30s i can 't remember his exact age um but he has an english accent and of course he 's grown up and doesn 't look like um adam who adam is his first name and so the villagers all knew him as adam but he has taken his second name rob so rob riley comes back to dublin and he 's working in the dublin homicide squad when this girl is murdered in this in the village where he grew up in the woods and so it starts with him having to go back and so as you you learn then that he is adam you start to get inside his head and he 's it 's very sort of angsty and on edge and she writes these particular books in first person so she 's a first person um you know she 's absolutely fantastic at writing first person um so as they investigate these the recent death questions inevitably arise about the missing children from years ago and and they start to wonder are these cases linked and has the killer struck again and he even gets to sort of go back into his old house where he um uh where he used to live and he sees the neighbor who still lives there and so he 's always worried about being discovered and so you start to wonder whether he did have anything to do with it or what happened so it 's an absolutely gripping read i can thoroughly recommend it and she writes with a great sense of place and her characters her characterization is fantastic so um taina french in the woods and the second book with um rob riley is the likeness but in the woods is the one that i 'm recommending tonight thank you so books that have that mysterious thriller element very quickly because you 're on edge when you 're reading it um yes sometimes but not so much with um with tane french 's books i 'm more like that with sandra brown 's i find hers unput downable but um with chain french because there 's just so much of the landscape and the countryside and the sort of irish pubs and the whole village atmosphere i feel that i can put that down hers down and pick them up more right so um but yes i do um any book that has you know a kind of mystery in like that yes i 'm always sort of ripping through the pages but i wish i had more time to read um but it 's hard sometimes as you would know when you 're writing um you know we always wish we had more time to read i know i know it 's always you always want more time to read and when you are writing and you walk past the new book that 's there anything i just want to deception creek great book and quite sad at times yes yes it is and patricia 's also said i have enjoyed all three of your novels are you working on something new yes i am working on something new i 'm working on a book that 's set in my hometown of newcastle so um it 's another a book um it 's another murder mystery um again something that happens in the past and uh but i think i had a chat to my editor about it because i do have a an idea for a fourth book and i left it so that a fourth book can be written but it happens five or six years down the track and so my editor said maybe we should leave a little bit of time um in real time between this i mean we 're not going to leave five or six years but maybe write something else and then come back to that so that there is a little bit of a gap there so that when because it 's the idea is the detective 's coming back together speak to the squad that they dealt with at the time so it 's that kind of idea um and so at the moment but she was saying to me sorry that um uh that my readers will expect a strong sense of place because that 's what i gave them with the snowy mountain series and so wherever i said it just make sure that it has that strong sense of place and so i thought i mean i 've lived in sydney as well but i 'm born and bred in newcastle and i moved back here and um and so you know i this is the place that i know the best i know the sorts of people that live here i know the the topography the landscape i know the buildings i you know it 's a very old city and it has some great coastal areas so um i thought and i i have chosen um a spot for for it uh the location and i think readers will really like it i 'm very excited i did love the location you do a fantastic at new coast libraries we 're only a couple of hours for newcastle so i 'm sure lots of people up here would be very keen to read a newcastle-based book yeah it 's amazing how many people have said um in previous interviews have you ever thought of setting a book in newcastle so yes it 's my home city yeah fantastic can you tell us what kind of research you 've had to do in the past to get the right kind of crime element or the the right crime element in your story or has research dictate what you 've had to write well i had the story for charlotte pass already i had actually wrote two books said in charlotte pass before um was published so there 's two in the bottom drawer but i was never happy with them it was only when i heard about the chairlift that ran between charlotte pass and threadbow that was the longest chairlift in the world back in 1964 that all the threads that i had together for this story came together so with that i as far very very well and i know threadbow quite well so i didn 't really have to do location-wise all that much research for that but i did read a book called skiing off the roof which is the history of charlotte pass and i had bought that book in the very early 90s and uh and so i read that and and also um i you know i i 'm not one to just depend on google google 's good for some things but um this was a historical account of the history of skiing in australia and predominantly charlotte pass so i read that book from cover to cover and with kraken back um there 's a character in in that book who um is like works in kidnap insurance and i did hear um there was a non-fiction book written um about kidnap insurance by um someone who had worked for lloyds of london who do all the underwriting insurance for big companies when they insure their workers when they go and live in dangerous countries like yemen and you know colombia and places like that and i so again i ordered that book from booktopia and reddit cover to cover um but as far as dead horse gap goes um i 've done four world drives there where i 've gone up to see the alpine huts many were burnt down in the terrible 2020 bushfires but the kosciuszko huts association which is a volunteer organization they do restore and rebuild many of the huts so they are doing that at the moment um but yes i 've done four wheel drive tours um i 've spoken to the snowy hydro because that is in the book because i have workers you know skiers um that work in the ski industry but in this particular story i have um a you know generations going back to the the cattle grazing property um that held snow leases before uh the national parks took over the area and it became a national park the new south wales government used to um lease out leases for for the the stock they used to bring up the cattle and stock roots we all know man from snowy river so it 's the summer so yes lots of um speaking to the snowy hydro people about the huts that they built to shelter their workers looking at some of these old huts and doing a lot of research on trove about the snow leases in the high country so a wide variety but if there 's any budding writers out there i would say if you don 't have first-hand knowledge of it the best thing that you can do is actually speak to people who do have first-hand knowledge because that 's where you pick up the nuggets and and that 's where you if you don 't know it yourself then then speak to somebody who does know thank you so much leigh that sounds all very fascinating and um it 's hard not to get stuck in the research isn 't it some you get to start learning more things and you just make sure you get to learn more and more and more yeah i think i think yeah i think most writers have that kind of um desire to learn too so it 's hard to cut keep reading yeah absolutely we 'll have more questions for you as the night progresses but now we 're going to move over to our second guest fiona lowe who began writing stories when she became a mother prior to that she worked as a midwife a sexual health con counsellor and a family support worker she is now the author to 36 books correct me if i 'm wrong fiona_._1718.32 i just have to count up things 35 36 i 'm not sure well take 36. they include rural medical romances wedding romances the medicine river series and women 's fiction books fiona has won the prestigious usa award and the romance writers of australia 's ruby award along with being named finalists several times fiona 's books are set in small country towns and feature real people facing tough choices and explore how family ties impact on their decisions so once again if you have any questions for fiona be sure to pop them into the chat function and we 'll get to them and now i 'm going to hand you over to fiona to tell us we should be adding to our to be read piles thanks fiona thanks very much well um i was really enjoying lee 's conversation there because um the victorian high country is a very special part of my life and i 've said a few books there but i get palpitations if i read thrillers and suspense so um my books and my recommendations are going to be very very different from um from christie 's i get terribly anxious so and um i was chuckling about um being and i think it 's very brave of you to set a book in the town that you live in because i live in a small regional city and i can tell you now that the first one is like there 's no there 's no servo on that intersection you 're gonna have to really so so what i do is i take um i always create a fictitious town in a real area so i surround it by real places and most of my uh the last six five books i 've set in my state in victoria but came out last week is actually set in tasmania and the reason i said it in tassie is because my eldest son went down there to study medicine and so he was down there for quite a few years and tazzy became a bit of our second home and i said it on the north uh the north west coast which is um close to victoria um but not so well known and um yes i was really excited when i got us an instagram the other day that the devonport bookshop had it because devonport gets a mention so yeah so um as i um was said i um worked with families for many years and i 've worked with every type of family that can exist and i 've worked with everyone from homeless people through to very wealthy people and come across just about every possible combination and i 've unwishingly filed away a lot of stuff because back then i wasn 't even writing so normally when i come up with a story i come up with i have a theme so with um a home that was set around a community garden the theme was displacement and i explored three different types of displacement um a woman who was homeless a refugee uh actually was four a young teenage mother whose life was completely turned upside down by unexpected pregnancy and a woman whose life was impacted and turned upside down by chronic illness so um i take a theme and they 're normally connected with social issues of the day and with a family of strangers i wrote on my whiteboard escape and i had absolutely no idea except that that was going to be my theme and i think a lot of us in modern life we have these great dreams that we 're going to escape but the thing is we can 't actually escape our life normally the things we 're wanting to run from the things that we actually have to fix fiona did you start writing this escape theme in 2020 when covert hits [Laughter] yes i actually covert was now i probably started this book in the may june and they were mooting a um a vaccination so i decided that that the connecting thing for these three women 's stories was going to be a community choir and then of course it came to the final type setting and in the acknowledgements i had to write please imagine the day we can all sing together and it 's only just happening now so anyway so um three main characters um steph um she 's a young woman in her thirties and uh she 's a toddler and she and henry i 've always been fascinated by this um people who go on holidays and they have the best time which is great that 's the whole point of a holiday but they confuse that holiday with real life and so steph and henry had such a wonderful time that and they 'd come off a terrible year that they decided they were going to relocate from melbourne to this tiny little coastal town in tasmania and all they needed was an internet connection she was going to start a business he was going to surf it was all going to be wonderful and of course they get the mobile phone tower and um steph 's trying to start this business um henry is was supposed to be working from home and he 's spending his life commuting to the library and god knows where just to get some internet connection and um and then to make matters worse um the uh henry 's teenage daughter from a previous relationship comes to live with them and so i delved into very much and this is probably a bit of my life i delved into the mental load that women carry because um you know and frequently i 'm asked you know i 'm surprised no one 's stuck i 've trained them i 've tried to train them but you know they do really well for a short period well for a reason and then they break you know so i don 't know why i 'm the custodian of the shopping list i try really hard not to be but so steph i 've i 've i 've put that in and so that whole domestic juggle that uneven thing you 're both working from home and book i did channel a lot of stuff because i think there 's massive strains on relationships when it 's like well my job 's important yes but my job is important too and then that whole blending of families it takes about seven years to blend a family and they 've they 've inherited this little girl watching the little girl she 's a teenager and 13. and um yeah so that steph and henry life is not going so well for them in rookery cove and uh steph joins the choir because that 's the one thing the one thing that she 's doing for herself and addie is has returned to rookery crow she was rookery co she was born and raised there and she never expected to come back at all um but um she 's got this opportunity for a job promotion um but it 's a bit of a double-edged sword because she 's come back to town and it 's raising the ghosts of her past her parents have passed away and she was known as a bit of a wild child when you know you cannot outrun your past in a small town and uh and she 's got this job uh but it 's very demanding and there 's a whole lot of stuff going on at work and um she drinks to cope and if you ask addie did she have a drinking problem she would say no she does not however it 's getting harder and harder to get up in the mornings and um the reason i wanted to explore this whole line is because women are actually australian women are drinking far more than we 've ever drunk before and it was exacerbated by the pandemic and um and it is actually becoming a real problem so um addie addie doesn 't want to join the choir but her mother ran it and there 's a bit of community pressure for her to join so she 's a very reluctant member of the choir so stephanie stephanie 's like that puppy she 's so enthusiastic about the choir and addie is the complete opposite but anyway and then we have brenda she 's lived all her life she 's moved into town and she wants to um [Music] she wants to repair the relationship with her uh daughter and there 's this whole myth that that mothers and daughters are as adults are best friends are they and what if your daughter actually reminds you of the worst traits of your mother-in-law that you didn 't get on with you know and what happened um if you were struggling when she was a teenager so there 's a whole lot of history there and brenda just wants to live an authentic life she has cared for her husband she 's raised her children she 's looked after everyone and now she just wants a bit of time for her but can you do that if your family don 't want to let you so and she 's joined the choir to help a friend because you know she 's a helper so these women come together in this choir and there 's an almighty bomb that go a metaphorical bomb that goes off that that threatens their not only their friendship but but their personal lives so i 've just noticed a comment down there that was um rookery cove penguin was i always say that um there 's a i take a little bit of different places so there 's a little bit of stanley there 's a little bit of penguin and the geographical setting is actually tiny wee um boat harbour which is absolutely beautiful but mike rookery cove 's got more people and and more houses so um and i love delving into um people with flaws i mean we 've all got floors but i love delving into characters flaws and holding them up in front of their faces and in when that happens to us we generally want to run the other way but eventually we have to um if we are going to grow we have to accept and and start to try and change so um i love to write books like that which means that i also like to read books like that uh i 'm very much a character driven novel i love a character driven novel i i 'm not that fast if there isn 't arc i do actually get frustrated if the book if the it starts and finishes and the character is in exactly the same spot so i like to see a journey um so i want to start tonight to tell you about um the beautiful words by vanessa mccausland i was lucky enough to meet vanessa on a book tour just before lockdown in 2020 we 're in new south wales and um i think i flew home and uh i think we 're in lockdown about a week later so i had read her debut novel and this is her third and um i loved her day boo novel but this this book is amazing she 's just grown as a writer and it 's and it 's called beautiful words but it 's a beautiful book it her she has the most beautiful turn of phrase and funnily enough it 's said in tasmania i really laugh about this because i don 't talk about my books that i 'm writing with anybody so i didn 't tell anyone i 'd said a book in tasmania and um i think penelope janus written a book that 's come out earlier this year set in tasmania and then um my book 's about acquire well it 's not really about a choir but it features a choir and meg big nell is bringing out a book about a choir in may and if someone else is bringing out a book um uh sophie green no i can 't remember and acquiring judas like what is this is it zooming around in the zeitgeist and the authors just lands on you do this so we 've got a whole tasmania fest at the moment anyway i really recommend this uh there 's no spoilers for me to say that sylvie suffered a brain injury when she was 17 or 18 that 's referenced in the very opening of the book and um she lost a lot of memory from that and so she spent the last 25 years um reclaiming her words and she has a very very quiet life and the premise of this book is that she 'd lost contact with her best friend growing up when she 40 and an invitation to come to bruny island to celebrate the 40th um birthday and she goes and she 's got this little life and they 've all been really quite successful and um and it 's this whole journey about learning about themselves and i don 't want to give away any any spoilers uh but you will taste the salt you will feel the wind on your face i don 't know if anyone 's been to burun island but cloudy bay i mean it 's just the windiest place on earth and um and you feel all that so if you want a lyrical journey through a novel definitely give this one a whirl um i 'm a jane austen fan and um and i 've chosen persuasion this is very i mean you probably can 't see it 's very old and dusty this one but i mean i actually came to jane austen through pride and prejudice when i was 15 and my mother gave me a copy and and i started reading it and i said it 's really boring and she said darcy and she said keep reading anyway but what i love about persuasion is that um this is an older heroine so um and i i strongly believe that there 's a lot of jane austen 's um personal experience that she put in into this novel with the older heroine who was engaged to be married to this man you know i 'm not sure 15 years ago or something because she 's she 's in her early 30s and austin died at 36 so and this was published post i can never say it right post humorously after she had died um so what these two characters come together with it with life experience and a previous relationship and it 's still got the same austin um wit and her um razor sharp um character uh detail she 's amazing the way she watched people and could describe all their foibles and all those quirks she 's amazing that way but this is probably the only austin that 's that 's brought me to tears um and i just feel that it has this extra emotional overlay that 't quite have so i think there 's a lot of jane in this one and if you haven 't read it i would recommend it um yes so that 's that one and now um i 'm we was talking before about time to read so yes not a lot of time to read but i am a huge fan and a growing fan of audiobooks and i think last year i just i don 't i don 't um review books because i think as an author it 's absolutely fraught but i record for my personal pleasure what i 've read on goodreads and so i did a count at the end of the year and i was 50 50 last year for audio books and and and reading books so i 've just got the picture here um sorry put that up there so sorrow that 's called sorrow and bliss by meg mason i listened to this last year um it was a huge huge british book huge huge seller and i came across it a later and and friends who 'd read it they 've given it to my i 've lent it the print version to my um soon-to-be daughter-in-law who 's in her late 20s she just couldn 't couldn 't read it um and but i listened to it and i loved it i not sure i would have necessarily um stuck with it in print either it 's quite a challenging book to read the lead character has a mental illness and so she 's very frustrating you can see that she is deliberately blowing herself up over and over again and and she 's got this saint of a husband but it really takes off in the middle and and i loved it and i actually it 's one of those books where you reach a particular point you go ah i had to go back and read the start that 's really interesting fiona because i like most books that you re that you read i think we are very similar in taste but i did start that in hard in paperback and and i didn 't finish it but i do love an audio book so maybe i probably would have put it down but i 'm a different i 'm a i am a very forgiving reader when i 'm on holidays i 'll read anything kicking back whatever but during term time with all the pressures it 's almost as if i sit down and say right i 'm here my time 's precious you better impress me yes so um yeah but i do think that the start of this book when i went back and listened to the start again i then had a much better appreciation for the whole book so it shows some lovely terms of phrase so uh i 'd recommend it as a book to read when you 're not pressed for time and maybe maybe an audio book so do i have time for one more or are we yes yes that 's fine what was my other one whoops going the wrong way ah okay so too much lip which are you near mulum aren 't you up or is that the north northern rivers mullen bimby that 's because that 's further up yeah okay yeah lip by melissa lukashenko now i read i just saw a tiny little snippet on books and publishing about um a month before this book came out and so it sounded interesting and i i so i read it and i loved it and then it went on to win the miles franklin and i was like glad i read it before i knew that um this is uh there 's two books that i would say everyone should read every australian should read and this is one of them and melissa lukashenko has she 's taken an indigenous family with and it could be any family with all their foibles but overlaid with that is 200 years of oppression and she will make you laugh she 's got and she will make you cry and she will make you excruciatingly uncomfortable but um it 's a really great story as well so i really think i don 't say this very often but i think everyone really should read that book and the other book i think everyone should read is the beekeeper of aleppo but um yeah i i was a bit she kind of starts off with a point of view of a crow go with it okay and then it just takes off um so i that was that was my fourth one thank you so much fiona um i 've got to say coralie you get five stars tonight she read lee 's books and she 's also said here thanks again fiona for another amazing book i just finished family of strangers today bloody amazing oh thank you which um i i love your book screen i haven 't had the chance to read it so i 'm very much looking forward to getting stuck into another story um coralie also said being stuck in tasmania was a nice change i 'm good i 'm glad and that she loved kieran oh yes well he was lovely yes i agree i liked him too [Laughter] um maria said great point fiona about the myth that mothers and daughters have a great bond it 's good to have a different take on family relations well you know there 's one thing i want to do anything in my books um and you know we 're all different people and it i i had an interesting conversation down at the beach and someone someone um was saying i think i can 't remember what it was in reference to but she said that would that would never happen in your family and i 'm thinking you have no idea about my extended family and that thing has actually happened in my family it is just that most people don 't want to air their dirty linen and then people think oh that hasn 't happened and when it does happen to them they think they 're their own the only person but that 's not so we 're all human and we all go through similar things it 's just whether you 're more open about it or not absolutely um mary lou said she loves boat harbour oh it 's beautiful place patricia says that she loves the beautiful words yes i loved that one too and coralie said she loves vanessa 's books too carly you 're very impressive but they 're all the just commented interesting thoughts about the correlation between persuasion and jane 's life now i think about it yes ah yes no i think absolutely and jane i mean i 'm not fabulous on remembering uh her history even though i 've had the jane austen tour of you know i 've been to bath and i 've been to where she 's buried and i 've been like i 've done all that that was a while ago but um she was she jane austen i was engaged and i 'm not quite sure why she didn 't marry and but i in persuasion uh annie 's talked out of marrying the man that she loves and is told because he 's not socially acceptable enough and so she walks away and then regrets it so um yeah anyway i think i think jane wrote quite a bit of her own life through that maybe was getting a few things off her chest in that book who knows we 'll never know sadly sorry sadly her sister burned all her letters so when jane austen died because she corresponded to protect her privacy so sad for us narelle commented that he would lose all his fortune if he married jane um i want to ask you fiona so your women 's fiction stories do focus on real people facing the tough choices and the relationships with those people around them so how do you come up with story ideas is it memory banks of all the ex from your previous work do you have a jar with all these ideas that you pop in as you get them yeah i will start with your theme i don 't have i am not one of those authors that has um thousands of ideas at all i am a one trick pony at one point in time so there 's always major panic when i finish a book because i sign it to book contract i will never commit to more than that because when i sign a two-book contract i know the book that i 'm writing so i only have to come up with one more and then when i when i hand that in it 's like blind um my books very much come out of uh current social issues so um anything i read you know read like reading the paper so well a home like ours i really wanted to explore um [Music] women over 50 where the the highest rising rate of homelessness in this country is women over 50 so i wanted to write about that um i really really was passionate to write about women 's issue with alcohol um which is why i chose that so i 'll choose themes um but like that 's still i chose displacement and there 's so many ways your life can be displaced so i chose you know a few different things with with once i 've got a theme then i have to find scenarios that match the theme and then i develop the character but i normally start with just knowing what the character believes about themselves because what we believe about ourselves which could be and is often incorrect think of an anorexic person who looks in the mirror and thinks they 're grossly overweight so but whatever we believe about themselves everything we do and how we react in any situation so i can drop my character in anywhere and know how they 'll behave and i normally start a book and i have an idea of some turn a big turning point for each character and then i have a lot of blank space and you 've got your word you 've got your word on the board i 've got a word on the board yes that 's right and then so my writing is then um two steps forward one step back so i know what i 'm doing today i 've got no idea what i 'm doing now and then i have to write myself into it and then that 'll be good because you can always edit words it 's that that 's that first bit where you 're like oh i don 't know what i 'm doing next and because i write three characters and i entwine this story then you 've got certain things that have to happen for each character so then you end up with something like this and for all in and then you end up with something like this where you 've got one characters you 've got way more and you 've got all these blank spaces for the other one so that 's the terrifying bit but you 've obviously done a fairly good job you 've written 36 books uh well thank you but the um the last six have been the most complicated most challenging and they 're the biggest books so i guess they 're very big i started yeah but they 're easy to read because coralie said did you i get people saying to me i read your book today and i 'm like what they say read your book today when 's the next time i 'm like oh lord it took me a year to write you read it today maybe you should read it again more slowly ration it so i started off writing 50 000 word medical romances where you were just focusing on one couple and it was their story well you know that 's much more straightforward than three people in a community or in so yeah yeah it 's got more complicated it 's got harder i reckon yeah well thank you very much i know that we 're running late tonight so if anyone has to go i apologize but i 'm just gonna go forth as we normally will and i will keep asking questions um because it 's such an engaging chat with both of you authors i hope you don 't mind that we 're using a bit more of your time not at all um i 've just recently popped in uh into the chat mine the link to my newsletter i send out a monthly newsletter and all subscribers are able to go into the draw to win the latest uh release books by both authors tonight so if you 'd like to win either dead horse gap or a family of strangers be sure to sign up also both lee and fiona have newsletters too and i put their links into the chat if you 'd like to sign up for them this month in line with international women 's day i 'm going to recommend two first one is the greatly anticipated debut novel the trivia night by ali lo i don 't think she 's related to fiona here tonight ali was the former features editor at ok magazine in london and 16 years ago she flew to australia just for a year but she never returned so she now lives in sydney um ali 's style of writing has been likened to aussie author powerhouses liane moriarty and sally hepworth the storyline reminded me a little bit of desperate housewives remember that old show there 's drama and comedy in situations that make you think how on earth did they get themselves into this the story revolves around a set of parents who are attending a trivia night at dali heights primary school as an annual fundraising event it 's set in the wealthy northern beaches in sydney and it 's a community where everyone knows each other and secrets don 't stay secret so very long the event itself gets a little bit out of hand and discussion talks to swingers as more alcohol is consumed these group of parents make a reckless to deal with the fallout so i found this book really fun entertaining easy to read there are some twists along the way which will make you keep turning those pages to find out what happened this is a real binge-worthy book which i 'm sure is going to be a great success for ali and the second book uh is the long weekend by western australian author fiona palmer um i love books about writers and this one is about a successful author um who is holding a writer 's retreat four strangers attend with their own motivations and secrets the four strangers hope this weekend will help them learn more about writing but it actually helps them learn more about themselves and this is a character driven story it 's fast-paced and while it mostly occurs over a three-day long weekend we see flashbacks to what the aspiring authors have experienced in the past and it allows you as a reader to really understand their pains and their goals and their challenges um each of the stories are woven together but it 's really easy to follow and um fiona writes an engaging story with relatable characters and plenty of emotion aspiring writers will like this one because it 's got a bit of behind the scenes writing tips and lifestyles sprinkled amongst the pages now quickly before i pass you over to marie i 'm going to ask both you leigh and fiona what is your favorite thing about the writing process lee do you want to start um my favorite thing is when you get that that beginnings of a story in your head so that that great sort of feeling like okay i i 've i 've you know the start i think the start before you get into you know how hard it is just that excitement from the beginning and then the research i do enjoy research so um and i have to be careful not to um you know not to keep researching as you mentioned before and know when to stop and because inevitably you 'll get to a stage in the book where you 'll have to do more so i keep telling myself i 'll have to do more favorite part and once i get to 50 i 'm very slow at the beginning um but once i get to the 50 mark um i write a lot quicker there and i think it 's sort of in my head and i 'm rolling along flowing with the story and uh and that so i like the second fifty percent of the book and i like rece the research part of it thank you yeah um what i really like is um i 'll write um i 'll write a line that is i would imagine is completely inconsequential some you know it could be something like you know if they ate a mango or you know i can 't think of an example right now but then that your subconscious obviously grinds away and suddenly that one off the cuff line that was just a piece of dialogue that had no impact or bearing on the story turns out to be either the totem of the book or um takes you off into uh becomes quite a significant event in the story and that 's just your subconscious um i don 't have any favorite bit that i 'm actually excited because i normally write in a constant state of terror a i 'm gonna am i um able to come up with a story b how the heck does it start there 's only all those 30 odd books there 's only been one book that i have had an absolute clear i know exactly where it 's starting and it was like a download that 's happened once once um with lea it 's the same i think you spend the first half of the book getting to know your characters and this so the second half of the book is technically easier um but yeah i just love that magic where you write something that you think is inconsequential and it ends up becoming a vital part of the story that you 'd never imagined it would be fantastic okay marie i 'm going to pass over to you for your recommendation tonight oh and to tell us about the about women event hi can everyone hear me thank you so much lee and fiona writing process and and um you 're both such accomplished authors that i wanted to point out that i did go through our mid coast libraries uh libero check to check what books we had and we have both pretty much all of your books both lee and fiona i couldn 't get your latest because they 're already out um some are reserved so if any of you want iva lee or fiona 's latest books you will have to reserve them um because they 're very very popular so um i 've had to reserve the latest one uh i 'll probably be writing for that one because somebody 's already reserved it before me so i was able to get a few of your older ones but um just to mention also what you were saying fiona about um having so little time so [Music] one of these is on audio that i 'll be uh looking through so audio is a really good way as well because we 're so time poor which brings me to my point which fiona mentioned about trying to get books really really busy person so i went for my one book that i 'm going to recommend was purely because it was going to be easy and small to read and they 're vignettes and justine bateman is known for her acting career um she 's written i think this is her second book um but what i liked about the the book is called face and the reason i chose it was its international women 's day is that she um i didn 't know this i didn 't know about this uh this is particular in the states that um for most women on screen there 's a and a kind of um subversive trend going on that you have to fix your face you cannot be seen to age and she 's received a lot of backlash from the media for choosing not to do anything to her face which before would have been unheard of you wouldn 't have people can do whatever they want to regardless of you know their careers but particularly women now in certain careers they 're um it 's not only 't do it you 'll be vilified so she chooses um fictional vignettes to examine that she 's interviewed hundreds of women journalists uh not just actresses women that work you know on the front line in certain way and she uses that to interweave the stories now they 're not that i have to say they 're not that well written um but the issues that they raise are really interesting particularly in our society where um status is very much associated with the visuals in certain fields and what i found interesting of the people in america where she said even their husbands there 's a a man that he 's he and his wife um are promoted to a well-known company and he gets on he gets a senior position and after they leave they talk about the fact that it 's shocking that the wife hasn 't had her face fixed and that will affect his reputation in the company that uh they will have to speak to him and he will have to speak to his wife um that she will have to have her it 's really important because she talks about role modeling what that what those messages mean to younger women um and what it means to look at our accomplishments first and foremost as a sense of worth rather than the visuals so what do we accomplish in our lives and what are we worth and so for that alone i recommend the book face um and leading on to that we 've all about women every year um this is uh some prominent uh women have sessions to do with many different um issues happening in society and this year we were able to stream direct from sydney opera house so we 'll be streaming at tari library and foster library this sunday you will need to book so please go ahead and book your place every session is about an hour an hour and a half so 11 30 we 'll have the first nations women talking about the future and then at 1 30 we have rosy body and grace tame and then at four o 'clock we have laura tingle it 's absolutely free to everyone in people as possible there and will be really pertinent topics so um looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible to that event this sunday thank you that 's all from me thanks marie before i let you both go would you be able to share with us what your proudest writing moment has been for one of them one or more and it might be tricky you know do you want to start oh well i guess it was the well i don 't know the first book is wonderful but i 'm i 'm very proud of my two ruby awards and my one rita yes congratulations yes i agree with fiona the first book is very special um for me it 's getting uh charlotte pass published because it was the book that i wrote three iterations of it so i think just um getting that publisher was always the story that i wanted to write forever and so finally um having that picked up was was really special um yeah just i did uh charlotte pass did win the 2020 um romance writers of picked up by reader 's digest which was absolutely um i was just gobsmacked at that i couldn 't believe it when i allen lundmann contacted me and said you 've been shallow pass uh there 's an offering for it to go into select digests oh sorry reader 's digest select digest which is a four books uh bridged version of four books bound together in a beautiful book and sent out to about their 5 000 subscribers that don 't really buy their books anywhere else so they don 't usually buy online or they don 't usually buy from bookshops it 's a complete sort of different um market so um i you know i just remembered the reader 's digests the papery copy and dusty copies in doctor 's surgeries and uh and that and i was like oh my god when i first started writing i never would have believed that one of my stories would be in reader 's digest oh congratulations to you both you 're both very impressive authors and um we want to thank you for joining us tonight you 've 've taken to tell us about your own books and also books that you 've loved too um thank you viewers for joining us tonight and all the books that we have mentioned by what lee fiona marie and myself they all are available in the midcoast libraries catalogue um if you 're wanting to check any of the titles a full list will be published on my social media account at canadian a writer along with the midcoast library 's facebook page alternatively if you 're wanting to purchase any we do encourage that you contact your local bookstore for anyone in our area be sure to head to the sitting wombat

danuka i think it is sorry januka mckenzie whose debut book the trent has been attracting a great deal of attention on behalf of midcoast libraries marie and myself i 'd like to wish you a wonderful

reside in midcoast council here and i extend that respect to all aboriginal elders past present and emerge thank you everybody lovely to see you i 'm down here in sydney on holidays and what better way to have a holiday than talk about books and drink red wine so i am really looking forward to tonight because it 's a bit of an unusual double act we have first time of the double act i 'm going to pass over to kanina and probably go a bit quiet on you now and emerge a bit later over to you kanina thank you so much chris and hello and welcome back to about a book this is our very first one for 2022 so i do hope that you 've had a nice summer break my name is kanina mayne i 'm a local author to mid coast libraries my my two books are the one and all we for most people the summer break wasn 't what many people had expected i know that many were affected by covert and had to isolate causing them to miss out on seeing friends and family along with giving up holiday plans so big hugs to you any of you that are watching tonight that didn 't get the summer that you were hoping for thank you to all of you and so many of you got your screen switched on which is so lovely it 's so great for our guests tonight to be able to see that they 've got a captive audience at home speaking of summer my little family happened to be very lucky and like usual spent lots of time at the beach where we were able to escape the crowds we did some house renovations and even managed a trip to melbourne which was a trip that we 'd originally planned for last july a highlight for me would have been taking my son to see harry potter and the cursed child an epic play that goes for over two shows lasting more than four his seventh birthday um giving him the very first harry potter book and over the four years i 've read all seven books to him and it was a lovely thing to do sharing that time snug it up together reading it was just a bit of a special time especially to get away from his younger sisters so he always was happy to read harry with me some nights would take us up to 50 minutes to read one chapter but it was a massive feat and we got there in the end and he loved it became a massive harry potter fan and for his 11th birthday last year we gave him tickets to go see the play which i highly recommend it was set 18 years after the last book and was truly amazing it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience one thing that i didn 't do much of was reading or writing it 's funny because in the lead up to the christmas break i always think i 'm going to get so much reading and writing done the actual truth of the matter is that i less reading and writing than i normally do in term time so however i am hopeful that some of you at home were more successful with your reading piles and got to sink into some truly great books if you do have any recommendations for us be sure to pop the details into the chat chat function and share with all of our book lovers here tonight you 've already met chris jones who is the manager of midcoast libraries and later that later this evening chris and i will both give you one of our book recommendations i 'm very excited about our two guests tonight and that 's because i 've been a big fan of theirs since their first book the book ninja came out in 2018. that 's right i said their book for the first time ever we have a writing duo as our guests ali berg and michelle kallus kayla i think i said it wrong first kayla 's best friends and co-writers are here to tell us about their three novels and give us some book recommendations too so aly and michelle have writing club i found us a books on the rail initiative and now have written three books together when they 're not writing books ali is a copywriter and michelle is a primary school teacher they both live in melbourne where two of their three novels are set and are currently working on the screenplay to their first novel welcome ally and michelle i 've got lots of questions for them tonight but if either of you at home either anyone at home has questions be sure to put them into the chat function and we will get to them i will pop their website into the chat uh for anyone to check out whilst they 're i ever sorry at your leisure and now i 'm going to hand you over to ali and to tell us a little bit more about themselves and their books thank you so much yeah thanks so much for having us we are very honored to be here and it 's great to see so many faces um yes uh thanks i 'm ali this is michelle and we are co-authors co-writers and 'd tell you a little bit about our journey to becoming authors before we jump into our book recommendations which we 're very excited about we sort of had an unconventional route into becoming co-authors uh we started off uh building a social enterprise called books on the rail all about books of course um so we thought i 'd tell you a little bit about that and then tell you and then mitch with us how we got into writing books together um so yes back in 2016 we co-founded something called books on the rail i had just got back from london um and uh i met a girl there called holly who start and i helped her start books on the underground which is a very similar concept where we put books on trains um and i thought it was such an australian idea that as soon as i got home i approached mish who was my best friend and still is and my book clubbing bestie and i said we have to create something like this in australia um so we uh decided to put um a train with a big sticker on it that said take me read me and and put me back for someone else to find um and we thought no one would find it or nothing would happen of it but people got wind of the idea and um very quickly publishers started sending us boxes of their books to put on trains and the press got wind of us as well and started writing that there was ninjas putting books on trains and public transport and eventually um we very quickly uh became australian whites we 're based in melbourne but we eventually became australian-wide and book ninjas all over australia from every state around the country and started putting their own books on public transport and now we have um about a thousand book ninjas all over the country and about 10 000 books in circulation um with big stickers on the front saying take me read me and put me on put me back for someone else to find um and yeah we call the people who who plant those books book ninjas um and we were hearing genre that they would have never read before or they met a friend through a book that they dropped on a public transport and then someone else picked that book up and posted about on social media and they met that way and we 're finding out all these amazing stories but we really wanted someone to meet romantically through books on the rail but it just wasn 't happening so we sort of um concocted this idea and thought it would be a great book idea um for two people to meet romantically through through books on the rail um so one day we were um having a coffee with uh one of the publicity managers at simon schuster a publisher um we sort of brought up that we thought it would be a great idea um to make a romantic comedy about books on the rail where one woman drops a book on a public drops books on public transport in the hope to find her perfect man um and she really loved the idea and she brought that idea to her pitching meetings and we thought that she said that everyone loved it and we could write the book we had no idea really how to write the book but we had the idea and we were really passionate about it and we began writing our first book at the start of 2017 called the book ninja and i 'll give you to mitch to discuss our writing how he did that so yes writing a book was a very new concept for both of us um and it was especially new um writing it with another person um i think thankfully ali and i we 've known each other for such a long time and we have always been very very similar very like-minded similar sense of humor similar interests um so i think that definitely was a huge part of allowing this to work successfully because it was real trial and error at the beginning um so for ali and i to to write our first novel together we worked out that we wouldn 't have time to sit side by side and not and write each chapter together um we both worked full time a very small tight deadline um so we were frantically trying to write about over two three thousand words a week each in order to meet the deadline um so we worked out that we were just going to have to have a really clear understanding chapter by chapter of the big milestones in the book so that we could divvy up and divide and conquer um the book which turned out to be amazing um having one of the perks of having a co-author is that you can go on holiday and the book continues being written you get married you can have a baby and the book just keeps on being created so while at the beginning it was a bit of a um juggle to work out how to make it um happen it 's now an amazing gift that we we have for each other um so yes we use this plot map this is our bible this is what we go um to to make sure that we 're both on the same page um with our characters and and their the plot trajectory because chapter that comes after one ally hasn 't yet even written so we use that to to keep us both on track and on the same page and over the course of the three books we 've developed this new voice which sits a little bit sort of part way between ali and my voice um and it 's this now this whole new sort of entity that 's taken on a life of its own um and now when we go back and and read each other 's read the chapters um i know i find it really hard to remember and work out who wrote wash um yeah pretty a pretty amazing thing uh we sort of just morphed into one person and can 't really tell where one of us begins and the other one ends which is which has been a really exciting process and a really exciting result because when we um first when we 're first deliberating about how to write the book we thought well maybe we need to have characters each that we write a perspective of or um in our first just weren 't sure if we were going to be able to nail a consistent um voice and energy but yes we 've we 've been able to to create this new this new voice which has been um which we love we love our joint our joint character voice um you don 't need to name her yeah we should we do she 's our best friend um yeah so we 've been able to create three stories together um we published the book ninja in 2018 yeah um closely followed by um not fancy while you 're reading the following year um we worked on those books really sort of back to back um and then we released our latest book fancy meeting you here um late last year so our books are all romantic comedies um they have a bookish theme you can tell we like reading and we like incorporating that into into our stories and it 's always a big part of our protagonists lives as well um and we sort of have a bit of a quirky sense of humor so uh our characters them well we feel that they 're very lovable um we 've got an accountant who is obsessed with knitting we 've got a turtle in one of our stories a pet turtle um got a ferret a ferret of course there 's always a bit of a quirky animal in each of our books um and that helps us to sort of create this really real world um around us maria 's commented here she said how fascinating to morph into one voice and she 'd like to decide i 'd like to know how you decide on giving up the chapters um that 's a great question well i think um with ali and i as we 've we 've always worked full time and ally now also has um a one-year-old um it 's sort of whoever gets in first gets to write the chapter whoever 's available first i think in our first in the book ninja we had a little bit more flexibility where sort of every second chapter we wrote in order to um have that equality i guess between the two of us was going to write seven nine and um eleven but now it 's sort of who is in the document we write on google docs so it 's a live document we can see what the other person is writing and we can edit on that so now it 's a little bit more organic based on who 's up to watch or i know i 've done this to ali a few times where i 've been writing a chapter and i just have no idea how to finish it or where to go with it and i 'll just send her an email and say alec can you please finish this chapter i have writer 's block um and that 's the magic of having a buddy yeah that happens all the time and i think also you miss she 's uh great at writing a breakup scene i feel like you always get the breakup scene and i always want to write the big romantic um it 's you it 's always been new gestures so i think i get to write that chapter i try and when you 're a bit stuck to just pass it along get some fresh eyes on it it 's it 's amazing yes um marie would also like to know how has it ever been a twist in one of the chapters that the other one wasn 't expecting when when you 're reading each other 's work back i 'm assuming i think so i think again um in that vein uh i am i am a huge romantic we both are because we 're romantic comedies but mishi 's a lot more realistic and i like to have the character say i love you after the first date and get engaged after the second date and mish likes to take take things a little more slowly so i think sometimes i 'll write i 'll just sneak in and i love you after the first date or a proposal here and there and mitch will take them out i never win those those battles have you ever had an instance where you haven 't agreed on a serious plot point and how do you figure out oh you it helps that ali and i are not very confrontational people um and we especially have a huge amount of love and some admiration for each other so um working out how to give feedback and how to advocate for our ideas i think has been a big part of learning to collaborate so closely and so tightly um but it all the big things i think we 've always been on the same page we 've only ever wanted the best for our characters and for our story and our brainstorms are really dynamic and organic and it 's us sort of throwing out ideas and seeing where they go seeing where they won 't go um so the the conversations are just really discussions and dialogues around what we think will work um and i think we trust each other 's judgment a lot and we just trust each other 's insight and um it 's more about conversing over whether we think it 's going to work or not or how we 're going to be able to bring it to life so thankfully no big no and i um which is good it 's been all smooth sailing so far i do if if there is something really major i 'll get a text at three in the morning saying i 've been thinking about this and i think we need to change it then i know it 's serious and then we change it and so do you try i mean copenhagen 's been an issue but did you previously always get together to do your writing sessions or your brainstorming or is it something that you do online now together yeah so prior um to kobe we would get together all the time we um we yeah we had a ritual where we got together i would usually go to mitch 's house she would make me avo mesh in the morning and then very i was very lucky and then we would spend all day sort of writing together or plot mapping together and we would spend really intense periods together um and then of course like i did with everything kobe threw a major scanner in the works and we had to um for this third book um but we yes we used zoom like everyone did and um yeah and we sort of got yeah worked our way around it um that way so a lot of zoom sessions a lot of very very long zoom sessions speaking of your third book do you want to tell us a little bit more about fancy meeting you here yes so fancy meeting you here um was a really special book um to write and i think we started writing it before sort of the world shifted and changed in 2020 um and then continued to create this world that we really enjoyed escaping into when everything felt so uncertain and rocky and a little bit dire um so this book actually is set in london our first two books are set in melbourne but this one um is set in london um although our protagonist is australian we have to have an aussie aussie character so she and her family are the expats who moved um to london when um evie our main character was um finishing up high school um and um and follows the journey of evie who is um a very passionate writer of screenplays however has terrible writer 's block um and finds herself turning 30 with the same screenplay that she started writing about 10 years ago and and hasn 't really progressed in so she 's got this sort of itchy energy um and this sense of i guess inner turmoil and failure that that her twenties um haven 't weren 't what she what she hoped they would be um and at the same time she 's got this deep deep fixation and infatuation with this very famous um well-renowned author by the name of hugo hurst who she 's loved from afar for many many many years um she 's also a podcast host she hosts a podcast with her best friend ben feldman um and they sort of explore the world of film which is their their shared passion um and through this podcast they happen to um interview a medium to the to the to the stars to to celebrities and actors um and somehow through this meeting she finds herself transported early twenties um and she has this opportunity to do it all again and see how she would rewrite those really fun and uncomplicated yet really defining years and she just so happens to meet that hugo hearst character who is just an up-and-coming writer who works around the corner from her and yes it 's a story of love and hope and of i guess wishful thinking and trying to find yourself along the way yeah it 's a really beautiful story i love all i love all of your books they 've got this kind of warm snuggly feeling as though it 's like a cold winter 's night and you 're curling up under a blanket or something they just make you feel really good they 've got such great characters and i do love a rom-com as well can i ask what sparked the idea for the third book do you remember i think we were originally um talking about uh yeah if we could sort of um go like things were difficult we had no idea how difficult they would get um because we started we sort of were talking about you know what what we would do to go back to a simpler time 10 years ago and then as we started writing the pandemic hit and we thought wow what would we do to go back 10 years and how how nice it would be to bring our readers back 10 years into the past um although it 's not so far into the past so much has changed um and then yeah we really wanted to to do that and to sort of um bring our readers into a different world and into a different time but then also make them realise that uh 10 years ago was a simple time but a simpler time but also we have progressed so much since then as well oh that 's lots of fun and i did see that it is um that your latest book fancy meeting you here is one of the 55 books on the dimmix reading challenge for 2022. so the challenge is set up to encourage readers to be their best bookish shelves by reading widely so i 've in seeing um lots of other book recommendations and they 've kind of got a wide list of different genres that you can read pick and choose from now did you they 've got there 's more time for questions but i might get you to move on to your book recommendations if that 's okay yes so we might tag team do one each um first book recommendation that i wanted to share is called the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reed we have both become mad taylor jenkins read fan girls we were a little late to the party with starting to read her books um but immediately hooked um and this is definitely both of our favorite of of hers so she 's also read uh written malibu rising which i think came out just last year and daisy and the six as well um and seven husbands is set in hollywood in the in the 1950s um and follows the life of this very very famous and glamorous um actress and tells her life through the seven husbands that she collects over over 've i love about taylor jenkins reads is that she just completely immerses you into a time and a place and everything about it is so intoxicating um that you really do feel like you 're in that that um setting with your characters um so i think just the worlds that she create how vivid they are um is something that uh we really admire and we so enjoy as well and yeah the story just takes you on these twists and turns and has um a really unlikely ending as well with a very powerful message um so yeah big big fan of taylor taylor jenkins read yes i read i was late to the party on her as well and read that one last year and i think it was one of my favorite reads of 2021 it 's just epic it kind of really transports you to another place in time doesn 't it yes yes it 's amazing and one of her other books daisy jones in the sixth i think that the tv series is coming out this year which is very exciting oh one of her earlier books forever interrupted but it 's yeah it kind of has a different feel to it yeah i just read one of her earlier books over the summer holidays where one true loves and it 's very very different as well it doesn 't have that same iconic um decade setting that she has in her her earlier later books yeah this is just a light romance yeah so far how many i 'm really early i 've got to read it um is it me yes you um so i 've got we 've got four eight four recommendations and i think i 've got two two sentimental and two that have inspired my writing but i 'll start with my all-time favorite our all-time favorite book which is the bronze horseman i 'm not sure that anyone 's read it but it is about um it 's a historical fiction set in russia world war ii and it it talks about the leningrad siege and it um sort of it 's a three-part book uh the first book is the bronze horsemen and it um and it is a beautiful it 's a historical fiction and it really sets the scene and tells you a lot about um the history and what happened at the time but it 's also a beautiful love story um between um two people and yeah it 's just really one of the first books that um mitch and i sort of bonded over um yeah so much about um we talked about the book late at night we constantly um were talking about the characters and if we could meet them and we went to see paulina simons the author in melbourne when she went to speak i went to russia when i was living in london and i did bronze horseman is a statue in in russia and i tracked it down and sort of um jumped out of my tour and sneaked out of my tour so i could take a photo with it and it was just became an obsession for us and it was one of my first books that i became truly obsessed with i love it and it 's amazing and i 's one of the books that i 'm you know embarrassed to say that i haven 't read because i 've heard so many good things about it it 's actually on my bookshelf and it 's waiting to be read so you 've given me the final push i think to kind of bring to do it [Laughter] it would take you a long time to recover i when we read the three of them i found it really hard to find the book after that because i was just so immersed in the world and the story is just so oh amazing um all right my next book um the next one is a book called this is how it always is by laurie frankel um which i read on my honeymoon a few years ago a couple years ago and it is a beautiful heartwarming surprising [Music] just big hug of a book it follows the um this big sort of chaotic loud um rambunctious family of four four young boys um and sort of goes from the perspective of the mother and the father and really and and how those fam family bonds and and the things that you do for your family it 's a beautiful exploration as well of how one raises a child that is shifting and changing in a way that 's a little bit unexpected to perhaps what you imagined and what you dreamed for your child and this in particular the youngest child of the family who um his name is claude although he at a very young age feels that he he 's not in in the right body and that he um wants to grow up and be a girl and the way that the family empowers him and loves him or i should say her um and creates this really safe and nurturing environment um in order to allow her to become who who she truly is um and how the protective elements of family can both be the most amazing thing for the child but also backfires in different ways and um it explores that in a way that 's just um full of compassion and full of love and and humor um and real hope just how just how nuanced and wonderful this this story is so definitely recommend that one thank you um so my second one is one that inspired our craft in spite our writing it is a little book called the one by kanina may i 'm not sure whether you 've heard it i 've heard of it it 's it 's such a great it 's such a fantastic read and it is really one that inspired us it was uh kanina 's first um debut book um and uh i hadn 't heard much about you but then i read that um sorry to embarrass you i read that um uh that you were a writer for him in a way which if you think i 'm obsessed with the bronze horseman we were both obsessed with home and away completely and utterly obsessed we also went to all the me meet the actors um lined up in the hadston shopping center in melbourne for ages to meet them so that was very exciting um and then uh as well it was rom-com about the bachelor another thing like the perfect read um but yeah i think we i thought it was just going to be a light read and a fun read and it was both of those things um but something that it really taught us i think was um characters it just has the most exceptional characters it follows a few different characters and their points of view and um it sort of helped us realize that um that characters even in wrong content especially in rom-coms um can be multi-dimensional and should have different layers and you should be exploring different things about them as you go on each of the characters i was always surprised by things that happened and i learned more and more about them as things went on and i also thought about them after um and i remember canada you messaged me after saying um which was your favorite character and i liked one character originally and then changed it up and i kept thinking about which was my favorite character and i couldn 't applied and i think that 's a sign of a good book and that i think we learned a lot about characters from that and i highly recommend it the one thank you very much that 's lovely um my next recommendation is called lost and found by brooke davis who 's also an australian author um and it was actually a book that our editor um sent to us before we started writing the book ninja as um sort of a book that she felt would be a a good tonal fit and a good inspiration for us as we developed and and tried to discover our own our own voice um so we both read the book while it said in wa and we both read the book i think while we were traveling um through wa so that was an extra sort of special element to it um and i think it was one of the first books that i read where i really um developed this sort of love of books with really quirky unusual characters and quirky unusual friendships and it 's a book that 's just so heartwarming and beautiful but really just keeps you laughing and and set primarily from the perspective of her i think she 's about seven eight-year-old girl who finds herself um lost in a shopping mall and goes on this adventure to find her to find her mom and along the way collects these um two wonderful characters and becomes very good friends with them and i think they 're both um in their 80s and going through their own sort of life journey and life turmoil um and just sort of the wacky dialogue that she creates in the story against this beautiful arid backdrop um is wonderful and i i love i 'm i 'm a primary school teacher and i love books that sort of take you through the eyes of young children that sort of innocence and that um the beauty and that sort of raw humor that they can create um is is always really fun so yeah that was definitely a taste of um it 's a wonderful quirk that that i hoped ali and i would be able to replicate in some way or formulate in some way in our own books trisha 's actually know that it does ah it 's actually stephen 's commented that he loves that book and for anyone that is um uh a member of uh mikko 's library 's book club i know that that is a book club set if anyone 's interested if you wanting to do it as a book club book yeah i would wear a good book club book that 's great yeah we actually got to meet brooke davis over the phone we read it ages ago and then we loved it and then um and then our agent that we just got a couple years ago represents her as well so we spoke to her on the phone and it was extremely exciting steven 's saying that he got to meet her too ah she 's great yeah amazing um my second sentimental book is um a uh is one that i read i think when i was in primary school or secondary school um tomorrow when the war began by john marston um which is i 've read i i think it is a seven i think yeah um but forever and ever it 's about um uh people it 's about a group of young kids who go camping and then um and then uh come out of the where they 're camping and realize that australia has been invaded and taken over um and what they do about it and they sort of have to fend for themselves um and yeah mental a lot of me it meant a lot to me for a lot of reasons and i think even if i read it now as an adult i think i would still love it i might read it as an adult as well but um i think uh it was fantastic it was said in australia one of the first books that i read that was in australia um and then yeah we 've set out a couple of first our first two books in australia as well um and uh my first my first crush was in that oklahoma the character and um yes he was a big heartthrob and um as well um uh i just always thought about that book all the time thought i would come out of the woods or come out of the forest and and australia would be taken over but yeah so it 's a great book and i loved it and you have to save everyone and i would have to say to everyone in the world and be on my shoulders and i would and i would do it with a very good looking boy called homer and um that that book has sentimental value to me as well i 've read it young as well and loved it but then when my well now husband and i met at uni uh i went to uni about nine hours from home so when we 'd come we 'd listen to audio books in the car and we listened to the entire tomorrow when the war began series together which he 'd never read um but then we they 've actually done two film adaptations will a film and the tv yes how did you like homer in your adaptations i loved him in the film and i haven 't seen the tv yet have you seen was actually surprised that they didn 't do more of the tv yes i agree i agree i was disappointed yeah i 'll have to watch it where do i watch it i 'll find it fine maybe abc ivy or something yeah yes and then i 've got one more book i know um we 're tight on time so i 'll just mention briefly it 's the light we lost by jill santopolo um and it 's a romance and i think where ali and i different maybe why i 'm better at the breakup scenes and she 's better at the love scenes is that um she loves ali loves like really yummy romantic comedies and i love sort of really heart-wrenching romance stories um and this is definitely one of those just um a book that will just completely captivate you i know i was um stuck on the couch i couldn 't i couldn 't move just reading this incredible love story um my husband i think eventually found me when i got to the end just sort of sobbing on the couch when it beautiful and heartbreaking but i was also devastated that the book had finished um and i didn 't know what i was going to do after that um so yes a beautiful very emotional romance novel that will stick with you for a long time yes i loved that one too and was expecting the next one to be as satisfying and i found myself a little bit dismayed because i loved the first one so much yeah i agree i felt i felt similar um and then if you want to um laugh then have fun while you 're ready my last recommendation is last night by mary mcfarlane it is a british book it 's a romantic comedy all of her books are romantic comedies and um funny and hilarious and it 's sort of a lot of our humor is inspired a lot by her i think i highlighted half the book and was the entire book there were sad bits as well in that book actually but yeah i just i just find her hilarious and there 's so many funny books that i was crying funny well doesn 't she yeah um marie 's also commented wow that 's an amazing book ninja move to go to russia to track down the books journey and i 'm just scrolling up because judy kindly said hi everyone i enjoyed reading labyrinth by amanda lowry and love objects by emily mcguire she recommends both of those but thank you i 've seen a lot about um love objects actually same it 's on my list there 's such a long list today um i 'll i will i am now that you 've pointed out the time i am mindful of the time so i will quickly get to my recommendation and i have just popped in the link to my newsletter because each month i um kindly get a book from the publisher so in this case from alan and when they 've donated a book to uh for you guys to win of uh ali and michelle 's latest release fancy meeting new here so if you 're wanting to go into the draw you 've got to click on my link and i 'll recommendation um at the end of last year uh i listened to a podcast um australian author rachel johns we 've had on here before she guest hosted the writes or women podcast and interviewed american novelist ellen hildenbrand and ellen but it 's ellen i 'm gonna say ellen had written 27 novels most of them are romances and many based around nantucket island where she lives um so i 'm going to actually recommend the author um so i only read two of her books but she was captivating in her interview and i was in awe of all that she had done and really appreciated hearing um her struggles and her triumphs over all the years of being an author so rachel jones recommended that listeners listen that listeners read 28 summers so that was the first book i went to and i have to admit when i first actually listened to this one on audio when i first started listening i didn 't know if it was going to be for me but before i knew it i was captivated by the characters in the ongoing based around the classic film same time next year which i didn 't know about but quickly was googling where the couple have an arrangement whereby they spend every labor day weekend holiday together no matter what is happening in their lives so the readers catapulted into the story of their love and longing for one another and it 's got such a great support cast of characters and really showcases the beautiful place of nantucket she writes the settings so well and from what i can gather online that she does it across across the board of most of her books i enjoyed it so much that when i had my next audible credit i downloaded the next book uh this time her 2021 release called golden girl it immediately had the same vibe and i settled into it much quicker this time this book was about an author vivian howe whose 13th novel is about to become out when she 's killed in a hit-and-run accident she ascends to the beyond and as a signed martha someone who is called her person and permits vivian to watch below her newly grown children her ex-husband her high school sweetheart and along with the investigation into her death so she 's also granted three nudges allowing her to guide those she loves to make different decisions back on earth so it 's a little bit quirky but i found it really fun uh this story is told with multiple viewpoints and it 's really easy to follow um it 's an easy light reading which explores themes of family friends friendship first loves and grief so from what i can tell you can rely on ellen to write a really great beach read both of them both the books that i 've read had a real great escape feel to them and whilst doing the research for this event i noted that familiar names and some of her books appeared in other blurbs so i 'm assuming that she might use the police officer across all of the books that she set in nantucket for instance um and i i really like that kind of thing so she has a long back list and i plan on slowly making my and so midcoast libraries has plenty of ellen 's books to choose from so that was quickly my recommendations and chris before i get to you i 'm just going to ask ali and michelle another question um so huge congratulations to both of you on selling your film rights for the book ninja that is huge and so very exciting for all of us that loved your novel um can you tell us a little bit more about how that came about and what it 's been like working on the screenplay together yeah so um it came about very randomly our publisher just called us one day and said that they had uh that they had sold the right they had pitched the rights and we thought that nothing would happen and it was sort of in discussion for a long time and then and then it and then it um got sold to um uh film fury and uh paradise pictures which is a part of village um so yeah it was really exciting and we were pinching ourselves there was a huge pinch me moment um then it 's been a long process since then we 've written the treatment um uh which is a was a 20-page document sort of detailing exactly what would happen in the film and we worked very closely with the um producers on that um and they yeah sort of helped us transform the book and we actually now think that the film is maybe better than the book we 're not sure but um it 's very similar but there are some plot points that have um that have changed that we 're really excited about and we 're really excited for you to see if it yeah when it when it does eventuate and um we 've now just finished the screen play um so yes it 's now it 's it 's been a long process and it 's been yeah really interesting with the screenplays you don 't um get to write anything that dialogue so you don 't get to write what people are thinking or describe the scene or anything like that it 's all dialogue which was really difficult to sort of transform also a lot shorter our screenplay is about 111 pages and our books are about 380 pages so cutting it down was hard but also much easier to write to write a shorter shorter screenplay than a long book as well so it 's been hard and easy and just overall exciting so have you got a due date on that or is it whenever you get to it uh it has finished we have finished the screenplay you 've finished yeah yes so we are now waiting um yeah we 're now i 'm waiting for the next step which is um another round of funding and then hopefully it will be hitting screens at some point with a hemsworth or two so did you have to watch lots of rom-coms in preparation or was that something you 're already both across very across we 've had had a very healthy diet of rum gums just about all of our lives so we felt we felt well-versed we 're researching that in that department at least yeah yeah we did yeah we 've been watching a lot more australian i think um just because it will be an australian production and yeah we 've become even more obsessed with australian productions there 's so many good ones at the moment that we 're watching love me and bumper two of the ones that we 've watched at the moment which we are obsessed with yeah yeah i 've really enjoyed bump i 've got love me on my list i like the pile of books okay so thank you very much we will get back to you as well but i 'm going to hand everyone over to chris now to tell us a little bit of what his book recommendation or recommendations are but chris have you had a highlight this summer or you 're about to do your highlight yeah my highlight is um i 've always subscribed to holidays i 'm on a nine week break it 's the longest break i 've had in 35 years so i 've got to try and figure out i 'm into week two of that and i 'll have to bow out for the next one because i walking between new south wales and the victorian coastline that 'll be in a month 's time so i think marie 's taking that on and driving all over the place so we 're going to be seeing the grampians we 're going over to mount uh gambia and seeing all the vineyards around there we 're going to a danila quinn because neither of us have been there we don 't know what we 're going to get ourselves in for but we 're going there because we haven 't been there and that 's where my husband 's from chris oh look this is why we 're going there because everybody else has been to deniliquin about us it 's okay all right look out for that and um yeah so a lot of victoria we haven 't seen before so i guess that 's my um my big highlight for this year yeah how exciting indeed and i 've been doing a lot of reading too oh what are you gonna hit us with tonight well um okay two books if that 's all right and can great to hear all your books i was fascinated by all of them i realize i 've reached a certain age when the books that you talk about enjoying i discovered through my children particularly i have to say tomorrow when the war began i went oh that 's right we were driving around listening to audiobooks with that one so a great way to travel i 'm going to recommend first of all the book my book club just finished and i 'm fortunate to be part of a book club that encourages me to read um i like that i like that i 've really got a commitment to to go through there my book club recently read an amore towels novel called the lincoln highway now i 'm a huge fan of towels he wrote a gentleman in moscow which i think is a really perfectly balanced novel and fascinating characters beautifully written a lot of humor lincoln highway isn 't quite that good i 'd have to say it 's different but it 's a damn good book it 's got the same magical quality to he 's got a complex storyline and his young brother billy 's this fascinating child they end up on a traveling the lincoln highway but they encounter people from uh elliot 's past because he went to juvenile detention for something that he written it populated with characters that have a mythological flavor a um a giant black man called ulysses who has his own story which turns out to be very much like the ulysses of classic greek classical uh sort of history beautifully rigged so i would highly recommend lincoln highway by emile towels and the one that i 'm reading now and i 'm struggling to place myself because i do like to place myself through novels and this one is a rip roaring page turner i had read it described as the modern greats of wrath i don 't know that i 'd quite say it 's quite the same as grapes of roth but it really does grip you and it 's a a fantastic journey it 's um i don 't know if it 's backwards or forwards but it 's american dirt by 'm that far through it i can already recommend it i know it 's going to be keep going right the way through it set in mexico there are drug cartels there 's a sentence around a woman martha lydia and her son luca it 's a very confronting first chapter very confronting and thereafter their tension and it 's an escape novel it 's a it 's not a crime novel it 's a get away from criminal and really i 'm kind of hoping it ends well but i 'm not even sure about that that 's how good it is so i would highly recommend american dirt even though i haven 't finished it yet i love that you said that that 's an escape novel when i said my beach ring was an escape novel yeah i have seen lots of um lots of reviews on that one too but it might be a bit gritty for me chris what do you think i think it pro look it 's not as gritty as you might think the first chapter there is there 's the the rest of it 's written far less graphically than you might imagine and a lot of it 's about people supporting each other and bonding and caring for each other so there 's a lot of real human beauty in there as well it 's just that there are bad guys bad people and you know there 's at events and actions that that are associated with them but um no i think for most people it 's it would be really quite readable and probably hard to put down fantastic i just had a quick look i thought that that might have been one of the book club sets too but it doesn 't appear to be yet if it isn 't if it isn 't it should be um okay yes um mary lou said here loved the lincoln highway such a classic american writing and judy 's commented our book group just read a gentleman in moscow and loved it and annette has said thanks for a very interesting discussion and best wishes to ali and michelle apologies for having video off um she 's signing out didn 't want any spoilers [Laughter] cheryl said read this book about a year ago i still i still think about it so is that american dirt sure yep american dirt and it still had had a lasting effect on me oh a good if a good effect i hope murray 's asked [Laughter] that didn 't sell it to me this it was difficult to read but yeah it really it was it was um confronting and a lot of things but it did i agree with chris that it you know it showed the power of friendship all right well thank you very much i 'm going to ask ali and michelle one last question before we finish up for tonight and that is what 's your favorite part of the writing process for each of you [Music] i think i think just getting to collaborate with ally i mean we 've always just adored spending time with each other and riding with her is so social and dynamic and full of humor and and light and makes the trickier elements of writing like deadlines and um self-doubt manageable and breathable um so yeah just just working and learning from ali is is amazing it 's been such a gift [Laughter] yeah i think the same and um yeah i think also just getting to to make um stories up with with your best friend is so much fun we get to we 've named so many characters together looking through baby name books and um we 've thought about ideas about what would happen and yeah created these worlds together and it 's just been so much so much fun and i feel like yeah i feel like we 're we 're an old married couple now but yeah it 's been it 's been so much fun and yeah it 's great it 's a great way it 's a great thing to do well it 's very inspirational you should probably run some workshops for people to learn how to do it properly fascinating and how wonderful to have each other 's support yes yeah very lucky i 've also also got a comment from norm which i don 't think it 's norm but to listen to how you write which i agree it 's very very fascinating so before we finish up for tonight i wanted to let you all know that library lovers day is on monday the 14th of february yes the same day is valentine 's day

listening to them tonight if you don 't feel comfortable with that that 's fine as well so my name is kanina may and i 'm a local author to mid coast libraries and i have just had my second book come out earlier this year all we have is now my debut book was the one back in 2019 so i 've been a book lover and a library lover for as long as i can remember and i 've been a member of this library service since before i could even walk so writing reading and talking about books are some of my favorite things to do and it 's such a thrill being a co-host with chris each month and so you 've just met chris jones who is the manager of midcoast libraries chris is an actively avid for over a decade and it was his first live it was his first club that was the very first book club of this library service i think now mid coast libraries has over 80 active book clubs i think in the area which is just fantastic and there 's close to 200 uh book club sets available later this evening both chris and myself will give you one of our book club recommendations not book club but book recommendations but before we get into that i want to introduce you to our special guests so tonight we are joined by a sydney-based perth author burke harrell who has just released her 10th book you had it coming we 're also joined by kyle perry from tasmania his second book the deep is coming out next week are we down to counting sleeps now kyle exactly a week from today um there is bound to be lots of anticipation um about this one after that since after the success of carl 's debut the bluffs so our first guest is burr carroll otherwise known as bm carol she was born middle of six the middle child of six she often retreated from the chaos of family life by immersing herself in books she has found memories of the mobile library bus that used to pull up outside their house in blaney and the dozens also books that she would borrow at a time some quite inappropriate for her age in 1995 burr moved to sydney and began working as a finance manager in it industry as she began to climb the corporate ladder she was inspired to put pen to paper and began writing what would become her first novel executive affair bur went on to write another six novels that would be commonly referred to as contemporary women 's fiction or life lit before changing genres to what would be classified more as domestic fictional psychological fiction meaning that her last three novels which are published after be under bm carol have a thriller and mysterious element to them hopefully beau will tell us a little bit more about her motivation for changing genres if you have any questions for burr be sure to put them into the chat we 'll hand you over to bird now to tell us a little bit more about her own books along with her book recommendations thank you ver thank you kanina um i should say because burke causes a lot of confusion it 's short for brinidesh and bm is bernadette mary so um that everybody goes oh um um and um what caused me to change running i can 't really say i just decided that my um eighth book the missing pieces of sophie mccarthy was going to be a little bit different and um i changed the name that i was writing under and um and then before it was published i sort of wanted to change it back but the publishers thought that was a bad idea so um now i 'm bm carol which my children think is really really funny and so they call me bm when they 're being you know smart um anyway i 'll tell you a little bit about i 'm not going to tell you about 10 books um but i 'll tell you about the most recent book which told from three different perspectives um three women and but i don 't want that to turn off male listeners um the first of those characters is megan and she 's a paramedic and she 's just about to finish her shift um when she and her partner are called to a quiet sydney suburb and the scene awaiting megan is a very shocking one um a man has been shot outside his house and he doesn 't look like he 's going to live and what 's even more shocking is that she actually knows this man and she hates him and yet she still tries to save his life even though he ruined hers and the second character in the novel is jess and jess is a former friend of megan 's and um jess is a really tough uncompromising character she 's an ex-professional boxer and she 's on her way home from the gym when she receives a text from megan telling her what 's happened um to this man and her first thought is you had it coming which is not a very nice thought head and the third character in the novel is bridget who 's the detective trying to solve this case of couch of this man and why and bridget is a you know really talented detective but she 's also the mother of two teenage children and the more she investigates this case the more it makes her look at her children and understand the vulnerability of the particular age that they 're at and um she finds out that the man 's name is william newson and he is a defense barrister who has built his reputation and defending sexual assault cases um and he is extremely good at his job in fact he 's so good at his job that quite a few offenders have not been convicted for their crimes so there 's a lot of people who are angry with him and bridget as she delves deeper into the case she 's finds out about a rape trial that occurred 12 years ago and about the teenage party where that alleged crime happened and about two girls at the center of the trial um girls a and that 's just a quick synopsis of the book um fascinating thank you i should tell you a little bit about where i got the idea for the book i 'll make this really quick um and i have my six well my my son who 's now 19 and um i have him to thank for the idea of this book even though um it wasn 't_''_477.599 a very happy thing that happened and when he was 16 we had a house party for his 16th um and i 'm sure i can see lots of people rolling their eyes thinking well that was a stupid thing to do and it was a really stupid thing to do we thought we were being super smart avoid the 18th then we 'll be drinking at 16 and you know um we 'll have a 16th and it 'll be easy and of course there was a no alcohol mandate it was very closely supervised it was a lot of adults and but it still ended in the worst possible way it ended when an ambulance has been called so and it aged me 10 years and you know when you think somebody 's going to die in your living room floor that has that effect and it resulted in all future parties being banned so my daughter when she turned 16 had no chance whatsoever and um and also it just made me see you know um you know what teenagers are like you know how invincible they think they are and also how vulnerable they are and how you the last thing you want is for one mistake to have lifelong consequences so that really kind of got me thinking and in you had a coming it 's it 's not underage drinking it 's that other thing it 's teenage consent and sexual assault that 's the other peril of course that happens at these parties and something that we 've all you know heard a lot about this year and i didn 't when i was writing it i didn 't know that it was all going to blow up this year i was just delving into all of my concerns as a mother and the mother yeah so that 's just a little bit um a background so i 'll go on and i 'll talk about my book recommendations so this is my first book recommendation other people 's houses and this is written by kelly hawkins and kelly i believe is an author who 's based in newcastle and i really enjoyed this novel i 'm going to read the back of it because i think sometimes the back of the novel gives a much more succinct description than what i can and kate webb still grieves over the loss of her young son 10 years on she spends her weekends hungover and attending open houses on sydney 's wealthy north shore imagining the lives of the people who live there then kate visits the harding house the perfect house what it seems the perfect family and basically kate becomes obsessed with the people in this house and um and i like this book for lots of lots of different reasons um i a bit like everyone else i like the idea of open houses and i suppose i 've never really thought about your house open for people anybody to walk into so i thought that was a really really good premise um and as an author i was kind of a little bit jealous of the premise i thought it was such a good premise and sometimes that happens to me i read a really good premise and i go oh and um and i also like that it was said in the north shore i could kind of see these streets i could see the houses that she was talking about and and i had a has an unreliable narrator in fact you know a woman in her 40s who 's a bit of a drunk and usually when i start reading those characters sometimes i think oh this is another drunk narrator but it really was so much more than that and also there 's that you know you start off and you you know feeling really smug and good about yourself you can go my plate my life is in a really good place next to this character but as the story goes on and her backstory is revealed it 's really well written and i read that book in two days so um i highly recommend it my the next novel i 'm going to recommend is this one and kyle this is a tasmanian author katie mcmahon um the mistake i don 't know if you 've heard about it or heard about katie so um this looks like a women 's fiction kind of novel and the back i 'm not going to read the back because the back of it doesn 't sort of do it justice so this is um a really very very funny novel but also really dark and it 's about two sisters um case and beck and one of them is based in melbourne and one is based in tasmania and i liked the whole commuting between the two different locations in this um and kyle you 'll be happy to know that the climax happens in all the action happens in tasmania which is the best location ever for drama and mystery and but um what i liked about this was that um it successfully combined you know that and leanne actually has given a quote for this book and when i read it i did ask leanne if you know they had a long-lost sister in the family because i felt it was so similar to one of her novels and i can just say that the mistake that was made um is something that you know is quite unforgivable um and has you know long-term consequences and and you know there was a lot of drive the booklet everything i can 't recommend it highly enough i really really enjoyed it and um and one one thing i will say one extra thing i 'll say is that the two sisters in the novel are really wonderfully depicted and being one of four sisters i feel like i 'm kind of an expert on sisters and i 'm very critical when people write about sisters because sometimes they make this just too nice and sometimes maybe this is just too mean um but these sisters were just really wonderfully depicted so that 's my second novel i have no idea how i 'm going from time hopefully my third novel and this is completely different type of novel and i guess my first one was a psychological suspense the second one was general fiction with a darker thread this is i don 't know how to describe this it 's a coming-of-age novel it 's david nichols um and it 's called um sweet sorrow um and i 'll read the back because um it again describes it better than what i can it 's the summer of 1997. charlie lewis is stuck school is over his family is breaking up his father is falling apart and the long empty holidays stretch ahead towards an uncertain future then quite by chance charlie meets fran fisher and it 's as if a new world has opened up before him but can it last 20 years later charlie tells a story poignant clever hilarious sweet sorrow is david nichols wonderful new novel about the rocky pad path to adulthood and the searing experience of first love so this was published in 2020 um when my last novel who we were was published and um funnily enough we both wrote much in that reunion mind frame you know when i uh when i read it and and i guess reunions bring about lots of different you know emotions you know nostalgia um curiosity competitiveness sometimes bitterness and revenge and when i wrote my novel i went down the business revenge i am wrote and david nichols has gone for the sentimentality um and the nostalgia side of school reunions and i just found it a really funny very perceptive novel and the teenage boys in this book were so real i could oh you know i could see them and feel them and i love the banter in it and but there was you know one thing in this novel that i felt that you don 't often see in fiction and it 's um you know we hear a lot about toxic female friendships um the friendship of the teenage boys in this novel is you know um very very interesting and it really explores you know when that banter between males goes too far and the they some of the friends can 't ever realize their potential because i found that really interesting so sweet sorrow david nichols i 've really enjoyed it thank you but they 're your three they 're my three and i totally forgotten when i knew that when you sent your email through but i just remembered then um david nichols one day is one of my all-time favorites from when i was living in london and read it and i 've got sweet sorry sitting in my book or somewhere one in one shelf somewhere and i still haven 't read it which is kind of bizarre that it 's one of you know one of his other books is one of my favorites i really need to get a lot of people love one day don 't they and a lot of people who you know because one day it 's quite a sentimental book as well um my son actually my son owns this book um david nichols is loved by everybody in my house yeah yeah i 've i 've read his previous ones but um yeah i have to go back and look at sweet sorrow and um and has her book the last of apple blossom coming out later this month also also said along here um loves the mistake um starts slow but picks up and keeps on going so that was your second recommendation so but i would like to know um what comes first for you when you 're writing a story the characters the setting or the complication um it can be anything really i think when i started writing this genre the first novel the missing pieces of sophie mccarthy it was sophie mccarthy that came to me and i could really see her and i you know she 's kind of one of those people who have admire and have hate and i kind of really knew who she was and i kind of started with her um with the latest novel i think it was the you know idea so the opening scene in the book um you know the ambulance gets there and the idea of the paramedic knowing the person and that 's what i started with and then just you know and obviously because my head was 's where i ended up going but i started with the you know the premise with of that opening scene and i i don 't really plan my novels so i can 't sometimes it 's all jumbled up about what kind of sparked what oh but it 's nice to know that the ideas come from different places yeah you 're not relying on one soul you know and and look with with uh i have to say my last few books also you know because my life is really boring um my kids you know as their lives are kind of picking up and getting really interesting they 've provided the fuel for the last people and my la the school reunion when it was my daughter and something that happened to her at school sparked that so and the last two novels have you know had a fair bit of input from my teenage children and what 's been going on in their lives and are you stuck with your teenage children in lockdown at the moment yeah i am karina that 's why i 've got and they 've been told don 't move don 't move a muscle luckily the dog 's asleep if it was earlier in the day he 'd probably be prowling he 's very overstimulated at the moment there 's too many people around and he 's like one of those dogs from the me memes online you know that 's been walked too much so every time somebody comes downstairs he thinks now we 're going to go take him for a walk i guess i 've got my headphones on too because my mine are all very close by and often very noisy um so are you working on an 11th book at the moment i am i am but i am highly distracted and i 've decided that lockdown doesn 't make me feel very creative so i 've just been yeah that 's very understandable been working but not very productively yes i was i was very excited to send her an office to school today but um i do feel for everyone in sydney lockdown and for those in melbourne that faced it so much um about really and we 've got julietta henderson another author who said i had sweet sorry for ages two before i read it he 's also my fave loved it when i got into it and cassie says i have one day on my t um to be red pile and now i 've added sweet uh it 's sweet sorrows to my list um so lee would like to know would you prefer to be called burr or bm well face-to-face bro if you 're referring books i don 't know it 's really i don 't know how those authors do it that you know um right under a completely different name um i can 't remember i remember going to see one author she was a pam mcmillan author and i think she used to publish under sydney i can 't remember her surname but her real name was kim and it was really disconcerting at least i 'm bur or bm which is kind of close so you know sorry lee wants to know whether the next book is under burr or bm or even now bm and christine says 11th book burr how incredible yes incredible indeed well thank you very much and if you do have any more questions um for for burp be sure to pop them into the chat and we can get to them susie has quickly just said i read you had it coming really quickly and she really enjoyed it oh thank you so now we 're going to move over to our second guest kyle sorry lisa said i loved it too so carl perry is a drug and alcohol counselor based in hobart in tasmania he has grown up around the tasmanian bush and seas with the landscape a key feature of his riding and his spare time he loves the sea and his entire leg is covered in ocean tattoos his debut novel the bluffs has been translated into five languages it was shortlisted for the dybbuks book of the year and the indies debut fiction book of the year and was long-listed for the australian book industry awards general general fiction book of the year i think many people will be eagerly awaiting the release kyle once again if you have any questions for carl be sure to um pop them into the chat function and we will get to them i did pop in a link to burr 's latest book and when once kyle starts speaking i will pop in a link a pre-order link if anyone is interested be sure to click on either of those um so once again i 'll hand over to kyle 's to tell us a little bit more about his probably upcoming book but also welcome to talk about the bluffs as well and then move on to some of his uh favorite books thanks kyle thanks kanina um yes i 'm i 'm rugged up in a jacket even though i 'm inside with the heater going it 's absolutely freezing here in in hobart and i was so i feel for everyone who 's in lockdown absolutely but i was talking to my publicist today and i said look i 'm sure it sucks but i had to buy gloves just to walk from my car park to my office it 's that cold 'm sure it 's i 'm sure it 's terrible um yes this is uh my upcoming release the deep um it 's out in exactly a week it 's uh i will i 'll give you a bit of a rundown of the premise then i 'll explain the characters the same with um burr the three point of view characters in my book are male as opposed to your female bear and the same way i hope that that doesn 't lead to any female readers so the deep is centered in a fictional town on tasmania 's east coast it 's called shack town and it 's in a place called the tasman peninsula which is a real place it 's got uh the the highest sea cliffs in australia it 's got some pretty dangerous tides and some really complicated underwater sea cave systems in this town there is a family called the dempseys who run a drug cartel or a drug outfit and i 'm just the main criminal enterprise so the main story is about one of those family members his name is mack lot and he 's kind of the outcast of the family he 's been to prison for drug dealing he 's trying to get his life together he 's trying to reform himself um what that looks like though is he 's currently out on bail which involves some pretty strict bowel conditions he 's got to sign into the police station every morning he 's not allowed to have his own pain meds in his house he 's got to go to the chemist every morning to get them and he 's got a curfew how the story begins is uh mackerel 's nephew forrest dempsey washes up on the shore forest is 13 years old and for the last seven years he 's been missing along with his parents his parents being the previous leaders of the drug cartel so what happens is forest dempsey washes up on the shore and that sets the whole story into motion because suddenly mack is right back in the thick of things because now raises a lot of questions about what happened to forrest what happened to his parents what 's the way that that drug outfits work or criminal criminal outfits work is that there 's always competition and there 's always others wanting to muscle in on that territory so one of the main dangers of the deep right from the start is that there 's a rival drug kingpin that sees the weakness in the family and then he starts moving in so that 's the start of the the drama of the deep the main the point of view characters is mac it 's mainly about him and his story and his redemption forest it 's all about um what happened to him and why he 's there and how he 's trying to make sense of the world and the last is is another dempsey his name 's ahab he got out of the family a while ago and he 's trying to stay on the straight and narrow but he 's obviously very fiercely protective of his family and his town that 's uh that 's the main premise any of those who have read the bluffs um it 's got a similar narrative style of turns um a lot of a lot of action right from the get-go and i really have had some really good feedback on the deep a lot of people have preferred preferred this to the bluffs which is a really really good sign for me to get um i didn 't expect to get that you 've already got a comment in here that lee who 's from port macquarie library uh uh lovely librarian up there she 's she 's already managed to read it and she said she loves it it 's brilliant kyle oh thank you awesome so yeah yeah that 's that 's the deep i 'll let you uh pick it up yourself it 's got a really nice cover it 's got some nice spot gloss there so it 's a nice little tactile art object for your bookshelf if nothing else um i 'll move on to my book recommendations now that 's all right i 'll start with the what my current read it 's the girl remains by katherine ferkin um i 've got the proof i got it uh 'm only just kind of really getting to it now i 'm loving this book um i read her previous book sticks and stones this is a police procedural set um on the the uh was it the mornington peninsula i think the peninsula somewhere in victoria and uh it 's based around the same detective from her first book detective emmett corbin and there 's some really fascinating dynamics in this book because emmett 's wife is a journalist and almost from the beginning of the book we 've got some tension on a case because he um has got to try and keep keep the media on the download where she 's trying to get the scoop so straight away you 've got some great family dynamics the actual main premise of the story is about um back in 1998 three teenage girls venture out for a night of mischief but only two return and then some remains some girl remains wash up on the beach and that starts the story it 's a very um i 've been kind of keeping an eye out on all the the book i 'm currently reading and all the reviews have been so stellar um everyone 's really enjoying this book a lot of people have um really got excited about it being a police procedural a really strong aussie police procedural um anyway i haven 't finished it so i can 't tell you how what i think of the ending but i love it so much at the moment and i think it 'll be good i 'm looking forward to getting to the end i wanted to talk about some other books that i 've read recently they 're not aussie crime books they 're not even really cro they 're not prime books at all um but i 've been exploring some different stories and different genres because i 've been uh researching my third book so i 'll start with this recommendation which is um norse mythology by neil gaiman um this book is essentially retellings of the norse norse myths by neil gaiman and the reason i want to recommend it is because i 'm not really being that much of a fan of to me that much i don 't seem to have finished any of his books but this was recommended to me as a really good kind of expose of the norse myths and again i 've never really been that much interested in mythology but i really wanted to explore some some norse and viking themes in my next book so i picked this one up i wasn 't expecting much and yeah i absolutely devoured it um just the way that he presents like these ancient myths but in a bit of a fresh way with you know his stylistic writing he draws out some really subtle character stuff as well and just some really nice things so if you 're looking for something just to maybe break up what you 're used to reading or maybe it didn 't take me that long to read um it 's really readable it 's really interesting a lot of it lingered with me actually as you know mythology tends to do so norse mythology by neil gaiman is one of my recommendations i 'm impressed that you went back to i 've recognized is is that i think we have this tendency to think that if we don 't like a book it 's it 's the the writing or it 's the author 's style which i mean i think you know i fell into that trap as well but it 's not really true every book is a separate creation every book has its own energy and personality so even though i haven 't really connected with any of his other books um yeah for some reason his style of writing in this this song to me yeah that 's a great point i think what 's this well especially when um i i know even in my second book my publisher was a little bit unsure because it was different to my first um and i don 't know how you handled that verb when you tried to do something a bit different um because they do want you to write the same but as an author you want to kind of explore other things as well yeah the publishers don 't like you to write different that readers will come with you um yeah well as readers we like a wide range of we do we do we 're not as narrow as what publishers think we are yeah i think too that as creatives we 've got a good idea of of where kind of where our gifts want to grow into so we can kind of see oh well if i go in this direction it 's going to be good eventually or there 's going to be an appetite for this eventually so when we take that first step out we see the direction but no one else is living in our skin no one else is in our imagination they can 't see that final vision yeah that 's true because i mean you see like if we compare it to music artists they 'll do albums now that 'll be a flop you know this year and then five years later they 're massive hits and it should be the same books but but yes that 's that 's uh that 's my second recommendation the other recommendation i have comes sydney a while ago before everyone got sent to their rooms um she recommended that actually she assigned this book to me as my homework it 's called the passage by justin cronin um it is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel which comes in at like 971 pages um she told me you have to read this book this is your homework and i 'm like yeah okay i 'll take the challenge but so i i got it on audible to begin with um and started listening to it and i was i kept like i was a bit cheeky i kept messaging it saying there is so much backstory like why am i getting massive expose on this character and i was getting like frustrated and she 's like just put it down if you don 't want to finish it i 'm like no i 'm gonna finish it um and then i bought it in hard copy just so i could kind of um read a bit quicker and it it 's really long and quite boring in places and yet it 's so good which so interesting for me to kind of work out why does this work for me why do i like it um i think i don 't like post-apocalyptic this has like a zombie slash vampire um plot it 's about um yeah it 's like about it 's about a a vampire zombie apocalypse and about how it decimates the population and so it begins with how that that outbreak begins and then it leads into like the survivors in their colony and there 's like this one scene where they 're all escaping on this on this freight train and it 's over overrun with these zombie vampires and the way it 's written is like a literary book it 's just it 's fascinating so i just the fact i got to the end of it i think it 's a pretty good idea because i mean i 'm pretty i 'm a pretty busy reader um so anyway i i think if you want again to try something different if you want to like get immersed into some world building you want a bit of a zombie sophisticated got great characterization i um i definitely recommend passage i 'll assign this to you as homework if you 're ever talking to candace just let her know kyle perry finished the homework she assigned me how do you characterize zombies kyle well without giving too much away these zombies kind of have a bit of a a hive mind okay so that that 's how they 're but then also there 's this real great like tragedy because when they first become um zombie slash vampires they still have enough memory of their home and so they like they 're like well they want to come home and so you 're like you 're feeling sorry for them and i don 't like zombies i don 't even like i said i don 't like apocalypse stories at all so anyway it 's good to be challenged as a reader and as a creative and um yeah i 'm interested actually if you read it let me know what you think of it i 'm interested that candace recommended a zombie book because she 's such a hardcore thought you 're going to hold up something really scary and bloodthirsty no that cover looked scary to me well yeah it does it does look scary but when somebody says zombies to me i always kind of half laugh i don 't know why well it 's it 's vampire like they can 't come out during the day otherwise they get to like you know like vampires kind of came out the day the only place i can get killed is like right over the heart like you know like a um like a steak to the heart every oh man it 's and it 's got like little moments in there where they 're reading from journal articles or actual journals or emails that kind of thing it 's lots of cross-format lots of different views for anyway it really really solid i finished it that 's a thousand pages i 'm done just has commented here to you kyle homework plus scary cover equals nightmare [Laughter] um elise also said thanks for the recommendation i think that was for the north mythology um north is it for her son who was an adult now was really into viking mythology as a kid and susie says um every book has its own energy and personality i like this way of looking at books and margaret says for her sometimes it 's the time that she reads it that can make the difference and i think that 's when we 're talking about what we like and what we feel like writing and you know breaking into something new and i definitely know that i might be in the mood for a thriller as opposed to a you know a rom-com or something like that mary lou wants to know kyle um how many times have you watched the princess bride um not that many admitted as a kid i haven 't watched it since i entered adulthood what 's that what 's the reasoning behind that question maybe maybe she 'll get to us i was going to ask you the same question uh that i asked birth um what comes first for you when you 're writing the story the characters the setting of the complication get the plot idea however that being said my complications come from my day job which is um you know like in counseling and therapy work so i 'll have a conversation with someone something about their life will spur an idea and then that 'll become the complication in my mind and then generally i 'll frame up the characters based on their their input ah yeah we i think you 'd be constantly uh be placed like given ideas wouldn 't you in that kind of work you 'd have to kind of choose very carefully which one you 're going to spend a lot more time with well with the deep it 's all about um ice the drug ice and it 's manufacturing and stealing and it 's trafficking and that was based because i was working with a lot of high profile high up their ice dealers so their stories their their kind of wisdom from that side of the tracks their experiences were like really crucial to crafting a realistic story um sorry mary lou 's just commented here she 's read um she mentions that was the princess bride oh yes sure yes had you forgotten that 's so yeah no so what happens okay i 'll explain that so in the in the book the the kingpin the one that 's coming in called the dread pirate blackbeard and this this comes from you know the moniker dragon pirate roberts from the princess bride and however i didn 't get it from the princess bride i got it from the story of silk road silk roads is an online drug trading platform and it 's like in the dark web and the guy who runs silk road or used to run silk road called himself the dread pirate roberts because in the princess bride the dread pirate robert 's name is given to multiple people so once you die someone else takes it on and the idea is that name gathers a lot of a lot of weight and the same way in the real world in silk road this drug trading platform he used the name dread pirate roberts so that if he he could like evade the authorities by making sense so it was a good question the actual answer is i didn 't get it from the movie necessarily i got it from silk road who got it from the movie that 's not quite as innocent just no whimsical at all rachel says she loves bur bm carol books and kyle 's are going straight on her to be red pile thanks to you all um now i i will move along to my recommendation now but please be sure to um add an import and add any questions for kyle and burt into the chat and we 'll get to them in a minute um so i usually like to recommend books by australian authors because we have so much talent here in our country however this month i 'm i 'm recommending um the anticipated novel uh malibu rising and currency of my i can 't wait to read that yeah um by the american author taylor jenkins read um and i wasn 't the only one looking forward to this after this after the success of her other books one of them being daisy jones did the spotlight on some of my favorite audio books um and which is currently being that one 's currently being adapted to an into a limited tv series for amazon by reese witherspoon 's hello sunshine company um and malibu rising is an addictive read from the moment i started reading it i didn 't want to put it down the story is about four famous siblings within a 24-hour period including a wild malibu party the story also jumps back in time to when their parents met revealing a full emotional and heartbreaking relationship for me if an author sets out a certain time period whether it 's a one weekend one year in five years time or in this case 24 hours it 's something that gets my attention and i think that 's what really attracted to me attracted me to the one i one to david nichols 's one day which we 're talking about um i love knowing the time frame set up um and i really enjoyed seeing how in this case um they manipulated uh how reid manipulates the story arcs and said timeline uh so this book is fast paced with family members who are not only likeable but delightfully flawed she 's established complex but believable relationships between the siblings and ultimately it 's a story not only about family bonds but also about the power of breaking free the setting of malibu is strong within the story you can also feel this you can almost feel the sea breeze and the smell of salt in the air which given none of us can travel much these days it 's nice to escape to another place and even to another time in this case reed highlights the 1980s with the surf culture the fashion the cars and the music once the party starts in the second half of the book reed uses small vignettes of other characters that we haven 't previously met and i can see that some readers might find this jarring or annoying um as there is a certain desire to get back to the main cast um even if i had to pick uh pick on one thing it would be that i probably enjoyed the found the pace dropped off a bit and i think that probably did have something to do with wanting to uh get back to the other characters and i wasn 't as invested in these small little characters that she mentioned it 's a whirlwind ride from the 1950s to the 1980s jumping back uh jumping between the multiple story lines we know each of the characters intimately their flaws their fears and their hopes ultimately it 's a coming-of-age story and i really enjoyed it now the day after i finished this great read i started reading one of her previous works the seven husbands of of evelyn hugo and i 'm not sure whether that 's on screen yet that one um and so this is what my book club is doing this month uh in brief this one is about an aging and reclusive movie star evelyn hugo who has chosen an unknown movie uh magazine reporter monique grant to write her biography monique hopes this will jump start her career along with uh help her get over the fact that her husband of only one year east side apartment monique listens to evelyn tell her story making her way to los angeles in the 1950s her rise to fame and her desire to leave show business in the 1980s um the book is broken into sections detailing her life and the seven husbands each section of it is a different husband monique is drawn into evelyn 's life realizing how deep her ambition laid as she learns about a great forbidden love uh last night i read through to the end of the fourth husband and she writes uh short chapters which are just too easy to consume it 's so easy to say just one more i 'll just read one more and she has a great knack for writing impressive end of chapter cliffhangers which makes it even harder to put down at this point you just want to keep propelling and i even just snuck in whilst i was waiting at gymnastics for pick up i snuck in a little bit of cha of of husband number five um so the rest of the blurb on the back tells me that evelyn 's why she 's chosen monique to write the biography their lives intersect in a tragic uh an irreversible way so of course that has you guessing uh how they 're connected um uh taylor jenkins read writes stories that you just want to binge on and are so easy to consume kind of like a glossy magazine itself or a binge worthy tv series she 's written seven novels in total but the last three of them have all been new york times best sellers um in each of these red explores the inner lives of the rich and famous showing us what goes on not only behind closed doors but behind the camera or the glossy film shoots i think she 's found a formula that will and truly appeals to the masses so um that 's i snuck into recommendations which chris will have to laugh at because he usually does that and i 'm usually only doing one but i couldn 't help it because i was gonna do malibu rising but then when i started the second one i thought oh my gosh i think i so there 's a few comments here um mary lou says uh the deep is since a sensational read so many twists congratulations to kyle thank you uh susie said i really love daisy jones and i 've brought my olympia rising look forward to reading it after your recommendation yes and and now you 've got to get this one as well because this one 's great as well um mari or marie i 'm not sure sorry if i 've said it wrong uh wow car lots of human complexities found in the counseling space great how you harness your creativity to leave stories from your counseling work yes absolutely i imagine it 's a nice uh release as well okay so i 'm going to hand over to chris now to give us his recommendation and you can still pop questions in if you have an iphone and kyle so over to you chris and uh thank you kanina and this time i 'm only doing one recommendation you 're consistently doing three recommendations can i just say there are some sentences that people say that you again but they do make you smile and the sentence that i snuck in a little bit of husband number five i 'm absolutely loved i have two sides um and just to let you know kyle up here in foster when it gets below 10 degrees people go what 's really really cold oh yeah but we we win i i get depressed if it goes if if i say 19 i 'm like oh 19. that 's right that 's i think we 're only having a top of 19. okay i was up in armadale on the weekend so i had a pleasant reminder of how cold it could be that 's a very hard place in new south wales and i also have to say burr bernadette i have a sister in law bernadette and um and she she would love to know more bernard ads it 's not money and having to explain a name she 's from a a grand uh catholic family so yeah it was a good connection but um and thank you for the recommendation i i quite like neil gaiman sound a bit strange but uh he 's he 's done some really interesting comics and or graphic novels and uh he co-authored with terry pratchett who 's one of my favorite authors with good omens so i can recommend that one well i listen to his masterclass and he 's a genius and he 's such good like storytelling but anyway i just didn 't respond to his writing i guess no i i get that so my one recommendation then one is uh it has it has a tasmanian connection i noticed that burr had the tasmanian connection through the mistake i think it was wasn 't it yeah kyle has a fundamental tasmanian connection obviously so the um author i 'm going to review and the book i 'm going to review is uh the author is heather rose yes who um he might have crossed paths with i don 't know what happens in literary circles i have a few times in the bookshop she 's beautiful yeah yeah and uh actually the first book i read of hers was bruni now which has an obviously this is i get to read basically one book a month seems to be about my rhythm is the book club read and so it 's always something new and the one that we read uh the title will actually be almost impossible oh doesn 't work with my screen the museum of modern love by heather rose now i thought this was um superior to bernie and uh a really remarkable novel actually i won 't read the back of the story other than this struck an absurd chord with me by um one of the comments is this is a weirdly beautiful book and it really is weirdly beautiful it 's based around um the artist the performance artist marina abramovic who for 75 days sat in a chair in a moma in um in new york and she would not say anything or move and people would come and there 'd be a chair opposite her and people come and sit and spend time in that space and it 's you know how there are some some novels where when people go well did much happen you well and it 's one of those novels that the the plot is very straightforward it is people who sit opposite a marina and you get to see their how it changes them and how they self-reflect and you begin to also unpack the story thread of mourinho 's life which is really quite extraordinary in itself and quite quite bizarre in so many ways and you get to see other characters lives and their tragedies unfold or how they grapple with their tragedies and how actually sitting opposite marina has enabled them to self-reflect and perhaps move into better places in their lives what is probably most extraordinary of all is that what you 're reading primarily happened and uh it is a fictional work without a doubt but based on such a bizarre um real life situation that it drew me in it 's i would say it 's probably not my normal style of choice to read which thrills me to bits because i love i love that people are currently recommending me zombie vampire officers and you know i can i can really dig that um up at about 400. so there 's a tip for any writers uh 399 pages rock with that and a lot of book clubs will read you but i would hardly hardly recommend the museum of modern love by uh heather rose great book i think my book club we haven 't met to discuss it but i reckon they 're all gonna say it 's fantastic yeah lee says he um that it was incredible how she gradually lost gradually lost herself in the installation and yes is that right you made me think that i might i was commenting on the wrong book um and christina said yes i adore this book read it years ago i might need to reread yeah i would i 'd hardly recommend it i can 't think of anybody that wouldn 't actually get value from it actually the curious way i did it too was we went on a road trip to south australia when you could do road trips and um we listened to it i think it 's the first audio book i 've listened to for ages uh to the rest of it and it was it 's a really good way to travel so anyway absolutely lots of audio books at your library by the way i have to put a quick plug in also on borrower box and libby with midcoast libraries um one last thing thank you kyle thank you burt i am actually adding titles to my list courtesy of both of you including your own works of course so thank you chris um we 've got here that jazz says great great book recommendations and she says burr you zoomed with our book club group in october last year to discuss who we were which was a thrill for our group and she 's looking forward to reading you had it coming knowing the trauma that inspired it um and cassie 's got a question for both of you uh what are the pros and cons of writing so bur would you like to take there first um [Music] well i 'll i 'll start with the cons because i 'm experiencing them really right now and that is the fact you work unloading or if the washing needs to be hung out and it 's so hard not to get distracted and not come up with a thousand reasons um you know a thousand things you should do other than right so um i always remember matthew riley used to have an office in the city and i thought that if i was ever successful enough i 'd like to have an office in the city and get dressed up every morning and go somewhere where i could close the door but then the positives are that um you know you can write in your pajamas i don 't i don 't write in my pajamas but i like the idea of writing in my pajamas a lot and and that you can take um tea breaks and lunch breaks and you know afternoon tea breaks and as many bricks as you like really and given i find that the more you eat the more creative you are um and um so the flexibility has been great and it 's particularly being great with my kids as they 've grown up because i used to have a corporate job and i was you know gone from seven in the morning till seven at night so having a job where i can work from home is um an amazing privilege really yeah absolutely i might complain about them but you know i do like them how about you carl what are your pros and cons of writing oh man there are so many pros to being a writer anyone interested in being right 100 recommended um maybe not as an income stream but i mean just like to be able to create to engage with humanity and humans book people are like the best kind of people there 's a really great culture and community around it you get to create worlds you get to explore yourself you get you put your stamp on kind of the the literary fabric of australia and the rest of the world sometimes um just yeah there 's the energy creating the excitement of exploring new things the adventure of it that 's just it 's awesome and especially like i 've had a very good i writer but also i spent 10 years in 10 you know unpublished failed manuscripts to get here and even that journey was fun like just to create and write is awesome i think the the only con there 's maybe two cons one of them is deadlines can get a bit suffocating sometimes because you 're like oh i really need to get this out but also i want my creativity to flourish so there 's a little bit of attention you 've got to balance and then the other major con is just goodreads reviews um yeah but you just you just read those kyle yeah i 'm not doing that with the date with the moment don 't go there don 't go there you 've made me remember oh there 's lots of positives i was just concentrating in the home i love finding out weird things about weird things you know you 've got you end up in an amazing general knowledge because you 're always researching something strange and you end up with some really useful general knowledge and stuff you 're interested in you and learn north korea you only do it if you really want to and it 's alright yeah yeah yeah i think reviews themselves are okay but the goodreads reviews i think because people don 't have any accountability and people would just comment because it wasn 't the book they thought they were picking up like it 's just a big this is a minefield so if you want to be a writer don 't read goodreads reviews yeah but then when you have a la a lapsing moment and you can 't get uh the writing done you go oh i wonder if there 's any more reviews there and then and then curse yourself for looking um yes cassie 's written here people can be savage on goodreads um and jazz wants to know is the writing process for each of you always done on a computer and do you worry about losing your work kyle do you want to go first this time um yes always on a computer i can 't hand right uh i did download some dictation software but i does it doesn this is my new ferrari this is a 600 ergonomic keyboard wow wow i had to get because i um was had a have rsi now from writing too much but this keyboard enables me to write all day or night and not get fatigued so yes it all happens on a computer and i email drafts to myself pretty regularly that 's how i try and mitigate the risk of losing anything even though it 's never happened do you scrivener or just a word this word i have i have scriven a bit but i 'm really i 'm not very bright with that kind of stuff so i just stick with what i know what about you bear um mine is yeah definitely on a computer and just on word um i don 't think you need a fancy package to be able to separate your chapters sometimes if the novel is and these last few novels because there 's a lot of plot lines once i 've written it sometimes i use an excel spreadsheet to figure out what 's happened where because as soon as of what the reader knows and when they know it but i only do that after i 've written the first strat i don 't do it as i 'm as i 'm writing and yes i am always scared of losing the work and so um like kyle i email it to myself um and then my inbox regularly runs out of space due to you know me emailing large files to myself constantly um and it 's backed up in you know numerous places so and and even when the book is published i 'm so nervous you know i still have drafts that are you know completely useless on my computer i still can 't delete the old drafts so um i guess it 's you know but occasionally something will happen that makes you panic and sometimes you can lose a file it 's and it 's a very panicky feeling so i think we all have that fear in us that we lose our work yeah it 's funny that you both say that it 's purely computer because i 've got this notepad i scrap pieces of paper i 've got two other notebooks next to me here but i think that 's because uh when i was getting quite serious about writing i had young kids so i could carry this with me uh wherever we went and so even if we 're playing blocks on the floor or something i could have that next to me and i 'd be scrolling things down um and uh and now i take one to bed and i 've got one one in my bag where we 're going to all the different activities and then i then i 've got like a little circle and a tick and a circle that means that i have popped that into the computer that 's my code to say yeah you 've written you 've put that on the computer so it 's really sophisticated ideas but i uh didn 't use i just used word for um for the one but uh with my all we have is now that came out in the book i 'm working on now i 've used scrivener but i 've found it so handy to color code and you wouldn 't think that i 'd like to be organized because i 've got it everywhere but i do really enjoy being able to be organized and i don 't write chronologically so i move it around a lot so do you guys write chronologically or yeah i write chronologically but if i don 't know what 's going to happen in that chapter i 'll just put like a placeholder paragraph and then move on to the next chapter yeah similarly i write chronologically and um i 'll if i 'm stuck i 'll keep going with the same character until i can figure out what 's happening to the other characters i didn 't help myself with with the previous two novels because i had seven different perspectives in each of them which was really bad idea so i regularly would get to a point where i didn 't know what was going to happen but you particular character you had more than seven didn 't you begin with burr in um sophie 's story yeah the missing bring it from nine down to seven and then she 'd say things like can you tell us that but through a different way and i was like no i can 't tell you that through a different way because i 'm meant to be in the head of that particular character and it was a really ambitious thing to do and and i don 't know why i did sophie like that it was you know sophie just came out like that but then with who we were it was a school reunion so you know you 're meant to be representing a cohort of 80 odd students so in my defense you know i kind of said well seven is actually not that many when it you know could really be 80. so and i and i think i think readers you know and taylor jenkins you 're talking about you know putting in little characters and and she did that with daisy jones there 's lots of you know little characters readers are smart they can follow it i i love the little characters and the little book with seven i 'm going to do ever um ah jazz wants to know sorry sorry it took me a little while to get does the cat have any book recommendations [Laughter] yeah she does i 'm needy and i need attention that 's her favorite uh are there any um last questions before we wind up for tonight at this stage it looks like well i wanted to say thank you so much for joining us today um it 's been great fun having both you and both you burr and carol i said it again and kyle on tonight um and all the books that have been mentioned by burr kyle chris and myself are all available in the midcoast libraries catalogue um alternatively if you want to purchase any we encourage you contact some of our local bookstores the sitting one bad at foster or the online

doing such a great job yes _"

    "text": "[Music] wetlands are one of the most diverse habitats on the planet they are important for flora and fauna and often contain species that are found nowhere else wetlands function like the kidney of the system and they 're critical for protecting our environment wetlands help reduce the impact of flooding they absorb pollutants and improve water quality they are critical for climate mitigation and adaption and coastal wetlands help protect our shores from wave action there are many different types of wetlands they can include areas that are permanently covered by water or even those that are only inundated at certain times of the year unfortunately 90 of the world 's wetlands have undergone degradation since the 1700s february 2nd is the celebration of world wetlands day and in 2022 it 's all about undertaking management actions to help protect wetlands for people and the environment over the past several decades many large areas of the midcoast region have undergone rehabilitation and conservation to protect these important wetland areas once a farmland site that was suffering the effects of acid sulfate soils land clearing and extensive weeds the rehabilitation of the rehabilitation works was improving water quality in the manning river the works on site have had a range of other improvements including increasing biodiversity the scientists seen extensive planting of native species including an area of local fruit trees designed for wildlife to enjoy a major part of the project has also been the filling in of drainage lines and the re-wetting of the landscape such as this beautiful wetland behind me this helps prevent the effects of acid sulfate soils we 've also undertaken extensive weeding and pest animal control today cadillac wetlands provides an important sanctuary for local wildlife including kangaroos wallabies koalas and species like the endangered giant dragonfly over 180 different species of birds call caddo wetlands home this includes the white-bellied sea eagle black swans and the comb-crested chicana which is a threatened species and cadiz wetlands is its southernmost nesting site in new south wales today works are continuing to maintain and protect this important 1400 hectare site caddo wetlands is open for the public to enjoy with several different walking trails it has become an internationally renowned birding hotspot with visitors our wonderful wetland buladi la plain wetland is a 366 hectare site located along the mile river this floodplain wetland is an important natural area that provides additional protection for the internationally recognised ramsar listed mile lakes wetlands that are located downstream works began on the site in 2013 with a focus on water quality and threatened species protection fencing was placed around the outer areas of the conservation zone to prevent cattle from neighboring properties entering the site and weeding work and pest animal control was undertaken over 11 000 trees were planted on the site to help restore areas that had previously been cleared and to provide extra protection for the vegetation that was still in place the bullet dealer plane wetland is also home to the largest known described population of the endangered flora species lindernia dealer plane wetland is a great example of the need to protect high-value natural areas and prevent further degradation for the benefit of both human and planetary health located between the willama river and the ocean the darawing wetlands had been cleared for farming and extensive drainage networks installed and this soils work began on the thousand hectare property in the mid-1990s and focused on improving the water quality of the willama river and wallace lake system as well as restoring and conserving the significant coastal floodplain wetland area over 20 kilometers of drains were filled in to re-wet the landscape so that it more closely resembled the natural wetland features cattle were excluded from the site and regeneration was undertaken including the planting of thousands of native trees since work began the site has seen impressive regeneration and is now home to four endangered ecological communities and a number of threatened species the site also includes the darrow ink nature reserve and is a great example of the ability that natural areas have for rehabilitation dawson wetlands are located on either side of the dawson river in the taree township on the northern side of the river is a 45 hectare area that had previously been cleared for farming but from the 1990s onwards has been preserved for wildlife maintenance is still being undertaken on the site including extensive weeding works and today it is the southernmost site of the of the river the wetlands cover over 20 hectares and include two endangered ecological communities including swamp oak flood plain forest and coastal salt marsh restoration on this site included the removal of a heavy weed infestation including lantana madeira vine and morning glory today the area is a thriving biodiversity hotspot and home to animals such as the powerful owl and it became a refuge during the drought for many species including the kangaroo together these four major wetlands contain almost 3 000 hectares of protected and conserved natural areas in addition midcoast council looks after about 4 000 hectares of reserves which are managed and maintained each year to improve the biodiversity in our region protecting our wetlands involves our entire community and work at all of these sites could not have been undertaken without some important partnerships including government agencies local land care and coast care groups our indigenous community local land holders and community volunteers so this world wetlands day get out and enjoy your local wetlands national park or nature area and find out why it 's so important that we value manage

    "text": "[Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] what makes you australian first i can answer it first yeah i think that family makes what is what makes me australian i have lots of family here and lots of history here so i think that 's what cool makes me australian what about you um well i have dna planted into this country so um uh through aboriginal songline and uh generations and generations of aboriginal people before me being here um so i i i can 't help but feel australian naturally um on a on a social level um i feel australian because i 'm proud of the fact that we live in a place called australia it 's inclusive to me i love australia because it it has a bit of everything and i think um that 's one of our unique features to some other countries i guess well i think what makes me australian is i love a fair go yeah um i appreciate everybody um and i like different stories from all cultures and people well speaking as a migrant myself i think i feel australian just because i think it 's not a clearly defined culture but i feel like for me growing up it was about having just freedom and opportunity i 'm certainly proud to be australian i think it 's the inclusion of everyone is my favorite part what makes me australian yeah i think that 's a really good way to put it dennis and i think like that 's exactly it like to be australian in that term it should be inclusive and anyone should be able to identify as an australian i hope that what makes you australian can be accepting everyone giving everyone a fair go like you said how a lot of the indigenous population would define themselves is perhaps that connection to country so that can apply whether you 're indigenous or not if you feel that connection to this country i think you can feel australian i think that 's a good summary why do australians ask such personal questions when they do not know you very well or at all so i think that yeah australians are nosy but i also think they 're just inquisitive i of questions it 's interesting though when i was still in sydney i would i guess i 'd always ask a question and we 've discussed this before um what do you do for work whereas when i moved up to the coast it changed because no one really cares what you do for work up here it 's just like oh so who are you and where do you live i think people are very well intentioned it might be a bit abrupt at times but it 's just a way of getting to know you i don 't know if they would always do it to other people but down the street but i think it 's just they see you from another country and they they just want to know they are they are curious so i think it comes from a good place i don 't know if it always comes across um as politely as it might do i know that i find out a lot about someone within five minutes um that 's just me but i think a lot of people like that of forming i don 't know i guess bonds bonds with people and you can often yeah you can find connections too maybe australians are not as as worried about offending and it 's more more acceptable to explore and find out about other people and um maybe there 's no need to be offended and perhaps that 's the australian way i think it 's the australian way but i think not all cultures would do that so i guess maybe we don 't we don 't think of that i i agree with you uh we 're a pack of big dories and dory means like nosy sticky picks or like what 's going on sort of thing um because i 'm always doing it myself but um now we 're very curious uh very curious to know uh where you come from and who your family is um on an aboriginal level that 's the first question that you 're asking it 's um who 's your mob where you from what do i bring to a dinner party when tell not to take anything should i good question always always take my own beers um that way you know what you 're gonna have enough for yourself yeah i feel that myself when i 'm invited somewhere and they say oh don 't bring anything and then you feel terrible because you come empty-handed i went last week to a birthday party 75th birthday party no presents was made clear and i was the only one that didn 't have a present because i 'm obedient i don 't know about the later step where you always take favourites that 's what exactly what i was thinking or not the average office yeah no you should do it because you get too many of them at christmas you do yeah i 'd probably say yes you should take your own wine a beer and if you don 't drink take your orange juice or whatever yes okay and then you might leave some behind it put it in the stash leave it in my fridge what 's the best place to meet new people in this area germain again yeah you can i feel like maybe feel like we 've got a lot of like you know active people in the area um so that 's how i see because like you know there is pubs and clubs and all that sort of stuff but i think like as a young person who 's gone away and come back i think sometimes there 's not that many avenues for meeting young people um in the area so i find that a lot of people manage to do it by going to the gym yep yeah i agree with that there 's a lot of um we 've got a good sporting culture in the area so getting involved in sports or community activity is certainly a strong point for people i moved to the area 23 years ago picked it out on a map and knew nobody now know nearly everybody around the area but sport was certainly my first introduction to people and then having children going to different things around here as well we do have a problem we giggle too much yeah that 's right why do australians put pineapple or perry perry why do australians put pineapple or perry perry chicken sometimes together on peaches pizzas i don 't know because that 's a stupid idea it isn 't it is i don 't know what pericardium i don 't like pineapple in anything savoury that 's just a weird the 70s in the 70s before you were born no i 'm not that young my level came in and then we had that was really big and to have dinner party where you would have pineapple and cheese and things like that i like pineapple and they dress up pineapples like the whole pineapple yes to make it look like a mountain and things like that with mashed potato and devon now why do they do it oh they just copied somebody in the first place yeah that 's what australians do coffee especially other cultures yes yes that 's why we 're such a mixed bunch yeah [Music] why don 't parents live with their children when they 're old it 's just been the way it is i guess but i look at other cultures and and i do we like our space and our and we don 't want to feel our parents encroaching but i guess maybe as we age ourselves we might change our deer on that i don 't want to go to the age ground what happens in aboriginal communities is that the elders are taken care of so that so the old people actually live with the aboriginal families there is a reliance on on other services and other people providing for elder members of the family i think i think that i think i think um australians like to have space and i think the spoiled for space and i think that when yeah i think that and you know as families we encourage young people to go out and live in their you know go explore the world and go do their own thing and i think that um young people get used to that as well and they don 't want to have their parents living back we do have an aging population as as well we 've got we 've got more people um in their senior years than that that way of um the young looking after the old is not going to be as sustainable because i 've met a couple of people recently that are buying homes and planning for their parents to come back if they have to when they 're old or to have them come back and live so they might be getting a house with grilling flat or an extra space at the back so i think on the whole though most people and most parents probably don 't want to go back and live with their kids as well because they 've got that there at that point their life where they want to go and they want to travel and they want to do their own thing okay which australian slang words do i need to know um my wife hate this one wasn 't yet you were down the street there today wasn 't you [Laughter] yeah that 's a really good one um yeah i reckon i reckon and then also servo mackers yep avo salvo so let 's clear those up so survivor station yeah this afternoon yeah skewie what 's a skewey having a schooner large beer um yeah what else do we got always say so many yeah we say so manny why do you ask me what i 'm having or cooking for dinner oh that 's so easy for me because i 'm a terrible cook and i 'm always looking for ideas and inspiration you might hear an idea from someone like you say to your your workmate oh what are you going to have for dinner and they 'll go such and such that 's a good idea i might have that too i don 't think it 's just it 's casual conversation everybody has dinner so you can talk to anyone about what they 're having for dinner it doesn 't really matter maybe because we 're such a multicultural society as well and we can like we might be having mexican or thai or chinese or italian and we 've got so much choice whereas if you 're from a particular culture in a particular country you have a more restricted sort of she 's hit the name it with um being judged or a certain lifestyle but i think the question is not asked for any other reason than australians find food interesting you know the reason yeah you don 't want me to ask because you can answer because i don 't eat anything no she 's so fussy and if she says if she says please i 'll say [Laughter] okay what should i wear to bar or pubs around this area oh look um a pair of boardies and a t-shirt some thongs thongs and a singlet and stubbies no you go as you are okay i think that 's that is that is one of our better sides isn 't it i think that you don 't have to feel you 've got to have some decorum well some people just i 'm not suggesting a swimsuit nuts it 's all pretty relaxed and yeah and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere do you know that i was nearly tossed out of the hotel australia in sydney and sydney in about 19. oh just after you were born 1951. no no no no 66 18 [Music] you _"

    "text": "one of the main parts for uh things to happen with aboriginal languages is it 's in it 's imperative for our community consultation to actually go ahead and that consultation needs to be pretty transparent and involve all key stakeholders so as part of the process for the naming of the building yalawan yaganya the concept was given to me as a local language holder in tari or jari there are a number of language holders that are spread out over a a broad area or land region these three countries that the language is bound by is budape what am i and gurungay and the land boundary that that includes uh goes from the wilson river all the way to the foot of the great divide all the way down to the nelson bay so it 's quite a large extensive land region examples of words were given to the council to use so i gave them three choices and then they picked one of those and then i sent that off to the language group had it endorsed passed it got a staple of stamp of approval to the council and said we 're ready to roll and we 're ready to rock on the usage of the word in a in a cultural signage sense our ethos is we come from the land and the land owns us and because of that language came from the land itself so aboriginal language is not just language it holds knowledge within it when our language was taken away from us through engagement and colonisation we lost that connection to land reconnecting that data cable that was cut um so to speak uh took seven years of um many people from up and down the east coast from the three countries the the build up by one of my guru countries to actually create a dictionary so we can have it back it has reinvigorated the sense of culture and heritage with a lot of aboriginal people that are studying it and engaging in it and the knowledge within embedded within the language is um it 's empowering for anybody who actually learns it so the importance of our language being respected and acknowledged as an aboriginal part of to hold on to it i really ask for you all to respect our language because it 's a sensitive issue for us you know when we lost it so there are still sensitivities around the way that you need to consult with language so when it comes to consultation of language you can 't just go out and find a word in the dictionary and slap it up on the wall you need to actually consult with the local aboriginal language holders such as myself and jeremy saunders and ben saunders and other names to mention there 's many but that consultation with aboriginal people is really really important and and and respectful and it 's something i think we need to walk with respect and um you know and nyan jiren gary walk with pride together as well so um so if you do need to find out about guteng and how you can it can be used in the context of cultural signage yeah get in contact with one of the gatan language people or find out how you can and i know that the midcoast council to happen from now on as well so um most of the people there will be able to put you onto somebody that can help you out [Music] [Applause] [Music] _"

that very lengthy intro i wanted to introduce you to our special guest tonight tonight we 're joined by kim lock who 's in south australia and who 's booked the other side of beautiful has recently

pets coming out in september so welcome to both of you thank you so our first guest is internationally published author kim locke kim has published four novels her fiction explores what happens behind

chat box for us and we 'll get to them after she gives them gives us a bit of a spill about her own books along with her book recommendations lovely intro now i 'm told um i have the floor for about 15 minutes so i hope i can actually last that long um thank you very much to midcoast libraries for having me tonight i 'm really really thrilled to be here and it 's lovely to meet kelly so i 'm i 'm very excited um without further ado i will introduce you to the other side of beautiful um this is my fourth novel and it just came out last month so it 's been out for about four or five weeks now um and this is about a woman named mercy blaine who hasn 't left her house for two years until one night on the eve of her 36th birthday that house burns down so in the opening chapter uh mercy is standing on the street and there is trucks everywhere and there 's dogs barking and there 's emergency services personnel and her house is is in flames um through a suit but but as as we discover that 's not her biggest problem her biggest problem is that she hasn 't actually buys a very tiny and um rather shabby old camper van and goes on this very unwilling road trip from adelaide to darwin she has the company of her sausage dog who 's called wasabi um he 's sort of like her assistance dog and along the way she meets a lot of colorful characters uh gets herself into some fairly absurd scrapes and situations but ultimately what she 's looking to do is is find a sense of home within herself so that 's that 's the basic premise of this of this book um it 's a little bit funny it 's maybe a little bit um poignant uh it 's a little bit um a bit of a rump a bit um a bit sort of fast paced and and fun um but hopefully it 's just sort of an engaging story about getting out on the road and [Music] finding yourself maybe when a lot of us can 't get out on the road right now so it 's perhaps a way to travel vicariously so that 's that one definitely the perfect read when you of australia yeah with mercy yeah maybe get some scenery see a bit of red dust get a bit of red dust in your hair so the uh next novel i 'm going to talk about tonight is called you wish by leah weston i hope you can see that okay so this was um leah 's third novel and it was published in 2018 and this is a really clever funny entertaining story about a man named thomas lash who is something of a photoshop genius so much so that he 's kind of fallen into owning this company that creates um virtual alternative realities for people so perhaps if you want to win an oscar you can have the photographic evidence to prove it complete with red carpet dress and all of that kind of thing but what happens when reality starts to uh digital reality starts to kind of blow the lines with with real reality and and trouble starts to arise um it 's got a fantastic cast of supporting characters including um his mum who is a juice drinking wellness vlogger um he 's idiosyncratic it 's just it 's just a really entertaining very clever read and it 's probably perfect for right now if you 're looking for something really escapist uh really easy to read i would i would highly recommend this one it 's it 's a lot of fun so certainly look for that one i 'm keeping an eye on the time here so the next one i 'm going to talk to you about is called the breaking by emma gold this came out earlier this year um this is about a woman named hannah bird and she 's an aussie expat in thailand um and she gets swept into this sort of thrilling adventure uh story um when she she 's actually rescuing elephants who have been rescued from the tourism industry it 's really beautifully written it 's a very um sensory novel so you can really taste and smell and see and hear thailand so again it 's probably another perfect novel for now because overseas travel might be a sort of not happening for this foreseeable so this is this is a really great eye-opening a little bit about um elephant rescue i certainly learned things that i that i didn 't know um so yeah this is this is a really lovely read and i 'd i 'd highly recommend it the third one how we 're going fine you 're doing fantastic oh good thanks kanina i feel like i 'm just sort of sitting here talking to my computer so it 's good to know it 's good to know there 's people out there this is a memoir this um came out about five years ago this is by marie manchara and it 's called of ashes and rivers that run to the sea it 's a bit of a mouthful but marie was born in the 1960s and she was one of thousands of aboriginal children who were taken by the government and the catholic church and forcibly placed with white foster families she was taken when she was a toddler about three and she didn 't find out the truth about her identity until about 25 years later she was almost 30 and she just found a baptismal how she discovered the truth so this is a memoir that recounts her trauma of being a stolen child um and also the reunion with her mother uh 25 years later her mother lives on the tiwi islands north of darwin and so she actually flew up and and met her family it 's um it 's a really amazing story um it 's heartbreaking it 's beautiful it 's darkly funny uh marie 's writing is so good she 's you know she 's the sort of brighter i think we all wish we could be but um uh so yeah i would i would really recommend this as essential reading for everybody it 's a it 's a really wonderful really really wonderful story so that 's definitely worth reading and my last novel i think i 'm going fairly fast it 's right i 'm not going to hold you up my the last level i 'm going to oh good last novel i 'm going to share with you is called year of wonders by geraldine brooks and it is just one of my favorite books plague novel it 's a set in a small english village um when a bolt of cloth infected with the bubonic plague arrives in the village and they all get very sick and they have to quarantine so it 's either a really good read for right now or maybe should be avoided but um so it 's historical fiction um it 's about a woman named anna frith who is a minor coal miner 's widow and she becomes a kind of unlikely heroine she becomes the healer the midwife the herbalist she 's the woman who tries to keep order in the village when you know chaos and hysteria is ensuing it is beautifully written um it 's very educational um but it 's just it 's just a really really wonderful story you get a really good sense of time and and um geraldine brooks is obviously just a an incredibly talented author so um yes we 've got when the villagers turn from prayers to murderous witch hunting anna must confront the deaths of family members the disintegration of her community and the lure of illicit so yeah just one of my favorite novels it 's always on the top shelf and um yeah one to pick up if you 're interested in that kind of thing so i don 't know how how i 've gone there i 'm i 'm quite early i 've sort of raced through it so it 's fine they 'll be questions for you no doubt and um you 've given us a good range of styles of books different genres too yeah i work in different kinds of moods yeah i tried to pick a little bit of something different but obviously i 've picked a continuing theme of hopefully a bit of escapism and a bit of entertainment and maybe a bit of travel so yeah and i tried to pick maybe titles that um perhaps maybe people might not have heard of before because i i love discovering new books and new titles particularly if they 're if they 're older and they may have passed me by yeah that 's right it 's so easy for a great book to pass you by because there 't get to one for a long time mary louise said here year of wonders is a sensational novel i devoured it absolutely i would agree mary lou have you read that one too yes yeah i loved it i think it 's actually the the best of her writing others would argue it but i think it 's just such a well-structured novel and anything that has lure of illicit love in it is surely going to grab the audience i discovered a fascinating word in there um which uh in that novel which made me understand a bit more about um cakes this is going to sound strange you know the beast uh beasting cakes that you get um which are full of cream and almonds and and all of that and they 're delicious and rich and i always thought they were called bee stings and they are but their origin isn 't about bees or stings it actually has to do with the milk that it was made from which is the first milk from a cow whose um uh first milk you get after a milk and i found that word in um in uh year of wonders i mean good lord so there you go you 're eating it sorry my ramble no that 's funny for the cake because i don 't know about it and i like cake yes i 'll have to look it up um also keep there 's a lovely um note here from lee that says it was a gorgeous read she 's talking about your book the other side of beautiful it was a gorgeous read kim i loved it and i 'm recommending to friends oh thank you very much that 's lovely to hear i 'm so pleased i would like to know him what sparked the idea for the other side of beautiful oh that 's a fantastic question um sort of two things uh the first one was the character 's name i i had the name mercy bitter in my head for a long time um because i found her name actually um in a cemetery where i used to live um she was a very it was a historical grave she just love the name mercy bitter i did change her name to mercy blaine for the book because it 's maybe just a little bit more uplifting but the name was with me and then i 've wanted to write a road trip novel for years um so perhaps those two things coalesced i actually wrote the first draft of the novel in 2019 before covert had hit while we could all still travel so it was the timing was quite uncanny in that it turned out being about travel um but yeah that that 's sort of where it came from the the desire to write a road trip novel and her name and then it just sort of went from there so did you do the road trip yourself i have yeah i did it um when i was 20 or 19 so about 20 years ago i actually moved from mount gambier where i live now to darwin so it 's sort of very south to very north but i did the trip very fast um i was was with somebody else so i did it in a half thousand kilometers in three and a half days and it was incredible i just wanted to stop and and look at everything um it was amazing it really really stuck with me this beautiful um land and so i sort of promised myself that one day i was gonna go back and do the road trip again i haven 't had a chance to do it again so writing the novel was sort of um a way to a way to to do that myself and sort of pay some honor to that trip that i 've always wanted to do but but yeah so i have but a long time ago oh that 's lovely though yeah i 'm sure you 'll get there yeah yeah one day and then you can take photos of all the spots that mercy went to yeah i 'd really love to do that actually do her trip um obviously i won 't be in a van with a top speed of 75 like mercy is and hopefully i 'll be in a vehicle with some air conditioning um i 'll would love to do it maybe let 's cross fingers that it 'll be sooner rather than later yes you did throw a few elements at her didn 't you slow digital no air conditioning that 's right dog yeah not a lot of food not a lot of clothes not a lot of clean clothes no all right well thank you and uh we 'll we 'll keep moving but if you have any questions be sure to pop them in for kim and we 'll get back after kelly 's gone through hers and have a couple of writing questions for you both so thank you okay so now over to our second guest kelly hawkins who joins us tonight from newcastle currently in lockdown kelly is actually a local to the mid coast area and went to school in wingham is that right i hope it 's right yeah yeah wingham is where my uh second novel was just set i know i read that along with writing books for both adults and children kelly writes reports for a private investigator over the years she 's travelled been a political journalist a graphic designer a mystery shopper even a staple remover when she 's not writing she 's planning a holiday or dreaming of one or reading of course so once again if you have any questions be sure to pop them into um the chat for kelly and we 'll ask i 've already already can see here another uh very clever author julietta henderson that said absolutely loved other people 's houses that 's a nice way to hand over to you kelly it is thanks to julieta hers was great i loved it um yeah thanks for having me guys it 's um quite weird to to know it 's mid coast when i you guys are thankfully not in lockdown um and i haven 't been back to lingam for a while so it 's i won 't be going back for a little while unfortunately but um yeah so we 're in newcastle a bit locked down at the moment but coping so far so i 'll tell you about my book my um uh adult book came out in march this 's a it 's a psychological thriller um and it 's setting in sydney on the north shore of sydney um real estate is one of the main uh themes and i suppose so it 's a good spot um had to be said in sydney this book it 's about a woman in her 40s called kate who is uh she 's still grieving she 's she 's fairly she 's not coping very well she 's um the book starts on the 10th anniversary of her son 's death so she 's she 's um she 's borderline alcoholic she goes to open houses up and down the north shore and takes something from each house while she 's there like a memento and then she takes that and she keeps those um it 's her way of imagining i suppose um the life that she might have had um with her family who she doesn 't have anymore so it 's um that 's how it starts and then kate goes along to a house called the hiding house that 's locally known as that she adores perfect house she can imagine her family living there so she goes along and um while she 's at that house she sees a photo of three people there 's a kind looking man and a woman a beautiful woman who she knew from her university days and a boy and for a moment she believes that boy um is her own son he 's very similar of course he 's not um but uh she becomes obsessed with the hidings um and begins following them becomes involved in their lives and then we we work out um some she gets him too involved and we find the secrets and things that are going on in their lives so that 's this book um yeah very different from my other book my new book which is this one which i 'll just show you briefly it came i just got the final copy so i 'm very excited that just came in the mail this week so this is um the school for talking pets which is my middle grade novel um very different an adventure novel for kids it he 's australian and he has a pet blue tongue lizard called bongo and he wins a week at miss alice einstein 's school for talking pets on an island um of england so he goes off to this uh school for a week meets the other children it 's quite charlie the chocolate factory esque meets the other children but then some secret agents come to shut down the school um and he has to work with the other kids and all the talking animals too to save the school so there 's lots of fun animals in that one um that sounds super fun i think my kids would like that lots of talking puppies all that sort of stuff it was fun to write very different very different book so i 'll give you my recommendations i 've gone different to kim i 've gone with um i had too much trouble trying to go through things i 've read over the years it 's trying to choose four or three or four novels is hard so i 've gone with um i 've gone with some really enjoyed so the first one is michael robotham 's uh when you were when you are mine sorry which is great he 's one of my go-to authors really he doesn 't ever really put a foot wrong um as far as this sort of book goes and this one 's much the same um this was only really new i think i knew recently out and it 's a standalone book he does write quite a few series this one 's set in london and it 's about a woman in her twenties i think she is philomena phil and she 's a policewoman who became a policewoman after her uh after being on a bus that it was bombed by terrorists so i think that informed her decision as a child but on the flip side of that her father is a gangster quite a really wealthy and well-known gangster in london so she 's it 's a little bit about family i guess and you can 't how you can 't choose your family and then also she becomes involved um with a she it 's a domestic violence situation stands up for a young woman who is being abused by her policeman partner and gets herself in a lot of trouble trying to do the right thing so if there 's a lot of um there 's a it 's a lot of things of domestic violence in here um i think he handles them really well and he just writes in a really sort of straightforward way that really keeps you reading so it 's definitely a page tanner that one um yeah and i really enjoyed that one the this is actually a library book it 's got my my i can keep this for a while during lockdown so it was a two week one but it 's given me a bit longer so this one 's called falling by tj newman it 's an american book i do mostly read australian but a couple of the ones i 've chosen today are um overseas authors actually um this one the hook had me from the beginning as soon as i heard about this one i like i said i love travel going to want to read about it and this one has a really interesting hook i suppose for a thriller of a um a pilot he 's flying from l.a to new york and he needs to um he his family are kidnapped in the morning and he gets a message when he gets on the plane when they 're up in the air saying if he doesn 't um you know if he doesn 't crash the plane they 're going to kill his family so then we have the whole story about how he 's going to try and save the plane and save his family so the author is it 's a debut author um she was a flight attendant so it feels very real um certainly she seems to know what she 's talking about as far as all the processes and and all that 's quite interesting i think for someone like me who enjoys that sort of stuff and maybe a little unrealistic in some places but if you can overlook that it 's it 's one of those books you 'll read in put it down so that one um and i guess also in that one the characters are quite interesting um there 's a couple of interesting flight attendants and the bad guys are a little bit more nuanced maybe and then terrorists are often portrayed so it was interesting i found that one quite interesting next what i have on uh this one i think you 've had been carol on um your podcast before but this book was great it 's a new one um you had it coming and it 's she 's an irish australian i believe and she 's written a few books um this one is set in sydney and i liked it i guess in some ways i like books that are set locally is always great um this one is set similar to where mine was really so that was interesting for me um and it 's another one where it 's got great women female characters um two of them are suspects and victims at one point and the third one 's a police officer so you get a really good look um a paramedic meg who goes along to a uh shooting and that man who was shot was the defense barrister in um in the case where she was a rape victim uh along with her friend um many years before so uh so she obviously doesn 't feel a lot of sympathy for this man who defended the the people he raped her but um he dies and then uh obviously she 's a suspect and her friend says all sorts of suspects pop up but it 's it 's a really i think a realistic book of its type and it 's well written with really sensitive um portrayal of of the subject matter and i think the characters are really likable and and well done so it 's good to read they 're distinctive female characters which is um sometimes quite hard to do um i think she 's done a really good job um and i would yeah i would recommend that one it 's a good read another easy fast ring too and my fourth one i think this i don 't know if the sent me so it might not be the same as what 's on the shelves but it 's called girl a by abigail dean so she 's british and this is her debut novel as well um it 's it 's a pretty hard going novel in some ways it 's a psychological thriller as well and it 's about a woman who 's escaped from a house of horrors situation where her and her siblings were kept prisoner by her father and her mother to a lesser degree and she escapes when she 's young there are flashbacks and then we um basically what we start off with her as an adult um her mother dies her mother 's in prison for her role in the in the um in the whole situation and her mother leaves her the house the house of horrors so she has to deal with uh come to terms with what she 's you know what she 's been through um and we meet the siblings and their relationship it 's got its characters are quite unlikable some of them in this and i think partly that 's why but i think it 's beautifully written and really fred it 's hard to believe it 's a debut author i think it 's it 's very well written um but a lot a lot there 's a lot of fairly hard stuff to read about but again it 's not uh gratuitous um by any means but yeah the house of horror situation is it 's a fascinating i suppose thing to write about so there 's a lot yeah there 's a lot of interesting things in this one as well so this one is um probably the hardest going out of the four as far as subject matter but yeah i think it 's a great one this one so that 's my picks thanks so much kelly and yes we did have bear carol on before and what i love is that burr recommended your book sorry isn 't that a nice uh uh you know a nice supportive environment you obviously both like the same style which was great um when you were recommending falling it made me think just um the wife and the widow by christian white yeah yeah i just thought that 's a really great uh page to turn into but just i listened to a podcast with him saying um that the whole idea came from him uh thinking about a wife being at the airport waiting for her her husband to get off the plane and he doesn 't he never turns up and so it 's the whole mystery of what 's happened to her yeah she 's just in points are fascinating really aren 't they yeah yeah but i know that when burr was recommending yours she said um that it was a great premise which when i started listening to it on audio i thought wow that 's so true just that premise of going into other people 's houses and stealing the little memento and kind of yeah really stalkerish i like just walking past people 's houses at you know night time in the light rain you can see you know i should eat that online should i have it you can see see different things make up was it like we were buying houses and selling houses at the time or a house a house and it 's just it 's a fascinating thing like going to someone 's house that they let you in that you can look around and you know it 's just it 's quite amazing that we let people do that really and it is i think we all want to see other people 's lives and it 's a little bit of that and yeah that 's where it came from i think yeah how do these people live what yeah they look like what 's important then what 's on their walls and yeah yeah in their cupboards going through cupboards and analyzing what pictures they 're drawn yeah it was really clever um lee 's also said that she took other people 's houses and and also um entered last holiday by c l taylor on a recent holiday to bellingen um and she loved it so thank you that 's great thank you and kim 's also popped in that she 's gonna order um your talk uh do you balance writing both or psychological thrillers and then middle middle grade fiction i think i 'm still learning these are my first two books and so i guess before i had them published you can write whatever you want so i wrote i had the idea for um both books one i wrote the adobe i had the idea of the adult book and wrote it and then let it sit around and you know waited for a while and had the idea for the kids book and wrote it as well because i didn 't have any you don 't really have any uh i 've also written young adult that didn 't get published but you you just you write what you want before you published and then now that they 're published i 'm contracted to write another one of each so i 'm writing another adult and another kids and it is like it does do my head in sometimes you have to really i can 't_''_2099.04 do them both at once it 's quite hard because they 're very different but by the both and um the adult books are quite heavy or at least um you think about them quite differently whereas the kids one is just completely different so i like it 's great to be able to have that variety which is i think i 'm really lucky in that way yeah i 've listened to i can 't even remember who but i wasn 't_''_2128.24 that long ago i was listening to a podcast about an author that does write two different genres and and they were saying that they would do um one genre in the morning and the other in the afternoon but i did london even that would be quite close i couldn 't do that yeah i 've done one whole book and it 's being edited and then i 'll start on that kids book and do that and then i 'll have the edits back so it 's like i 'm only working on one i think about all the other books in my mind but i wouldn 't there 's no way i could write both at the same time yes so it 's another psychological thriller yeah yeah so would you say that when you are writing one of those um books what comes first for you with the story is it your characters or the setting or the complication um for me it 's always the characters i think um but the complication is really important the setting i think is yeah i mean they 're all they 're all important aren 't they but um probably the characters because i think you have to get those straight in your head before you can do anything else or before you can make the story do anything so probably characters but the complication is probably is important for the sort of thing i write but um again i 'm not as it 's not as big as it is for some writers who have that really good twist which i would really like to do a bigger sort of twist that you have to you know you it 's more complicated but yeah i think it depends on exactly where you sit with what you write yeah well yeah your genre how it all ties in yeah yeah but i i 've mentioned this before um because i 've struggled with uh endings of writing the ending of the manuscript i was working on and for all we have is now and i envied jane harper who said she starts with that ending and knows what that big twist is and then works for like works backwards which i think is very clever yeah i don 't think i 'm i have to know how it ends but not maybe everything in between but i have to have some idea or i think it 's too hard yeah so for both of you what 's your favorite part of the writing process kelly you can go first for me it 's the beginning and the end but the beginning particularly where you have the idea um and it 's really exciting and um and that 's all great and you really oh this is going to be a great book and then it just gets hard for a long time so that i don 't mind editing um especially when you can be good but yeah definitely the beginning when the idea is first new and tiny yeah how about you kim i 'd have to agree with kelly there i think the beginning there 's certainly a honeymoon period isn 't there when you get that spark of an idea and the character and you and you get that sort of maybe the first 20 to 30 000 words down i think there 's a yeah it 's definitely a kind of honeymoon period i think for me my favorite is is probably though by about maybe draft three or four i i actually find the first draft is um i have a love relationship with it it 's um i think i 've seen ann patchett say that um writing the first draft when you 're writing it you 'd rather be doing anything else but when you 're doing anything else all you want to do is get back to that get back to the writing that 's kind of how i feel um so i think rewrites are my favorite part when you can see that it it is in your head um because my first and second and potentially third drafts are nothing like what 's shining in my head um so i think once it starts to polish up is is my favorite part that 's when you get that real sense of accomplishment it 's it 's starting to look how you want it to oh wow the rewrites are definitely not my favorite um so kim you 've had four books published and there 's been a little bit of a time span so can you tell us how you like what your journey to publication was yeah okay so um my fourth novel which has just come out the other side of beautiful um is i think eight eight years my yeah my first novel came out in 2013. so um journey to publication well i was always a reader i was a very um bookish kid and and i was always writing but i very much i revered writing so much that i thought it was something that all these holier than now people did like it was art was something that i would do um publicly um so it sort of fell away when i was sort of wrote as a kid and all through my teens and then it fell away when i was in my 20s i think life got in the way um and then when i had my second baby when he was um and like an infant my um husband had long service leave so i had five months where i actually had another adult to help me out and and i decided to get back to writing fiction prior to that i 'd been blogging a little bit just about motherhood and things like that and i 'd also written a few articles for a parenting magazine they just put a call out and then they published my first article and then they came back to me and wanted some more so i sort of had that little bit of validation that people maybe wanted to read what i was writing but i really wanted to try a novel so i sort of gave that a go um and when i finished it i draw that 's it i 've done that now ticked that box but a few friends um convinced me to let them read it and they liked it and then it sort of a few more people wanted to read it and they liked it and i got encouraged to maybe explore publication and so i joined the essay writers center and had the manuscript assessed and i just kept waiting for somebody to pat me on the head and go okay you 're done now and nobody ever did so i i think i i was quite lucky that it went that way and then yeah it got picked up by a small press in adelaide and the rest is history [Laughter] you make it sound very such a very gentle and a surprising experience yeah that 's funny because it certainly yeah it didn 't feel gentle so many so many rejections it 's such a um i don 't know i don 't know it 's it 's amazing how you can keep going on so little confidence i don 't know what keeps you going sometimes will that 's what i felt in the end just wanted to be stubborn dig your heels in i 'm not giving up yeah that 's right it 's not going to defeat me go down kicking and screaming how about you kelly how did you get your um publication deal yeah mom 's long and complicated i think often um yeah i started writing when my kids were little as well um i was a journalist briefly and then a graphic designer and did lots of different vaguely writing jobs um and none as well and then had more time when my kids were young and i started writing i went to write kids books basically because a lot of the books they were reading were terrible um and ended up not doing ended up writing young adult um which didn 't get published but they were nice about it and so i did that and then i wrote i had the idea for the adult book um and i sent that off that idea and a short story off to the faber academy which is alan and onwards their thing we write writing a novel which is a six month course um and i won that scholarship for the idea and on the basis of the short story so that sort of i had to really write it then so i wrote it during that course which is and i 've never really been interested in writing adult books so it was i found it quite difficult and it has had a lot of edits the adult book um and then i put that away once that course was done and i finished it and wrote i had the idea for the kids book and i wrote that and then i sort of put them both away um edited a little bit um didn 't do a lot with them and then wasn 't long after that my husband got sick so he was diagnosed with terminal cancer so they gave him two months to live and he he did he lasted for eight um so i didn 't write it all during that time and the book sort of just sat there and then after he died yeah thank you so that was a really rough time and yeah so we took he was he was very sick and he was very unwell so it was a really traumatic time so the kids and i 've got teenagers now we i i took six months i said i 'm gonna give myself six months off work after he died just so we could all be together um but i thought well i 'll do one more thing and i 'll send these books out and see what happens um so i sent them to agents i 've had a few been on a few retreats and various things sent them to some people that were recommended to me um and one ended up picking it up melanie austell and she said she picked up my adult book and in the meantime i sent the kids book out to publishers myself because i don 't think she was really taking on kids books at that time um and it was a really weird thing so i think it was only four months after matt died that that melanie um and at the same time uh she she she helped me edit the adult book we um shocked it around and at the same time the kids book was people were interested in that a couple of the same publishers and it ended up that harper collins took the kids book and the adult book to the same acquisitions meeting the children and the adult publisher both took it along so it was really bizarre and we ended up getting a contract for two adult and two kids books through them which has worked out well because they can sort of coordinate um my schedule a little bit so i 'm not trying to i 'm not overlapping so yeah so it was very strange time so i got that i got that um deal and i 'm always asked you know how how exciting it must have been to get which it was but it was also like it was like six months after matt had died not even that i don 't think so it was a very strange time for me the whole block has been in the depths of grief yeah yeah and obviously that sort of thing takes a long time to get over but you know having said that um having this to concentrate on is a new sort of career has been really great um and really lucky for me so yeah it 's been it 's been two years now so it 's been an interesting two years since my dad yeah yeah well i 'm sure he 's very impressed with everything he 's doing and i that kind of puts um kate in your book is going through so much grief herself so was that nice to be able to release some of that within the page it actually was all written before so so i do get asked that a lot as well but it had like i 'd already written i actually did try to write the first thing i wrote after matt died was going to be a follow-up to the adult book and it was terrible like just i think apparently it happens quite a lot when you 're in that situation that you just flat and sad and not very good so i think i got that book out of me and um yeah but neither ca the grief that 's i 've written about is all before yeah before i had any any grief it was amazing that you were able to get into that grief before you actually had to experience it yeah yeah there 's lots of lovely comments here people are saying that it 's a very heartbreaking story and thank you for sharing with us and and you deserve all the success success after you know we 're walking such a tough road so there is lots of love on the chat for you people are very nice people are very nice i 've found yeah um well thank you for sharing and kim i 've got a lovely comment here from jazz saying that she chose your book the three of us for their book club group back in november of 2019 um and the book cover got her attention as did the fact um that the story was set in galla is that how you pronounce it story and generated a lot of discussion in our group as well as challenged our thinking and beliefs it was a great story and moved me in many parts oh thanks jazz um that 's really really lovely um it is a good book club book people are saying that actually because it 's got those um sort of challenging elements it 's a hard book to talk about actually without giving away the major uh the major spoiler which is is the main theme of the book um so yeah i 'm i 'm really really pleased that you picked it up and you enjoyed it is that the book with the um the washing line with the clothes yeah yeah yeah it is it 's lovely yeah yeah um all right better i better keep us moving along um because now i 've been chatting too much i 'm just going to pop in there a link to my newsletter in the chat um because the um i 've i 've been very lucky that i 've got both kelly and kim 's books um available for giveaway send you through the newsletter and you 're able to enter to join uh to enter either to win either book uh the win will be done tomorrow night wednesday night um after eight o 'clock so now it 's for my recommendation and i have to admit that i 've been terrible in terms of reading um the in the last month the only book that i have managed to read in hard copy is your book kim which i still haven 't finished and that 's not because of it it 's because i 've been trying to work on my book which i was very excited to be able to type the words the end last week yeah congratulations that 's so exciting maybe that that 's the best part of writing again another author actually commented and said that she 's never written the end then she 's going to try it so now you 've got to do it i mean they 'll take it out but you 've got to do it um so i yeah i 've been i 've been really busy know when you know the end so close you keep thinking it 's so close and it just keeps stretching out that finish line um so now i 'm in the midst of reading back through and and uh yeah doing lots of scrolling crossing things out um so i 've decided to go with a book that i read quite a long time ago quite a few years ago um but one that 's been recently adapted to film and no doubt been attracting a little bit of attention with so many people stuck in lockdown and with netflix in front of them yes so the book that i 'm going to talk about is the last letter from your lover by jojo moyes um and i 'm going to be quite clear here and say that this is not going to be a book for everyone um chris you are not going to like this so don 't reserve it at the library um but if you 're if you like a bit of a sucky romance like i do maybe you should check it out so this by um the best-selling author jojo moyes and moyes has written 15 books including her some of her biggest hits are me before you after you and most recently the giver of stars so if you if you have enjoyed a book by this author be sure to pop them into the chat so you can share what other titles that you 've enjoyed so this one the last letter from your lover is told in jewel timelines so essentially it 's two separate but connected love stories that are set decades apart so in the current day you have ellie who 's an upcoming journalist looking for a story and she discovers a letter from 1960 written by a man asking his lover to leave her husband ellie who is romantically caught up with a married man herself is immediately intrigued by the past affair and then in 1960 you 've got jennifer wakes up in hospital after a car accident she can 't remember anything her she can 't remember anything her husband her friends or who she used to be but once she 's um back home lover that she was willing to risk everything for so ellie and jennifer 's stories of passion adultery and loss around together in a pretty emotional novel so it has been some time since i 've read the story so i must say that i can 't remember the ins and outs of it but i do know that i really enjoyed it i was intrigued by the mystery of the letters and i really wanted to know what had happened to the couple back in the 1960s storyline and the romance was lots of fun um so the movie adaption adaptations so it can be found on netflix and stars felicity jones and shailene woodley and apparently it 's been 10 years in the making but please do reach for the book before you reach for the remote because i can assure you that the book is definitely better i generally always say that but in terms of the movie adaptation there are notable notable differences between the book and the film one is the romantic storyline for ellie the modern day character in the book she 's having they 've changed that um and her brand genugo is a a brand new character that they 've brought in um he 's single and works at the same publication that she does so there are vast differences in their both the book and the film and the film obviously offers a lot more of a polished hollywood ending so essentially the spirit of the novel stays the same and i must say that well i didn 't love the movie i did enjoy it um it 's good it 's a good romantic flick to snuggle under a blanket with um but as i always say be sure to check the book out first um and we 've got kim yep you really liked the giver of stars i haven 't read that one but it 's been sitting here sitting on my bookcase back there um lee said netflix did well you liked lee that 's good i was a bit judgmental but um i just think i really enjoyed the books and i 'm just so much when i love the book i feel like they miss little bit let down um so i 'll hand over to chris and then i 'll if there 's any more questions i 'll pop over to them before we um exit for the night so chris what do you have to recommend for us tonight well thank you canada and i wanted to say a big thank you for the 13th um 13th session that uh you 've hosted so admirably so it 's been fantastic always keep it rolling along so that 's brilliant and can condolences carefully really really conducts one of the uh i i think you 're the first um author that we 've had that has a rolling skate roller skate in the back of the there um that is really cool is that yours yeah yeah i had to sit in front of it got to put some something exciting behind me oh goodness um and uh it 's interesting when you said the end um my favorite author of all time is terry pratchett um who um sadly passed away um younger than he should have done and one of the most when he knew he was dying and it 's the one and only novel which he finished with the end so really powerful sort of um yeah it 's very sad um though he wrote wonderfully humorous works my novel is and it 's mine are often older ones uh at least they 've done the journey because they 're usually my one read for the month and then my book club read so i 'm reading or have read for the second time actually the reader so the reader by bernard schlink is i know that when you spoke about settings characters and complications the reader has them all so the reader is set in uh post um [Music] hitler 's um berlin in post germany after the second world war it features a character michael young i think he 's about 15 and uh an older woman that he ends up in a relationship with by the name of hannah and hannah 's quite a um an unusual character and sort of riddled with mood changes but she 's a good relationship there it 's a strange one not a woman so that 's part of the connectivity but of course that setting and um and maybe all of you read the reader so i won 't_''_3417.2 i won 't give away too much in the space but um it does go back into the darkness of the nazis and the characters are involved in that space and that 's where the complications begin the uh and it 's a very interesting exploration of what uh what challenged people post in germany the the um the horror of nazi germany and how the younger people tended to almost try and purge um their parents generation out there was a fervor to kind of cleanse and um but the michael character in it is um he sees it 's a lot more complicated as well it 's a very um challenging in many ways novel but very readable and i double club which meets on thursday i 'd happily recommend i 'm sure the library will have copies of it the reader by bernard schlink thanks kameen thanks so much chris it 's funny because i uh also in that i don 't think know that i 've read any of the books that your book club have read and we 've read over 60 titles in the last five years so that 's showing how many uh what a wide range the midcoast libraries does have they 've got lots and lots and lots of sets of book club books which is great something to suit everyone exactly so i 've got a question kelly from narelle that says will your next children 's novel be about animals so is it a follow-up kelly um it 's not a follow-up that it is sort of set up to be a sequel but well um i 'm actually doing something completely different it 's to be called bird brain but having said that there 's not really a lot of animals in it um there is a bird but now it 's more about an adventure this one set in europe in a made-up country um about an australian girl who goes over there and she becomes a princess but it 's it 's not really about princessy things more about children than animals oh lovely jazz also wants to know would you please explain your staple removing job to us it 's exactly what it sounds like it was just for a um it was just for a company that that was in data um they were putting documents online so you had to remove all the staples from documents so they could then be scanned and saved um digitally so it was a job it wasn 't a very high paid job or anything but i do quite like jobs where i can think and i don 't have to concentrate so it was great for that so it 's great for this your hands are busy but your mind can think about other things so yeah it actually was literally with stable removers removing staples oh you did have a proper staple yeah yeah yeah i just wanted to make sure we had appropriate we 'd actually wear them out after a while um a marie says a hot pink roller skate is a novel accessory on a bookcase that looks right at home so thank um coming along each month and listening to us chat about books susan said just watch the underground railway on netflix as it 's our book club book of the month book was definitely book definitely better yeah it 's very odd i think if the movie is better we 're reading it for our book club this month oh thank you i 'll be interested to hear what susan 's book club have to say i think it 's a pretty damn good book actually so mari or marie sorry if i 've pronounced that wrong says 84 book clubs at midcoast libraries i thought we had more than that um but i must be wrong 84 is pretty good um so yes that 's i don 't think if we 've got any final questions be quick to pop them through um but yeah thank you for everyone that 's joined us and um all the books that have been mentioned by kim kelly chris and myself are all available on the midcoast libraries catalogue um alternatively if you are wanting to purchase any we encourage you contact lockdown um and that have had a really tough slog our look for anyone that is local to us be sure to head to the sitting wombat out at foster we hope

how much you loved him last time so we 've brought back our friend dwayne from midcoast council hello dwayne welcome back hello corey hello guys how are you now today dwayne we 're talking about pitch and volume how we express ourselves through our voice do you use your voice think we all have maybe even without knowing it so we 're going to bring back our three emotions that we had last time which were happiness sadness and grumpiness and we 're going to look at pitch and tone where it comes from in our body and how we can express those different emotions let 's start with happiness shall we yeah so when we 're happy we often talk quite high in pitch would you say that was right dwight yeah yeah yeah that 's definitely right when dwayne has a very deep voice so it can sound different for different people but when we 're happy we tend to talk really high show us dwayne i 'm very excited where can we feel that coming from in our bodies can you feel it on your throat let 's try it again ready dwayne yep i 'm very i 'm very sorry yeah you can feel it there can 't you and it feels like it 's always busting around your face now let 's talk happy but in a very low tone i 'm very happy i happy it doesn 't quite feel right does it so we know that when we 're happy we tend to talk higher in pitch isn 't that right yeah now another thing that happens when we 're happy we often talk a lot louder than we know we are isn 't that right dwayne yes say that you 're happy again and show us the volume i am so happy see see how loud he was isn 't that exciting now let 's try doing it very quietly ready i am so happy it doesn 't sound right so we know often when we 're expressing happiness we talk in a high pitch high pitch with a loud voice isn 't that fascinating yeah all right let 's try saying i am happy all together with high pitch and a loud voice ready you do it with us ready yep i 'm happy well done i bet you did brilliantly at home didn 't they dwayne yeah i 'm sure they did absolutely yes all right now who remembers our second emotion what was it sad sad all right twain oh wasn 't that interesting what changed let 's try saying i 'm sad in a high pitch ready i am sad that doesn 't feel right does it let 's try saying low i want you to imagine put your hands on your tummy and feel it coming right from the pit of your tom tom ready i 'm sad that felt right didn 't it yeah when we felt sad in the past it comes from a very low place so when we 're sad we express it using a low pitch yeah all right now dane can you say it again but can you say it really loudly i am sad oh that doesn 't sound right that doesn 't feel right does it no let 's try it again but let 's try it nice and soft using a low volume ready i 'm sad that felt right didn 't it okay so when we 're expressing sadness in our characters or at home we 're gonna use low pitch from our tummy and a quiet voice ready let 's all do it together join in sad wow well done what brilliant actors we are let 's give us a little wheel we get back into our happy place all right so our last emotion was grumpy grumpy okay dwayne can you please say i am grumpy but in a really high pitch for me i am grumpy that doesn 't sound right does it all right let 's try with a really low pitched wing i am grumpy oh no that doesn 't sound right either maybe we should try in the middle in the middle in the middle yeah i am grumpy that sounded about right didn 't it so when we 're expressing our grumpiness and we 're using pitch we don 't use a high pitch or a low pitch we use a pitch that 's in the middle how cool is that alright let 's try it with volume now dwayne can you please say i 'm grumpy but really really loud i am grumpy oh that 's almost a bit scary isn 't it that 's not the best way to express our emotions let 's try it really really 't feel ready that does it no it feels a bit off let 's try it using a medium volume just like we 're speaking now yeah ready we 'll try it together all right i 'm grumpy wow that felt right didn 't it it did it 's nice and it gets our emotions across all right let 's try it all together join in at home ready we 're going to say it with a medium tone and medium volume and medium pitch you ready i am grumpy wow amazing good work everyone all right let 's remember how happy we are and how much fun we 're having and drama okay well we 've learnt today that when we 're expressing happiness we have a high pitch and a loud voice yeah isn 't that right yes we 've learned that when we 're sad we use a quiet yeah quiet volume and a low pitch and the last emotion when we 're grumpy we 're going to use a medium pitch and medium volume isn 't that right wayne yes all righty well let 's say you thank you guys bye i hope you 've had fun today i know why i certainly did and i 'm sure dwayne did too we 'll be releasing some more of these videos so mums dads grandparents or anyone who likes to get creative make sure you follow the midcoast libraries facebook page or if you 'd like some more stories and songs come on down to our midcoast libraries branches and talk to one of our friendly librarians this has been brought to you by midcoast council we 'll see you next time bye-bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] _"

    "text": "this is the information session on housing id which is a new module in our toolkit and i would like to introduce glenn capuano from id who is the expert in this field and he 's going to give us an overview thanks glenn thank you lindy uh thanks for coming along to the housing session housing id uh is the newest information tool that we have and that mid midcoast has from id something that 's developed over time we 've actually been doing work in the housing area for about 20 years but only housing id has only been around as a online tool for about two years we have 18 subscribers around australia to this one which obviously we 've got over 200 to the community profile but it 's more of a specialist tool with a lot of information on housing supply demand and affordability so it actually grew out of a bit of consulting work that we did in a number of places about supply and demand of housing so how councils could increase their housing supply without over-developing suburban areas for example without uh orientated developments and activity centers and that sort of thing and we also looked at who lives in what type of drones what type of housing would be in demand housing id as an online tool has developed more into an affordability tool the other parts are still in there but most of our clients are mainly interested in the affordability section where we actually monitor in six month intervals how affordable housing is who can afford to to live in your area basically based on actual rents and housing prices so i 'll go through that with you today okay so this is housing id uh it 's a little bit different to our other tools uh in that it 's actually built on a different platform originally it looked very different we 've tried to make it look a bit more like the community profile and social atmos now with a left-hand menu and menus that expand to sub-categories and uh it is a little bit different in that we have a dashboard on the home page which we don 't really have much on the other tools will notice some differences for the other tools uh but the idea is that it 's a dashboard it 's a little bit of a divergence from what we 've done before uh in the way that we set it up is really to uh to go to step you through story of housing in your area and to highlight some of the most important characteristics of that um with in the form of text charts and a few maps as well so housing is made up predominantly it 's made up of five menu items here but it 's really in three components housing demand housing supply and housing affordability so we 've actually break that into five housing demand is a bit of scene setting so it 's what uh what your population look like looks like and therefore what type of housing they are likely to be needing housing supplies what type of housing there actually is in the area now and how that 's changing with building approvals housing consumption joins the two together and says what type of dwellings are occupied by which household types and incomes which directly compare the housing prices rents and the the incomes and affordability and availability which looks at housing stress and how many dwellings are affordable to particular income groups and that 's probably the key part but i will go through the others first we sort of end on that on the the main home page there you can see right front center need for affordable housing and that is our estimate based on census uh housing stress rental stress how many households are in immediate need of affordable housing because they don 't have access to that at the moment that 's only the people that live in the area we 'll go through that in a bit more detail you can click on these and they take you through to the the detail there which is right now in there in the affordability availability page we 'll come back to that comparison of prices and and rentals we have benchmarking on the site we only have the regional new south wales benchmark so all of the calculations are done compared to regional new south wales to the regional new south wales price uh but the units both to buy and rent are a little bit lower and that said december 2020. so this is not census data this is from our partners prop track who are based uh as part of the rea group they do realestate.com and they scrape all the listings basically from there and look at what things are actually sold and rented for in particular time periods and that 's uh medians over a quarter and then we 've got some background information household size population uh dominant dwelling type and and then of course the number of affordable rentals and affordable sales which is updated every six months on there as well so what we actually mean by affordable i 'll get to that shortly let 's have a look at some of these uh i 'll go fairly quickly through housing demand because most of this is actually replicating what 's on the uh the other sites the um particular community profile and forecast so you can see the forecast there where 's your population tracking what 's your so well it 's uh not taking into account the recent influx from sydney uh which we think is a bit higher what we do know though is that midcoast is a an area with an older population in fact the second oldest in the state of new south wales uh most of the population there are aged between about 55 and 75 that 's the the key group which is neatly fixing the baby boomer cohort one-third of all population baby boomers by the standard definition of that and the increase in population in the last five years this is not census this is estimated resident population five year increase predominantly in those older groups up to 2019 we 'll get 20 20 update on that age group stuff very soon actually in the next couple of weeks which will add into here so you 'll be able to see whether they whether you are getting more families moving in but the age profile still at the moment shows quite an elderly population and because of that the household types heavy on couples and loan person households not so particular chart doesn 't break out the one parent family but we saw on the profile that one parent families are pretty important as well export options on these charts a little bit different you do have the copy to clipboard and the download options just to put that into a into an image file one thing on housing id at the moment we don 't have a data export function you can request the chart data which basically means someone at id is going to go in and send that to you manually if you do want the data we do have the data that 's behind that but it 's um it 's a on request service at the moment uh how are households forecast to change what you can see there is minimal change expected in families a bit more by 2036 and i think that 's when that women area is coming into fruition but the biggest increases are in the lone persons and couples and this can sort of impact on the type of housing that is likely to be needed in the future is households particularly maybe maybe not so much smaller house housing but smaller blocks perhaps that sort of thing uh because you 've got the increase in the smaller household types on there and then they 're dominant tenure types as we saw uh in the previous session not a great deal of rental uh uh social rental there 's some we saw there 's some pockets there particularly atari uh but less than the regional new south wales average and full home ownership is the dominant household type overall with all of those retirees but there 's a fair bit of private rental as well so that is also important how has tenure changed social and affordable how that 's not right um sorry i think those numbers are incorrect i think that 's just a total that 's showing total increase that 's a an error and i will get that fixed up uh all right so uh that 's the housing demand section uh the housing supply then looks at what type of dwellings are the dominant housing in the area you can see separate house medium density 's a bit of medium density uh and it has increased oh it hasn 't actually it 's been pretty flat even the medium density so most of the change has been in the separate house category between 2006 and 16. the mix of housing when you break that up so we then go a bit further than we do on the other tools and break up the type of housing separate house medium density and high density by the size of housing in there so how many one two three and four bedroom houses are there and the thing is for separate houses we group together zero to two bedrooms because not many one bedrooms uh separate houses uh and the medium density we grip together the three plus because there 's not many four bedroom medium densities so but that 's sort of a small medium and large format housing what 's the mix of housing there and how 's it changing you can see the increase so it 's three bedroom separate houses is dominant but the increase is almost entirely in that five-year period in the in the three-bedroom [Music] medium density but really it 's four plus bedroom separate houses that are on the increase for the most part so if you think about the expected household types of age structure that 's kind of a mismatch there with the large houses small household types on the increase the building approvals we 've got quarterly place of building approval so you can see exactly where the building approvals have gone in for any combination of quarters through to um through to march 2021 which is the latest that we 've got there so it 's quite recent so if you want to look at just the last year 's worth you can see where those dwellings have gone in a few improvements to this chart with this map which i 'm hoping to to get in there is an opacity slider so you can see what 's underneath um the moment it just covers that up sort of thing but um and potentially in future the option to overlay council zones or expected release areas or anything like that so you can see whether the see the specific places and how many building approvals have been in each of those for the uh the given time period and that 's the default is the full time period since the census september 2016 to march 2021 total of 1789 mappable building approvals in that time period you can see exactly where all of those are uh and then we have a chart that looks at your completions versus approval so how many of those drawings have been completed pretty even there so so what that 's saying is that in midcoast most dwellings that get approved get completed within a year so there 's not a lot of lag in that and there 's not a lot of approvals that don 't get completed or a lot of completions without there being corresponding approvals going forward which can be an indicator of a economic downturn as well so that 's the housing supply so what type of dwellings are there where are they going in and how how 's the completion of tracking against the approval housing consumption brings that together and looks at who lives person and couples without children are really the dominant household types in your area what you can see is that lone persons do significantly live in medium density dwellings couples really don 't couples almost entirely live in separate houses alongside families there which are a smaller household type the number of people per dwelling we saw already that midcoast total number of people per dwelling is is pretty small so average household size is 2.24 which is about 4 of a person less than the regional new south wales average but what you can actually see is when you break this down by bedroom size the difference is all in the larger number of bedrooms so basically you 've got small households occupying three and four bedroom houses but you 've got about the same size uh households occupying the one and two bedroom households as a crossroads or new south wales so basically you 've got what this is showing is you 've really got quite a lot of couples without children if we select that household type of further analysis couples without children disproportionately occupying three and separate houses category over time uh and then when we look at where that is uh couples without children for the most part almost all areas except maybe tonkari there are living in the separate houses the one that the one group that does live in medium density and probably because of the medium density will include retirement villages uh the um the lone person households and you can see in places like uh foster tongue curry tari and old bar that they are actually occupying medium density housing so if you build that sort of housing it seems like lone persons are more likely to to live in that but uh there 's not much evidence of any other household type living in the um in the medium density housing types what about one parent family so one family is largely increasing in the four bedroom separate houses that 's mainly in separate houses overall so that is broken down by your small areas in there and so you can see just be aware we do call this we have a tendency to call this revealed preference but it that 's the type of housing that 's available so lone person household occupying medium density only because that 's what 's available in retirement villages but the idea is that you can monitor and it 's predominantly census data in this one but uh you can see who what type of households do living what type of drillings and where on the housing consumption page the rest of the site prices and incomes and affordability availability is getting to the core of how affordable is housing in the area so if we go into prices and incomes what is the mix of incomes the um [Music] households in income brackets so this is from 2016. you have a look at the data notes we probably need to define what these are these these very low low moderate ranges are really important in terms of the availability so new south wales and victorian governments have both signed up to measures of housing affordability that are based on set income ranges we adjust these every year these are the census ones but the uh data notes there show households that are of the regional new south wales or greater sydney media council in your case it 's regional new south wales very low incomes less than 50 percent incomes 50 to 80 percent and moderate income is up to 120 percent of households uh the median for regional new south wales so what that shows is that at last at the last census midcoast which we already know is the overall disadvantaged area had a much higher proportion than regional new south wales in the very low and low categories similar proportion in the moderate category and a much lower proportion of the high and very high category and these ones very low low and moderate other ones that we care about as far as providing affordable housing you can also see how household incomes change while this is a fairly boring chart which i greatly like but it is it does show an increasing gap in that mid coast council over the last 10 years census at least was the incomes were were increasing at a lower rate than the regional new south wales average so that 's incomes and track they get this data they get it 's a complete list of all sales and rentals for six monthly periods we we determine the medians for a quarter and you can get we get an update every six months and we do uh do quarterly uh income and sorry or quarterly house prices so you can see for any quarterback to 2016 there uh what the medians were for uh entry level for houses and units we also show you not just the medians we show you the entry level at upper level that 's the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile that 's in the data notes there so entry level the idea particularly for house sales is that this is what you 'd be needing to get a foothold in the market just to get in 25th percentile bottom quarter and the upper level is the level you 'll be looking at to potentially upgrade your housing within the same area so the interesting thing for for mid coast is although median is very close to the regional new south wales average the entry level the the the market is now above the regional new south wales average for that and that 's telling not so much for units but we already saw it 's predominantly a separate house area it 's a uh we already saw that so the unit is probably less important there and then how 's it changed well the house prices have just gone ballistic in the last year you see one year growth of 14.8 percent point nine percent per unit so it 's a huge increase and consistently um it 's a much lower rate over five years but three years now six point three percent per hour so really strong house price growth and that 's pushing the entry level now over the regional average for the state uh similarly for rentals sorry um i 'm just interested i know that we can benchmark that against regional new south wales but are you noticing that same trend in other states in in regional areas particularly in new south wales and victoria uh haven 't got enough data for queensland we don 't have enough clients in there not in much the the biggest one actually is in victoria if you go and have a look at the bass coast uh housing id site uh they 've had like a 50 increase in a year it 's just crazy and their affordability has just gone through the floor that 's incredible um but similar similar sort of sea change location that 's supposed to be closer to melbourne than it is than um the um yes it 's very much so regional particularly coastal locations really having this big increase in house prices you don 't see quite as much in the rents i don 't think the rents have caught up yet still still pretty strong increase in the rents over a year there not quite to the magnitude of the housing prices so that 's the again you can do that for quarters so the the change one which is showing one three and five years doesn 't doesn 't change but the actual amounts you can see the dollar amounts that it was there so if you go back to 2016 your entry level for a uh is pretty close to what the census said but if you go to december 2020 it 's gone up to 350. just that 's the entry level that 's the amount that you need just to get into the market but um probably more importantly over that time uh it was below the average for regional new south wales and now it 's above so it 's changed quite a bit in in that time we 're getting we 'll be getting the september quarter sorry that will be getting the june and march quarters from 2021 in september um which will update on the site so it 'll be quite a quite a big one you can also just map that in terms of change between the current time period and i selected earlier year so you can see how much they 've changed in that that time period as well so it really gives you a handle on the rent and if you want that at the small area level you can see that on the affordability and availability changing so if you go on to the how do it the median calculation only not the entry level but we do the median calculation for each of your small areas for the selected time period so you can get that that 's only in six month intervals there for the small areas but you can get that for each time period where it 's gap will be calculated sometimes there 's not enough sale or rentals in that time period you can see that on there so the idea with the affordability and availability page we 're actually shortly going to split this page into two we 're going to have a housing stress page and an availability of affordable housing page it 's kind of mixed up at the moment and i can see why it was done they sort of did let 's look at house purchase and everything and to do with that in one go and then let 's look at availability at rental but the um availability is going to be separate because i think that 's the way we normally go through the site so it is going to be changed the will still be there we 're just going to make a separate page for it so the idea is 2016 census and when we do the 2021 census will enable us to look at in detail a lot of information on housing stress housing stress is defined as people in those lower to moderate income brackets spending more than 30 of their household income on rentable mortgage what you can see there is that rental stress is far more of an issue in mid coast than mortgage stress it 's more than twice as large a population that we 're in rental stress as in mortgage stress of the mortgage stress you can see though that as a percentage of those with a mortgage it 's much higher than the regional new south wales average it 's almost all in the very low income category well sorry it 's actually quite neat to split as a percentage it 's uh very low in low incomes and then you can see by the sa2 so these are those same ones we use for the job seeker numbers the sa2 is where now just remember that that is 2016 census information we then if you go down to the renting whereas rental stress fell on here you can say that rental stress is the big problem there so 46 of all dwellings at the last census that were rented were in rental stress that means that they 're very low low or moderate income and they 're paying more than 30 percent of that income on their rental and very low income rental stresses uh is a significant amount but also low and moderate income where is that it 's in those lower socioeconomic areas it 's like like tari but one thing you do notice is the atari is there if you go remember if you you can see them all on the list here if you go down here tary 47 percent it is high it 's definitely higher it 's the highest in raw number if you sort that you can see that there but as a percentage foster and ton curry are actually higher what you may be seeing there actually put that very low income one on stress basically if you 're on that in that less than 50 you 're in your renting you 're in rental stress um so you can see their foster time carry comes up as a higher rate of the lower to moderate income rental stress and that 's probably because they don 't have as much of that social housing as what there is in terry which is supposed to be pegged to income so you shouldn 't be in rental stress if you 're in the uh in the very low income category although some may creep into that in the uh in the census because the incomes are collected in ranges but you can see that atari has got a bit it 's got more in that very low income range but it 's uh in the low income categories more in foster and tinkering that 's for the rentals and then if we we go into the next section we look at what we call the availability metric now this is what is updated this is what is uh we get every six months so as well the actual number of sales and rentals we can actually calculate how many actual sales and how many rentals were affordable to those income ranges in each time period so what we do we estimate the affordability ranges by rental for each of those income groups so we take the income groups we inflation adjust them each year from the census and we look at what would be 30 of that income and how many rentals were affordable to that group in that time period so you can see there we do that separately in each of the each of the years and you can see over here how many of those rental listings were affordable we also do it for different household types so the the state government uh says if you 're a couple without children these are your income ranges to be considered low and moderate income that 's different for a loan person it 's different for a family with children so low income families with children can afford more just because low income is defined as a higher level of income in your in that that 's uh that 's affordable if you 're on a low income there for the lone person households what we are looking at adding in which i think will be very useful is what of those listings what the bedroom size is for those ones so it 's all very well to say that families with children can afford 60 on low incomes can afford 68 of all of the rentals but if those are all one bedroom units that 's not going to help them very much so that 's our next initiative on on here is to add a bedroom breakdown to that that affordability calculation but even if we just stick with average all households you can look at how affordability has changed over time so on the rental listings you can see here december 2020. if we just go back a year so just have a look at that one so 27 of rental listings were affordable to an average household on low incomes in december 2020. you can see already from that compared to the previous period it 's down by 108 rental listings 's that 's a lot different we always compare that to june 2020 which is the previous uh time period go back to june 2016 it was 31.3 december 27 is about 30 33 so it 's hovered around the same level around about that 30 to 35 mark affordable to low incomes rental until december 2019 and then in the last year it 's fallen dramatically and i think that is a pandemic effect that is because we are getting people moving out of sydney and pushing up those uh those prices so so low income affordability is much down because the prices the rentals are up so you can see that very clearly in there you can do that there 's a lot of data notes in there about how that 's that that 's calculated that 's showing the old one it 's probably worth mentioning that this is a relatively new tool from id so it 's continuing to change as um as they tweak it and find new ways of explaining things we 've uh we 've done a lot of changes since even since uh yeah and we continue to change and improve that obviously we 'll load in the 2021 census data when we can but there 's other things that are going on as well particularly this affordability section we 're trying to make that as useful as possible if we go back up to the the mortgage section you can see the same calculations for how much people could afford uh on those income levels for a mortgage have a look at this low income one when i go back just a year there so that 's gone up quite a lot there for the mortgage and that 's been more continuous so if i go back five years there was more affordable remember these incomes are inflation adjusted so that 's not just saying that houses were cheaper but the the incomes have been adjusted to that year as well so it 's what was affordable to the incomes in that year uh for the regional new south wales averages so we 're at a record low of affordability for sales for sales it is a little bit different and have to assume that they 're a first home buyer basically because obviously you 've got a lot of people retiring into the area they 'll be probably selling up in sydney and buying in midcoast so it 's not going to affect them so much uh so we 're assuming that you 're a first home buyer that you 've got a 20 deposit and we 're we have to assume an interest rate for this as well which is uh probably even there a little we 've reduced the interest rate recently that we use for this and that makes it appear more affordable than what what it is what it was but uh even that does look high compared to what many people are paying on interest rates at the moment but it 's apparently the standard variable rate so well you can see that in there so what what 's affordable to those based on the assumptions that you 're a first home buyer with a 20 deposit basically you can see the low very low low of moderate income and then you 've got that affordable sales are to the different income ranges so if you go to the low income ranges for december 2020 this is how many sales in each of these areas were affordable and this is the median house and unit price in those areas as well so gloucester 33 affordable sales that 's not bad that 's affordable to low incomes just make sure you check which income level you 're using for these we had it originally defaulting to very low but there 's almost nothing it 's affordable so very low so we actually defaulted to moderate but i 've actually found low income probably the one that you 're going to be most interested in these are less than 80 of median so your affordable sales they 're mostly double digits but re there 36 142 sales were affordable you can see the median price in tari relatively lower than just about anywhere else there but if we go back and we look at say december 2016 four years before you can see that tari had 278 affordable sales to the income ranges that that existed in been so little wage growth in the last five years they 're not much different but you can see that 's enormously different so it 's re which is your most affordable place to buy half as many now as now that were affordable in that last time periods as there were four years ago and you can see that they growth in that uh time period in the average average price you can see the same thing for the rentals in here low income rentals i 'm sorry that 's the rental stress this one the maps look very similar just be aware that i get mixed up sometimes where is rental stress felt that 's about the rental stress this one is about how affordable rentals were and this is on a on the time periods in here so your rentals there if we go to low incomes you can see these are of course private rentals we know tyree has got in particular quite a bit of social housing that doesn 't get included in this because these are market rental listings 218 affordable rentals to low go back to december 2016 12 months ended interestingly 173 so the rental there 's more affordable rentals in 2020 than they were in 2016. is that right for sorry yeah more in number yeah about about the same percentage so it doesn 't seem to have at least entirely affected the uh the availability of affordable rentals for that area but it may have for other areas that need to go through and have a look at the differing numbers gloucester gloucester for example they have 37 rentals in that uh at last time period goes down it 's only 26 in the in the most recent conversation so some of them do do vary but uh you can see that the house purchase the main the main function of this movement out of sydney has really been to increase the housing prices much more than the rent although rents have gone up but nowhere near as much uh and so you 've still got some relatively affordable rentals but still as a percentage even it 's heart tartar at low income less than 40 percent are affordable to part all right uh i 'll move along there 's not a lot else there the last bit on here is affordable housing need so that is using the census data and account of homeless population to estimate total level of housing need this is also work in progress this was originally done using a um using some work that was done by um ahuri australian housing and urban research institute that looked at how you estimate housing need and they looked at people who are homeless marginally housed in social housing and in rental stress in the very low low and moderate income households so it 's this is only our best estimate at census time as to how many people were in that crit those critical categories in rental stress and homeless homeless and marginally housed which includes include with homeless the thing that that does draw a bit of attention in this one is that we assume that only 50 of rental stress is long term and therefore we exclude 50 of the rental stress in um in there from the affordable need number and that 's housing stress one year were also in housing stress the next year so it 's close enough to 50 percent so that we kind of discount that uh affordable housing made by the fact that many people in rental stress are not necessarily in rental stress long-term it might be a temporary situation it might be something they are they can get out of but there is a long term about 50 of that is long-term rental stress now that 's an average across australia we haven 't measured that for mid coast but it provides you with a good comparable estimate to our other clients to see how much of your household population is in need of affordable housing so our estimate there is just under five percent of housing would be needed for for um so about 1 900 households in need of affordable housing so it is an estimate but it can give you an idea if you 're an ad advocating for funding under a social housing model if you 're looking at partnering with an affordable housing organization what 's the sort of supply that the moment we are working on a way to potentially update this we realize it 's 2016 data and it 's something you probably do need an update we 're working on a way that we can incorporate this affordability metric which is much more up-to-date in the affordable housing need but we 're not there yet so if you 've got any suggestions as to how we can actually recalculate that on a six monthly basis we 'd be interested to hear from you because we 're working on that at the moment as well we can see there we break that into this some homeless population most of us the rental stress categories and you can see which groupings there are in those categories the interesting thing i find for midcoast you 've got a lot of lone person households but overwhelmingly well not overwhelming but in in numbers it 's actually families that are in most need of that rental housing so families that are more likely to be in that rental stress category and in need of affordable housing so that can really change the way housing market shows you 've got increases in couples with without children living in four bedroom separate houses um the affordable category the need for a uh perhaps the subsidised rental rate below market rent or whatever is more in the family category and it 's particularly families on very low incomes and this is because of the midcoast status as a quite a low socio-economic area and i would probably expect quite a large proportion of that will be in the aboriginal population as well which we saw is a disadvantaged group in that way so that sort of thing you can have a look then who 's living in what type of dwellings and make some assessment about what type of housing would be needed in that affordable space and that 's why we do put that that was pretty important as i say i 'd like to get that updated more frequently but it 's in on the home page in there so as i say housing id is a work in progress i 've mentioned quite a number of things that we 're looking at improving 're trying to work in we also look after the community profile and social atlas and we 're trying to update those as well but uh any any future improvements the housing tool will flow into your your site as well and really happy to get your feedback any any time about how you 're using that and whether it 's whether there 's things that could be improved in that as well _"

    "text": "[Music] so [Music] the manning river turtle is a very special species it 's a it 's a native australian short-necked turtle and it 's confined only to the mening river catchment in in new south wales it 's found nowhere else in the world it 's got an ancient lineage of about 55 million years so it 's a it 's an incredible species the betting river turtle lives in the in the manning river system from the middle of the catchment through to the upper reaches of the catchment and it 's found in the major rivers and and creek tributaries of the meeting river scientists believe it prefers the cooler flowing systems the meeting river turtle is important because it 's found nowhere else in the world other than the men in catchment and it 's threatened with extinction it 's rare in the wild and it 's under pressure so we have to do our do our best to secure this species in the wild and protect it so that that ancient lineage that 55 million years of its existence can continue into the future we in the wild and we need to know more about where they nest and how they nest and nest management we 're calling on land holders and interested members of the public when they 're in nature in the manning river catchment to keep an eye on the banks of major creeks and rivers in the system and to report any sighting that they believe to be a manning river turtle nest whether it 's an intact nest or whether it 's a raided nest that 's the sort of information that we need in order to manage the species better very little is known about manning turtle nesting behaviour however they are closely related to the bell 's turtle that is found on the new england tableland bell 's turtle nesting is by comparison well understood and likely manning turtle have similar nesting habits bells turtles usually nest within 10 metres of the water 's edge and up to 2.5 metres above the water level they nest in a variety of substrates like sand sandy loam clay loam shingle and gravel deposits nesting starts from october and goes through soil making digging easier you may be fortunate and see manning turtle during a late afternoon storm sticking their heads up above the water and venturing out on the sand and gravel banks to nest this is a location where we search for freshwater turtle nesting it 's adjacent to quite a deep waterhole it 's an area that is in full sun there 's there 's no shading at this site it 's within 10 meters of the water and it elevates quite quickly off of this deep water hole here up to about two to two and a half meters so that gives us the key attributes in terms of proximity to where freshwater turtles are and suitable nesting habitat the other advantage here is that the the soil is quite loamy sandy and and friable so very easy for the turtles to be able to dig in this particular substrate a really good area to keep a close eye on as we move through the rest of this season in terms of timing of when to go looking for nests uh freshwater turtles on the tablelands look the main thing that 's happening there is that the the substrate adjacent to the water holes uh gets a little bit easier to dig in and so that 's one of the best times to go looking for freshwater turtle nests and you want to look around sort of around november into december here on the coast so as as everybody can see here the bank 's quite sheer to in front of us here and but the best of the the nesting habitat in the sun and with the nice soil is over there so likely the turtles come to the the end of the pool um which is often where these deposition sites are and the the cattle tracks have created quite a nice easy access for them so they 'll be sticking their heads out through the water here and then climbing up in a spot like this and especially if your soil is going to be more clay like there 's going to be more tracks that are going to get held in the soil here but this is the kind of spot that you banks here and for skid marks coming up through the middle if this was maybe just slightly higher from the water in this in terms of this run you 're likely to see nests being laid here or at the bottom of this run here as well so they they come up from the water hit this first bank and lay a nest and then some will continue further up and get just to the top and then lay a nest and in a spot like this where we 've got a nice gradual bank then they 're likely to continue a little bit further up and create a nest up up there or above here like we 've shown before some of the tracks that you might see in this substrate it 's it 's very difficult because it 's a it 's a very loose sandy loam so you would only be seeing tracks you know maybe maybe the day or two after if the moisture stays wet and the rainfall is not too high but because there is a little bit alone if you are lucky you the plastron as as the turtles climbing up and on these banks here they 'll often come to some sort of some sort of rise that gets them a little bit more elevation and so the body of the turtle will be sitting here and with their back legs they would excavate a nest chamber that would look like this this is typically what we might look for is just a very slight depression in the ground and as as the rain falls and it sort of settles to almost a sort of level during the nesting season if you if you go out across your property along the riverbanks and you come across what we can see here which is a depression that 's been excavated and you can see these fragments of eggshells around the side this is a classic example of a freshwater turtle nest that 's been raided by a fox these shell fragments all of the eggs are gone this is the most likely thing that that you 'll find it 's really hard to find freshwater turtle nests because they disguise them so effectively banks of the rivers and creeks and you see a nest please report it to midcoast council to hunter local land services for the manning river turtle group [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you _"

good for you ready fingers in front of your ears and [Music] i know let 's do it again ready good work one more time really really loud ready [Music] good work well done okay so today we 're going to focus on how we express emotions using our face and our body when we move our face to display how we feel inside it 's called facial expressions and when we move our body to show how we feel inside it 's called body language i know cool words right they 're ones you should keep so now we 've warmed up our body i have brought a special friend from midcoast council please welcome dwayne hello everyone hi dwayne did you do your warm-ups uh [Music] yeah i 've done my eyebrows good we need to do our eyebrows don 't we all right so what we 're going to do today is we 're going to look at three special emotions happiness sadness and grumpiness dwayne have you ever felt any of those emotions before oh what we 're going to do is look at how we can express them through our whole body and this will help you when you 're playing a character in a play or putting on a skit at home to feel happy sad or grumpy let 's start with happiness shall we dwayne could you please give us an example in your face and your body of what happens when you feel super happy nice freeze dwayne good let 's take a closer look shall we so here we see dwayne 's mouth see how he can see all his top teeth and it 's pushing off his cheeks that smile is a happy smile and they 're the best it 's a really good way of expressing how we 're feeling what about dwayne 's eyebrows and his eyes see how they 've almost disappeared because it 's so exciting i like to call them happiness crinkles not sure if that 's really a term but we 're just going to go with it today also look at jane 's body see how his chest is open and it him that is a really good way of us expressing how we 're feeling all right dwayne can you please show us super duper duper happy do i unfreeze now oh yeah oh yeah okay sorry fantastic see

    "text": "um all right everybody i 'd like to introduce glenn capuano to you he 's a statistician with um id the demographic consultant people and he 's going to do a briefing this morning on um the impact of covert on our demographics so i 'll hand over to him now thanks glenn thanks lindy and thanks everyone for inviting me along today uh yeah my name 's glenn the company 's id stands for informed decisions uh yeah and we put together a series of online information tools to assist local government decision making i 'll be going through those tools in the second and third sessions today uh but first up we 've got a a briefing on the demographic trends in midcoast council and particularly some of the things that we know about the most recent population trends and the impacts of covert on those there 's a lot we don 't know but we 've got a few sort of data points and of course the 2021 census which is in the field at the moment being collected uh will give us quite a bit more next year so we 've got a few things we can see what sort of an area midcoast is now how it 's changed in the past and what are some of the trends that are impacting that at the moment uh really happy to take questions along the way i believe there 's a q a uh button there so you can put questions in there um i am happy to uh to talk to people as well if you want to uh if you can unmute or if you can be unmuted when you 've got a question then that 's that 's fine uh as well i 'll share my screen and we can get started we 've got uh yeah quite a bit of info here about the uh the current population trends uh we have a series of online information tools available to mid coast we work with you to promote evidence-based decision making help you make uh evidence-based decisions about your community uh funding applications really about understanding your place we 've been working with council since amalgamation uh and with the previous to lakes for about 10 years prior to that uh and you 've got access to our community profile social atlas population forecast and the new housing monitor which is the subject of the third session that we 've got this morning so we 'll as i 'm not going to go through them in detail right now but you do have access to these public information tools uh to assist you with understanding your your community with the community profile giving you all that demographic information we 'll be loading in the 2021 census data as soon as we get that early next year uh matt atlas which gives you spatial mapping this is how things vary across mid coast uh and the population forecasts which uh take you from a set of agreed assumptions to what does the future look like uh in um in the mid coast council area go through them in the next uh session and then housing id and the one after that housing very detailed look at housing supply demand and how affordable housing is in the area as well so we do have be distributed to you if you would like a copy of the slides which are useful resource in themselves you can register at content.id dot com dot iu forward slash briefings and actually i might just put that in the chat but you can also scan that qr code if you we 're all fairly used to scanning qr codes at the moment so uh so what 's happening australia 's population at the moment uh we 've just reached the end of a record period of population growth uh 2019 20 was the lowest growth in in 10 years we 've got six months of the next year uh we 'll get i think in september we get the june the march quarter figures so this is only up to it says 2021 there but it 's up to december 2020 you can see that the uh the nation as a whole australia lost 3 700 people so uh it 's we 've gone from strong population growth to actually negative population growth uh and this hasn 't been seen since 1916 so we 've got a really massive 've got gone from high population growth to zero in fact slightly negative population growth in the space of a year in the year end of june 2020 which we do these things in financial years you can 't really see the impact because it 's only the last quarter that was covered impacted there uh it is relatively low particularly for new south wales uh about 0.9 percent population growth which is the lowest in 20 years but the there 's no growth in that last quarter and the next two quarters that we have up to december 2020 show extremely low population growth in six months new south wales did manage to add 4 600 people and so that 's pretty much flat victoria um lost a lot of population uh queensland 's the only one that 's significantly gaining population still that 's predominantly because of migration from new south wales and victoria we do have an aging population overall and you can see that in the 40-year time series that we 've got here only up to 2016 there so it 's not that we 're times as many people in that age group as there were in 1976 we expect to see that continue possibly even more so in the 2021 census results uh with the also in the last 10 years we had increases in 25 to 34 year olds and zero to four and five to nine year olds uh there went up quite a bit and of course the baby boomers uh aging into their 60s and early 70s now increasing in that last decade as well one of the drivers of population growth uh at the national level of course is the birth rate uh although we 've heard some anecdotal things about birth rate increases post covered there are preliminary numbers for 2020 and they don 't show that at all they show actually flat two slight declines in the birth rate 2019 which we have the official figures for lowest birth rate on record and it 's mainly driven by the big declines in young women having children and somewhat of an increase in the older women having children so it is uh people having kids later in life so you at a national level the population grows by excess of births over deaths called natural increase and net overseas migration more people coming in than leaving and except they 're not doing that anymore in the six months end of december 2020 we had negative 66 000 overseas migration so 66 000 more people left the country than came in uh and that means that largely offsets the natural increase and total population growth for the financial year ended uh just ended um just over a month ago likely to be fairly fairly flat maybe even slightly negative for the the full year new south wales share of that uh you can see to december 2020 uh was also negative interestingly we did get um no sorry was it do you was slightly slightly negative for the six months end of december the the quarter of december actually had slightly positive overseas migration for new south wales but it is uh it is negative um overall for that six months but you can see there you 've gone as a state from getting a hundred thousand close to so it 's a big a big shock but that is disproportionately on city so uh sydney gets a vast majority of that overseas migration uh what the really interesting trend though is interstate migration which is negative for new south wales but not as negative as it has been uh that might change uh with the um with the current lockdowns and everything but we won 't see that for um for a few quarters uh until we get the um june and september quarters uh figures for migration but the strong trend which is going to interest you is this movement from sydney into regional new south wales that has picked up uh so we 're getting more people uh moving from city it 's always been a trend there 's moving from sydney to regional new south wales is not a new thing but it 's picked up post covert and i think it will have picked up again in the last few months but up to december 2020 it 's going at about 22 000 people per annum so that is 22 000 in net terms 's not just more people moving from sydney to regional new south wales it 's less people leaving the regions and going into the cities and that 's a trend across australia and indeed we see to some extent worldwide as well new south wales uh local government areas you can see that uh mid coasts uh sitting up here in the lower to moderate growth range but all of the coastal areas really are strongly um grow our growing and that 's in the five years at the one year level pretty much all those coastal areas growing some declines in land uh sort of areas of growth on the in some of the larger centers in land as well uh with most growth in sydney interestingly within sydney and the last year their fairfield local government area and i think that 's mossman as well uh reported a population decline anywhere that is heavily reliant on overseas migration even just the last four months of financial year that were covered affected starting to see uh that that impact and we 're going to have many more of those which we don 't get until uh march next year you 'll start to see significant population declines in many of those areas in sydney but what we expect to see is with that exodus to the uh the regions or less people moving the other way remember as well that many of the regional areas will continue to grow while sydney declines so you do have community profile and social atlas to enable you to tell this story i 'll be going through them in the next session but you 've got profile dot id dot com dot youth forward slash midcoast 20 suburbs districts uh and an overlap of foster tom curry uh full census data for each one going back to 1991 uh in there and we 've got some new data sets which i will go through as well so what 's happening with mid coast up to 2016 population 91 800 growth moderate growth in the previous census period uh lower than the new south wales average uh average household size quite small 2.24 people per dwelling which is well below the new south wales nature of this one but that 's all the few small areas and showing where the growth has been in the uh in the five years ended 2016. of course we get an update for 2021 with the census results uh you can see some it 's quite strong growth predominantly in those coastal bits uh holidays point forks nest tea gardens uh crodie um harrington john 's river my apologies if i mispronounce anything in pacific palms blues beach cumber park all grown fairly strongly most most population growth is positive [Music] particular shout out to candletown which had exactly the same population five years later uh pretty hard to do um and bulladella which had a population decline but everything else uh it had growth there so fast forward four years to 2020 we 've only got this up to june 2020 just really the start of that code affected period uh you can see that the population has grown to estimated to have grown about 2 600 people in four years there remembering it 's that 's probably greater than the five-year growth there at the uh is definitely greater than the growth rate than you 've seen in the previous census period and that 's only up to june 2020 but have a look at what the components there of that one are natural increase minus 398 so more deaths than births to grow midcoast population you have to import people you 're doing this predominantly through internal migration and most of that is from sydney so the overseas migration component will disappear but the we expect the migration internal migration from predominantly sydney is going to accelerate so that you will have probably higher population growth while the nation overall is declining better question there are the figures growth per annum or total uh and the um [Music] so they uh i tend to put total growth in most of these so that 's uh that 's total growth as a percentage over the number of years that we 've got there so four years growth there was uh 2.8 you can on the community profile site get the annual growth in each year of course so what does this mean for the age structure median age in 2016 was 52 that 's increased by three years and it is the second oldest local government area in new south wales as a population uh the oldest uh i believe actually the old great lakes council was the oldest in new south wales but amalgamation brought the median age down a little bit uh and uh so eurovidella is now the oldest in in new south wales you can see some of the the groupings there but still pretty heavily dominated by baby boomer population they 're 55 to 74 year olds and that 's what it looks like in chart form which is straight off the community profile a large population of retirement in pre-retirement age large elderly population uh not so many fair few kids but not very many young adults uh people in their 20s not very many of those in the mid coast council area increases over time predominantly in the uh the 65 plus age groups and particularly the baby boomers in that sort of uh 60s to early 70s age range we 've got different outcomes in different areas so different profiles so you can see comparing tongue curry to mid coast area overall a lot of older population in that area and the increase almost all in there but it 's a surprising increase in young children under fives there at the last census uh whereas uh old bar despite its name is actually one of the young areas in the coast so it 's not young compared to the state but it does have a lot more young children and some and parents of young children in the community there so households smaller households dominant and on the increase so overall there 's a decline in the couples declining couples with children increasing one parent families increasing couples without children and low in-person households i would expect to probably see something similar in the in the next census but you may get some more families moving in in the most recent time period they are particularly the one parent families which are often seeking that affordable housing which we know is an issue and we 'll cover that in the housing id section the culturally diverse groups uh distinct uh indigenous profile available on the community profile that goes through that population which is quite a large large group of people um 6.2 percent of population identifying in the last census as aboriginal or torres strait islander origin uh overseas born nine point three percent which is quite low and there 's some of the birthplace and language groups in there so you don 't have a large overseas born population not very reliant on overseas migration you do have a significant aboriginal and torres strait islander population and it 's a bit hard to see on that map it 's better if you go onto the main atlas site and and you can zoom in as a number of the smaller towns and communities in there uh near uh near around hari predominantly is the the largest group uh but one thing about the uh aboriginal and torres strait islander population is a in an older area like that it 's actually keeping the population a bit younger because as a as a population they are quite a bit younger than the total population um you can uh those age groups there and that 's off your indigenous profile on the on the community profile the other form of migration which we talk about uh talked about in state and migration within the state uh is the movement predominantly out of sydney and you can see how strong that is people moving from central coast blacktown penrith northern beaches and the hills are the top five sources of new people moving into mid coast that 's up to 2016. movement out is mainly younger people and mainly to newcastle and fort macquarie with a bit to queensland i do also have the um age groups of those so migration by age i actually put a slide on to that what you can see is that the migration by ages strongly into 55 and 65 plus year olds moving in 18 to 24 year olds moving out but there are some families moving in as well so uh 30 somethings and young children moving into the area and you can see um let me just go back to the slide there that has continued since the census but it 's consistent but we would expect expect to probably see an uptake in the next year 's data 2019 20 only includes four months of the the pandemic there so moving in from central coast they 're almost the same as the census ones so lots of living from central coast blacktown northern beaches penrith and hawkesbury pops in there as well and movement out to the same places there so midcoast really you can see there every local government area in the greater sydney region is a net gain to mid coast and that 's only going to increase uh with the the trend of movement outwards of the cities and less movement uh away from the area remembering the movement away from the area is not necessarily to sydney to start with its young people moving to newcastle and queensland this leads to some trends in housing which is pretty important we 've now got housing id which gives you a lot of information about the affordability of housing you 've got a high rate of full home ownership which is not surprising because you have an unoccupied dwellings so at the last census 17.7 percent of dwellings were unoccupied on census might be really interesting to see what happens with that this census are people moving into holiday homes this is what something we don 't know for sure until we get the census data the high home ownership is the main trend there people buying houses outright that can be pushing up prices for the local population as well though relatively low rate of social housing compared to new south wales overall you do also have housing id which is online right now this is our newest tool and you are one of 18 councils nationwide to have that resource a lot of detail on housing supply where new dwellings are going in what types of dwellings are being built where what type of households living what type of dwellings how the prices and incomes compare and how affordable is housing based on the incomes that are in the area at the moment the third session today will go through this in detail so if you 're interested in the housing story you want to for the the third session this morning uh but i 've got a few uh key trends in there um for which are just taken out into the slides there so we have rental and housing prices up to december 2020 and at the end of september we 'll be adding the june figures june 2021 so it 's quite recent information rather than the roman waiting for the census there median median price they 're 380 dollars a week for a house uh and you can see their regional new south wales uh had huge increase in house prices in that last year midcoast has been fairly consistent but you can see one three and five years on house prices pretty consistent growing around three percent per annum uh and um so it doesn 't jump around as much as others but it is fairly strong and consistent growth in the rents uh prices are a little bit different prices uh to buy uh have gone up further we 'll have a look at that in the housing session uh building approvals you can see those areas along the so much around atari for example or even the established areas of foster turn curry but it 's uh places uh can 't quite see what these ones are but i think it 's old bar in those sort of areas in there where you 've got the new housing growth um and then we look at what actually is affordable we focus a bit on rentals but you can do this for house prices as well we 'll go through that in the session so most of the affordable rentals for the people on low incomes which is less than eighty percent of the median uh uh interior overall only 27 of rentals are affordable but forty percent in terry uh and that 's to the uh 12 months end of december 2020 and that fell that 27 is down from 36 a year before so you can see the effects of this in migration from sydney on the housing affordability uh which is reducing particularly for home purchase but also definitely for rental as well you can see that broken down you can get mediums and change for area down into those at least 20 districts oh there 's the salesman i did put the salesman in so affordable sales uh 66 affordable in 2016 51 affordable in 2020 we take that one you can do it for different income levels but we 've taken that one for moderate incomes which is up to 120 of median assuming that people who are looking to buy will be on somewhat higher incomes but even there you can see we 're down to about half of all sales are affordable to first home buyers on even moderate incomes and that 's that 's actually above average incomes 19 to low income so it 's quite it 's quite good of being able to see what quantify what is happening to the these prices and this is based on actual sales and actual rentals so we 'll go through that more in the third session as i said forecast id is where we look at the trends and take input from council about land supply where new dwellings are going in your housing policy zoning and our assessment of demand we is that the uh where is the population heading and we 've got currently up to 2036 the next iteration will go to 2041 on the forecasts uh we 're expecting moderate growth to about 113 000 by 2036 but these are pre-covered forecasts so uh it 's there is a page on the population forecast which looks at our likely impact of the the the um covert pandemic on the population growth but it is it 's not quantitative it says this may have a positive impact this may have a negative impact we haven 't revised the forecasts yet a lot of the the difficulty in revising forecasts at the moment is not knowing when our australian borders are going to reopen for people to come and settle here again that 's going to make a big difference to many areas not necessarily so much to mid coast your big trend uh is going to be the migration in from sydney and less movement out of young people which we are seeing consistently in regional areas particularly those favored for a sort of sea change tree change population what it has been up to now so uh forecast does continue this it 's actually currently tracking a little bit high which is probably good uh in terms of you your current forecast because i expect the um since covert that you 'll actually see an increase in that that population growth that will probably catch up to our forecast but we do monitor that each year anyway and review when required internal migration is strongly up uh and overseas migration is stopped but this really won 't affect midcoast very much so overall up to 2036 in terms of the age structure remembering that these are pre-covered forecasts still expecting considerable increases in people aged in their 70s and 80s that 's because the peak age for of movement into the mid coast is about 60. so people then age into those older groups but you do have particularly in the second half of that forecast period through to 2036 significant uptick in the families with children particularly older children moving into the area you can get this for each uh each district within mid coast as well population you do consistently have at the moment natural decrease of about 400 people per annum so you need to import so to speak 400 people just to keep the population uh the same each year uh but by 2036 with the aging population we expect that to go down to about minus 700 with migration making that up the difference now this is predominantly internal migration and we 've currently got that around about a thousand people per annum with retirement in from sydney but we expect perhaps some younger people moving in there as well with the the attractiveness of the sea change so it 's quite possible that covert brings some of that migration which we 've got in the latter part forward and we do get a a boost in population in the in the near term if there 's dwellings for people to move into there 's quite a few holiday homes and that sort of thing but of course you 're building dwellings as well as we can see in some of those forecasts are only as good as the assumptions that make them site under assumptions for instance we have where the new dwellings are going in the residential development assumptions the migration assumptions what age people move in you can see the families with children which is a moderate one and then the big peak in the people in their 60s retiring to the area and a modest loss in the uh the elderly groups 80 plus uh probably due to moving to larger centers for healthcare so that 's the forecast we 'll go through the actual forecast site in the in the next session there socioeconomic trends uh it 's a few figures from the census just be aware these things do change a bit from the senses when we 're when we 're looking at and i should have a year on that but it 's mainly 2016. i have got a asterisk on on this one that the median rent uh shows 380 a week for houses and 295 for units so that 's 255 from the census that will also include social housing and it 's not quite the same measure but it you can see that show for the rental uh mortgage payments a little higher than that and the safer index of disadvantage showing the the total level of disadvantage in your area 911 so it 's one of the more disadvantaged uh places across new south wales in fact from the ranking from 130 for government areas in new south wales big coast ranks 111th uh in as from most advanced to most disadvantaged why this is is predominantly you 've got smaller households with lower incomes and in fact 40 percent of mid coasts uh equalized incomes adjusted for household size fall into the bottom 25 of the state of new south wales and that 's where all the increase was at the last census you can pinpoint areas of disadvantage using our atlas and i 'll go through that the next session uh the disadvantage really strongly focused around parts of tari it 's hard to see because they 're all in the smaller urban areas uh geographically uh and this little town in here which i can 't quite read um but we can have a look at that on the areas are a bit better off so it 's away from the coast uh which you see the the more disadvantaged places and that 's on things like low incomes higher unemployment rates low skilled occupations and single parent families uh while one of the other feeders into that is internet access unfortunately this question is no longer asked if you fill in your 2021 census you would have seen there was no no question about internet access and dwelling anymore which is a real pity because this is a really strong indicator of disadvantage uh 2016 had uh increasing internet connection but there was still a higher rate of households with no internet connection it 's about 21 of all households in midcoast had no internet connection at home and the communities of interest module on the community profile shows low-income households those on the in the bottom 20 of the country are mainly pensioners so they 're mainly in the in the retirees 52 fully owned their homes but there 's 24 of that that group is is renting uh privately which is quite um indicative they are households have no internet uh finally on the socioeconomic trends uh there 's a lot of people with trade qualifications one of the highest in the country 25 of people had a vocational qualification we have degree qualifications just under 10 uh and very low workforce participation rate because of the aged population and a high rate of part-time work so there 's a lot of people retire to the area so they 're not in the lab course they 're not looking for work uh and there 's a lot of people who have maybe partially retired and doing part-time work uh which is nearly of the labor force was nearly half you 've also got a high job seeker rate june 2021 so this is quite recent we monitored this monthly uh while it 's being published and it started to be published at the beginning of the pandemics see how many people were going into that unemployment benefits there 6089 people in midcoast were receiving jobseeker at june 2021 uh it 's almost back down to march 2020 levels which was just pre-pandemic but it 's still working age population that 's percentage of working age population i should stress which is 15 to 64 year olds so it doesn 't even include the large retired population with a larger retirement age population some of them may be in early retirement of that that percentage you can see there that 's the highest qualifications and that 's the job seeker numbers so job seeker at the peak which was uh around about june july of 2020 hit 15.8 percent uh it 's come down since then to 12.1 but it 's still pretty strong indicator of social economic uh the tari area these these areas for jobseeker are not same as the um as the small areas on the community profile they 're called sa2 regions which are an official geography whereas we use a uh generation that 's worked out in consultation with council so you can see tari there at 14.4 of working age population on job seeker is the highest in mid coast but has also come down since the pandemic peak of june 2020 now we don 't know what the current situation fairly soon because we get this every month we 're about to get the july figures maybe in next week i think so we get it less than a month after so that 's going to be really interesting to say uh you do have also a light version of our economic profile it 's got a lot of detail about the workforce and the characteristics of the industry in the area industries really very tourism and healthcare focus so accommodation and food services retail trade and health care and social assistance of course with the older population being quite high and large agriculture forestry and fishing employment as well uh and uh work destinations uh we 'll be really interested to see in the next census of course what impact covert has on the work from home right uh and particularly looking at uh the fact of the data census so even it 's only been a week since census day but the places in australia that are in lockdown have changed since then so we 've had uh we 've had a different mix i know that so to work from home if you can now uh but on on census night uh census day for the uh for where you work uh it 's uh and how you get to work it was a little bit different and only only some local government areas in regional new south wales were required to work from home so i 've recorded that on our blog because it is going to affect the numbers uh in the consensus as to what that that was i was kind of hoping that the work from home bit would have been representative of a sort of a new normal but some of it will be represented in the lockdown depending on where you are in australia this time you can see that midcoast is pretty self-contained most people live and work within midcoast with a few going to port macquarie and newcastle but predominantly working living and working within the mid coast region and just on the the work from home bit you do have in the method of travel to work on the community profile the proportion of people who worked at percent of the last census but even though i think midcoast wasn 't actually in lockdown on census night i think it will still have a significant increase in work at home on census night uh in the in in the census but we 'll uh we 'll monitor that it is going to change there 's a few things in the census that are going to be different because of that because of lockdowns so uh there 's a lot of things we do know and there 's a lot of things that we don 't know yet about the the impacts of covert which we 're going to have to wait for the 2021 census we do know that midcoast is one of the oldest populations in new south wales but strongly growth rate driven by migration in from sydney and that is if anything increased since the uh the pandemic started uh and um that has an effect on the housing in the area uh families moving perhaps seeking more affordable housing but as part of that they 're pushing up those housing prices and rentals uh a very large population service sector healthcare 's the largest industry small households uh older population but an increase some increase in particularly one parent families it 's also a low socioeconomic area uh with a high rate of the job seeker at 12 percent of population looking for work so we can expect probably stable to maybe even a little bit higher population growth which is quite amazing when you think that australia 's population is potentially not going to increase at all and maybe even slightly declined for the financial year just gone out forecasts are tracking a little bit higher but we 're thinking that your population will catch up to this it 's actually tracking fairly well overall compared to some of our forecasts and we expect we 'll certainly be monitoring that and we can adjust some of the assumptions but the forecast should be shouldn 't be too far off i think on the on the numbers that we see over the coming years you do have access to four id tools which are the community profile social atlas population forecasts and housing id communities of interest module to look at smaller population groups for instance the aboriginal torres strait islander population or the low-income households people born overseas and so on so you do have access to all of those these are public access sites you can call me or email me if you need any further assistance with the toolkit but we 're just about to go into the next session which will be uh how to use the community profile social items and population forecasts and then the third session which will be focused on the new one which is housing id so you can access all your id sites from that landing page you can go to our briefings page and register for uh the slides if you 'd like a copy of those slides i will send them out some probably tomorrow to everyone who 's registered uh and um you can also register and uh join our our online chat if you have any questions about the toolkit there as well so we 're on various forms of social media you may have seen our blog which is the moment and what the impact of the current situation might be on that you can join our blog and we tweet and do a few things on those various social media platforms the qr code there is just another version of that content one content.idea.com that i use slash briefings _"

    "text": "[Music] [Music] midcoast council 's annual waterway encatchment report card is celebrating its 10th anniversary with over 1 900 individual water quality samples taken across our six major catchments we now have important water quality data that will help us protect our catchments and estuaries and allow us to plan and implement management actions that will help improve them into the future in 2009 council adopted the great lakes water quality improvement plan and the water quality improvement plan identified the need to collect information about the health of our estuaries having 10 years of report card data allows us to identify trends and cycles that are taking place in our natural environment but they also allow us to plan for management actions that can help improve our waterways and then also monitor the actual impacts of those management actions once they 've been put in place when we first started collecting data about the willamba river we received a degrade and that represents the poorest site in all of the sites in wallace lake the main issues in the lambo were really gradual decline in water quality which was leases that we had in the orlando river we were facing back at that time 15 20 years ago we were chasing high mortality we were noticing in our stock which was attributed to acid sulfate um runoff from the fragala swamp and willamba river and so that was identified and we had to move out of those areas and stop and stop farming there because we couldn 't sustain those losses there 'd been a legacy of past clearing and agricultural development and and rural and residential development and the the river systems had suffered a degree of um impairment of in their condition it did indicate that we needed to implement catchment actions to improve the the runoff from the catchment into the wallamba river one of the main issues on the walamba at the time was riverbank erosion and that was coming from boat usage of the river we had conversations with the users of that river about the problem and what they thought the potential solutions were and so that meant in reality winding back uh skiing from 15 kilometers of river to nine kilometers we the erosion that was happening we 've seen that the riparian zones restore so we 're getting a water quality improvement over the last 10 years council has been implementing a range of on-ground actions across the orlando river to improve water quality this included fencing off uh rocharin zones to exclude stock from the riverbanks undertaking revegetation with navy species and installing uh erosion control measures including rock phillips to reduce boat wash and reduce the sediment input to the river this is a project rock fillet project and some planting on the riverbank which was done a number of years ago and we 've had really good success here the mangroves have recruited really well behind the rocks between the rocks and the bank that 's helping stabilize the bank and so that 's really halted the erosion at this site the plantings have done exceptionally well so we 've got a mix of species here that have grown right up in the riparian zone and that all bodes really well for the long term health of this riverbend currently trolling new techniques to address riverbank erosion are water quality and aquatic habitat just like the rock phillips these timber fillets are designed to create a low energy environment and you get mangrove seeds like these ones these are off the the grey mangrove the avacynia and they they tend to get deposited behind these structures and then yeah hopefully recruit and you can see other parts of this this structure where we 've had really good natural recruitment and that just accelerates the process of rehabilitating this riverbank these are some of the oysters that we 've got placed on the bank here they 're growing pretty well they 've survived the big flood this year and the little flood last year and so we 're really happy with how they 're going they 're providing some good habitat for other species like snails so we 're really starting to improve the diversity and the the natural values of this system that was actively eroding previously these islands have a history of dairy farming which goes back to the 19th century when we first came here they had paddocks they were re-vegetated with trees from the council the importance of ground cover and how it was a very very cost effective way of improving water quality was to have better grazing management and in turn better ground cover so once ground cover drops below about 70 percent it 's uh get an exponential increase in water runoff with the re-vegetation a lot of the if there are flooding events the silt gets caught on the island a lot better with the re-vegetation and so obviously that extends to better water quality in the lake and the river the durawang wetlands is a is a as a natural coastal floodplain wetland system it 's located between tonkari and holidays point and between the wallamba river and the ocean it was a degraded wetland system from about the 1940s onwards there had been over 20 kilometers of artificial drains established and so instead of being a functional native natural system which purifies water and stores carbon it was actually very impaired it 's underlain by acid sulfate soils that actually produced acid pollution which flowed to the wallamba river council and other stakeholders including state and national funding providers system in order to manage and remediate the landscape it was important to recreate as close as we possibly could the the pre-disturbance or the natural hydrology of the system we have two national parks that are right on the wallamba river the minibar nature reserve and the darawing nature reserve and they they protect 1300 hectares of wetlands that flow into the willamba river wetlands are really important for water quality they act like the kidneys of natural systems so they 're able to filter out sediments nutrients pollutants that all contribute to poor water quality in rivers we 've been doing work on feral animals on weed control habitat restoration with nest boxes and also our monitoring of wildlife recovery on the site behind us here which is the darawinka swamp we 've been containing and hopefully eradicating the ludwigia longifolia which has taken over post-fire ludwigia sort of takes over our native species and at the moment we 're suppressing it and the native species have taken over that now so we 're getting on top of it there is a few threatened species there the jabaru few times while we were working out here water quality is extremely important to those threatened species that are here we 've got 400 nest boxes uh in darawang napangat uh kaiwari state forest we 've found like potteroos uh qualls we 've got echidnas bandicoots we 've got a lot a lot of animals a different range council undertakes uh wide scale fair alarm controls across garrowank and the minimal landscapes in conjunction with support of hunter local land services and national parks so we undertake this work to reduce the key threat of fox predation on many of our small and medium-sized native animals including bandicoot long nose pottery brustov pascago and the eastern chestnut mouse the the project has been hugely successful we 've infilled over 75 of the artificial drains that are in the landscape it was uh very impacted by the drainage network and legacy clearing and there was very little life to now see it a vibrant and functioning wetland on a really good trajectory there are economic benefits there are community benefits and there are certainly environmental benefits of the work my ancestors part of the recovery process and helping it come back to what it once was has been extremely rewarding um the remediation work that 's been undertaken by council which is the re-flooding of some of the acquisition of some of the um flood zones and um covering the acid sulfate up has permitted us over the last five to ten years to actually revisit those leases and go back there and grow oysters in in the wilmba river again the scale of the problem is such that it 's beyond any one body of people whether it 's community landowners government agencies the only way forward is to work in partnership bringing a waterway back to to production is you know it 's a great achievement for council land and for the farmers and the landowners up there with consistent and extensive efforts to stabilize banks manage boat wash keep cattle out of the river and improve the quality of wetlands along the willamble river we 've seen significant improvements in ecological health of our estuary we now consistently receive b and c grades and that 's a great it 's really great to be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of producing the report card and the william rivers is a great example of a project that the community can be really proud of [Music] [Applause] [Music] you _"

    "text": "okay so hi and welcome to the information session we 've organised for uh the manning river estuary and catchment management program we 've got a mix of people here from community and fellow council staff so thanks for joining us um look we 've done a lot of consultation along the journey of developing this catchment industry management program but really this is just the beginning of the future of the manning river and we look forward to working with everyone to safeguard our amazing river system i 'm going to introduce you to my coordinator louise duff so catchment coordinator here and she 's going to present a presentation to you about the program thanks alicia um hopefully you can see the slideshow now um yeah so this is the we 've just launched the exhibition for the manning river estuary and catchment management program we call it ecmp for short because it 's a bit of a mouthful and this is what we 're trying to do with the plan we 're trying to safeguard this beautiful manning river that we all love we love the clean river clean people love to fish in our river and swim in our river especially on a hot day it 's a place where wildlife lives we 've got the manning river helmeted turtle found only in the manning um we 've got platypus and spiny crayfish and bass and all sorts of fantastic aquatic wildlife that live in the river and it 's a it 's a cultural place as well where generations have been connected to the river both our birpai community the waramaya upriver as well as white settlers who use the river and have for generations but when we did our rapid assessment of the river back in 2019 as we sort of kicked off the planning process we found many issues and problems in the system we 've got a lot of cleared land for agriculture and a lot of those soils are really compacted so what you get then is really rapid runoff during rain events and poor infiltration into the soil and that carries nutrients into the river we 've got cattle readily accessing the banks in a lot of places you can had an asset event last february after the drought where we have the acid sulfate soils um leaching acid into the river the main stem of the manning and you can see that there and from that we get red spot disease in fish and fish fish kills and we 've got a lot of weed problems especially after the fire and we have a lot of erosion as well and lot of that stems from agricultural practices and you can see the algae in the bottom left so where we get nutrients like fertilizers and manures washing into the river we get algae blooms and a whole lot of problems that stem from them so these are some of the pressures the river 's facing and we wanted to take a whole of catchment approach to manage these issues a little bit confusing but the plan has been developed under the coastal management uh framework and under the particularly under the coastal management act so just to give you a brief rundown on that um there was a coastal reform done by the new south wales government in 2016 that this relates to so the coastal management act um came in and it has a whole lot of objects around protecting the coast especially coastal wetlands literal rainforest and managing development but it also has one of its objects to implement the marine estate management act which deals with the marine estate and that includes the estuary so that 's why we 're doing this catchment management program under the coastal management act and it will allow us to access coast and street grant funding which will be at a rate of two to one um so i 'll just leave that there but if you 've ever got any questions about the coastal management act feel free to feel free to ask so as i said through the coastal management act we 're covering the estuary and you can see the estuary there in the darker green at the bottom right of that image the estuary goes right up past wingham and up to upper lansdowne anywhere that 's tidal in the system and we 're also taking the whole of catchment approach so that was a really not just looking at the estuary because what the whole system is connected from the fresh water to the salt and we know that what happens in the upper catchment impacts on the estuary so while we 've got a strong focus on the estuary because it is under the coastal management act we do have a program that addresses issues right throughout our whole catchment that 's a massive catchment eight and a half thousand square kilometers so the vision of the estuary and catchment management program is that the manning river its tributaries and the estuary give life to our community connecting the mountains to the sea together we manage the catchment holistically and respond to a changing climate safeguarding environmental social cultural and economic values the program 's organized into these eight themes and each of these themes has its own objective so i 'm not going to go into the detail of those objectives today but you can find them in the program online so number one is stewardship because all these problems are people problems if there weren 't people here if you went back system so um working with our community is number one water quality and ecosystem health is our second theme and objective addressing climate change risk is number three and then biodiversity looking after our wildlife aboriginal custodianship looking after social and economic values land use planning and governance so in each of these themes we 've got an objective as i said and a range of actions i 've already talked about some of the key issues that we 're facing in the catchment we did a risk assessment at the beginning of the planning process and you can find out more about that in the document how we did that risk assessment and some of the key issues that were raised were community stewardship as i 've said lots of coastal wetlands on the flood plain the coastal wetlands are really the kidneys of the landscape and they 're so important for filtering out pollutants like nutrients and sediments before they reach the river and the estuary there 's been a lot of floodplain drainage about 200 kilometers of channels were built back in around the 1930s and they they get exposed to oxygen and then when they get re-wetted the acid comes out into the system agricultural impacts are one of our key threats in the both the estuary and the whole catchment um it 's it 's it is a rural um area with you know a fantastic history of farming and we need food production we need food security and our farmers are a really important part of the cultural life of our community but we need to find ways to manage agriculture better and loss and degradation of riparian vegetation so as i 've mentioned that that riverbank vegetational riparian vegetation is what really holds the banks together it provides incredible habitat for wildlife and particularly with climate change it allows for wildlife movements up from the coast up to the mountains it also uh provides habitat for aquatic um species because it 's dropping in food and providing shelter and it 's stopping again nutrients and sediments from reaching um the river so there are top issues just to run through some of the other issues addressed climate change particularly 50 to 100 years really feeling the impacts of that modified flow is something that was a huge concern you know of course during the drought which was right when we were doing our risk assessment um pathogens from sewage and septic is a concern for things like swimming and also drinking water it increases treatment costs and of course for our oyster oyster industry which really needs that clean water at the moment we can 't direct harvest from the manning urban storm water litter and marine debris so this is coming from our major centres like gloucester wingham and tari wildlife conservation entrance modifications you might be aware of a sort of community and ministerial led push to modify the entrance and that will have a range of knock-on effects into the estuary modified hydrology and fish passage so we 've got a lot of barriers to fish passage in the system erosion and sediment control and flooding and inundation so i 'm just going to give an overview of the actions we 've actually got 36 actions um and when you look at the document you might think those actions are notes so if you 're really interested to get into the nitty-gritty of the actions if you go to anitcher j which is the practice notes you 'll see more detail around what that action is all about so in terms of promoting community stewardship we 'll be partnering with community groups particularly with landcare groups like the manning turtle conservation group um and with hana local land services our partner and i will be developing a whole range of education programs thinking about building understanding um commitment and those positive values and um giving people the skills they need to use the river responsibly uh we 'll be restoring coastal wetlands so those coastal wetlands are listed under the state environmental planning policy for the coastal management act and some of them are on acid soils and high priority acid soils some of them aren 't so we 'll be addressing um coastal wetland restoration across the board we 'll be addressing flood plain drainage and remediat remediating acid sulfate soils council has a long history of doing this particularly with big swamp and cat eye wetlands and we of that we 'll be working with land holders in partnership to restore riparian vegetation and it 's not just about um restoring it it 's also also about looking at you know can we create riparian reserves are there areas of public land that we could um use as you know best practice for riparian restoration and finally promoting sustainable agriculture and within our reference group there was a really strong kind of interest in regenerative farming and a lot of interest in that in our community it 's about restoring soil organic soil carbon pasture cover and that gives us a win because it it stops that diffuse um runoff that takes the farmer 's fertilizer that he spent money on straight down into the river during a rain event the plan does include a business plan so um under the coastal management act we have to put in a 10 year business plan so it does have budget against it and we do have firm commitments from council and some of the other lead agencies for that expenditure so it 's not just a plan that 's a legislative responsibility to implement this plan and we 'll be as alicia said kicking that off as soon as it 's adopted we 're starting to get ready for that now and we really look forward to working a lot more with the community in that implementation phase in a really you know ongoing and meaningful way we have council funds allocated to the plan so that comes from the environmental rate and the stormwater charge and we also have identified cost sharing so hana local land services is a great partner we have a memorandum of understanding in place with them and they 're putting in a significant amount of funds into this program some of it coming through the marine estate management strategy and as i said we 'll be applying for uh two for one funding through the coaster nester program run by the department of planning industry and environment so all together we 're aiming for for every dollar council spent we 'll be getting three dollars from our other partners uh just a bit about consultation so we have consulted with a range of some public events we had about 250 people involved in workshops and pop-up surveys and roaming surveys and online surveys around values we had a big risk assessment process and we talked with farmers and council stakeholders and our reference group we 've also consulted with the birapi community and with community interest groups um so right through the whole process we 've done consultation um but throughout the exhibition we 're really looking to talk with some more groups and also i 'm hoping to receive submissions so what 's our community telling us um the top three values through our quantitative survey were aquatic ecosystem health visual amenity and culture and spiritual value of the river and people understood that um all the other values stem from having a healthy ecosystem whether that 's economic values recreation tourism and so on so yeah there was a really clear understanding of that in the community some of the people told us um they love the wildlife the the birds the fish the dolphins people get blown away seeing dolphins run up atari and someone also said you know there great great grandparents who farmed this land lived worked and relaxed along the river so there 's a really strong connection to the river we engaged an agricultural consultant and he interviewed 24 farmers in depth and we asked the farmers about the barriers that they find to taking up good environmental practice and also what are their drivers and motivators and what we heard from that consultation is that farmers are willing to improve their environmental practices but they want it to have a whole farm planning benefit and to have benefits to their productivity and farm management we engaged jody laura at the left there to consult with the burepah community and their concerns were very much the same as the wider community they 're concerned about ecosystem health about acid events and pollution they 're concerned about flow and maintaining natural flow rates and they 're concerned about access and recreational access we had a fantastic reference group so you can just see a few of them here we had four farmers on that group um peter longworth in the front we had dairy and beef farmers community representatives um you can see tony wales there who 's in a coast care group um so we had a really good mix of people and you can see and chris one thing he said was you know people will move here and invest here if they know we 're committed to looking after the river and we also did a lot of stakeholder consultations so that included a technical advisory group of experts there 's a lot of council teams involved this isn 't about silos it 's not just natural systems we 're running this across council we did consultation with our partner agencies and we also had a lot of peer review processes in place we 've also started consulting with community interest groups and we 're looking forward to doing more of that over the coming weeks so we 've talked with women in dairy and we 'll be seeing them again soon the manning river turtle conservation group hosted us um to run a little workshop with them i 'll be meeting with new south wales farmers association today and we 're going to fish in the coming couple of weeks so if there 's anyone here from those groups thanks so much for your interest we 're really looking forward to hearing more about what you have to say look i might just mention and um just before we close that this plan doesn 't go right down to the entrance i 'm meant to say it only covers from two kilometers inland and up um so we 've got another plan we 're developing um which will be the old bar manning point uh coastal management program um the reason we 've split that off and doing the separate one is because um old bar and manning point are listed as erosion hot spots by the state government and they have a lot different um processes happening there with coastal inundation and erosion um so yeah we felt like we needed a special plan just to deal with those issues so this plan is more yeah from two kilometers inland and all the way up so get involved thank you so much for coming to the webinar um as alicia said this to have your say you can firstly make a submission i 'm going to be cheeky and say um you know sometimes we get to submissions that are people firstly with good suggestions and that 's something we really want um any sort of input that you 've got knowledge gaps that you can see in the in the plan very happy to hear that and um we 'll look at addressing all of those concerns and reporting back um but sometimes we tend to get more um critical submissions and it 's really important that if you do support having a whole catchment program in place for the manning that you let us know that too because um when we 're taking it through council that 's what will help us get it adopted and get those council uh investment you can come and chat with us we 're running drop-ins in tari wingham and gloucester and those dates and times are on our website and also on that webpage you can subscribe to our our manning river newsletter and that 's where you 'll find out about projects encourage you to get involved and participate in projects as they start to be developed and we 'll be consulting more just on the projects as we we 're planning them out so this is our web page it 's council 's website and forward slash our manning river _"

    "text": "[Music] [Music] hello everybody i 'm sure more are joining us but i 'll start the ball rolling because i 'm sure you 're all keen as mustard for this last session of the year to to get to hear the reading and writing experiences of both carly and annie my important role right now is to do an acknowledgement of country and it 's a very important role i acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet the gut hung speaking people and pay my respects to all aboriginal and torres strait islander people who now reside in munich 's council area and i extend my respect to all elders past present and emerging thank you nina over to you thanks so much chris and hello to you all and welcome to our very last about a book for this year my name is kanina may and i 'm a local author to mid coast libraries my two books are the one and all we have is now and it 's great to see so many of your faces up on the screen tonight and i yet to put their their screens on because you 're all in such good habit of doing it already which is fantastic um we will have a few more people joining us tonight and um i might have to remind and remind them to put their screens on too so lovely authors know that they 're not alone and just talking into cyber space so since our last catch up our local area has been slammed by covert 19 schools have been closed on and off throughout our lga year groups have had to stay home and isolate and i 've just had all three of my kids home for almost two weeks after a case which i must say was much worse than lockdown um isolation was tough with them not being able to leave the house and we used to bike ride and beach walk and everything like that during all the lockdown so this isolation was a whole new kettle of fish so i 'm sure that there are plenty of people who are ready to call it a year um but tomorrow is december we 've a good thing right so it 's busy but there 's always plenty of fun to be had in december and so tonight you might be after some book recommendations to add to your christmas wish list or maybe you 're looking for some present ideas or maybe you 've got some time coming off some time off coming up and want to be prepared with a big pile of books to read if you 're at home and you 've read something great recently and want to share with our readers be sure to pop it into the chat and let them know we 've got two fabulous authors and special guests here tonight to tell us about their own books and what books they 've also loved you 've just met chris jones who is the manager of midcoast libraries and later this evening both chris and myself will give you one of our book recommendations we 're joined by carly lane author of 18 novels including her brand new once burnt twice shy this gorgeous book which officially came out today so happy launch day to carly such a long backlist that i don 't even know which number how many books she 's got but she 's been promoting her latest release osprey reef is it in the right angle welcome to you both our first guest is carly lane who lives not far from us on the mid north coast carly is a proud mum to four children and wife of one very patient mechanic she is lucky enough to spend her days doing just the things she loves being a mum and writing story set in beautiful rural australia carly is well known for her rural romance stories but she also writes romantic suspense family saga and women 's fiction if you have any questions for carly pop them into the chat function and we will get to them i 'll now hand you over to carly to tell us a little bit more about her own books along with some of her book recommendations i 'll also pop in a link to her website thank you carly hi everyone it 's a little bit exciting it 's it 's my release day so little while um my latest books called once burnt twice shy and it 's actually um i wrote this while we 're in lockdown um about our 2019-2020 fires that went through our area but through most areas in australia anyway so i think there 's a lot of communities that can probably relate to the things that i 've got in the book that happened around my area so i kind of wanted to not focus so much on the fact that there were fires and that but more so on the community and how everybody seemed to pull together and there was people coming out as these unsung heroes everywhere places you sort of wouldn 't expect and how our businesses and um community organizations all joined together it was just really heartening to see and um yeah it just made me want to try and capture some of those moments instead of there was just so much sort of gloom and doom about it and it is still hard to sort of um i guess writing it i found it really hard sometimes to actually write even things were still really quite sensitive not and things that you don 't sort of think would be but they seem to sneak up on you so i think it 's something that 's going to take a long time for people to sort of um react to without getting too emotional about it but i 'm hoping that the book isn 't going to focus too much on too many of the sad things but more um i guess encourage people to remember how lucky we were and how wonderful our community really really is and i suppose lot of communities around australia would have been the same so yeah and it gets to feature my guinea fowl which people who follow me on facebook have been saying i need to put them in something so i 'd already put them in this which is lovely um dave makes an appearance and yeah it was lovely because i could actually make them behave themselves in the book which i can 't do in real life so i kind of miss that now that i 'm not writing about my 's out now and i 'm hoping it gets to most places i 've been hearing a few things about the delivery times are affecting books being distributed so i 'm hoping my book gets out and about there somewhere but we 'll just have to keep our fingers crossed i guess um and when i was asked to come on this it was a bit of a shock because i had to figure out what books i 'd been reading and i have um really not been reading that much lately but i have found a few that i remember were kind of momentous so i thought i 'd put those in and mention some of those with you um i 've just long the beginning of this month been down to orange with i don 't know if anyone knows kim kelly she 's an australian author she had a lot of stuff come out in the early 90s in particular and has been still writing and re-releasing a lot of her back title we were supposed to meet at um the muji festival this year that got my wine over that i can tell you now i was really looking forward to that but um so she decided that we should probably just do a small little tour we did orange and molong um i went out to parks and visited some family in that out there so that was really lovely um and one of her books that i 'd read just prior to going out was called this red earth which is she 's got new covers on her books at the moment so she 's got a whole heap of her back list re um republished and this um it has part of the story centered in new guinea and it was interesting because at the time i was writing my next book which will be out in may i think um and some of that storyline takes place in world war ii in papua new guinea and it actually centers on one of the battles that i didn 't think anyone really else well not no one knew about but i haven 't seen it really anywhere and it 's in her book and went oh my goodness i know about this and everything she wrote was stuff that i 'd been researching and reading it was so lovely to come across something that i was really interested in my book doesn 't necessarily go into the depth that hers does with her research she sort of focused most of her book on that but um i did particularly want my character to be involved in the luck force battle which was a really really horrible battle over there with the australian force and something that i found so interesting to research so i 've wanted to include that in my book which i did um did have a small moment of panic when i came across my last lot of edits and realized my dates that i 'd written in all these journals earlier in the book did not match up to the battle and i was a little bit devastated because i really loved all these letters i 'd written so i had to kind of do some quick mathematical reworking which is not my forte um but i think we now which is really good and really relieved they picked that up when they did um yeah so that was really interesting with that one and i really loved her story it was lovely to be caught up in that era and the other one this was the other one i 'm really sad about uh matt nable this is him he might recognize him if you don 't know him he 's on lots of um tv series and things i didn 't actually know he wrote books and when i got invited to maji found out i was going to be on a panel with him and i was so excited oh my god hubba hubba and went out and bought his book and read it so i 'd be really clever and be able to talk about his book with him and then it was cancelled and i still didn 't get to go and see him so i was really cranky about that but anyway the book is really good actually um and it 's sort of more of a crime detective police thing set in really interesting nice um atmosphere type thing um what was the other one um danielle hawkins when it all went to custard i think annie was actually talking about this one too i hadn 't read any of her books but i i 've seen her around and i have not read anything until i picked this one up actually it was an ebook loved it it was so funny and it 's so rural and covers so much stuff that 's just so everyday on a farm type thing so it was really lovely i loved her writing i loved her humor which was really lovely and the other one was who 's the other one the um yeah oh the mom who got back her life fiona gibson this one i found out by accident when i was looking through um just ebooks and she 's a english author but she lives in scotland and at the time i 'd just come back from scotland and i was in the middle of writing my take me home that was set in scotland so i was everything scotland so reading and taking in and her book came during the first lockdown and i 've got to say it was so lovely to be reading something that was funny and light and um very i guess chickly in a way but it 's her characters usually are a little bit older so this one focuses on kids that have left home and now you 've found yourself in an empty nest i 'm kinda sorta like that my three older kids are left home but i still got one in high school so i 'm kind of i kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel but um it was really good and really funny really light and i just really liked the whole concept of reading something like that during a really hard time actually like that first lockdown was really quite weird didn 't do much writing then so i did lots of reading but um there they were they were my reads that sort of stood out for all different reasons thanks so much carly and you did you did a variety two different interests now i wanted to ask you you 've had 18 books come out in 10 years meaning that you 've often had two books come out in one year can you please share your secrets with us of getting that many words down and what does your writing routine look like chaos absolute chaos um look honestly i know it sounds really impressive if i didn 't know me i would be really impressed too but i think what happened was when i had sent my first book in i 'd already had like another two one one finish and i was writing one didn 't know what i was doing and they 're probably really quite rough and crappy but i had them there and so i sent them in sort of pretty much straight after the north star so they kind of were already in the process of putting them through i think the first two years i only or two or three years there was only one out a year like a normal person and then they suddenly thought well we 've got this one here one in december and then that just kept going forever so i don 't know i didn 't technically agree to this i don 't know how i got myself into this mess but as long as i kept ahead it seemed to be okay because i was just writing like normal and i had that little sort of buffer between me and the other books so yeah it sounds pretty cool but it 's just that i 've just got to keep writing and not fall behind which i did earlier in the year and was not good what does your day-to-day writing routine look like do you write every day or do you have certain hours i like to write every day sometimes that doesn 't happen i was a lot more um treating it like a job like i 'm supposed to before my second eldest child came home with her grandbaby with my grandbaby and now it 's a case of come to coughs come and do some shopping do this do that and i do find myself thinking holy crap i haven 't written for had to try and put some boundaries in place um which don 't always work but normally i will try to get a full day writing usually when my youngest goes to school and then i sort of finish when she gets home or if she goes into a room as a teenager and shuts a door i get my computer out because you know i don 't feel lonely then but anyway so yeah i um usually just write whenever i get the chance now but i don 't try i try not to write on weekends and stuff and still treat it as a bit of a job well i 'm still impressed even though you say that it 's not impressive i think it 's very impressive still and so you 've written so many books that would be classified as a rural romance over the years do you do you find it hard coming up with new ideas set on the farm or it 's you find that abundance well i think the trick goal for me is i don 't want to write the same a plot that i can do differently so if i did have a farm set book in one i tend to try and do something a little bit different set in town or whatever and that 's the beauty of rural fiction like you can rule is such uh it 's not just a farm it 's not just a farmer it 's a community or a small town and sometimes they 're quite close to big towns and sometimes they 're on the coast and sometimes they 're inland so it 's quite a variety that we can work with which is really lovely so i try to use that um that scope as much as i can so that i 'm not stuck into a rut with writing like the same book sort of thing but i mean it just depends sometimes i do three or four farms in a row because it 's just the story that comes to me but um yeah i do try to spread it out a little bit that 's impressive too thank you all right well thank you carly and if pop them in the chat um oh actually lynn has just said anyone who has not read poppy 's dilemma i think this is carly 's best work and a great read if you have have a comment or a chat or a question pop it in like lynn has just done and we 'll um get carly to answer your questions but for the time being we 're going to move over to our second guest annie seton who 's not far up the highway from cali about 15 minutes they 've just said and they 're not far from us on the mid north coast or in atari and all bar and wherever else everyone is here tonight she lives in annie lives in beautiful coastal in a beautiful coastal location and jam packs her day with writing and holiday adventures annie has enjoyed many careers including a research librarian a high school principal and a university tutor and he took an early retirement to fulfill a long life dream of writing full time annie and her husband pack up every winter in their caravan and head north beauty and history of the landscape and puts new stories to paper annie is a hybrid author meaning that she is both traditionally and self-published this also means she 's a very very busy lady she actually has such a long list of titles that i actually couldn 't figure out how many books she 's published so i will get her to tell you and once again if you have any questions for any be sure to pop them in the chat as well so i 'll now hand you over to annie to tell us a little bit more about her own books along with telling us which books we need to add to our to be read piles thanks annie thanks kanina thanks for having me here today on midcoast libraries it 's a pleasure to be here now when you ask how many books i think it 's 53 i think i keep saying to people i 'll count them i know there 's 70 or 75 different entities because as well as having um the individual books i 've got translations i 've got audio i think the story that i 'm currently writing is number 53 but i will i promise i will do that so i know how many books i 've written i started writing 11 years ago when i retired from my job as a high school principal i worked part-time as a university tutor for a couple of years and started writing and never dreaming that i would be successful it was just i wanted to have a go at writing the stories that i always wanted to write so you know to get 53 out there and to have contracts with print publishers digital publishers in the us and then also start my own independent independently published career has been a very busy 11 years um osprey reef that you held up before and i 'll hold up here now came out on the 27th of october in ebook and it 's to talk about carly 's dilemma with books it 's still struggling to get to um bookstores in queensland three weeks later so um there is an issue with delivery at the moment but for some reason if you 're watching there should be stock in big w 's as well as releasing osprey reef which i 'll tell you about in a moment um three weeks ago in the last um two weeks i also released mary and haste which was the second book in my richards brothers series and i released the fourth book in my time travel series love across time which is the fourth and final book which is a real favorite of mine so it 's been a busy few weeks in terms of release and promotion and zoom meetings and talking and posting out print copies for my independent bookstore but osprey reef is the one i 'd like to talk about tonight um like all of the books i 'm going to talk about um as being favorites family is very important to me and i seem to have this common thread in my books where it 's all about family and issues um you know with grief and loss and happiness and tragedy um seems to get all mixed up in what the publisher has christened my eco adventure around i 'll find a setting we didn 't travel out to osprey reef because it 's 200 nautical miles offshore but my husband was my research assistant for that one and he did the actual on ocean in boat research i did all the research into my heroine who was the commercial shipping captain and into the various environmental issues that are covered in osprey reef one of them is climate change and coral bleaching and i won 't tell you what the other one is because that 's the big cliffhanger at the end you 've got to read the book to see what the other um environmental issue is there and a lot of people have commented and not done spoiler reviews but said oh wow i didn 't see that coming so it 's been very well received and i loved writing it and [Music] because i loved being near the ocean so much it was a pleasure to write about the whitsundays again my previous best seller was with sunday dawn that came out in 2018 and again it was set up in the whit my next book that has now been accepted by the publisher is called easter valles and that will be out in november next year however before that comes out i smiled when carly said writing two books releasing two books a year i 've got a book out in february called um outback roads i 've got a book out in march called lara pinter which is the fifth book in the porter sisters series that 's been very popular fifth and final book i hope but readers keep writing to me and saying can we please have another one and um then the outback road series is a an outback series and i 'm planning to release a book every two months in an eight book series which will take me through the beginning of 2023 i did say when we were traveling this year that i was going to try and get a bit more of a life balance because i work fairly long days and seven days a week that did happen this year when we were away on our lovely five-month trip the problem was when 60 000 words of next year 's book so i had a very busy fortnight of trying to finish a book so my major goal is to have a life balance but that 's always overtaken by these stories that are crowding in my head that want to be written so i will get there one day but in terms of the books that i love to read it 's very interesting when i thought about it because i write across genres my books that are with harpercollins and were with pam mcmillan are primarily um well they 're all australian settings they always have an issue that threatens a landscape or an environment then they have characters that are facing certain dilemmas within their family or within romances or with relationships or from a tragedy and they all sort of come together and they 're very um character-driven family-oriented books solving a variety of mysteries my other genre that i love writing is time travel and my very first little novella that i wrote back in 2012 was a little time travel steampunk novella and i keep coming back writing is uh historical because my last three books i think have had a dual timeline they 've had a world war ii or a 1930s setting as well as the contemporary setting so when i started to think about what sort of books i like it 's books that encompass all of those things but are also very emotionally engaging and the four books that i want to talk about tonight um a book by amy harmon called what the wind knows i just stumbled upon that i 'd never heard of her and i was just i think it might have been on a 99 special on amazon and i bought it and i devoured it i loved it so much i then bought the print copy from the book depository in the uk because i think it 's independently published and i wanted to have my own print copy it starts off in contemporary new york and through going back to ireland to scatter her grandfather 's ashes the heroine somehow finds herself back in 1921 ireland very emotional very sad but very the most clever twist i still can 't get my head around what a wonderful job she did at the time travel i haven 't read any of her other books yet but they 're on my list to get to so what the wind knows is a beautiful read the other book that i really loved and i read on ebook and i don 't have it with me um tonight was a book by michelle montebello called beautiful fragile michelle is another independently published author and beautiful fragile was about a woman who wakes up in a hospital in spain and has lost 10 years of her life she has no idea who she is where she came from it turns out that she was a married woman in sydney with young children and it was such a riveting read i read it in one sitting because i wanted to know what happened and how she got there it was also a very emotional um book because with her lost memories she 'd forgotten 10 years and she had this family so it was about a rediscovery of love and about our very very satisfying read so i 've read quite a few of michelle 's other books because that one led me into it so beautiful fragile is a book that i loved i love to read books that make me cry i love to write books that make my readers cry but i also like to write and read books that have a laugh or an uplifting ending and one of my favorite us authors is an author called kristen higgins and i 've read probably 10 12 15 of her books over the last few years and still my favorite that i giggle at every time is a book called the best man about um a woman who was jilted at the altar years before when her fiance came out about his gay relationship actually at the altar before they 're about to get married and it was a very funny book there 's one scene in it that stays with me where she was trying to get away from somebody and climbed through the bathroom window she had spandex um tummy flattening pants on and got stuck in in her nemesis was the local policeman and he was actually sitting in the police car watching her try and get out of this window i laughed till i cried she 's got a real knack but in the next chapter something might happen and you will cry from the emotion and the grief of family so she 's got a very good twist on being able to combine those emotions my favorite book of all time and it is such a coincidence it was a book written in 1954 called catherine and it 's a beautiful historical novel by anya seaton and when you think of annie seton and anu seaton my pen name was really it 's coincidental because my real name is anne i sat for ages when i was trying to think of a pen name and it finally came to me that i was sitting in my chair looking out at the ocean and i write and live in my town by the sea so that 's where seton came from annie seton and then a few years later when i was asked in an i said anya seaton i thought wow isn 't that incredible but um catherine is the story said in the 14th century and it 's the story true story of john of gaunt and catherine swinford who was his mistress and who became the ancestors of the tudor line of kings and family um jeffrey chaucer who we 've all heard of was actually her brother-in-law in real life and it 's a beautiful historical tapestry that again makes you smile but predominantly cry because you know it 's a true story when i went to england the first time back in 1997 when our daughter was only a teenager we actually went to kennel worth castle and we 'd been to all the touristy type ones but we went to kennel worth which was just ruins and i stood there crying and kate said mum what 's wrong i said that 's the white tower that 's where blanche died john of gordon 's wife died up in that tower in 1400 and something and she 's just in the role so history is very important to me and think being able to get that emotion into my books and the historical timelines just fulfills that thing that i love to read and that i love to convey to my readers as well so well catherine is very hard to get i just saw a comment come up there i have four copies because i lent my copy to my mum oh probably 25 years ago and she lost it so every time i 'd see it at the second hand bookshop i 'd get another copy so i 'd always have a copy it was the only book that was ever confiscated off me in high school i was reading it in the maths lesson underneath the desk and i lost one copy like that the teacher took it off me and never gave it back so it 's a very special book to me so um that sort of all contributes to um what makes up my love of storytelling uh i can see michelle 's commented michelle montebello 's actually popped in tonight i told her i was going to talk about her book so it amy harmon and kristen higgins fabulous yes how lovely that we 've got michelle here tonight how lovely for you to be able to hear those beautiful kind words michelle i know and from annie satan that 's pretty impressive it 's just anything you do a very good sell annie i 'm sure lots of people were writing down names of the books that we 've been that have been recommended tonight and mary lou 's just commented here another author who said one of my writing friends leanne lovegrove tells me that you 're also a fabulous editor how much editing do you do for authors in my spare time which i have very little i do quite a bit of editing over the past 10 years i think i 'm up to about 300 clients of books that i 've edited all over the world i have clients from the uk the us australia and i love working with authors who are on their journey to publication and working with aspiring authors and giving them advice i 've eased off i had eased off the editing fair a heavy writing schedule but um when we 're away i kept getting emails from people saying um you know are you available for editing and i kept saying oh yes but not until november when we 're home and i 've got my deadlines met and i didn 't realize that i had booked five edits in november so i 've been very busy editing i 've just done one for an author in florida um one who i 've been editing for six or seven years and i 've done three new zealand um authors i 've got one i 'm in the middle of at the moment and i 'm also editing a memoir about the vietnam war from a gentleman that i 'm really enjoying and he 's two of the um five clients have also asked me to do the covers for their books because i 've got a cover creation business as well so um yeah i do a fair bit of editing to answer mary lou 's question so annie what tips do you have to um to make the most of our four hours a night oh my goodness it comes with getting older when your children grow up and leave home and your grandchildren only visit occasionally and your husband 's retired um you don 't need as much sleep i don 't think i don 't think i don 't as i get older i generally work till habits 10 11 at night i 'll probably do some editing tonight oh actually no i 've got to be sociable fiona_._2016.96 i forgot about that and um then when i go to bed 11 or 12 i might read till half past 12 1 past one if it 's a really good book it could be two o 'clock and then i 'm generally awake at six of the morning and race around do a few of the chores and i 'm i try to be at my desk by eight o 'clock every morning so um yeah it 's a busy life but i love it you certainly do um and i know that you 're always very full of ideas so how do you choose what to write first writing three books at the moment simultaneously and people say to me but how can how do you not get them mixed up and i use the analogy that if you go and visit jim and mary down in such and such a street and then you go and visit your aunt and uncle in the other suburb you know who they are and where they live and what their lives are and that 's what my books are to me i know who i 'm visiting sometimes though when i 'm in a panic i will forget a character 's name and i 'll pause as i 'm typing and think who is he what 's his name i 'm terrible with eye color because i don 't keep any character notes or worksheets or plots or anything it 's all in my crazy head and sometimes or quite a few times i 'll be writing about eyes and i think what color and i 've got to do a search through my manuscript to see what color eyes i 'd give them the hero or the heroine back write i think i will do a character sheet next time but i still haven 't got there what about you carly do you use character sheets and plotting notes not really although i have because of that very thing that drives me nuts i have tried to um write them down just in a notebook as i go but but then you leave the notebook in another room and you 're already sitting there and the cat 's on your lap and you can 't get up so i just usually leave that blank and come back to it one other day um allison 's also said carly i really wish i could have seen you when you visit when you visit south australia on the on the tour so we 're going to south australia yeah in january yeah it was so funny because we started mate well i had really nothing to do because i don 't know any of the places down there so um leone was sort of making these places and she had this big itinerary and i was there for like i don can 't stay that long so she 's condensed it right down and there 's still like i don 't know five or six i know seven libraries we 're going to so they 're kind of in a bit of a loop so we can get back in time to go but yeah for a bit there i wasn 't sure if i was going to book it or not because i didn 't know what 's going on with covert and stuff i still don 't know we 've booked it all but we 'll just see what happens yeah it 's such a big place too it 's really hard to sort of cram sort of them in any other way but yeah i hope you might be able to make it make it make a day trip over a night trip overnight trip there you go allison you 've got a goal from carly himself all right um i 'll just jump over to do my recommendation now and i 've just popped in the link to my newsletter in the chat and normally each month um our guest our guest i guess new release book so you would have been able to win one of carly and his books but this month is a little bit different so if you would like to win either of these these gorgeous books once burnt twice shy and osprey wreath be sure to follow me on ins facebook and instagram as i have a very i have lots of exciting well sorry a huge giveaway coming up for the second year running i 've got to 12 days in 12 days of christmas starting tomorrow i 've got 12 books to give away and so i 'll just pop those links to if you 're wanting to um if you 're wanting to enter there 'll be daily daily announcements and then each night a new winner will be announced now sorry i feel like i 've got stuff going on everywhere i 'm just getting up the picture of my book um because i listen to this one on audio so i 'm going to recommend the midnight library by matt hague so recently i was toying talking to a friend about it they mentioned that the premise of it reminded them of the midnight library and this isn 't what you want to hear as an author that the idea has already been done but i have to say that i absolutely loved this book now it came out in august last year and i had seen that it had been doing quite well but if i 'm honest the cover hadn 't really appealed to me so i read the blurb after speaking to my friend and i 'll suck straight in and immediately thought this is exactly my kind of book so the main character nora is struggling with depression and after overdosing she finds herself in a place called the midnight library it 's a space between life and death where she gets to reimagine her life if only she 'd made different decisions along the way in the midnight library nora is guided by her school library and mrs elm who she loved daily years before as a child and nora explores different lives she might have lived if she had pursued go from one extreme to the other um so before she found herself in the midnight library nora had been a swimmer a musician an animal lover and a fiancee and then once she 's in the midnight library she travels down all of these roads again to see what her life might may have looked like so the author explores regrets and roads not chosen every day we make choices and i love that nora got to experience other lives to ultimately see her root like her original life with different eyes the concept is something that many of us would have thought about before what if we had made that decision and it 's a reminder of the importance of appreciating where we are right now today so i was surprised that i did see a few bad reviews on this one and there is there is a comment for aussies that will probably grate on them because they go one of the characters goes from brisbane to byron bay via cross harbour so all of us on the mid north coast will go no what are you the brilliant story and i 'm not the only one that did enjoy it it was a new york times bestseller it was selected as a book club pick for good morning america and was the winner for goodreads choice award for fiction so i 've listened to it on audiobook and found the narration brilliant and i must say i got to tick off lots of jobs which is also during isolation which is an added bonus of being able to be immersed in a story when you get to do the washing up at the same time so i definitely recommend that you add this one to your list now i 'll quickly before we move on to you chris i might just ask carly and annie another question i 'd like each of them to answer what is your favorite thing about the writing process does anyone have an idea that they want to jump in first or should i pick you can pick all right carly what 's your favorite thing about the writing process oh there 's so many i should know this thing like up as a question i don 't i think i love just that initial getting everything down on the page because i don 't plot i think sometimes i can just put it out and it sort of all flows from your head and it 's all sort of jumbled up but it 's really exciting when you see it sort of start to take shape or a character starts to sort of tell you what they are and who they are and where you should be going and that 's always really cool because sometimes i have no idea what the characters are doing or what they 're going to turn out to be i love when they do finally tell you what they want to be wow that 's lovely what about you benny what 's your favorite part of the writing process there 's two parts for me and that 's exactly one of them um where the characters take me and i think people who are readers and who don 't write find it very hard to understand that the characters do their own things because out of our imaginations it 's coming through our fingertips into the keyboard so a reader will say to me but surely you know you know you 're making it up but your characters take on a life of their own and they do their own things and sometimes oh i didn 't know that was going to happen it 's a it 's a very hard process to explain so yes i love when my characters start to run and that 's when the story really starts to roll for me the other thing that i really love about the writing process and i don 't know how unusual i am in this because i hear so many authors say they hate being edited they hate it when their edits come in i love the editing process it might be because maybe i 'm an editor and i like doing it for other people but i find when you write your own stories it 's very hard to look at it from an editorial point of view so when my book goes to editing i mean there are things stick my digs in and say no i want that to stay but on the whole i usually give my editors a really big wrap in the acknowledgements because i think they polish your work they take that rough piece of work that you think oh yeah well the story 's all done now that 's good but when the editor looks at it with a keen eye and makes suggestions they will take that rough stone and polish it into a jewel and hopefully um make it an even better book than hopefully that we might have thought it was so yeah the editing process is something i really enjoy i love getting edits in oh goody what have they had to say mind you the first time i got edits from pam mcmillan for kakadu sunset which was my first book in the stores it was a 15-page letter telling me what was wrong with every chapter i cried i cried for about two hours and then um i got into the editing of it and i could really see what the it was a male editor what um that didn 't have one mark in it and i thought oh he 's forgotten to read this one he hasn 't changed anything and i flick through the pages and i got to the last page and he said that was an absolutely perfect chapter he said i couldn 't improve it it was almost a cinema cinematic that 's a word he said it was like a movie running in front of my head and it was a very suspenseful um chapter from an initiate point of view and that made me feel better after the 15 pages that made me cry but yeah it 's a part of the process i love thank you annie and so carly and he said before that the setting usually comes first for her so when you are writing a story do the characters the setting or the complication is that what comes first for you very much depends on what i think of sometimes yes i 'm not it 's all over the place for me sometimes i can start in the middle of a book with a a start with a character because i want them to do a certain thing or be in a certain situation but then you 've got to figure out who else has got to be around them and what all the problems are so often it just depends it really does if i 'm sitting at a blank screen sometimes that 's really daunting so it 's nice when i get just anything really to go with something to start with all right thank you now i 'm going to hand over to chris for your for your recommendation of the month thank you very much carl uh kanina and i 'm going to sneak in two um which is kind of traditionally what i do anyway and can i just say as you spoke about what 's the most exciting or rewarding part of the writing process interestingly enough it 's also the most exciting part of the reading process as a reader i can say i love it when i find where the characters take me so thank you for those journeys um i have um and i have to it costs um from brisbane to um yeah um it reminded me i was in armadale [Music] a while ago must have been about winter time and i ended up to drive from armadale to foster which should be about a three hour drive via newcastle uh which it felt a bit like that description there because the roads were snowed out so it was the longest drive i think i 've ever done for three hours worth of travel i 'm going to recommend two books so first of all my book club meets once a month and we read a title once a month and that primarily is about the limit of my reading allocation so for the for the month uh which is good it also challenges me and takes me to books that i would not have ever selected myself which i think is really important so the book that my book club did this month is it 's called the tattooist of ausfit and it 's written by heather morris now it 's actually a true account of lal or lail i 'm not quite and he he 's a jew from i think it 's bratislava and he ends up in auswitch and it 's his tale of survival in there it um it is really challenging it 's also very beautifully written and um he manages to to keep the horror not not so that it dominates the novel and [Music] um actually i shouldn 't say a novel it 's a it 's an auto by a biographical account of um love it 's really rich with love and survival and there is a woman that he meets called guitar and it 's about that relationship and all the other relationships he has with other people and how he how he survives and helps others and all the concerns people have too you know even surviving there 's this fear that you 're collaborating when actually you 're just surviving so quite an extraordinary normal i would have to say or as i said i have a morris wright um lale 's life story there or at least that part of it so i think um my book club will rate it amore towels by the way and it 's called the lincoln highway now the other one i 'm going to recommend it 's um i love supporting local authors any authors really but our local authors get a special mention and we have a local author who is whose name is a fan well i know it 's vanderbilty but the the name she writes under is vanda icemont she has written a children 's book and it 's about it 's actually about 2020 in the impact of the pandemic and the way the world suffered and um and how it came out the other side of it and the pandemic actually was a form of awakening for the planet which is the title of a novel there of all her book the awakening and we 're hoping to launch it in the coast libraries in january next year i was talking with vanda recently so you will be able to get that one from midcoast libraries when it 's out and you 'll definitely be able to borrow this one from the coast libraries because i did so back to you first of all can i thank you very much for doing the extraordinary job this year you always ask penetrating questions you always go great get great guests on board and it 's always an hour that just seems to fly by and i 'm going to say a very quick special thank you to midcoast libraries who 's there on the screen but you can 't see them and that 's trish hayes who has put all the work behind getting getting this up and running so you probably won 't thank yourself so i 'm gonna thank you thank you so much chris that is lovely and it 's i love being involved involved each month and being able to hear from other authors and hear about all their tips within the trade and i 've learned as i 'm sure many of our readers are that um many authors have such different approaches to the same to writing and it 's just fascinating hearing um how they what styles they like to write and how their writing days evolve and what they like about always fascinating and i 've got a comment here that says from um mari thank you annie for sharing your experience with editors and the editing process really interesting to hear that side of the process so yes i think authors always offer something different and it 's it 's lots of fun to hear about different genres as well um rosemary 's commented to you chris that um the tattoo of auschwitz was one of the best books she 's ever read and we also did that for my one of my book club reads and yeah it was fascinating wasn 't it and just such an emotive read and um someone was only telling me i think last week that is it correct there 's a sec as a second one is that right three and then then there 's a third one so i think the i had a moment there thanks mary lou that i was suddenly talking about the wrong book but yes this person told me that they actually liked the second one even better and were had put the third one on their you and she loves the format of these evenings also it wasn 't norm i can 't remember it wasn 't no it was lynn lynne says totally agree chris kanina oh thank you that you 're commenting me thank you she loves the session oh thank you everyone for your lovely comments um if anyone does quickly have a question for annie or kylie let us know otherwise oh cheryl said thank you and merry christmas to everyone happy new year take care and she also thought the tattoo to tattoo us was amazing as well it was a good read so i

mid coast libraries um these are my two books uh the one and all we have is now um this latest one is excitedly on sale across all digital platforms for only 3.99 as part of a kindle daily deal which is always nice okay so um only days after our last about a book event new south wales went into a statewide lockdown which meant that everyone in our local midcoast area we 've spent the last three and a half weeks in lockdown we understand that this is nothing compared to those in sydney and those surrounding areas also those in victoria and melbourne everyone our sympathies go out to you with the hard hard time that lockdown brings i know that some days are definitely better than others and um i hope that today this event brings a little bit of happiness event i just wanted to say a big congratulations to danielle donnelly who was the events manager for midcoast libraries and danielle and i were the ones that came up with this um the idea for this event um i wanted to so we 've been working together for over 12 months until she went off just recently on maternity leave um daniel recently just had um gave birth to a baby girl which was very exciting but unfortunately a week before um baby eva was born danielle 's partner jay had a cardiac arrest and was taken to sydney last week jo had a heart transplant and will stay in sydney um for the at least the next six months to recover for anyone that wants to donate to this course i personally will put a link in the call in the chat function to um the gofundme page because i know that a lot of you that do frequent mid coast libraries will know danielle personally and um yeah our hearts go out to her and everything that they 've been going through in recent weeks and months a big thank you to midcoast libraries who last week opened up a click and collect service i know that when i went up to collect my reserves uh there was a little line of eager readers at the little old bar branch so if you are a local member and want to reserve a book be sure to check out the click and collect service on the library 's website web website so any books that um mentioned tonight you can record you can go on and reserve it and it might be waiting for you within only a matter of days um it 's absolutely gone off so i went again today and paul christine was absolutely swamped she had staff everywhere yes and there was people buzzing for that hour trying to get it 's funny we 're not listed as essential services but there 's a whole segment of the community that think we are so oh well that 's right because books books bring us so much joy so um i hope that many are getting through pages uh during lockdown um i know that my book next to my bed sorry but i have a terrible habit of continuing to add to it and always thinking that i 'm going to go and get through them all um but i hope that for some of you that you can add some more books for those of you that who are finding it hard to concentrate on reading when there is so much going on into the world maybe these you can add these recommendations to future to be read piles when the world hopefully feels a little bit more normal if it ever will um either way we hope these recommendations offer you some excitement because isn 't it the best feeling when you open a brand new book oh sorry um one of my favorite things about speaking to so many aussie authors is always seeing how passionate they are about bringing their stories to life i 'm always proud to be part of such a supportive community where authors are continually continually giving each other 's praise so um before i welcome our guests i just wanted to thank you all for taking the time out of your night to support us and us the authors um and wonderful library events like this so tonight our guest authors are sophie green whose third book thursdays at orange blossom house came out in july of this year and we 're also joined by laney kelsey who i 'm going to call laney tonight because her name is a tongue twister and she says that she 's fine with laney his second royal romance book the waddle seat inn which also came out in july of this year so welcome to both of you thank you thank you so our first guest guest is author and publisher sophie green sophie is based in sydney and not only does she write fiction books for hachette she also works as a non-fiction publisher for them sophie has also written non-fiction books some of which are published under another name in her spare time she writes about country music on her blog sunburnt country music she has been practicing yoga since 1993 and teaching since 2002. sophie 's debut book the inaugural meeting of the fair vale the australian book industry awards for general fiction book of the year in 2018 and long listed for both the matt richard matt richard award for new up a new writer of the year 2018 and the indie book award for debut fiction 2018. the shelley bay ladies swimming circle was also a top 10 bestseller and she is currently promoting her latest released thursdays at orange blossom house which will no doubt be a bestseller too wow that was a lot of words to get out if you do have any questions for sophie be sure to pop them into the chat function and i will get to them i 'll also pop in the link to sophie 's new book and for any of you that are part of our part of um book clubs both her first two books are um on the catalog on the catalog for book club sets at through our library my my book clubs done both of them and both loved them so over to you now sophie thank you very much to canada and thank you midcoast libraries for having me people on the lower north shore of sydney and i pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging uh my local library does not have click and collect so i i 'm holding on to three library books that i borrowed just before lockdown um and can 't get any more so they 're just going to sit there until the library reopens but um uh kanina suggests i do a bit of show and tell with my books i will hold up fair vale the inaugural meeting of the fairvale ladies book club or fairvale for short um which is set in the northern territory and as the title suggests is about a book club uh then that was followed by the shelley bay ladies swimming circle which um was partly inspired by the fact that uh i have a i swim regularly in fact i was swimming this morning in a wetsuit because the water is a bit cold but uh i swim regularly at a beach near me which is a harbour beach not a surf beach because i 'm too much of a chicken i wouldn 't swim laps out any further but i 've certainly observed a lot of people swimming over the years and thought there might be something in that so i wrote a book inspired by that and then thursdays at orange blossom house which is the new one has a yoga class as at its well at its center um but it 's not about yoga i 've been practicing as canada said for many years and i don 't think i 'd want to read a novel entirely about yoga but uh as a teacher i have seen so much change um and wonder and inspiration come out of yoga practice and felt it in my own life that i thought it would be interesting to work that into a story so the only character i 've ever written who 's remotely like me is actually the yoga teacher who 's in this book his name is sandrine but she 's not my personality she just says things that i have said while i 'm teaching because i figured i might as well use my own material for new for a teacher to say so um so it 's set in far north queensland starting in 1993 there are three main characters grace moored in her 70s patricia in her 40s and dorothy in her 30s and usually when i 'm writing a story once i have the place and the year i then just wait and see which characters turn up and i 'll make notes as they turn up but i basically issue an invitation who is around at that time in that place who would like to have this story told and sometimes it 's a process of elimination there are characters i don 't who come through i don 't quite resonate with um some characters i put aside for other stories i have one male character who 's been following me around for years i just haven 't_''_635.44 put him in a story yet so um so sometimes things like that pop up but usually i just i need that sense of place first fairvale certainly arose out of place i was on a bus traveling from catherine to darwin in the northern the light was changing and uh started to look out the windows of the bus there was no light in the bus so i was scrolling in this notebook so i could barely see making notes about the what i was observing in the landscape and everything went from that actually and as i said chili bay was inspired by being at my local swimming place and looking around and seeing what people are up to i think the last two books have also been influenced by my interest in in bodies actually and and using them and the secrets they hold part of what inspired shelley bay was my my friendship with my best friend we met playing tennis um in a group lesson and we still play tennis against each other once a week when i 'm actually legally allowed to go to the tennis court which is not at the moment because it 's outside the 5k limit but um we are really interested in thrashing each other and our friendship evolved out of that and that sense that we could come to love each other so activity that was really interesting to me um and so i just i just i didn 't think a book about tennis would actually work so i made it swimming instead and the ladies in shelley bay certainly do find out about themselves and each other by testing themselves with an activity that is hard and similarly yoga practice is hard at least the way i was trained i first class i went into was not easy um in the days that i started practicing it was done in church halls mainly and there wasn 't a massive range of styles the way there are now um my teacher wanted me to start teaching and she nagged me for quite a few years about it and even by the time i started teacher training which was eight years after i 'd begun being a student there weren 't a lot of places to go and i did that teacher training in a community hall so yoga has evolved hugely over the last 20 years i 'd say there are lots of studios it 's a very uh different kind of remains for me is um is the sense of exploration and curiosity about the human body and what it can do and as i said the secrets it holds um and uh there was enough material for me to write a novel out of that so these women i think um they 're they 're quite different to other characters i 've written grace mord who opens the novel uh was the first character who came to me in each of my novels the first person who turns up for me is the person who gets the first chapter and she wasn 't that likable when i first met her and in fact i wasn 't sure if i would stick with her but she made herself likeable so she 's she 's managed to have a whole storyline in the book so um i 'll briefly i 'm just looking at the time because i also have three other books i 'd like to talk about um that are not mine but i came to writing [Music] basically cleared to writing fiction basically through writing about australian country music still do it i started it 10 years ago i 've was in a country music band covers band and we played at the tamworth country music festival and i was actually a real snob about country music even when i joined the band it was a friend 's band i was like oh yeah i 've always wanted to be in band and then we went to tamworth and i just could not believe the breadth of storytelling that was going on was one thing um and the breadth of talent and the depth of talent and i was a complete convert and then ten years ago i started to write um uh after i had to stop um practice had to stop practicing and teaching yoga very suddenly because i was very very sick and i took months to recover so uh i needed a creative outlet and writing about country music seemed accessible to me i could do it from bed so um that 's what i started doing and 10 years later i 'm still doing it and these days i don 't go chasing those comes into my inbox publicist send me things uh so it 's a great privilege i think to find out about all those great australian stories in song which is how i think of country music and every time i 'm in tamworth i think these tens of thousands of people are here in the january heat because they want australian stories and it 's the biggest australian storytelling festival actually because it 's it 's mainly australian artists so that 's my little plug for you to go to tamworth if you 've never been but i will now switch to talking about some other australian stories um so of the books that i 'm recommending tonight to are australian by australian authors and one is by an american so the first book i 'll talk about is actually the only one i have in print because i read the other two as e-books so this is anita heiss 's uh villa yarada gallandrai which is also river of dreams is the english title and it has a lovely cover so if you like artifact the artifact of the bit of spot uv as it 's known um on the cover uh to bring out an illustration that is there so some of you will be familiar with anita heiss 's work she 's written quite a few novels as well as some non-fiction um she 's the waraju woman and she has written there is veradry language in this novel it is a great big historical epic so if you like really big meaty stories of um with lots of historical detail of family stories love story this is one for you to get your teeth into uh it 's starts with the gundagai flood of flood of 1852 and anita 's done a lot of research um around that area and um delved into all sorts of library archives which she mentions at the back of the book if you 're interested in the research side but i think it 's just yeah it 's one for people who love a big story like if you want a lot of meat on the bone and you 're in your stories i think um this is one that anita 's other work i think she 's a really versatile great writer really fantastic at developing characters setting place and really keeping you in the story so um she really understands that that craft of storytelling so that you don 't feel like a minute of your time is wasted so you really can dive into the world she 's created i think and enjoy that so um that 's anita heist uh another australian author i wanted to talk about is nadi simpson who wrote a book called song of the crocodile which was long listed for the miles franklin award and uh it 's been it 's been on all sorts of other awards short listings i think it won something recently um nadia is you alright woman and there is language in that book and nadi is a member of a band called the stiff jinns and some of you may know the stiff gin 's work they haven 't released any music for a while but she said recently that they are working on some and i mentioned the music because i think nadi 's this story so it 's another epic but so different to anita 's books i don 't want to say every epic and book is like another um i think nadi 's book is really about love that transcends time it 's about country family it 's a lot of pain in it but also a lot of wonder and i think it 's not about it 's not timeless so much as without time and that 's not to say that it 's not set in a particular point in time because it is and it 's because it 's multi-generational storytelling you feel where you are and within the history of this country but there are also elements about it that feel timeless and feel like that could take place at any any point in the universe really and she just has this way of of weaving this story so that it feels like a tapestry but also is multi-layered um and it 's quite an art so at certain points you can feel like you 're in a dream reading that book and then at some other i think she 's a wonderful storyteller both in music and in prose form and so that 's song of the crocodile by nadi simpson and then the last one to mention is by an american writer curtis stittenfeld who some of you will know from her first book which was called prep which i have to say i didn 't like that much but it got a lot of attention at the time it was published and i didn 't like it to the point i didn 't hate it but i just didn 't go seeking out anything else then actually in my local library i borrowed american wife which was her second novel it was the second novel maybe third um and i didn 't realize when i read it that it was actually about laura bush who is the wife of george dub president george w bush and the reason why i mentioned that novel is because the novel i wanted to talk about to you tonight is rotten which is her latest book and that is about hillary clinton so curtis has obviously developed an not in the way you 'd expect so american wife is actually an amazing piece of work it 's looking at laura bush 's life and and her husband 's life from very much from her perspective and it 's it 's a very interesting heartfelt book um rotten looks at what hap would have happened if hillary had not married bill clinton so it 's based on their real lives off to a certain point but you don 't feel like you 're reading any kind of biography it 's so it 's a really engrossing story about uh what hillary could have done who she would have been um if she hadn 't not only married bill but been caught up in a lot of the naughty things shall we say from which he 's become known as which he became known as president um and and which linger over him still to a great extent so really fascinating uh exercise curtis is a very restrained writer except she writes these quite big books so it 's not as if it 's very sparse i think she just disciplined in how she writes she also wrote for those of you who love pride and prejudice she wrote a book called eligible which was she was approached to write it wasn 't her idea it is a modern uh retelling of pride and prejudice and again i was a little skeptical i loved it i just thought it was so funny and charming and she just did it in exactly the right way so if you like pride and prejudice as i said eligible by curtis sittenfeld but she also writes great short stories so she 's a very interesting writer i think in any of her works you could find a story that that would uh help you pass the time let 's put it that way and i think that 's mixed that for me my time is up i 'm looking at the time thinking that 's it oh the time is fine thank you so much sophie um i 've got here that both um susan and jenny have both used the click and collect service which is great and also susan said that um books and loved it and she 'd love to see the newest one put into the collection now i recently listened to a podcast interview that you did sophie with may linnell on the words and nerds podcast and was blown away by everything that you fit into your life your full-time job uh your country music blog yoga swimming tennis just to name a few things i want to know how do you fit writing fiction into your everyday life do you have a specific routine or does it just something that comes naturally i should point out that i don 't have children so that is one way i fit in a lot of these things because i am perfectly aware that women who have children who are running households with other people in them have a ton of work to do which can really get in the way of of creative pursuits um in particular so for writing well before our lockdown last year my routine was actually writing on public transport before and after work so i thought that was the way to do it and uh i started writing orange blossom house when we were in lockdown and obviously no public transport to work because we were working from home so i thought okay well i better find a different way to do this so i just decided to do it right at the end of the day like nine o 'clock at night um i actually focused quite well at night so that was not an issue in terms of that i thought all right once like i 've done housework and other work and everything 's packed away from there i 'll just sit down and just go until i lose my concentration so i tend to write quickly and i realized recently that uh because i learnt touched typing in high school it actually helps when i 'm trying to fit in a lot of stuff because i can type quite quickly um i can get quite a bit done when i sit down to write so i don 't my writing sessions are not long um but i tend to push out quite a bit and then i 'll just keep left before a deadline to go over what i 've done um sometimes not so that 's that 's how i do it i 've got next year 's book i 've just received the structural edit on and i 'm working on that at the moment same routine night time i 'll just do about an hour and then i think that 's about as much as my brain can take um and then i also want to make sure i leave a little bit of time before i want to sleep um as we all meant to do with screens so that 's how i fit it in and it 's look i also don 't waste any time questioning my need to do it i just i just sit down like right that did now do it now so so you don 't you don 't necessarily have a word target it 's just until you run out of steam that yes in that particular day yeah essentially you say you write fast and can get lots of words down but you 've got to have the sleep with a lot of planning yeah i should have mentioned that i do a lot of planning i have multiple planning documents and i keep a color-coded grid with the characters in each character gets a color so i can see the flow of points of view and um and i will sometimes spend one of those writing sessions actually reworking the grid so because the characters will always surprise me so i 'll start writing something and then whatever i plan for that chapter may not happen um so i might think oh well i 'm gonna have to spend the next next um hour session or whatever it is just going over that grid and reworking things and that process will go on multiple times throughout writing and that i have these character profiles and all sorts of things to refer to so you are a plant like you 're a plotter then rather than a panther in terms of yes i think i i do not have time to answer that 's the that 's the trick yeah no i i have to i have to i didn 't plan quite as much and i ended up doing a lot of rewriting so in order to cut down on on the editorial side of things as well i found that planning works best yes fantastic the planning is always a nice idea but i do love a color coding and section that does make me feel more organized than sometimes i am um in the podcast you also disclose that you have finished book for which you 've just said now and that it will hit the shelves next to you and you revealed in this podcast that the storyline centers around music i 'm seeing that so far since your books have been about your own passions we 've had uh about books with the book club swimming yoga music is book number five going to be about tennis which you did mention no because i just think as i i think if i was going to make a book about tennis it would have been shelley bay um but i don 't i i am quite aware that tennis is a niche sport and i am so i don 't know that anyone wants to delve into the minutia of um 10 is quite the way i might go to if i were let loose in a novel about tennis mate well i must say sophie my husband and i had a tennis lesson today we prior to lockdown have been doing a bit of cardio tennis you know and um so we 've been hiring the courts and playing with the kids which is a bit frustrating but i 'm very much into tennis and i do wonder whether everyone 's interest will peak after leanne moriarty 's new book comes out because that 's about tennis stars i 'm pretty sure ah there you go so she 's dead so no point me running about tennis it 's been done by the master and christine says here oh great idea so if you love a color coded anything and fiona wrote what 's wrong with tennis i love it well no i love it too i just don 't think i don 't know that it would work well for a novel happily write about tennessee day if anyone lets me get started talking about it i 'll be here for two hours so yeah all right well thank you very much sophie and if you have any more questions just hope you pop them in and we 'll get to them but now we 're going to move over to our second guest laney which i can say now um did i stop it up thanks who joins us tonight from south australia leone 's rural upbringing encouraged a love of books for which she will be forever grateful leony worked in government departments including the state history trust and the education department but lainey long to make her way back to the country she now finds herself dividing her time between her professional counselling practice in the beautiful adelaide hills and her childhood farm which provides a setting for many of her stories laney has two rural romance com which have come out with alan at unwin but she also writes some steamy women 's fiction suspense under the pen name of laini kaye so once again if you have chat function and we 'll get to them and i 'll also pop in lanie 's website details with her latest book so now i 'll hand it over to you lainey to tell us about your own books and your book recommendations for tonight thank you kanina and thank you kanina and chris and midcoast libraries for having me on we probably need some sort of hurry up signal to stop me just dribbling forever now um thank you especially to everybody who 's come on to listen and those who put their cameras on it 's so nice to see other faces instead of just talking to a screen um it 's really lovely to see you all sitting there and being you know nearly as uncomfortable as us really and as kanina said this is my 16th book i think um because i write under a pen name as well so this would be number 16 and it is the second in a i was going to say a rule romance series now it 's not actually a series they 're companion novels and i need to the phrase companion novels because i always say it 's a series and apparently it 's not um but just to prove that i know nothing about anything i actually thought i was writing women 's fiction when i wrote this i know nothing about genres didn 't know that rural fiction or romance was even a thing until the publisher picked it up and said how committed are you to writing in this genre that you don 't know even exists like good job and so of course i was instantly committed to writing in the genre because it happened to suit me because these books are largely set where i grew up in the murray lands of south australia now the murray lands um most people will think of it in terms of the river but the murray lands actually extends him from the murray river and it 's a very harsh arid land and quite beautiful in its own way i compare the family farm to like a mini version of the flinders ranges if anybody 's familiar with that kind of stark beauty so you know creep beds with you have very little water running through in huge granite boulders um it 's very dry farming land it 's it 's near to voider 's line which is sort of the cutoff point for the decent farming land and that 's moving backwards so it 's getting more arid by the year and the ground sandy so we tend to have cereal crops wheat barley uh lupins and we do sheep so swap between them year by year so that you know the land gets a little time to be fellow and naturally fertilized by the sheep so it was really easy for me to set these books in an area that i absolutely love um my youngest daughter and i we say that we feel we have quite an ancestral belonging to this particular property it really speaks to us so the books themselves um pepper tree crossing was the first book to come out um and that actually had quite an interesting genesis besides being women 's fiction on the sly in that the whole book came about from uh alliteration we were driving i because we go out to help my parents quite a bit we say we 're helping them on the farm you know really we 're just digging holes and taking lots of animals out there and dumping them on mum and dad but we say going out to help dad would always feed us and he was going through a phase of feeding us liberal worst every time we went out which like it sounds disgusting i know but there is actually a way to live worse it 's quite acceptable you need crusty bread butter liverwurst sliced tomatoes salt and pepper and then because my parents are british you have to have potato chips on top because we have potato chips on just about everything except for rice pudding but i think that might be coming so we 're driving out of the farm one day and my daughter goes ah i hope granddad 's got liverwurst today no lamingtons i hope he 's got lamingtons oh liverwurst and lamingtons that 's a great name for a book i went well no it 's not it 's not just start with the name write the book from it so you can 't that 's dumb she goes just do it so instead of going to get our liver western lamingtons we drove out across the farm and went sat next to this huge granite monolith that we love and plotted out a story which would involve of course liver western lamingtons so that was what we 'd called the book forever featured liver western lamingtons i pitched it to the publisher and one of her questions was you know before i come over and meet you i need to know how married are you to this title liver western lamingtons oh that 's brilliant isn 't it yeah no so liverwurst and lamington 's had to become the farm at pepper tree crossing but it does still feature liver western lamington so that 's fine and then the second companion book is the waffle feed in which is set in nearly the same area um but this one 's actually on the river murray which forms part of the murray lands and it 's actually the story of the city adelaide in this case and gabrielle the main characters live this life of privilege and she 's never experienced any hardship and her business partner basically challenges her and says you 've never had a passion in your life you 've never had to do anything that you 've really really wanted to do so gabrielle sets herself a challenge she 's kind of goaded into going to the plans i 'm doing up this in it 's very dilapidated um but she has a concept for it she 's going to make it into this fantastic bed and breakfast then there 's a second character in it hayden pake who is the local stone mason now hayden 's um a popular guy and up until about 18 months ago he had everything going for him um his world life would mates close family but there 's been a tragedy in his life that 's taken it all away from him so he 's living a life now that 's filled with guilt and grief the third person in the the point of view in the novel is making over in 1920 now ulcer is very desperately clinging to her failing memories because she 's old but at the same time she 's absolutely terrified of allowing these memories because there 's secrets in her past as well so we 've got ilsa he 's searching for peace hayden 's searching for forgiveness and gabrielle is looking for her true passion and to get there all three of them are going to have to face their truths and reveal their secrets and the reader gets to discover the way that their stories intertwine so um it 's quite a a gentle story um especially compared to some of my other racy stuff and it 's um it 's about the importance of learning to let go of guilt but to embrace grief because grief is where your memories lie so you can 't just cut off both of those facets and that comes from the fact that i 'm actually a professional counselor when i 'm not writing books so i recognize the importance of not locking yourself away from brief you 've got to allow it into those um two books in this genre and then i have as can you mention books in other genres so there 's malicious desire which is an outback noir um romantic suspense and then there 's a couple of steamy ones and then the others can get them off screen quickly and then the others are um all in ebook form because they 're weird american publishers and it is just too expensive to get them over here so i didn 't even have copies myself now as to the books that i 'm going to pitch i can 't even pitch my own book so i 'm not going to be great at this um first of all this is very special to me the bad muslim discount by saeed masood now it 's special to me because syed was actually um a mentee of mine uh there 's an american writing contest pitch wars contest very big and basically um writers who are unpublished apply to published writers asking them to mentor them they 're trying to win a spot um i had something like 200 applications asking syed 's writing is stellar he outpaces anything that i could ever hope to produce his work is almost literally fiction he can very easily twist it to literary fiction but he 's got this mad sense of humor as well which kind of lightens what he 's writing i was sold on the bad muslim discount when i read the opening lines of his pitch to me and i will share them with you i killed mikey it sounds worse than it actually was you have to understand that i didn 't kill mikey because i wanted to i killed him because god told me to do it i don 't suppose that sounds much better it helps i think to know that mikey was a goat it 's like reading those lines i 'm like oh i 'm in i 'm sold on this but the book is um very powerful and it 's very deep because in a nutshell the story follows two families one from pakistan and one from iraq in the 1990s and they traveled to san francisco in 2016. now um syed is actually voices perspective with this and the book explores um quirky family relationships arranged marriages islamic identity melting pot of modern america and i think that there are a lot of topics that we 're afraid to discuss uh given that they given that it should be an own voices focus we 're a little bit afraid to voice our opinions on anything i know when i was trying to work with syed i there were a lot of things i didn 't want to question but it 's great because syed actually questions everything himself he questions everything about his upbringing his faith um the way he 's he 's parented but he does it in the funniest way so it 's quite heavy subject matter book does go to some very dark places dealing with terrorism um but it 's irreverent and it 's dramatic and it can be sublimely ridiculous so it 's kind of got a bit of everything in it and say it 's so talented he actually in the same year this came out brought out the younger adult book and he 's got another they 're rom-coms that he does in that voice so yeah very talented writer who is going to be absolutely huge switching to an australian author now um i admit i don 't actually read very much contemporary fiction because i don 't have time and also i don 't like to read any genre that i 'm writing in i i don 't like to risk any transfer direct serve ideas or just writing styles so i try and read well out of what i 'm writing but i did pick up tanya faralli 's the eighth wonder the other week and oh my goodness it 's amazing you actually have to read this um the premise was really unusual i was expecting i don 't know now i 'm saying contemporary and obviously it 's not contemporary um i was expecting something fairly trite and then i was reading the premise um so it starts out with something along the lines of a wealthy heiress in new york in 1897 and she 's got matchmaking mother throat happening so i 'm going oh well you know we know lee does not know where anything 's going because i know nothing um it 's so much more than what you 'd expect rose is a budding feminist the main character uh she dreams of being an architect like her father and the wealth that she 's born into isn 't as secure as it seems so there 's you know that kind of stuff going on in the background but then there 's a secondary character ethan and he comes from an impoverished background he 's living on coney island with get this rescued circus animals including an elephant now is that a bizarre storyline but it is just absolutely amazing so i was blown away by the premise but even more than that what really sold me was the language in this book it 's absolutely sublime tanya has a knack for not only beautifully descriptive imagery but she uses words that you don 't continually read anymore so you you actually have to think about it and it 's almost poetic in the way that it 's written and the words themselves they 're so elegant and language to like it 's worth reading just for the story premise alone it 's worth reading so obviously put the two together and when you get to the ending i challenge you not to read that faster than anything you have ever read before because you want to know what 's going to happen because you cannot pick it there is a fabulous twist in there and i think it 's so rare you get to read a book with a really good twist so that 's yep highly highly recommend this you want to grab it i will flick that to you a really all the oldie will smith river god now i adore wilbur smith um i didn 't realize he was still writing it actually until the other day my publisher brought out one of the books so i kind of hinted that i really like will the smith uh this is a series of books river god set in ancient egypt and wilbur smith it 's it will be tagged as historical fiction with a little bit of fantasy but really these are like adventure these books couldn 't even tell you what it 's about because it is just so layered so busy so dynamic i don 't know how people can write like that like what is going on in their head i think it 's bad enough you know just novel and a few voices in there i don 't know how they can have so much going on and different timelines and things as well happening throughout so it 's told from the point of view of an egyptian slave um that 's everything there 's romance politics war it 's an absolute saga and you get fully immersed in it i am going to re-read the whole series when i find time because it 's well worth it and my final book now this is a funny one i 'm not even sure if i 'm recommending it because i 'm so conflicted over this but i kind of want everybody else to read it so they can tell me what they think so it 's khaled hosseini 's a thousand splendid sons and a lot of you will recognize so it 's got over um well over a million reviews on goodreads it rates really well and not as well as the kite runner did and it 's basically it 's a story of two female characters laila and mariam and it 's set against the volatile events um of afghanistan over about last 30 years so from the soviet invasion through the reign of the taliban to the post-taliban rebuilding but obviously doesn 't include the latest devastation and tragedy over there leila and mariam the main characters come from very different places almost a generation apart but eventually their stories are going to intersect and despite their initial dislike they learn to navigate the brutalities of life together now i believe this is touted as a literary fiction but like so many of the best stories at its core this is a romance so maybe it 's a romance those people who like to say they don 't read romance because this definitely is romance um and even some of the romance threads in it are quite trite and believable i really loved getting their own voices it um i 'm not very good with geography and the history of other countries so this is a really good way to find out information but that said one of the main reasons i 'm conflicted over this book is that i found the style of writing disconcerting and it was told quite dryly um and and it really was telling it was bold statement of facts not a weaving of story so the facts were told the emotions were told and the majority of the characters aren 't very rounded they 're just very surface and so you have that very distinctive hairs the good person here 's the bad person there 's no gray areas which i really like gray areas yet the bizarre thing is that together it all works as a cohesive whole which is quite bad and it 's doing my head in um there 's no point of the story where you get bored or want to set it aside so it must be working no matter how i want to pull it apart i still want to know what 's going to think maybe part of the reason it 's so intriguing is because it 's a really good lesson in not letting anyone tell you how to write or be bound by the rules that said khaled has said that if he was to write this book now he would write it much differently because he has learned through his writing journey um but it 's a book you have to read all about i defy anybody not to take a sickie to smash the last third of the book because it really gets moving and you are totally sucked in and it 's easily accessible reading and unless unlike syed 's book uh where you really have to have your thinking cap on this book to follow because he 's such an intelligent man you 're sort of getting dragged in his way this is much more accessible writing partly because of the romance storyline as well i guess but i think what truly makes this memorable for me is that as a mother i didn 't agree with one of the decisions that the main character makes at the thought it wasn 't believable it wasn 't credible and i was arguing it and i said no no books wrong character doesn 't do that mind you i hate when anybody does that about my characters but i 'm arguing about going no that 's wrong a mother wouldn 't make this decision and then i suddenly realized the fact that two days after i 'd finished this book i 'm still thinking about it and arguing about whether the character would or wouldn 't have done that and trying to understand her perspective that proves i was totally invested in the story and when it comes down to it that 's all you want from a book isn 't it get lost in the story wait that 's my lot thank you so much lee i can 't believe you said that you can 't pitch your enthusiasm made me i couldn 't stop smiling lin 's your enthusiasm has won me over to read it um and oh christine 's just written one an intriguing review i 'm tempted to chuck that sickie i want to hear me because a lot of people jump on the bandwagon when it came out because he 'd had a successful first book people want to love the second book so there were a lot of great reviews based on that so i want to know what other people think the real is also written yes river god and the next book seventh scroll were amazing i must say i accidentally read them in the wrong order which was interesting it would be the hard nothing right order um fiona also says the title what 'll save in sounds warm and cozy i 'm intrigued lovely name for a book an interesting sounding storyline yes it is a lovely story and then fiona went on to say um thursdays at orange blossom house sounds like waddle scene inn 's companion book and yes i when i was talking about the last both your books in the same in the last week or more it does they sound like they go together very well now i wanted to ask you a quick question oh actually we might have to move and then you lisa being very mindful of the time um and chris and i 'll quickly try and get through our recommendations um i 'm just gonna pop in a link to my newsletter um each month i generally have um a giveaway book from both our guest authors which i put out the thursday before out about a book so if you 're wanting to try and win one of those copies which are donated by the publisher um be sure to sign up so earlier this year i was um i was very excited to be asked to do a review on a book because the um a publisher had read some of my own work and felt like this story would appeal to me and and it certainly did so i was a new i was in i was new to amal award this book 's called the things we see in the light but amal has a long list of writing credits including both fiction and non-fiction books she 's been a speaker and panelist at schools universities and writers festivals around australia covering topics including diversity we see in the light only came out at the end of august and with so many of us in lockdown where we 're having to seek out our new release books online rather than peruse them in the shops like our lovely two guest authors at the moment they 're um not getting as many people walking through the stock shops and being able to see the books and see the pretty covers and being able to pick them up um so it 's a really hard time for our authors um so this one has really great tagline new beginnings old friends love and chocolate all four of these things appeal to me um so i was pretty excited straight away so it 's a story about zaha who um eight years ago married khaled and followed him to jordan she gave up her cake business and left behind her friends and family so we meet sahar when she shows up on her childhood friend 's front doorstep married life hadn 't gone according to plan but she 's come back to sydney without telling her husband so reinvent herself she embraces new things which have previously been forbidden to her she work begins working it and begins making new friends her group 's expanded and she learns new ways of working with chocolate so gradually we learn more and more about sahar 's life in jordan and what eventually drove her to leave there 's a really lovely mystery element to that part of the story which keeps the pages turning um back in sydney sahar faces challenges as she moves into this new way of life but there are beautiful moments so she makes new friendships and allows herself to be transformed just when she 's finding her feet her past comes back to haunt her so essentially it 's a story about change it 's about being courageous enough to acknowledge that sometimes life doesn 't go according to plan and you need to redirect yourself it 's about taking second chances and learning how to let yourself shine so something else that else that was really quite exciting to me about this book is it 's the first book that i 've ever provided to show you tonight but sadly my brand new copy hasn 't arrived this is just the advanced readers coffee um but what i did say about the book some is printed on the inside pages you know whether some of the quotes go and i 've got a little quote on the back of the real book um it 's i 've written full of flavor amala wads the things we see in the light is a warm emotive and uplifting story it 's about the power of friendship facing fears and being brave enough to find your true self the perfect book to immerse yourself in but be sure to keep both tissues and chocolates handy so that was a total thrill for me um as a still new writer or author and hopefully you 'll all enjoy the read as well now chris i 'm sorry but i 'm going to be really sneaky and do one more quick quick uh recommendation because this is a really easy to read romance book which some of us just need like a really easy read escape and this is so i was craving something a bit light to read um and as soon as i started reading it i relaxed into this book with some quiet confidence that i was going to be entertained so this is this premise is right up my alley it 's about two friends over 12 summers and basically that picture is all that it was needed for me and i was sold um so seeing any kind of relationship blossom with a jump within time is something that i really love um from the back of the book we know that poppy and alex met 12 years ago and don 't really like each other and they 're confident that they won 't speak again from the back of the book so the blood of this all tells us 11 years ago they are forced to share a ride home from college and by the end of this they end up making a pact to vacation together every summer and so they embark on a series of summer holidays um but two summers ago it all goes wrong this summer poppy asked alex the book alternates between past summers and this summer and it keeps you turning those pages to find out not only not only what happened two summers ago but what 's going to happen this summer i fell in love with both poppy and alex there 's plenty of wit from both characters and their sexual chemistry the sparks off the page um yeah so reach for this one if you 're going if you 're looking for a romantic page turner now i 'm going to hand you over to chris for his recommendation okay hey and uh kanina i 'm gonna do just one okay i love the phrase chukka sickie that 's so australian i was actually work walking around then our new library site at foster today and the project manager said um oh when you get there can you just crack a left and go into that room and i just went that 's so australian yeah some of those friends you know what brilliant yeah cracker left it makes no sense but i knew what he was talking about so um my novel is skies so our book club 's doing that one or it will be i 'm actually a book ahead because i got really excited i loved boy swallows universe and i think i love all our shimmering skies more now i don 't know that everybody would agree with me on that one simply because voice follows universe is a great novel so i 'm but i 'm going to encourage it as a book club read too if we do have a kit in the library so get into that you can borrow them even though we are closed you can click and collect book clubs and then figure out how you distribute them covertly safe we 're comfortable with that it um so all our shimmering skies is that has the same poetry that trent dalton wrote with in voice wallows universe it 's also quite um magical in in elements of its content in the sense there 's surreal features to it beautifully written setting in and around darwin following the the story the life and story of yes was that lynn did you just hold up yeah yes okay i i 'm loving it uh based around uh i forget her age now she 's she 's very young molly hook who is a gravedigger 's daughter it 's set at the time of the um japanese um attack on darwin and it it weaves in characters fascinating characters actresses and japanese pilots who decide not to bomb the harbour and crash their planes into the wilderness men devoured by the love of gold aboriginal characters uh blonde coke bob who appeared i just think it 's an extraordinary tale and i 've had to hold back from finishing it but i am already a month ahead of my book club because i loved it so much so double thumbs up for me for trent dalton 's all our shimmering skies thanks chris i don 't think lynn 's totally convinced she was wavering yeah both thumbs up hang in there lin hang in there it 's it 's fantastic um yeah lynn said our book club have just read it chris and we will zoom on friday so it 'll be interesting to see what said it was one of the three books that she borrowed from the library with the click and collect and wrong good on you jenny t well done and susan said all our shim rings guys split our book club yeah um i was in i was in the loving it but um was in the minority interesting hmm cool well i 'm in the minority too oh your only time will tell um quickly i 'm just going to ask laney uh one question because we i know we 're very tight on time but there 's a large and supportive community of royal rural romance fans in your opinion what do you think it is that the readers um of this genre are drawn to even though you didn 't know that you 're writing it you see that 's just it i 'd i 'd never read a rural romance until i got a deal for it either so um it 's a little bit hard for me to pinpoint what the readers love because i get told that my books um are a little bit grittier read two and a half in my life now i don 't really know that that 's true because i do like to like really investigate characters but i think people are probably drawn to the escapism a lot of the readers readers are obviously going to be city based so they 're looking for the of that you know that getaway that tree change but other readers are country based and i get a lot of messages going i remember doing this on the farm and yet this is just like where i lived and and i know exactly what you 're describing and i love being able to find the place that you 're mentioning even though my place is fictional people are sure they know exactly where it is so i think it 's largely escapism which we probably need now but escapism with a dash of realism as well yeah that 's a great way to look at it i know lots of people would be wanting to escape at the moment but there is that um sense of excitement isn 't that when you can sitting and the day-to-day things that they 're doing as well so you 've recently signed a two-book deal um with ellen and i went with four i 've got two two book deals yeah we 've got another four to come all companion i just all companion novels i just got my edits for book three uh yesterday the dandelion cottage and i 've got twenty thousand words left to write on book four which is the twenty twenty three book oh the dandelion cottage that 's a nice name and um are they linked at all yeah they will be this companion novel genre so they 're all set in a fictional town that i invented called settlers bridge so what i do is always have somebody new move into the district but you 'll see overlap of the older characters that you 've come to know around the district because i have a lot of secondary characters who have their own backstories and for example book four that i 'm writing picks up a very unlikable character from book one and she kind of gets redeemed a about her history and why she is the way that she is but it also involves a couple of new characters coming in so i am single-handedly repopulating this country town well lots of people like that it 's kind of a little bit like a country practice or home and away isn 't it you 've got to keep bringing new people in i probably should watch them um we 've got here lynne was just saying i think this is about trent dalton 's book definitely i couldn 't put it down but at times a hard read and jenny said i 'm struggling struggling with the cruelty and shimmering skies i 'm not far not too far into it so i will persevere who 's so jenny do so well i that 's we 're actually over time tonight so thank you so much for joining us um all the books that have been mentioned tonight um by sophie laney chris and myself are all available on the midcoast libraries catalog alternatively if you 're wanting to

that makes our guest authors feel very welcome that they know that they 're talking to people out there not just to their computer screen and just a few of us it 's lovely to see beautiful readers coming along and supporting our library and our authors so i 'm a local author to mid coast libraries i 've had two books out um with harlequin harpercollins my latest release all we have is now i came out earlier this year and my first one the one was in 2019 um so our lga has been rather lucky we 've just had three weeks of kind of normality which is a bit of an odd feeling where we 've had lockdowns and cases being announced regularly and yesterday we had the most glorious weather it felt like it was a true summer 's day and then at about seven o 'clock last two postcodes within our lga mine being one of them and i can tell you both kids and parents alike in this household were very sad that they weren 't returning to school today so i 've got my fingers crossed that it 's only a week and once again condolences to some of you that are still in lockdown and it 's been quite a few of these sessions month after month so we hope you 're taking care and being able to um read lots of books um good news for any locals that are watching tonight is that midcoast libraries will be offering the wonderful click and collect service that they offered last lockdown so if you 're a local library member and want to reserve a book be sure to access the click and collect option on the library 's website which was a hugely popular popular last lockdown um while we love our libraries and all the many services they offer we also love our bookstores and this saturday the 9th of october is love your bookshop day so be sure to celebrate the wonderful your favorite bookstore by purchasing a book or giving them a shout out online we know that some of the smaller bookstores have been doing it really tough over the last two years with everything that 's been happening onto exciting things is that i 've been soaking up some really great books recently what about you guys at home have you read anything that 's worth telling us and if you have be sure to pop it into the chat function and share which books we need to be reading and if you are after some great recommendations you 've come to the perfect spot we 've got two fabulous or two fabulous authors and special guests here tonight to tell us what books we should be adding to our to be red pile you 've already met chris jones the manager of midcoast libraries and later this evening both chris and myself will give you one of our recommendations so we 're joined by ian irvine author of 27 novels and ian writes a strained fantasy and futuristic eco thrillers it 's quite a mouthful ian and we whose second novel the shadow house came out only last week so she 's in the midst of um excitement high at the moment so welcome to both of you our first guest is ian irvine who grew up climbing trees and reading books frequently doing both tasks at once but at the same time with dreams of becoming a scientist he gained a phd from the university of sydney and in began the creation of his three worlds fantasy environment to escape the horrors of writing his doctoral thesis his thesis was 18 months late in scientific work has taken him to beautiful places all across the eastern hemisphere which ian says on his website have provided no inspiration to his writing as he prefers to send his characters to unpleasant places they 're testing them to their limit of human ingenuity creative urges pested ian until he began writing his first book of what was to become his his darwinian fantasy quartet and that was in 1987. he hasn 't stopped writing since and has become the author of 27 books so if you have any questions for function and we 'll get to them and i 'll also pop in a link to ian 's website if you want to check out because there 's lots and lots on there i 'll now hand you over to ian to tell us a little bit more about his books along with his book recommendations thanks ian thank you very much um just a a quick note on it now actually up to 34 published books oh i 'm so sorry no that 's all right that 's workforce you need to update your website then and and um maybe or maybe it 's the automatic wikipedia that it 's come up on uh it must be wikipedia and you know i uh yeah for those who are interested i probably have um the biggest website of any australian author i think and the first chapters of every one of my books and every one of my shorter stories were there that you can read for free so please go there if there 's anything you 're interested in and just quickly this behind me is this that shelf published in australia and around the world um so i started writing um epic fantasy in 1987 first published in 1998 by penguin um and this book here so if you look at those who 've browsed along the science fiction and fantasy shelves over the over the decades have probably seen the cover um and um so i 've written that i 've written a lot of different things um but i 'm most well known for my three worlds epic fantasy series which is um 15 novels plus another book of short stories and it would be about 3 500 words 3 3 3.5 million words all up so they 're big books and it 's a big series and uh just briefly because they came out last year these are these are the 15th and 16th books which and the 16th book the sapphire portal actually completes the series so um it 's uh and i also have written three eco thrillers set in a world of catastrophic climate change which um i wrote about 20 years ago and it seems to be coming more true with dozen books for children as well but um i think that 's probably enough about my book so um oh no yes i am a i am a marine scientist i i have my own little consulting company that i do pollution work mainly but due to pollution in the in harbors and oceans and so forth i 've been doing that for about 40 years i suppose and so basically i can consult and i write books and do a little bit of garden garden work and that 's pretty much uh the story of my life i live up here in beautiful dorrigan now we 're near near beautiful virgo and been here for 30 years and that 's it so i think now i 'd like to talk briefly the three books that i 've recommended and for those of you who who aren 't into fantasy or smart science fiction would be pleased to know that none of them are fantastic or science fiction because i actually i find it hard to um read in the genre i write it so i mostly read no crime all kinds of other things and the first book i want to talk about is the husband 's secret by lyan riatti and it 's been out for five or six years it was a phenomenal international bestseller and briefly this uh happily married woman woman with uh late 30 's with three children um discovers um by accident a box that says with um an envelope in her husband 's handwriting that says only to be opened in the event of my death and of course she knows she 's a sort of no moral upright woman so she has no intention of opening it but then subsequently the husband does some things that makes her suspicious because she does open it and well you 'll have to read the book i would have to say it 's a wonderful book she 's a great writer and i have to say that the husband 's secret is one of the most beautifully constructed books i have ever read so and it 's got a fantastic ending as well so that 's uh all i want to say about that i think un unclassified and it 's by uh max barry another australian author lives in melbourne he 's written oh he writes a book every two or three years he wrote a wonderful book about 15 years ago called jennifer government and [Music] it 's in a world set in a world where you you take your last name from the employee employee your employer so you you might be fred pepsi or anyway she 's the heroine is jennifer government it 's fantastic but this book is called uh just out recently um a month or two ago it 's called the 22 murders of madison may and i guess you 'd kind of call it maybe a sort of a time traveling um murder mystery thriller perhaps and um it 's just it 's also also beautiful beautifully constructed unlike i think any other book i 've ever read and all has a fabulous ending so max barry um definitely worth a uh definitely worth a read and the final one that i wanted to talk about is is an old quite an old book i would i 've read and it 's anyway it 's a morbid taste for bones by ellis peters who as everyone knows which is actually the um the um historical novelist um she and she essentially created the um i guess the media medieval mystery murder mystery genre with um with this book and the 20 more that followed it all featuring this um middle-aged benedictine brother called brother cadfail and they 're set in england in about 11 30 11 30 's to the 1140 's when england is sort of basically it was a civil war raging uh there 's lots of chaos and violence and trouble um but brother cadfail as you know has been a pirate and an adventurer and a crusader and all of these other things and a venture but uh then in in sort of late middle age he um sort of cast it all away and decided to um become a benedictine brother and he 's a great herbalist and gardener but he also um because of his history and he 's sailed all around the mediterranean and met lots of people and great sleuth and their they 're lovely romantic romantic there 's always a romance in them as well and brother cadfail is a very avuncular um hero and [Music] i they 're so beautifully written that i read them every few years i 've written every few years i guess for the last 30 years so um those are my three three books and i think i don 't know if anybody wants to ask me any questions there are some questions for you and johnny otherwise known as dave has said um it wasn 't_''_861.92 that a morbid taste for bones also made a great tv series here in the uk you joining us from the uk tonight johnny he 's also said i am welcome and he 's also said that it was the ruins that made him buy that and he 's not looked back apart to read it again marco fantastic yes it was a a fairly big tv series i think they made four series series of them the um yeah i 've got them on tape some haven 't seen it for many years joining us from canada tonight who said she started with geomancer is that have i pronounced it right do you answer yeah ah thank you both for joining us from other other time zones in different countries yes hello it 's lovely lovely to talk to you well gm answer is um it 's it 's the first book in my second years and actually i mainly write some youth from the mirror my first series was a quartet and then i wrote some eco thrillers because after i finish each book series they 're usually about eight hundred thousand words and i usually find i 'm so creatively exhausted that i write something completely different before i go on to a new series so i might write some echo thrillers or i might write children 's books or whatever and um so yeah uh after i finished the view from the mirror which is i i describe as darwinian epic fantasy because it 's not now you often hear in fantasy about them know the battle of good versus evil as if that 's the only possible theme that story i prefer to think of my a lot of my work as darwinian fantasy that 's not it 's not a battle of good versus evil or right versus wrong uh it 's there are a number of different human species that are all struggling for the for existence and which is not to say i don 't know have the occasional evil character and plenty of nasty ones because that 's often the nastiest characters or the most fun to write and it 's what 's also fun to write is uh giving the these villains their ironically appropriate comeuppance towards the end of the book well cesa 's got a great question here she says how do you keep track of all the characters in all your books uh well increasing difficulty i i don 't know how many characters i would have but i i would have i guess i probably would have created a thousand um over over 34 books and um some of them are recurring because no being fantasy not every no some characters are long-lived some different species are long-lived and but i but i i constantly i 'm constantly finding that um i have to do searches through a book to find characters names and sometimes you know one character you write the other characters a totally different character 's name which is very embarrassing and the book was published and it 's escaped the proofreaders and the editors and me reading it multiple times so um yeah it 's it 's one of the hardest things keeping track of so many characters and their their personalities and their motivations and their you know inner and external conflicts and so forth but i mean writings writing is incredibly hard work but on in another sense it 's not hard work at all because it 's something that i even when it is very painful i wouldn 't want to be doing anything else yeah that 's lovely isn 't it i was curious to know so with the the series that 's got 3.5 million words um do you plot for each of the do you plot for each book and then do you plot for the 16 books within the then i i usually don 't think anything more about what happens after the end of a series um except the only time i have is in the series begins with geomancer that series uh which is called the well of echoes and the next series which is a trilogy called the song of tears um are closely connected with a lot of a lot of the same characters at least those those few characters who survived the first series um i because when i got to the end of the final book in a series starting with jim answer i found it ended on such such a disastrous cliffhanger that i immediately started thinking know of all the ways that the issues that i brought up in that ending would be resolved and i have to say it 's not a very good idea to end a series with a a big fantastic series with a cliffhanger because quite a few readers were got rather vexed and um but anyway so uh so and one greatly beloved character called iris she is killed in the in right at the safe to go back in the water so to speak um and but then the let 's see the following series ends with a book the third book in the series is called the destiny of the dead and it explains why she had to die so it is all tied up and i i know it 's a i couldn 't possibly plot 16 a series of 16-bit books so i just plot a series i i always know how a series is going to end but i don 't always know how i 'm going to get there and even if i do know how i 'm going to get there it usually changes because the thing about writing is that no matter how much you uh plan it out and outline in detail uh it never feels real until you actually write the first draft it just feels made up and then once once the the first draft is written suddenly it becomes in my mind it it crystallizes into a legitimate story so but once the moment that story is written then i immediately think of much better than the first part and so on with the third fourth fifth tip because i often do seven or eight drafts sometimes more johnny has said here that he 'll never forgive you for irises is that right you 're assessing yes um and susan would like to know do you ever get lost for new ideas i know i actually one of my weaknesses as a writer is that i tend to have too many ideas and i tend to over complicate my story so often in the during the editing process and like i i usually have the story pretty much right by about the third draft but then the next three or four or five drafts i 'm basically trying to simplify things because sometimes if it 's if it 's over complicated it 's not good to read so i 'm cutting back and sometimes combining characters and doing all the things needed to make a story simple and easy to follow and a cracking good yarn i 've got one more question before we move on um aaron has said i started with these years later i wonder if you had a favorite series of your own uh [Applause] well that that quarter i suppose is my sentimental favorite because um i started because it 's the first story i ever wrote uh and in fact um i wrote the first drafts of those books out even though i had a computer back in 1987 i i found that i wasn 't very good at composing on the keyboard so i actually wrote the first draft of those four books in longhand in a big a4 a one-page date or page diary so and i can tell you once you if you 're not a really fast typist typing out you know 150 000 words um of first drum onto the computer is a very painful experience but uh so that that series is my sentimental favorite but i usually i i i i think usually it 's my my favorite is the the series that i 've just finished uh because i i 've i study the art of storytelling constantly and i 've written articles some of which are on my theme and mood and pacing and conflict and inner conflict and every every other aspect of storytelling we could possibly imagine so i 'm constantly studying the art of storytelling and trying to make each story better than the one before well thank you ian that sounds fascinating i can 't believe that you wrote all that by hand to begin with and if you have further questions for ian be sure to pop them into the chat function and we 'll try to get to them at the end i 'm just going to move along now to our second guess so anna downs joins us tonight from the central coast of new south wales and i grew up in the uk and studied drama at manchester university she moved to london to pursue an acting career and some of her screen credits include eastenders casualty in holby city in 2009 she left to go traveling with her australian partner a trip that included a stint working as a living housekeeper on a remote french estate where the seeds of her debut book the safe place was sewn the was published simultaneously in australia new zealand the uk and north america with more countries to follow her second book the shadow house came out last week so once again if you have any questions for anna be sure to pop them into the chat function and we 'll get to them so i 'll now hand you over to anna to tell us a little bit more about her books and what books we should be adding to our to be read piles thanks anna thank you kanina hello everybody and especially hello to um the uk and to canada how amazing to have you here um yeah so uh my second book is the shadow house and as kanina said that came out last week not helpful uh the cover is not helpful for you guys in the uk and canada because it will look different and that will be out in april of next year and i 'm sorry my mind 's still a little bit blown by 34 books i 'm just like i 've been sitting here listening to i 'm just we are not here listening to you talk about your career how amazing um yeah i i 'm a bit awful um when i am asked what 's my favorite book i i can 't do it i can 't pick one it feels like trying to name my favorite family member so i i started out trying to think of books that i could talk to you about you know like really old favorites that have stuck with me for a long time i couldn 't do it so what i 've decided to do is talk about um for 2021 releases because goodness knows it 's been difficult for those of us um who have released books in the pandemic i 've i 've released two now uh both under lockdown which has been um an experience um so you know these ones are not necessarily ones that have flown under the radar but certainly i just think that all of us who have got books out in in 2021 deserve a little bit of an extra push so i 'm gonna start by telling you about a slow fire burning paula 's work um she wrote the girl on the train and she put out a second novel as well called into the water which um didn 't do quite as well obviously the girl on the train went off um and it 's been a long time since she 's you know between books a slow fire burning is basically about it 's set in london and it 's about a dead body that is found floating in the water next to a houseboat um and so this story evolves around this dead body who was he who are the people around him and obviously who killed him but it 's not your average uh whodunit the clue is in the title you know i think that it 's quite interesting when you 're talking about crime and thriller novels to call something as slow burn is quite often a bit derogatory i love a slow burn i love to kind of you know um i love subtlety i love things to creep along so that i 'm i 'm kind of just as interested in uh the characters and this one does that brilliantly um the dialogue is exceptional the pacing i think is perfect and it also makes use of the novel within a novel device which is really clever so there 's that one of the characters is a novelist and as the um you know the the mystery uh unfolds of who killed this this guy that 's ended up in in the the thames um there 's a novel in the book as well that is also um unraveling a mystery and it kind of raises questions about an author 's right to exploit people 's real-life pain for entertainment so very much an interesting one for discussions if you 're a crime fan um the second book i want to talk about is this it 's called seven days in june by tia williams it 's it was a reese witherspoon pick um i think it was june appropriately enough um this book is amazing it 's it 's i haven 't read anything so delightful in a long time as in it 's just pure delight it 's it 's not crime uh two black authors in new york city uh and they had a um a romance a fiery fiery romance when they were at high school and then haven 't seen each other for many years and it 's about their seven days of reconciliation in new york all these years later and it turns out that they 've been sort of writing certainly about each other all these years you know one of them is a erotic fantasy novelist and the other one is um i know and the other one is he 's a kind of you know booker prize winning um literary star and when they get together they 're there you know they both kind of say how have you been writing about me and to me all these years in your books you know you killed me off in that book how could you do that you did this that and the other so they 've kind of uh it 's really interesting in that respect uh it also dissects the literary um scene in new york and it 's kind of a skewering of or lack thereof and it also just quietly has some of the best least cringey sex scenes i 've ever read you know how often sex scenes can be really bad and you 're like oh that book not ew at all great very very good highly recommend that um the third book is the last house on needless street by catriona ward she 's a british novelist i believe i might have got that wrong i 'm pretty sure she is um this is one of the most unique books i 've read in a really long time i don 't know how many of you are crime thriller fans um or you know if any of you read gone girl at the time for me gone girl was very exciting because the twist in it was kind of something that that genre hadn 't really seen before to quite that extent maybe you know on i mean i 'm sure it had it had been done but i think in a commercial sense it was very exciting and i haven 't felt that sort of excitement on that to tell you too much about it what i will say is that it 's really dark so if you are squeamish maybe not for you but it is so interesting so fascinating so exciting it 's the kind of book that you feel like you 've fallen down the rabbit hole and you have no idea what 's going on it 's beautifully written the sentences are gorgeous the imagery is beautiful it is terrifying it 's really hard to scare me really hard and this one scared me a lot but in the end it 's it 's kind of it 's hopeful somehow it 's so hopeful and so tender and beautiful it 's like it 's literally everything i 'm looking for in a book um and just ridiculously exciting and unique i cannot recommend that enough i 've got one more it 's an australian uh author her name is laura elizabeth woollett i am a huge fan of her work she she 's um she 's a literary novelist in that she focuses much more on on character uh than um plot i would released in 2019 focuses on jonestown and um uh jim jones and and you know that awful story of the cult where everybody died um but it is it 's it 's very much focused on um the people who get involved in that cult and why they get involved in it and it it 's somehow even though she 's drilling down so deeply into the characters i mean it 's that it 's so lyrical this is the newcomer and beautiful revolutionary but we are talking about this one um very very lyrical very very beautiful very haunting it 's super intelligent again this is a bit confronting um in terms of some of its material maybe not for the squeamish um but what it 's about um a murder a woman who is killed on um norfolk island or it 's a fictional um representation of norfolk island it 's based on a true story and you know what makes it interesting and unique is that laura is sort of subverting the uh the genre tradition of the whodunit you know particularly with regards to um fema 't necessarily make it into the papers and you know that it 's always the killers that we 're fascinated with and laura is um writing about the victim and the woman but she 's not just you know she i think often we want to um what 's the word like um victims we like to see them as saints and good but this woman was not at all and it 's diving into why uh she was the kind of person that she was and why after she was killed did everybody sort of say well she had it coming you know it 's it 's very much a deep dive into um a particular type of person who who has been a victim all her life you know and it 's only until she gets killed that everyone kind of you know that the crime is investigated but actually she 's been a victim of lots and lots of different crimes all her life so i mean i can 't recommend that one enough in terms of its um um uniqueness and its intelligence and its beauty it it 's a real page turner as well so that 's that 's my books and my recommendations i hope i didn 't go on for too long no no thank you that 's lovely and i actually when you sent through your recommendations the other week i at the local library didn 't have the seven days in june in so i had to get them to order it in and whilst i was looking it up i thought oh that definitely sounds like me i love stories about writers and innovative romance oh it 's so romantic it 's i think it 's one the most romantic books i 've ever read it 's oh i loved it yeah so i 'll take that one the two that you said are really dark all of our regular viewers will know that i get scared really easily so i 'll leave them to our hardcore fans yeah last house on needless to stream not for you uh susan wants to know um what is your latest novel about and she 's felt that setting was very important in book is set oh thank you susan yeah so um setting was very important in the safe place very similarly with um the shadow house and you 'll be happy to hear that it is set in australia um it 's set in new south wales in an eco village uh just uh about an hour and a half north of sydney so very much in kind of my area which is the central coast um but it 's it 's kind of set more in our hinterland so um up if you know the area towards sort of more like mangrove mountain pete 's ridge kind of area um so the shadow house follows a woman called alex she 's a single mum of two with a baby and a 14 year old son and she 's fleeing an abusive relationship and trying to start a new life by moving to somewhere very remote and out of the way she has her own reasons for that as well so she she moves to pine ridge this fictional eco village um which at first appears really beautiful and idyllic and finding creative ways to live sustainably um but very soon some very creepy things start to happen to her very mysterious things so she soon finds out that the same mysterious things happened to another mother six years ago who lived on the land over which the eco village was built so the eco village was built on farmland and that was a flower farm so um the same creepy things happened to this woman with the result that her teenage son went missing so the book is is about alex trying to find out what happened in the past in order to protect and save her children in the present i hope that answers the question sue says i was scared of my wits with your book how does woods 's book compare how does which book compare to woods is that this one do you mean my recommendation book i think so how does that one compare to yours in terms of scare factor ah that 's a really good question i i quite know how to answer that because i think it depends on what scares you i think this does that very very well it it there 's a lot of suggestion in it and you you get to fill in your own gaps until you don 't you know there are there are some quite visceral um descriptions in in there as as well i think with the safe place what i was trying to do more than anything was create a sense of atmosphere um i really admire books like i said that do that that rely you know kind of communicate with the reader and and ask the reader to fill in some of it themselves you know like i feel like um writing a book is it 's a two-way street so you 're you 're kind of um playing certain notes that you hope resonate with your reader and and that resonance within the reader is is um that 's the other direction in the street if you see what i mean um so atmosphere in my writing um plays that role i 'm and that 's where i think that the fears come from i think there 's nothing scarier on earth could be happening and those are the kind of books that i love i like books that set up a riddle for me um and where i can sort of almost yeah i can start guessing and filling things in myself um if there are a few good visceral scares thrown in as well then brilliant but that 's why i kind of like you know the snooping around the houses opening the doors what 's in this room what happens if we go down the basement stairs what 's in the woods that kind of stuff yeah yes narelle 's just said that 's a very clever way to write definitely now and i know that you narrate your own audio books i just wanted to know can you tell us a little bit more about that experience what it involves oh i love it it 's brilliant um so what it involves is um showing up to the studio sitting in a booth by yourself and an engineer basically presses play and you read your book uh which i found really uh surprising i thought there or help me out a little bit and that there really wasn 't the first time around the second time the engineer had a bit more advice and was a bit more um you know he he might say actually do you think we could do that line again it just made me think that this character might be a little more surprised in this moment that kind of thing which i found really helpful um it 's it 's also quite intimidating though because i don 't know if you 've ever read out loud or you know read your book out loud you know when they ask you sometimes to read the extracts and i i don 't know like the the fact that they 've pressed play they 've put they press record sorry and you 're just expected to read it and it goes so fast and then it 's gone and you can 't go back and redo it again and i think it 's easier for me as an author because i 've lived with these characters for so long and i can hear quite intimidating and especially when you 're kind of so with the safe place i i haven 't realized i 've forgotten i 've written an italian character into one of the scenes and so i 'm reading um the narration i 've got my big headphones on i 'm in my booth and i 'm i 'm um i 'm coming up to it and i 'm in the scene and it 's a restaurant scene and my you know as i 'm reading in my head i 'm going oh my god oh my god there 's an italian character in here you haven 't you don 't know how to do an italian accent what you going to do when it gets there what 's going to happen and so i 'm i 'm getting closer and getting closer and then i 'm like and then he said and i 'm like and it 's coming the italian person 's coming and i 'm like like it 's terrible and then it 's gone and it 's done and it 's in the cam and you can like oh god so it 's so it 's quite frantic and it takes a bit of getting used to um i haven 't listened back to the safe place so if anybody listens to it let me know if the italian guy is awful i often think that about audio books to pract for people that read them to practice reading an entire audio book would take a long time so i it must they must just you must have to go get very confident and just go with it i guess yeah i think probably um you know the the professionals would just learn to trust their instincts on things like that um and they would develop their own style and i think they well you would hope they would feel very confident in that style i 'm i 'm fine with it because like i said i can i was an actress um yeah i i write i think like an actor um i 've been testing out my dialogue for you know as long as i 've been writing the book so i can hear it well so i you know it 's easy for me um very enjoyable i like the experience but it is a bit mad johnny would like to know how much of the book do you record at one time good question uh so the safe place i recorded uh over five days 10 a.m start 5 p.m finish um you 're looking i would say oh my gosh they did give me a um they told me what the speed that i read at uh how many pages per minute and i i would say i want to say about i think you say about eight pages an hour if that makes sense or maybe that 's maybe that 's wrong anyway um that 's how much it that 's how long it takes it 's usually about a week um for a book with the the shadow house has got two um povs two characters i narrated one and they got an actress for the other so um i was i think i was in for four days for that one yeah but they were shorter days as well um this safe place and she can 't wait for the shadow house which is a lovely it 's a lovely bit of an awful love around tea because very early on narelle said that she read funny thing about norman foreman and loved that so yeah julia got a shout out as well and whilst we had earlier recommendations julieta recommended all my mothers by joanna glenn highly recommend and ruth has just finished the paris library and really enjoyed that one and i did see a really interesting uh comment from mari when this is linking back to ian 's handwriting um she said i read that authors who write long hand find their stories turn out different than when using a keyboard possibly due to the meditative process of handwriting that 's quite interesting i think isn 't it yeah well i think that 's probably true i think the other thing about um and yes it is a meditative process uh and i i tend to write a better first draft handwriting uh the other thing about using the keyboard is that you know you can tendency to just bang out any old rubbish first time and um and then edit it into shape later yeah that 's very true [Laughter] um have you found that narrating your books helps you look at your style of writing from a different perspective yeah definitely no it 's it 's it 's very educational but i um i kind of knew in advance that i was going to narrate both both books and so part of my copy editing and proof proofreading um process is like i read everything out loud anyway so i kind of i feel like they are um they inform one another you know i 'm i use the narration to inform my writing at most stages of the process um so but when when you 're in the booth and you 're recording it yeah like there are things that you can definitely take away with it i i learned a lot from this stuff from that experience of recording the safe place um and brought some of that into writing the shadowhouse i mean things like you know making your dialogue a so you 're not waffling so much sometimes when i 'm recording i 'm going goodness this is dragging on a little bit so you know note to self next time when you 're writing make sure that you read your scene out loud and make sure that it 's feeling nice and flowy um yeah i think i couldn 't recommend um reading your material out loud highly enough to any any author i think it 's a good thing to do thank you anna i can see that there are a few more questions but i will just move along and if i 've got time at the end or if people are willing to stay and pass at eight o 'clock we will get to them then um i 'm just popping a link into the chat with my newsletter um if you 're wanting to win either of anna or ian 's books um be sure to sign up there 's a current giveaway with my latest newsletter which will be drawn tomorrow night you could win one of their books which is very exciting um was recommending leanne moriarty 's the husband 's secret um because i absolutely loved that book and i had to smile when anna was nodding along to everything ian said like i was um it 's such a clever book that one that of whether or not you would open that letter it 's just very satisfying and i agree i loved that ending that she did so very clever but my favorite of her books is actually what alice forgot mine too yeah i love that one yeah i loved it and in what alice forgot she loses 10 years of her life and yes i love that but they 're my favorite too what alice forgot and the husband 's secret um and i 'm always excited for a new book by leanne moriarty and her most recent release apple 's never fall which is her ninth novel um skipped straight to the top of my to be red pile and i devoured it in three days which is a lot when i 've got three young kids at home i had to ignore them at several points for this story is about the delaney family joy and stan are retired tennis coaches and have full grown children after being busy for many many years they 're now supposed to be enjoying retired life but at the beginning of the book joy goes missing her children are forced to re-examine her parent their parents marriage and their family history with fair fresh eyes so the chapters alternate between now and last year when a mysterious house guest stayed at the delaney 's has a crime taken place or has there been an accident the reader isn 't sure and leon has a way of writing that makes you want to urgently keep turning those pages without taking a break um i 've seen plenty of mixed reviews for this one some people have said it 's become their new favorite while others have said that they couldn 't connect with this tennis story line and that they were generally underwhelmed um i loved tennis so the background colorings of the tennis story appealed to me and i enjoyed all those kind of references is a master at weaving think links to what we 're saying before about relying on your reader being quite smart she wants them to make the connections and i think readers appreciate this only giving them a little bit of information and them having to put it together themselves she creates real and relatable characters they have idiosyncrasies and vulnerabilities and flaws and you can 't help but be sucked into their world and you want to know more about them in apple 's number four there are a random point of view scattered throughout so a waitress listening to the four siblings talk a client overhearing a phone call of one of the delaney children joy 's hairdresser listening to idol gossip um i really enjoy this little snapshot of um the story from various points of view in the chat those chapters are very short um but i did one day if it was dying for some of the readers um like i said in my social media review um i didn 't think the mystery was as impressive as some of her other books um but my goodness she 's come the pressure she 's under um so she writes it 's kind of a crime thriller domestic noir drama about families marriage and children so for me it wasn 't perfect um but i think my expectations of this author are very very high so i feel that um i even you devour a book in three days it 's still got to be pretty pretty done good doesn 't it so it does have some bolts but um i definitely do recommend checking this one out and if you do let me know what you think yeah i i recommend it too i read it a couple of weeks ago just after it came out i thought it was a great book i 'm reading it on the screen i started it yesterday oh well you 've got two days to go yeah yes so you all you both enjoyed it i yeah i i thought it was a very good book uh beautifully constructive as well i didn 't enjoy it as much as as big little lies or the husband 's secret but i enjoyed it a a terrible oh sacrilege i love that book yeah no i didn 't like nine perfect strangers either i liked it yeah i was really really relieved to kind of get back into her uh old style um i appreciate that she tried something different in my nine perfect strangers but i was yeah not happy with those with that storyline um jazza 's got here the husband 's secret was the first book of book club group read back in 2016 and apple 's name before is our current book um susie says i 'm reading apple 's number four at the moment for our book club and agree it 's a page turner yeah um she just does something that makes you want to keep turning those pages at such a pace and you just don 't want to put it down you want to keep keep going um so chris i 'm going to hand over to you now to give us your recommendation for tonight thank you nina and thank you anna and ian for your recommendations i 've got now two books i 'm definitely i flip flopped with yours and the more you describe the visceral the more i found myself writing down the newcomer so i think i 'll i 'll tackle that one but uh thank you very very much and i have to say quickly for the last painting of sarah devos or devoe which was written by dominic smith it 's a great read it 's a red full audio book because trust me it 's a dreadful australian accent so i 'm sure your italian one is nothing nice well just quietly i have to i have done a lot of australian accents in the audiobook of the shadow house so apologies in advance if they 're awful i really hope they 're not and you didn 't say you narrated the last painting of sarah devos so nothing to do with me now i went on a bit of a i went on um i 'm going to really go back in time for my uh my recommendation and um by by various means i went read a book that i 'd read as a kid teenager called 's it 's the the um the story of the norse mythology and things like that and i really enjoyed it it 's it 's written by a school teacher so it 's quite tiny since thread through and so just because i am who i am i went i want to go back and read the source material so i 've started reading the original which is the prose edda and i 'm actually going to get to the poetic editor at some stage which they 're the two source documents for the norse mythology and this one is a translation by a gentleman by the name of snorri sterlison which sounds like a character out of um tolkien novels it 's what i 've loved about this i 've really enjoyed this journey because everything i 've read previously has been bulgarized it 's been tidied up um there 's whole sections in there that i i didn 't get from my my childhood reading there 's some for example there 's um this giant test who is wronged and eventually goes to the gods and the gods here for your husband she chooses and um in this book that 's where it ends but in this book you discover that she then demands that somehow other the gods make a laugh and there 's this whole interlude in which loki eventually makes her laugh by tying a a cord to the beard of a goat and the other end to his own testicles and which came as a surprise to me i have to say and and she laughs and laughs enough because they 're pulling against each other and there 's a lot of screaming and all that kind of stuff so this it 's it 's not all about testicles i have to say but it 's rich with things that i was not expecting and and um some some mythologies or that they often have very strong important messages about the right kind of behavior the gods aren 't that interested in humans and like there 's this weird segment where um at the end of ragnarok there 's this um giant that 's going to sail in hrim and he sells this dread died and you go okay that 's pretty weird and then there 's this little moral message which says which is why you really need to trim your toenails as often as you can because you know when you die you 're helping this boat out and i thought that 's not one of the moral messages i was kind of expecting from the gods and there 's this other one that 's about um somebody who ends up killing fenris wolf and he 's wearing these special shoes made from the trimmings of the shoes that you have at home and you throw them aside which is why you need to trim your shoes to so that this god can defeat fenris wolf and it 's just sort of like wow another really strong moral message trim your shoes and trim your toenails so i found it this really unusual journey into things i wasn 't expecting to find so i i actually think it 's got really quite a readable piece of work the prose edda and i 'm looking forward to the poetic version as well so this i think it 's the pros maybe it 's the el dorado where um tolkien got the name for gandalf and a lot of his dwarves you 're a 100 writer in fact in in the prose editor i think it is you can see them all like there 's philly and q and and you know thyroid and all that yeah clearly um tolkien 's been in there and grabbed the fair bit out of it it 's great great reading actually believe it or not yeah it is yeah i agree thank you so that 's made on canaina bit of weirdo field the only thing that is that that has been your most left field um today um i 've got a question for both anna and ian so both of you write thrillers can you tell us if you always know that the twist or the reveal element in the story um or is it something that comes out when you 're writing it and you go first i well my writing staff style has changed dramatically over since i started in 1987 when i what i couldn 't plan just didn 't didn 't work so i just made things up as i went along um and that produced some twists but these days i do quite detailed outlines and i might do 10 or 11 drafts of an outline and this is like a 40 40 50 page outline before i start writing and so i work out a lot of the twists at that stage but then as i was saying earlier once i finish the book and it becomes real then i see all these ways how the ending know that the twist that i had at the ending or the twists i had the end not really very convincing or they 've been done before and i try to twist the twist uh or discard the twist and come up with those tender ideas and pick the best of them to get something that 's fresh and original and surprising it 's hard work yeah um for me i mean goodness i 've only done it twice and so the first book my debut um i didn 't really even the story for many years so by the time i got to start putting the words down i knew i knew what it was about and the safe place is about the discovery of a secret so you know i kind of needed to know what the secret was in order to disguise it effectively for my protagonist who discovers it um the shadowhouse has been a really really different process for many reasons one of which is um you know i i had a deadline which i hadn 't ever worked with before um and so i had to come up with things very very quickly i i did an outline but that just kind of fell apart in the writing and my i know it 's such a cliche when authors say my characters started talking to me and they they started saying you know kind of dictating the rules but with the shadowhouse it really like every draft something major changed something completely pivotal um fell apart and something new grew in its place and so i didn 't know what the twist was or you know _''_3799.92 know who done it i didn 't know who was coming in when really until the very last draft when when my publishers were still going i don 't know that this is as strong as it could be do you think that maybe this person i don 't know like they threw a few suggestions around and it got me thinking and then i 'd go oh my god that 's not what happens in the story at all it 's this it 's something completely different then i 'd have to go back and change it so i 've had two really really different experiences and i 'll be very interested to see how book three pans out what happens there probably something different again ah thank you um before we go johnny 's got another question um when you write subsequent drafts e and do you write the whole thing again or overwrite the last draft i i i edit the draft um yeah often like it sort of depends on the deadline and um sometimes if the deadline is quite short i 'll do all my the first rafters a second and call it second draft and then edit on computer if i 've got more time i 'll print it out and edit on paper because sometimes it 's better to you see things on in print that you don 't see on the screen and so i use i do a mixture of that with most books and it 's really only books where i i 'm desperately short of time to meet the deadline because i like to meet my deadlines within say a week i know not every author feels meeting the deadline is important but i like to do that and if the time is really short then sometimes there 's no option but sometimes also there will be a chapter or two or a character that i just can 't write and then i might if it 's a character i 'll print out all the scenes with those characters with that character one after another and just get work through them editing over and over again until suddenly i 've got well that 's a good tip really weak to chuck it out to start again but but really needs a lot of work and just edit it edit it print it out edit it again print it out so forth um i like that tip about the character um i definitely agree about printing things out and wanting to read it on the paper how about you anna yeah definitely yeah every time i i i move on to a new draft i 'll print that out i 'll read it in print and making notes in pencil i use a lot of sticky notes as well so i 'll kind of put my big my big notes my big concerns in sticky notes so that i can kind of move them around on the actual draft as well um i find that when i edit and and read on you know on the computer and in the word doc i get too caught up in the tiny things and then you know i want to kind of move little words around but i 'm much better with the big picture in hard copy so i i print the new draft i 'll print that out again i 'll work through that write a new draft print that out work through that it 's yeah well thank you so much we 've gone over over time tonight so thank you very much to both ian and anna you 've obviously been very interesting guests and we 've had lots of questions for you both um and one of my favorite things about speaking to so many australian authors is that seeing how passionate they are about bringing their own stories to life and it 's such a supportive community where everyone 's continually giving each other praise which we witnessed tonight just in the chat group um so thank you ian and anna for coming on to talk about not only your own books but books you 've loved and what wonderful guests you 've been and i also want to thank you all for coming on and joining us tonight taking a chunk out of your tuesday night anything that has been recommended tonight will be available on the midcoast libraries catalog alternatively if you 're wanting bookseller for anyone in our area um head to the sitting wombat out at foster we hope you have a wonderful month ahead

    "text": "good morning everybody and welcome to the second session today um i 'd like to introduce you to glenn capuano who 's a senior statistician with id who provide an erasing amazing amount of information for us on our demographics this session is a brief training session on how to get around the system and find the information that you want um so i 'll hand over to glenn now thanks glenn thank you lindy uh thanks everyone for coming along today my name is glenn capuano and the company 's id which is uh stands for informed decisions we 're all about helping you make evidence-based decisions about your community we put together a series of information tools which are based partly on census data and partly on our own modeling which uh assists you to understand the role and function of your community to tell the story of each place how it 's changing over time and how relaxed the wider region so i 've got um i 'll just take you on a brief tour of the uh the community sites uh at the moment i 'll see the mid coast council community profile right there toolkit that you 've got access to community profile social atlas and population forecasts so i 'm going through uh today in this session and then the next session will be about the housing monitor which is the newest tool that we have uh all about affordable housing and understanding where and how your housing patterns are changing there 's a bit of information in the community profile on that as well of course but housing goes into a lot more detail particularly on the affordability side of things community profile and social atlas are predominantly although not entirely census-based so they do look at how how your area is changing between uh up to five six census periods actually uh and then the population forecast takes you from the last census through to 2036 and what does the future hold for the population of midcoast but as i said at the previous session that is currently based on estimates were done before the pandemic which means that we do need to [Music] be careful about what we infer from that year and a half so you do have a community profile i did have a look on your website here in the community statistics section is where you can find link to the community profile uh you 've also got our competitors there rem plans economic profile uh which i won 't be going through today but you 've got community profile social population forecast uh which i 'll be going through there so the community profile hosted on our site uh but uh contains uh links to your your council homepage there current population number estimate at 2020. so june 2020 is the last population estimate we have for the area we 'll get the june 2021 figure in in march next year and then that 's because we get a census release next year that 'll also get revised uh after the census data comes out so in june you can see also that we break down into a number of districts within midcoast council so these districts are defined as logical communities within your place these can be changed as well so if you need to if place and would fit better with another we can we can adjust the boundaries of those uh and we do adjust them over time so every place that you see in there in about profile areas is available for each of the censuses back to 1991 so we have those 20 areas which we call suburbs but they 're probably more districts in most cases um and foster tongue curry as a total as well as what we call an overlay area in there which is uh you can see it 's just the sum of those couple of areas there we can add other districts as uh as required within your area different views of the same information some councils have wards some planning areas that sort of thing in there but they 've been designed the ones that are in there have been designed to encapsulate uh logical communities that have some sort of connection to each other but have a minimum population size of about um a thousand people some of them a lot larger than that of course so on your uh highlights page here you a range of of characteristics compared to three benchmarks and we normally benchmark to the next largest area being a suburb compared to mid coast the mid coast to regional new south wales new south wales or australia but we 've got some key numbers there how they changed in the previous census and how they relate to the wider region in there on a little tiled grid you can get that for each area individually when you 're in any particular page on the site you do have this control panel the control panel attaches at the top of the page as you scroll down the page so you can see it when you 're on the maps you can see it when you 're on the text or the charts tables and you can change which area you 're looking at for instance you could say well what does this look like for auckland st gardens and it changes also the benchmark that you 've got available there so the benchmarking is really important all data is shown in comparison to a larger area or to another area foster if you want to by just changing that benchmark over there we 'd normally benchmark we normally compare to a wider region so you might say we want to compare that to the whole of the mid-north coast you can do it in any any measure hawke 's nest tea gardens is really a baby boomer area with a lot of retirees there in their 60s and 70s so you can see that on the chart directly compared to the uh to the benchmark and then this second chart is called the emerging chart it says what are the emerging groups what 's changed in the area over the time period you have selected in your comparison so your comparison there over five years is the default so in the new census we 'll default to 2021 with a comparison to 2016 but you can still compare to any of the early years you can go right back as far as 1991 census if you want to there you can see this area has doubled in population since 1991. almost all of the increase has been in the over terms the population has really shifted into those uh age groups in there so you can see you can immediately make those comparisons what does this area look like over time what does it look like in percentage terms how does it compare to a region how does it compare to another area within your place and start telling the story of that area you 've got export functions on here as well you can copy the charts into a range of formats high resolution image formats pdfs copy to clipboards my favorite one just click on that and then open up word and you can just paste that straight in with a control v it 's that simple with all the exporting functions uh you 've also got export functions in the table itself so you can go export the five year age groups comparison over time for the area we 're looking at a fully formatted table with the with just the data that you 've got on there you can also say i want to export all time periods and areas in a flat file so that data for that topic for all of the areas into one file and all of the years all at once so sort of a data dump of the whole site there for that one topic really good if you 're reading that into a gis or something like that or you want to make your own charts so that that functionality is there the other way that you can look at this information is uh suggest other topics that you use to build up the story so hawke 's tea gardens age structure should be viewed in conjunction with household and dwelling types so if we go over to household types that opens up the how do we live category in there and you can see that area i 'll switch back to a different uh i 'll switch back to regional new south wales as i as a benchmark so you can see how easily you can just say oh what does this look like compared to a different area couples without children so that is going to be your retirees in that area i 'll switch also just households not many families with children at all in that cork 's nest gardens area uh an increase is all in those smaller household categories that has an impact on household size you can see if you move over to household size which is here under how do we live uh one person and two person households combined together make up over 80 of all the dwellings in that area i 've only got one or two persons so average household size in fact is exactly two people per dwelling and falling over time so and if you go to the households without children which is also related and suggests that in there you can see that this is almost entirely the older couples without children and the old alone person so this is a very elderly area what 's the median age is that one median age of 64. that must be one of the oldest places in the whole country i think with a median age of 64. [Music] and of course your area profiles themselves so the topics that we 've been moving between they 're all summary and estimates how old are we different measures of age groups who are we culturally diverse groups education a disability or need for assistance what do we do which is about employment industries and occupations method of travel to work all of that sort of thing and then how do we live which is households housing tenure and dwelling information so again you can follow through what are those what are the characteristics of that place you can see housing tenure there in hawke 's nest full home ownership predominantly but there 's a significant sub category of renting there uh although that went down full home ownership went up so there 's a lot of people retiring to that area uh and as a consequence of that you would see that there 's a relatively low amount of employed population the labor force participation rate is only 33 it 's got a relatively high unemployment rate among those looking for work you can see that on there so those are the sorts of things that you can get out of the community profiles really good for telling the of a community defined by something other than place in the communities of interest section are there any questions at this point but just in terms of the area um harrington crowdy head and johns river that can be a little bit difficult for me in the water water and sewer business unit because we don 't service john 's river so oh okay it 'd be good if i could just get the population for harrington and crowding if you 're just after population you can do that there 's a uh specialist profiles down here it 's got locality snapshots uh and you can um you can get population and basic characteristics for one sensors only yeah any locality in midcoast there 's a huge number of them so if you want to look at um what was it crowd just say crowded head yeah yeah yeah if you want to look at that that 's there on its own it 's only got 75 people oh that 's great that 's exactly what everyone needed to say thank you do that for each of those you can list but that 's not the longer time series and not the more detailed breakup of those characteristics that we 've been looking at about that 's that 's fine that 's fine okay so that 's a good one to remember you 've got your locality snapshots there [Music] there 's a few other ways of looking at the information in the community profile and that one of those is via the social atlas so profile as i said is looking very is is very good at looking at let 's go and have a look here at a particular place so say we were we were picking let 's pick boston this time so it 's not very different foster 's uh a little bit different to the the rest of mid coast there uh it 's got more lone person households and actually less couples without children and you can see the raw numbers in there you also see the little a next to each of these so that sort of turns things around and puts it on you can go into the atlas and you can saying these are the characteristics for a particular area it 's how does this characteristic look like uh distributed across the region so if we have a look so we want to look at those lone person households actually i might go to all the lone person households because that we saw that was huge in um was that hawke 's nest tea gardens so if you go into that that goes you go straight into the social atlas which opens up a new a new window there which is mapping just that characteristic now the maps are at the sa1 level now these are the smallest districts that the census can produce information for most topics on and it is available at that level on the atlas but the sa ones don 't in themselves mean much other than being able to spatially map because uh i don 't think too many people identify with 1116907 and where 's that it happens to be just on the outskirts atari there but so we we don 't necessarily know that unless we map it so they 're very good small themselves they don 't necessarily mean that much they 're sort of one to two hundred households each on average you can see that one in wing and there 's got 93 households of which 30 are lone persons living alone age 65 plus in that one and you can even zoom right into that you can see the street pattern underneath you can turn the satellite view on if you want to you can see exactly what 's there so that 's that little slider changes the opacity so it changes so you can see the colors overlaid on top of it or you can zoom in to see what 's underneath there so overall that old lone person 's category you can see you do have to zoom in so i 'm just using the scroll wheel to zoom in on the on the mouse foster ton curry kind of has the lion 's share of that on the uh on the map there lots of high percentages of lone person households h65 plus and that 's shown as a percentage of all households a couple of other numbers if you want to the rollover shows you both the raw number and the percentage you can also change your year so if we look at 2016 and 2011 we always have the last two census years on atlas we don 't go earlier than that because the boundaries change too much in between censuses to be able to concord them at this level they 're say one level between more than one census at a time but in the new one new atlas we 'll roll out 2021 census information mid next year and we 'll have 2021 and compared to 2016 in there you can see there lots of um online person households in that area the other thing that you can do there 's a couple things you can do you can left click on each of these essay ones and build up a custom area custom area shows on here with all of the the sub places and you can export that into excel if you want to you can change your map once you 're once you 've got that custom area so if 'll update that and you 'll just need to re-export that again on the custom selection you 've got there and you can change your map to any of about 100 different maps on here once you 're in the atlas so you can see a range of different age groups for example that we 've got on there these are our standard ones and these are the ones associated with excuse me with the communities of interest module say mapping age 65 plus proportion of population you can see some of these places have got 70 plus of the population aged uh over retirement age that little one there i 'm reckoning that 's probably a retirement village of some description zoom in there i 've got a whole lot of streets named after people 's full names uh so i would say that 's probably a retirement community of some description you may know what it 's called or whatever um but you can try it 's the golden ponds retirement village that one golden pond okay yeah so uh about 80 percent of the population there is foster tongue curry it 's not much different to that um there 's a few few younger places there but you can also go over to the second tab here the analysis page and you can see oh this is 2011. i can actually change that back to 2016. um and it did change actually so you could say 65 plus in 2011 the area with the highest proportion was ton curry hawks and st gardens actually overtook that in in 2016. uh so you can see that you can do some sorting on that analysis page so if you want to know your highest and lowest percentages 865 plus hawke 's tea gardens 46 of population tan curry 43.9 there 's some sort of competition there i think between those two um and you can see that the average 29.9 percent for midcoast it also puts the benchmarks on here so just for comparison australia-wide 15.7 of population was a 65 plus midcoast pretty much doubles that and in fact the the area with the least population age 65 plus is stroud rural west even that is above the there if you want to know where the boundaries lie for those areas you can overlay your suburb boundaries on here by the way i can change the name if you like of that i prefer districts i think it makes more sense to call them districts you can see where the boundaries of those areas fall are at a certain level they remove the labels that 's glossed about so we 're strouder or westerns out here that 's strong and in those uh those areas over here so these boundaries we 've made them consistent over time so even though the small areas that make them up have changed in the census years in between we adjust all the past years to the current current boundaries in there so atlas is really two things enable you to look at a characteristic uh visually spread across the area see that 65 plus category really strongly in hawke 's nest there but it also allows you to see that in a list form on the on the analysis page so you can easily see what 's the highest and lowest you 've got your age groups there which you 've been through but you 've got a range of other topics in there household types which we 've had look at culturally diverse groups aboriginal and torres strait islander people and people born in specific countries or with specific ancestries uh incomes and well-being so the type of incomes and see for index which i will go through before we finish up today uh education levels uh workforce uh characteristics uh how people got to work on census day uh we 're all very interested in what we see in the next census from the worked at home one for example uh just bearing in mind that this is about a specific day so in the um in work from home in the last census was not such a thing but it was very high in gloucester balance which is sort of the rural area surrounding gloucester that 'll be mainly because farmers working on their own properties but the network at home sort of takes on a different meaning at the moment and so we 're watching that depending sort of thing um so you can monitor all that so that 's in the workforce you 've got transport uh housing and this leads into some of the stuff that we 'll be doing on housing id in the next session uh housing types housing tenure and housing costs the number of households in housing and mortgage address on there but this is 2016 data we 've got more up-to-date information and housing id on the affordability of housing which is based on recent sales and rentals so probably you 'd be better off using that in the in the housing tools as a measure of measure of affordability there so each of those you can easily change between if i go back to say the uh the culturally diverse groups we can have a look at the aboriginal and torres strait islander community in here and you can see the distribution of that population across uh across the area uh tari for example it 's got a high proportion in there and again you can use the analysis tab to see how that 's distributed across that uh identifying as aboriginal and torres strait islander in in tahrir you 've got a range of other ones in here things like low income households high income households internet connection is a useful one which we unfortunately won 't be able to replicate in the new census data because that 's not asked in the 2021 census high rate of internet connection there at holidays point uh quite a low rate in tongue curry which you probably expect with an older population you can see that mapped so atlas has got those two two things you can look at a map and you can look at a list of the the areas that are broken down you can also export the map image into any any format there or into a png image format i think you can also look at change in raw number terms or in percentage terms between those census years see most areas have increasing internet connection that 's probably why one of the reasons why they 're cancelling the question is that most households now do have internet access but it 's a good indication of disadvantage which is on the on the profile here index of disadvantage 928 full mid coast in the presentation i had the advantage and disadvantage index advantage and disadvantage index maps both the upper end of the scale and more advantaged households and the lower more disadvantaged households always the more disadvantaged places are the lower score on either of these you 're ever in doubt just check out the top ones karingai mossman willara and north sydney in new south wales the most advantaged and the bottom there for warren of central darling and walgott and with the covet outbreaks um in walgett it 's so interesting to see that they are among the most disadvantaged places in uh in new south wales mid coast is is fairly disadvantaged but not quite at that uh at that level with um 911 safa there which is uh in certainly in the lower range but not right at the bottom of the of the scale there of more interest this by the way i probably didn 't provide so much context on this but this is a really useful if advocate for a particular community on the basis of of disadvantaged uh disadvantaged population and it includes a whole it puts into a number uh an index score which ranks area a whole lot of measures like low incomes and higher unemployment single parent families lower education levels and unskilled occupations so the within your area interesting to note that holidays point is the most well-off_,_1572.799 the most advantaged place in mid coast even that is just marginally below the new south wales average so all the other areas are in the bottom range and you 've got three districts which are in the bottom ten percent of the state which are wingham tung curry and tari itself which are some fairly fairly big population places within your area as well these are quite disadvantaged so you can see that also on the atlas atlas will actually allow you to pinpoint will allow you to pinpoint on the index of advantage and disadvantage check if you are applying for a grant which index they want you to use the disadvantage one only measures the lower end of the scale the we show the darkest shading so the darkest shading on the um is the lowest or the most disadvantaged areas for the lower numbers and then the higher ones are the more advantaged more well-off areas you can see that many of the areas tar is a really interesting example many of the areas just surrounding tari are pretty well off but in the town itself there 's a lot of disadvantage and you can see actually the most disadvantaged spot within tari is a sea for index of 543 the effect of whole of mid coast is this area in here so again you can you can see that now mostly a see for index that low generally indicates social housing you can see that yes about 60 of all dwellings in that area are social housing i 'm sure you 're familiar with it as a place if you 're working in the council with a sea for that low uh certainly worth worth pointing out these ones just across the road are also fairly low safer and high rate of um high rate of social housing in quick question but i 'm not sure if you answered it before but what determines the the size of those districts were they generally based on population or is it more just the statistics and how they meant roughly yeah so the the sa-1 areas we don 't have any control over the abs to find those and they 're they 're supposed to have somewhere around 200 dwellings uh but they do vary a lot uh they also have to align to locality boundaries and that sort of thing yeah okay so some of them are a bit a bit smaller and some of them are a bit larger than that but uh you know on average is around 200 dwellings the population varies a bit more because the number of people who are dwelling in different areas varies quite a bit as well and sometimes they design them and then there 's a whole new housing estate pops up between when they design them in census so they get larger than they should uh so they 'll be split in the next census and that 's nothing yeah here which i think we should call districts uh we 've defined in consultation with council so uh the and they can be changed i will just take you back out then to the community profile the one area that we haven 't really touched on yet is the community of interest module this is a little bit different in the way that we look at a a place so area profiles profiles a either mid coast council overall or a part of that in geographic terms so it might be a profile of the hawke 's st gardens area for example the communities of interest enables you to pro profile within mid coast a sub community so that that is a profile of your indigenous community or the profile of your elderly population or a profile of your low-income households for example so i can 't go through all of these but you can see the different groupings that we 've got in here with your community of interest being defined by a particular characteristic so the indigenous profile in here is for aboriginal and torres strait islander people that characteristic at the uh at the last census with comparison to a an earlier year there are a range of sub categories in here then you can go through all the different topics for that particular community so in the case of the indigenous population you 've got service age groups you 've got our standard age groupings there midcoast council area compared to the same group in this case indigenous population in new south wales across the state or compared to total population and they do tell you quite different stories for a community of interest so you 've got two benchmarks you 've got a spatial benchmark and you 've got a total population benchmark for the community of interest so in this case you can see the aboriginal population here much younger than the total population overall and increasing across all of those groups if you change that back to the total so the um the indigenous population of new south wales benchmark you can see it 's similar much more similar in age group to um to the new south wales average but it is community than there are on average for aboriginal and torres strait islander people across new south wales there 's also a higher 65 plus population which there is obviously in the general community as well so you can tell a different story in the community of interest when depending on which benchmark you select whether you select that same group elsewhere or total population off your area a few other things on the indigenous profile you can look at the household types and the housing tenure so we did mention the lower socioeconomic status in the um in the social housing areas uh social housing is uh quite important in public housing we also split that up into the housing co-ops which are the um aboriginal uh co-op housing pretty important community in there as well but there 's a lot of people in private rental in that that category and also look at things like household types household size what sort of thing a lot of one-parent families in that community so it is unfortunately a story in many cases of disadvantage but you can draw that out with you can look at which may or may not be associated with that with disadvantage yeah my household income quartiles is great out there um so that 's all right so you 've got your age group so you can pick any one of these specific age groups and get a profile of that community so we know for instance 65 plus is a large group in mid coast but you can have a look at them uh 65 plus what sort of uh employment are they in are they are they still working over 65 in fact they 're not as a lower participation rate in in 65 plus so they 're more likely to be moving here to retire that sort of thing you can see are they still living with their kids at home or are they mainly now they 're mainly couples without children and so on and you can also see the types of dwellings that they live in at different age groups how many bedrooms they 've got whether they have internet access or that sort of thing for the specific group conversely you enormous group in your area but you can see that they 're in young children they 're zero to four-year-olds disproportionately in mid-coast more likely to be in one parent families a lot of that we 've seen is the aboriginal community so you can explore that for the age group there you can look at the same sort of things for low-income households what age groups are prevalent in the low-income households community we do have a definition for low-income households which i think is on the introduction page it 's the bottom about 20 of the uh the country um here bottom 20 of equivalence incomes across australia all that sort of thing you could also look at the characteristics of people needing assistance people with a disability uh and for instance employment outcomes all those sorts of things so quite a range of topics but just remember in the community of interest section you are looking at a group defined by a characteristic in the area profiles character you 're looking at the characteristics of an area in total uh in non-english speakers and overseas born as speak a language other than english um some of our classes have sub-categories here but you don 't there 's not enough non-english speaking background population to have subcategories on that one and sexes if you want to have a look at comparison between males and females and look at gender differences that 's on here so you can look at [Music] the characteristics and these are mainly employment and qualification related so you can look at employment who does more on paycheck yeah we didn 't include the domestic work on here for some reason that 's our arguments but oh what 's happening with this one it 's not working sometimes sometimes you get a whole lot of stuff in the url from other there is it 's come up there i don 't know why that doesn 't work if you do get that if you do get that issue hit that little reset icon that um it should go back to um so you guys can see unpaid child care females again you can compare females elsewhere you can compare to the opposite sex as well unpaid childcare because they 're retired in most cases there and the kids have left home so you can explore any of those any of those so some councils are doing gender equity studies and that sort of thing which is this doesn 't go the whole way of looking at for instance equal pay and all that sort of stuff you can look at incomes but remember that 's also it 's not broken up between the different hours worked as well so females do have lower incomes than males but that hasn 't been adjusted for things like occupations and hours worked which are in here as well so if you need to do that sort of study uh you 'd need to to go a little bit further into that females also more likely to work less paid hours the other new bits of the community profile which we 've got are jobseeker now i mentioned at the presentation we 've got job seeker numbers now every month from um from march 2020 through to june 2021 so this is a recent edition something that we get _``_2275.839 people are on jobseeker in each of these which are called sa2 so unfortunately that 's another level of geography which we don 't have elsewhere on the site but that 's all that 's published at however it does give you some information um about the number of people on that job seeker payment you can see that for instance taree tari is 14.4 of all the population are on job seeker and that 's quite high and that 's population age 15 to 64. so it 's working age population doesn 't include retirees in there so um yeah certainly worth we 're having look at we 'll be updating that i think we 'll get the july numbers in the next week for this one so it 's quite a recent one not not reliant on censors whereas mostly information area profiles communities of interest it 's all census data we have to go back quite a long way now we 'll be getting 20 21 but it 's a little while until that comes out this is a monthly data set so you can monitor that set here on annual migration by location firstly in the census uh this is a good lead into the population forecasts census shows where people move to and from to come to your area and what age they do that what mid coast has is a large population of people coming in for retirement and i mentioned that if you didn 't have that the you have natural decrease in population because more people die than are born because of the uh greater age structure of the mid coast area but you do lose 18 to 24 year olds and this is something we 're monitoring really closely um we 'll be interested to look at that in the next census people move out in their um their young adult years but anecdotally and at a at a state level we can see that there 's less movement out from regional areas for young people in the last year or so so with the pandemic that 's staying put in regional areas while people still retiring in from the cities so that may affect the results from the next census _``_2418.64 year on year is only in total for the local government area what this is showing your area is the area of interest and then the blue areas and this is just for the 2019 20 year are gains to your place in net terms and what so what this is saying is you 've got quite a bit of population exchange from the central coast central coast 417 people moved in in that year and 233 people moved out to the central coast from the coast but that 's a net migration in of 184 so that 's your biggest net gain that 's here at central coast but you can see every single area in greater sydney has got a positive migration to mid coast there 's a lot of movement in from greater sydney and that 's where most of your new population is coming from there are the red areas are the losses and that 's mainly to port macquarie and newcastle interestingly the loss to newcastle over many years has been quite high but in that last year last year was quite a bit lower again in 2021 's because the young people aren 't leaving so much anymore so you can explore those for each of the years that we 've got we get an update on this every march for the previous june the same time we get your population update in the population estimates page here so we 've got two 2020 population from midcoast and you can get that for each place as well not what 's going on in gloucester but there 's quite a bit of population growth across midcoast so that migration figure we then use that in the population forecast so where people move and what age they do that is a really important factor in the population forecast so i just want to finish up on that so the population forecasts where we start to tell that story ourselves based on the set of agreed assumptions about the community so that is where we think the population is now where it 's headed for 2036 but just be aware that the assumptions that underlie this were adjusted in january 2018 so obviously that is pre pandemic tracking pretty well they 're evaluated october last year they 'll be evaluated again soon and whether we need to adjust these assumptions but you can see there the track is somewhat linear growth there up to 113 000 by 2036. this is probably not far wrong australia 's population growth has fallen off a cliff and australia is not growing and may even be shrinking in population but areas such as midcoast which are still getting a lot of migration out of the cities probably likely to continue to see significant population growth in the future so i don 't think our forecasts are too far wrong there 2021 what do we have in 2020 which we 've got a population number official 94836 whereas the um official erp was 94 395 so we 're not far out we 've got 400 people below and i 'd expect it to be made up in the next two years if your population growth is probably going to increase a bit more in the next couple of years because of the migration in so i think you can have a fair now even though they 're still a couple of years old but we are monitoring them and we do review them relatively regularly if they need that what you can see is where that population growth is expected to be 2016 through 2036 and then a total increase was about 21 000 people total change there your biggest growth in taray old bar holidays point in brim uh while wing and balance which is that surrounding area of wingham is is showing a uh population decline there a lot of that where the new um population is is going to be dependent on where residential development is and this is a something that we haven 't we don 't necessarily uh factor in or we may have if you go to a particular place you can see the individual developments that are driving that change and so we 're that 's that 's specific about where and when new things are going in uh but if we have a look at the results we have a look at the population households and dwellings i 'm interested to see the occupancy in the occupancy rate there what about overall for mid coast the occupancy rate so there 's a number of percentage of all dwellings that are occupied we know there 's a certain percentage of holiday homes um and it 's not huge in mid coast there 's certainly areas of a lot more of that but it will depend on the place i think oxness tea gardens area has got a lower occupancy rate because there 's more holiday homes we 're largely in the forecast looks like we 're not changing that what can happen is if you 're getting migration in you can get population increase from people permanently occupying those holiday homes and that 's something we haven 't factored into the forecast but we need to potentially look at that next time if that 's if that 's happening may or may not be happening but we can certainly look at that you can see the the population numbers in each of those five year periods uh you 've got then things like the age structure so what 's what are the age groups look got a uh large increase in 85 plus almost doubling in the 85 plus population in that hawke 's st gardens area you can change the years by the way so if you want to start this at 2021 you can do that or you might say well i only want i only want the next 10 years so i can go to 2031 there so you can adjust that you 've got the same usual export options from the charts and the tables that you have in the community profile as well you can change those years and then you can have a look at that for another area as well so if you have a look at brimbin then well it 's a very small place at the moment but it 's got some growth expected in there it 's not been separated out in the i think that 's been separated out in the forecast but not in the profile because it 's too small at the moment for for profiling but it 's likely to have a higher population in future i assume there 's been see that 's not really kicking off for a couple of years though bremen 's a really interesting case there glenn we 're sort of looking at it from a water planning perspective and um yeah it 's essentially undeveloped but has the capacity to service up to 20 000 um lots i think but yeah it 's sort of a bit of a crystal ball exercise on when it will kick off if developers are able to to build and develop there yeah we 're assuming a fairly slow start in about 2024 to that so um yeah so it sounds like from what you 're saying it hasn 't started yet yeah that 's right there 's um i think there 's ongoing conversations with the developer on how we can get water and sewer services and um yeah as a start yeah so we have to sometimes in the forecast take those as a bit of a guess as to when they 're going to start um [Music] yeah so it will be it might be we might have to tweak those at some point but we it 's supposed to start according to forecasts so you 've got a little while um but also also pointing out in the forecast you 've got brimbin as a separate area in the community profile uh i don 't even know where that is um it 'll be in with something else that 's too small at the moment because the profile is passed data anyone know what area that we 've been maybe tarry balance okay it 's just on the outskirts isn 't it there it is just north of your screen there though yeah so it 's included with a whole lot of those little localities on the on the outskirts of atari yeah there 's not much there at the moment so that 's an important point then about the the uh forecast when we go in there brim ben is is there but you 've also got atari balance area so that towery balance area will be slightly different to the atari balance area in the community profile because it doesn 't include brimming you can see it 's separated out but uh see the in the forecast results which i mentioned in the presentation components of population change if you go over to midcoast council overall you can see that in a five-year period you 've got 4374 births expected and that rises only slightly to 2036 but have a look at the number of deaths is about 6 000 deaths rising to about 8 000 in five years over that time frame so your natural increase which is actually natural decrease in the midcoast case goes from about 400 per year to about 800 per year over the next 15 years so basically to grow the population you 've got to keep importing more people over that time frame because you do have a rate of natural decrease that doesn 't mean that you 're more likely to die but if you move to midcourt it doesn 't mean you 've got a high death rate overall it just means that people are older in mid coast so they 're less likely to have children and more likely to die because we do die at a certain age you can see the the for the overall 2.24 that 's actually above replacement level it 's just that you don 't have all that many young people having babies uh but as when it 's age adjusted you 've got a relatively high fertility rate so we factor all of that into the forecast we factor in a death rate for each one as well the forecast mapping section forecast mapping shows you where you can expect a particular population group to be so for instance if you were planning for say you were planning for a youth youth plan or something like that you might want to say i want to know about 10 to i said 10 to 18 year olds or something like that 10 to 19 let 's go with that i 'm just picking up an age group sort of at random there and maybe i want to know over the next 10 years how that group is going to change so maybe i 'm looking at playing a skate park or some other sort of youth youth facility based on the forecast assumptions this is where you group and this is in the forecast mapping population and age structure map so you can see there uh the atari 317 more people and that brimbane area expected to develop by then another 126 in there wingham another 97. but have a look at wing and balance it 's it 's falling 107 uh it 's the lowest the most decrease there some of these are increases some of the decreases in that grip so overall we would expect that youth group mean nearly a thousand more by 2031. but quite a lot of areas some of the older communities there i expect they can have declines in that group while others have got increases so that can help you plan as to where these um where the populations that use a particular service would be over time so that 's basically it for the population forecast or the only other thing there is drivers of population change which is uh a bit hard to demonstrate in these sort of sessions it 's a little bit of an essay sort of it 's quite text heavy but it 's role and function it plays who moves in who moves out and where the housing supply has been identified as dimensions we 've been there in particular so have a read of that if you want to know why the forecast is sort of saying what it 's saying there but what the clear indication is that you get a lot of retirement from sydney not much in from overseas you get movement out to queensland and newcastle young people and that really underpins that we overlay those those new dwellings that are where they 're going in and the birth of death rates and see what 's what comes out of the model as far as that future population next next sentence results will come out we 'll adjust the the base population and increase that time period to another five years on the end of the forecast as well so that 's where where those um those come from community profile social access and population forecast they work they do working well together for the most part because most of the areas are the same you can say how 's the characteristics spread across our area atlas and what does the future population look like in the population forecast so that 's really it for those three we 've also one other thing i suppose just to mention you do have report sections you can download a report on an area or on a specific community of interest um if you 're interested in our blog blog.com.u we 'd love to have some comments and discussion on on the blog as well this one 's my predictions for what the census will show uh and the uh what we call the crystal ball gazing so these are based on all the things that are happening at the moment uh what are we expecting to see from the census results uh and there 's some some key things in there so you 're welcome to have a read of that if you 're interested uh you can always contact me and id generally if you have any queries about what 's in the site as far as the census update we we really relied on that for a lot um which will be coming through from about june next year but we can 't have it in the site immediately it will take a little while for us to get all of that data onto the site but we 'll roll that out as soon as we can you do also have a light version of our economic profile with some basic numbers on the workforce but i understand you use that competitor 's tool predominantly for the the economy there just with the blog glenn um i just subscribed so are you sort of being encouraging participation like about what we 're seeing on the ground in our area or yeah well please do any you can comment on any of our our blogs and uh the comments are moderate moderator because we do get some crazy ones but uh if you genuinely commenting on on population trends we 'd love to see that yeah absolutely yes thank you glenn that was and lindy that was really good for us we 're planners i think most of my team 's been in attendance and we 've been having great tools and you know it 's so helpful for us so thank you oh that 's good well thanks for the feedback uh and um we 'll see you you can always uh contact me if you 've got any more questions uh as well uh emails uh probably best but if you sign up for the the blog uh you you also get access to our chat there 's a chat feature that comes up on the on the tools uh and if it 's enabled i don 't think i 've got it enabled at the moment because it 's mainly me there 's a couple of others that do it but uh when it 's enabled then you can chat to someone if you 've got any queries as you 're using the tool as well thank you _"

that about the stolen generation there 's still a lot of understanding like when my uncle got taken away i didn 't realize conditional void zones i didn 't realize that he was a styler generation so my friend explained it to me and i 've met a few people that are still on generation and look in their eyes it 's just empty and what 's been done in their lives the national sorry day is a nationwide uh day on the 26th of may and it recognises and allows people to bring or to come together to understand to start the healing process around the impact of the stolen generations when kevin rudd said sorry to the aboriginal peoples australia-wide i saw the faces on a lot of people and to them that meant a lot he 'd done a lot of damage yes too because what the government to me means a sadness because of what happened in the past with children taken away from their parents and not even coming back to someone not coming back to meet their parents parents passing away before they even come back to meet him and well like my grandmother i didn 't find out that she was a stolen generation until i did some family history and it was her three sisters and her brother that was taken from their mother sorry means um sorry for the loss of my ancestors my aunties and uncles my nan and pop who were in the stolen generations here is a whole generation which is a community which is largely based on the connection with the phobias being disconnected from their phobias and that was cruel my great-grandmother was taken to court at maitland and she was told that she was an unfit mother and she had no support to help her with their children and i 've got documentation to say that her mother-in-law their two sister-in-laws are in this court with her the magistrate still took the children off to fully it 's very very hard for people that aren 't part of aboriginal communities have not been directly affected by the stolen generation to fully comprehend the depth of impact it has not only on families but on whole communities i think the first one was i can 't think of the documentary that movie the fence yeah when that come out i watched that and that was pretty yeah horrific i feel um yeah so that sort of touched deep inside me yeah my mum wouldn 't talk about things um and when she did talk to me i didn 't realize that she was a stolen generation when she told me that she grew up in an orphanage a nun you know not an orphanage but a convent with nuns her and her sister and her brother she was five-year-old_``_243.28 her sister was three and her brother was a baby and she didn 't even know that you know that she was either and seeing being a five-year-old kid she didn 't know and she still didn 't know until like until she died every aboriginal friend that 's my personal like i understand that when i have 20 friends and 18 of them have somebody is connected to a strong generation that 's a story of a whole population i was talking to some of the elders in the chinchilla boy zone um and that was telling me about how they were treated up at quinchula and you know going out on cold days rounding up the cows and everything and they had no shoes they were standing in cow poo to keep their feet warm which was you know that was disgusting you know you know if you 've got to take the kids away treat them right the ignorance of they still don 't understand us our aboriginal people our aboriginal family works they don 't know the structure but nothing i 'm a very new immigrant to this country just three years four years into the country i understand that i 'm participating in the colonization of this land and i 'm sorry that 's what sorry means to me and i actually acknowledge that i 'm using the resources of the the uh and conserving for 60 000 or more years and i 'm honored to be take a share of it but i 'm still conscious that i 'm part of that process of colonization or innovation whatever you want to call it and it 's also a great opportunity to take what 's happened in the past and to look forward to the future and to really start a healing process so we can work together in the full and true spirit of reconciliation to make sure that all people in australia have a common future together we 've got to move on yeah reconciliation and do what i can do now not what 's happened in the past there still needs to be a lot of change a lot of change and it still needs to be you know average for children with aboriginal carers it 's a real chance for all australians to reflect to take a step back and to think about those impacts to put themselves in the same shoes if it happened to them or a member of their family and to really understand the impact they need to um learn more about aboriginal culture about us learn more about us and understand us better us as aboriginal people we need to get together and it 's kind of like um a celebration that we don 't live in that society anymore it 's great that we can acknowledge what 's happened and and by acknowledging that we are healing we need to be grateful for where we are now today you _"

    "text": "[Music] good evening everyone and welcome to our marine discovery series uh we have an excellent evening for you tonight with being joined by milly formby from birdlife australia and also nick coleman from midcoast council we 're going to talk about a range of things uh shorebirds and how they connect our world really really interesting stuff so this evening 's marine discovery series is being uh co-hosted by hunter local land services and midcoast council would like to say thank you for them out to them for their involvement it 's going to be a great evening so i 'll just uh introduce millie so milly formby is a zoologist and recreational pilot who first began learning to fly in 2016 to follow the shorebirds on migration she currently works for birdlife australia as a project officer for their migratory shorebird program and millie also has a background in the arts and is an illustrator of the wing threads children book co-authored with jackie karen which will be coming out in 2021 to learn more about wing threads you can visit wingthreads.com and tonight milly 's going to my name is millie formby and i 'm a project officer for birdlife australia 's migratory shorebird program and thank you to midcoast council for inviting me to speak tonight as part of the marine and catchment discovery series tonight i 'm going to be sharing with you all things migratory shorebirds and by the end of this talk i hope i will have you convinced that sherbets are the most awesome birds in the world but firstly what exactly is a shorebird okay well sure birds are a group of bird species that can 't land on water like seagulls and other sea birds and they don 't have webbed feet either for that reason and they 're commonly referred to as waiters because most of the time you see them waiting around wetlands mudflats and intertidal areas to feed in australia there 's more than 50 species of shorebirds and most of them are migratory and they belong to several families with fabulous names like godwits and curlews sandpipers not stints snipe and pratt and coals and i 'm sure some of you are familiar with those birds showers spend most of their time here in australia during their non-breeding season which for us is late spring to early autumn then around march to april they take off on an epic journey all the way to the arctic tundra to breed and that 's about twelve and a half thousand kilometers away and to get there they follow a bird migration highway called a flyway and australia is part of the east asian australasian flyway and there 's eight global flyways in the world and the east asian australasian flyway has the most number of species and the highest number of individual birds as well with about six million waiters estimated to use that route every year and to make that epic journey they take binge eating to the next level so just before they migrate they eat lots and lots and their bills are adapted to feed on many different things that live at varying depths in the mud to reduce the interspecies competition so they can detect that food in the mud too using pressure sensors in their build that are called herbst corpuscles which i the same way that bat echo echolocation works for them to detect prey they like to eat uh shellfish like pippies as well as worms sea cucumbers crab shrimp and other invertebrates that are found in the mud and they build up stores of fat and protein so that they can fly those long distances and some shorebirds will almost double their body weight in size from eating just these invertebrate foods they also undergo some pretty big uh rapid physiological changes just before they migrate too so to be super energy efficient on the flight they shrink the muscles they don 't need for flying so the muscles in their legs but also in their gut because they 're not going to be doing any eating or drinking on the fly and the flight muscles they use so the muscles in their chest get bigger but also their heart muscle gets bigger too so that they can pump more oxygen carrying blood around the body while they 're flying because they actually flap their wings the whole way they 're not gliding like other migratory species are and on demanding enough they also need all this food so that they can grow new feathers so as i mentioned before they have a non-breeding and a breeding season and they also have a non-breeding and a breeding plumage so this red knot that i 've got here on the screen is actually in non-breeding plumage and the one i showed just before here is in its breeding plumage so it 's sporting this beautiful brick red coloration on the chest and head so they molt just before they migrate and just after they migrate too so and this uh breeding plumage is all about impressing one another for mating now the smallest species to undertake this epic migration is called the redneck stint and it weighs only as much as a tim tam about 25 grams so it 's just a little bird and it can fly up to five thousand kilometers in one go equally impressive is one of our larger shorebirds weighing in at around 800 grams the bartel godwin and the bartel godwin holds the world record for the longest non-stop flight ever recorded for any bird screen is a very famous female godwin her name is e7 and she was fitted with a satellite transmitter in new zealand in 2007 and was then tracked crossing the pacific ocean on migration from alaska to new zealand on a continuous flight that stretched just under 12 000 kilometers over nine days so she flew that entire way without sleeping or eating or drinking on the way now when the shorebirds arrive on the arctic tundra up north they nest on the ground and their breeding plumage isn 't just for attracting a mate it also helps them to be super cryptic and you can see here in this image there 's a bartow godwit male sitting in amongst the moss and lichen and grass there on the tundra and their eggs and chicks are also super camouflaged in this environment so here 's a picture of three bartow godwick chicks sitting in the nest and the chicks are what we call precocial which means they can feed themselves just after hatching so they don 't need mum and dad to go out and forage and bring food back to sea birds and the arctic tundra is the perfect place to be a shorebird chick because there 's millions of mosquitoes and other other insects in the arctic summer for them to feed on they also feed on berries and such so this migration ecology has evolved over time because the birds are exploiting these high energy rich resources at different times of the year and there 's also fewer predators on the arctic tundra too so they can that can prey on nesting adults and cheeks which are quite vulnerable you know nesting on the ground in that way but what is probably most amazing though is that the adults leave on their southward migration before the chicks uh are old enough to fly and yet the younger birds that have just fledged and learned to fly know how to make their way back to australia on their own at about six to eight weeks of age so that 's pretty incredible and once they arrive back here in australia they 'll spend the first uh two years of their life uh in here in australia or new the east asian australasian fly away before they become mature enough to start breeding themselves and then they 'll also start making that migratory journey up to the arctic to breed every year like their parents so they 're constantly chasing an endless summer between australia and the arctic and we have records of tagged birds so we do have a banding and flagging program for shorebirds here in australia that 's led by the australasian water studies group and we have records of red knots that are more than 20 years old so that means that during their lifetime they will have flown more than the distance from the earth to the moon just on migration alone and i think you 'll agree with me that that is pretty amazing their behavioral ecology though also makes them quite vulnerable to extinction because they 're relying on a lot of different habitats when they migrate and the flyway is like a chain with links in it and if any one of those links fails the chain becomes broken and indeed they are the world 's uh most endangered group of to stop over and refuel immigration have become degraded or lost completely and part of the problem around that is that the wetland places that they like to feed don 't always look particularly appealing to humans you know they 're boggy swamps or you know widespread mud flats and uh with mosquitoes and such so it makes sense why someone might think it would be an improvement to fill it in or and build a block of flats or or drain it for agriculture and this is what 's happened a lot around the yellow sea in china and korea which is the major stopover in the east asian australasian flyway for migratory shorebirds and some of those speeding areas have been reclaimed for development and you can see in the image on the left a huge flock of cod widths there in front of an area that 's being dredged for reclamation fortunately though you know we are making headway uh with shelby conservation in those areas and last year the chinese government declared the yellow sea a world heritage area so that was a huge win for wetland habitats not just around the yellow sea but also here in australia and all throughout the flyway because as i mentioned earlier the flyway is like a chain with links in it and all of those links in the chain need to be taken care of and the shorebirds spend most of their time here in australia six months of every year so it 's even more important for us here in australia to be taking the lead on that and looking after estuary sorry wetlands and industries is not just for the birds but it 's for us too because uh wetlands provide us with all sorts of ecosystem services so you may not know peat wetlands for example stores 30 of the world 's carbon so they 're helping to mitigate impacts of climate change uh wetlands also absorbed and stored store water so they 're helping to filter out and remove any pollutants to help provide us with clean water supply mangrove wetlands provide protection to coastlines against storm surge and wetlands also provide us with livelihoods and places of recreation to billions of people worldwide shelby 's a wonderful living expression of how we are all connected to one another through this global ecological network of wetlands and like many of us do shorebirds call many places home along the east asian australasian flyway and their migration links over 4 billion people in 23 countries and four continents and that 's over half of the world 's population which is pretty incredible so shorebirds really do connect our world and they share a message with us that conservation is a way of caring for all life that includes people it includes us too so by now i hope i 've convinced you that shorebirds are totally awesome and as such i can only reason that you 'd like to go and see some shorebirds yourself in your local area and it just so happens that the manning river estuary and nearby port stephens are two of the best places for shorebirds migratory shorebirds and some of our residential bird species too in new south wales so port stephens is internationally significant for the critically endangered eastern colu which means there are regularly flocks of at seen there at port stephens and manning river estuary is uh nationally significant for eastern curly which means that 0.1 of the population is or more is seen regularly at that site and both sites are also nationally significant for double-banded plumber which is a winter migrant to australia it 's a bit different to all of the other shorebird species that i 've been talking about it actually migrates from new zealand to australia during the austral winter and then it goes back to new zealand during our austral summer so it 's a little bit different in that way uh but all the other birds as i mentioned fly to the arctic and back and you can also see a lot of bartel godwin 's in this area uh wembrul pacific golden plover and sandaling uh gray tail tattler and sharp tailed sandpiper so they 're the most common migratory shorebirds that you see in those two regions nearby as i mentioned before your best bet for seeing shorebirds is between september and april during their non-breeding season that 's when they 're here in australia but there the place between may and august as well so i mentioned earlier that the birds don 't start doing that migration to the arctic until they 're about two years of age some species is three so those younger birds remain here in australia so you could go out and see some of those juvenile birds i know um here in the hunter um where i 'm located at the moment stockton sends it is quite a good flock there of eastern curlew and bartel godwin i 'm not sure about up at port stephens and manning roof i haven 't been there recently but um i 'm sure if you went out there you 'd see a few birds around so you can look up where to find different species um like those i just mentioned in a birding field guide if you 've got one i um i like to use the pizzier night app on my phone i also got the australian bird guide which is by csiro publishing which i like or if you 're a bit more tech savvy birdlife have an app called bird up manning river estuary and see where different species have been seen and i 've just got a map up here on my screen of the two spikes uh at manning river estuary where the best places for seeing uh shield birds so at harrington and at farquaad inlet they 're the old bar um yes and if you want to you can also uh register for the bird data online through bird life 's website for free and um you can download the app on your phone too and you can record any migratory birds that you might see there in the app which goes towards helping our national shorebird monitoring program so actually helping uh contribute to some of the conservation efforts for migratory shorebirds at an international level which is just awesome uh the other site i mentioned was port stevens and um that 's internationally significant for east and curly eastern curlew and bartel godwin are the two species you 'll see the most around port stephens and the best places there around swan bay soldiers point and uh window was spit near corey island there river estuary actually is the largest site uh in uh of um breeding it 's the largest breeding colony sorry of little terns in new south wales and uh that 's a highly significant too and there 's a breeding colony at port stephens as well so they 're both really important sites for shorebirds in australia and when you 're out and about if you do go and look for some migratory shorebirds there 's many things um that you can do to help take care of those birds and the main thing is to minimize the amount of disturbance that you that you are due to those birds when you 're out and about in wetlands and estuaries so they need that energy uh to be um flying those long distances as we mentioned and restoring their feathers and stuff like that so if you 're constantly spooking them they 're wasting that energy on uh disturbance and you know protecting themselves and make sure if you go out with your dog on the beach keep your dog on the leash that 's really important and if you your boat or horse riding that sort of thing keep your distance we say about 250 meters and even if you 're out just looking at the birds with your binoculars it 's really great to have a telescope actually if you go and look for shorebirds so that you can keep your distance and still have a really good look uh try and stay about 100 meters away from the birds i haven 't gone into all of the different species today because there 's so many of them and they 're not the easiest birds to identify for a birding beginner but if you 're interested in learning more about shorebird id birdlife have a wonderful range of free resources that are available online that you might like to take advantage of there 's the shawbird id booklet which is very popular and it 's now available online as a downloadable pdf so you can go to the birdlife website i 've put the link there on the um slides at birdlife.org forward slash projects forward slash alberts 2020 forward slash counter resources which is a bit of booklet it 'll come up at the top of the listing and you can just click on it and it will go directly to that document um on that same page there 's also some great resources on id waterbirds and a and turns as well there 's a booklet called my turn that helps rid turns so uh that 's it from me thank you so much everyone for your time and um yes i guess i will go to questions thank you thanks millie um so just for everybody watching as i mentioned before there 's a little um q a button down the bottom so if you just press on that not the chat button just the q a and you can ask any questions and then we 'll get really to answer them um just while we 're waiting though i thought that was really interesting really and particularly the way um that they migrate such long distance like you you really think about that in your head and just how far they 're going um you mentioned about tracking them and knowing how far they you actually do in order to track the birds yeah so um that 's with the australasian white studies group which i mentioned before and we use two different methods one is um satellite tagging so we have little devices that have um a little solar panel battery on the back and they 're fitted to the birds with the harness and the way we i should explain how we catch them actually it 's quite epic um we used a technique called cannon netting and it 's um what it sounds like actually we have big cannons that are attached to a net and the cannons are buried in the sand on the beach and is strategically placed so um we usually do a recce trip beforehand to see where the birds are roosting on the beach of wherever we 're targeting and as the high tide comes in the birds will flock and sit on the beach to roost and hopefully they sit in front of our net and then we can fire the cannons so everyone 's hiding in a bird height far back behind the the the birds and then we 're able to remove the birds from the net and pop them in holding cages made of shade cloth and um we can fit them with a little metal bands and identifying leg flags on on their legs and some also get fitted with satellite tags as i mentioned and those satellite tags uh send back data about where the birds actually are and it 's um transmitted live you know during their migration and it 's really valuable information because um we have an idea about where the birds go but often it ends up being a lot broader we find out exactly where they 're going and it 's often on a much broader scale and we need to know that so that we can target which habitats need protection as well as at what times of the year those birds are actually there the other technique we use is a geolocator which is a lot smaller um and a lot cheaper as well so a satellite tag costs about five thousand dollars for one unit but a geolocator costs five hundred dollars geo locator it doesn 't transmit live information you actually have to re-trap the bird to retrieve the device and then you can download the data from it so it doesn 't work for birds unless they are a species that has high site fidelity which means they 're coming back to the same place again and again year after year and so some species that works really well for like ruddy turnstones we have a group of ready turnstones that were captured on king island and fitted with geo locators and we 've had a 50 uh recapture rate over many years with those birds which is really amazing that 's very high for any any species of bird and those geo locators they can tell us longitude and latitude data but they also tell us behavioral information like um nesting patterns so the geolocators record light patterns so if the bird is sitting on a nest the geolocator is covered up so it comes through in the data as a darkness pattern and we can tell when they 're flying because it 's a light pattern but also bird 's standing in salt water you can expect that it 's feeding because the um it 's picking up that conductivity if it 's flying you wouldn 't have that conductivity pattern so we also get behavioral data from geolocators so it just depends what kind of information you 're wanting to get and um yeah the likelihood of being able to capture the birds against the which technique you 'd choose and that 's how we find out those data um there 's another question that 's been asked uh do these satellite tags affect the bird 's speed in flight or any of those yes that 's a really good question and it 's uh it 's really important so we cannot fit anything to the bird that is more than i think it 's more than um two percent of their body weight something like that so they 're very very lightweight tags the geolocators weigh less than one gram and i think the biggest tags we fit to red knot are 2 gram we have 2 gram and 5 gram satellite tags the 2 gram gram ones go on larger species like uh wimbrell and east and curly so yes it 's very important that they 're very lightweight so that they 're not impacting on the birds in that way and the harness are fitted in such a way too so that they 're not going to um impact on the bird flapping its wings or um yeah interfere with its flight in any way and you know we 've had we 've had birds like our wimbrell um that we 've tracked for three subsequent years in a row and they successfully bred and things like that so we have um indications that show that it 's not not impacting on the bird 's ability to breed or to make undertake that migration and such which is which is good that 's what we want yeah next question how many eggs are you doing eastern colors like oh okay i 'm not sure specifically for east and curly but most sugars tend to lay uh three to four eggs that seems to be a thing yeah uh is it possible that the shorebirds environmental conditions environmental conditions i 'm just wondering if they think that um or if they 're meaning that um that are the shell birds there is it becoming a protected area which is a little bit about what we 're going to talk about oh okay yes um no no i don 't think so not in not in china um i i think um i 'll maybe i 'll answer that in a bit more detail after nick 's next talk because there is a long long answer to that so yeah all right well we might leave the questions there for now we are going to have another opportunity to q and a um next on his presentation as well so there 'll be more chances to chat with millie um but we 'll move on so i 'll introduce our next speaker who is nick coleman who works for midcoast council he is an environmental officer with midcoast council and he undertakes a lot of projects in our area and one of those is working with our shorebirds so um nick 's going to give us doing in this area yeah yeah thanks can you hear me thanks for that area i appreciate that um just quickly to touch on something to talk about in my talk um the dredge spoil if there 's dredging done in manning the manning area we put the dredge spoil out the shorebirds we will really like to the strawberries that i 'm going to talk about really like the nest dinner so it 's something that we think about and where we put the judge spoil and but that 's yeah that 's probably not what you were talking about the question was but anyway i 'll share my screen all right so what we 're talking about is the shorebirds that actually nest in in the manning area so these are they they nest in the summer periods the same time as millie 's um international uh guests arrive our ones uh are under breathing and nesting up these are the industry partners that we all we all band together to work on on the protecting our breathing shorebirds so there 's quite a few of this and i thought i 'd bring it bring it to your attention now and i 'll point out a couple of the key ones so the first key one is the volunteers so we have a good network of volunteers always looking for more and they help gel everyone together and as you 'll see later a lot of our management has to be at the usually available in keene the next person i 'd like to point out is the shorebird ranger silas darnell he 's he 's funded by the national park saving our species uh funding and he does a lot of the monitoring and he 's on the spot for most of the time so um but yeah the thai midcourse council ground lands local land services all the bird groups and university newcastle 's getting on board yeah it 's a it 's a big project but if we all do a little bit it goes a long way so as milly said um these are the the two main breeding areas for the birds i 'm going to be talking about um yeah both areas the the point the point to make here is that for in regards to the little turn which i 'll talk about in a second uh this is the most important breeding area colony in new south wales a quarter of the little terms that reach adulthood each year grew up in the manning area so to get on to the the three birds the shorebirds that that nest here so the little turn is the up left one uh it can migrate from southeast asia comes in in australia in the summer east coast of the um east coast of australia and it will it will start you will lay eggs in the october period and around about april it will have flown away juveniles could stay the quiet oyster catcher uh an endangered bird it will stay here all year round but it also breeds in um in the summer period on the beaches and the other beach is the uh the alibird is the beach stone fairly it used to breed here fairly regularly there was one couple but one of them was taken we think was 't breed anymore but uh one is still can be seen every now and then we 're hoping you 'll get a partner soon and start breeding up again so uh just to go on to what they 're so similar to the melees one that uh buried up in the northern hemisphere well these ones that breathe here and they go by camouflage but they use large open expanses of sand to lay to build a nest and lay their eggs so um and go by camouflage so there 's no vegetation around it 's just open sand they dig a little depression lay two to three eggs this is a little turn uh nest and after a period of time the eggs will hatch and then the chick will stay for a few days because i can 't can 't walk in that depression and there 's another picture of them there so they rely on camouflage uh it 's just nothing to say that they 're there and they 're easily they 're easily trodden on and i 'll talk about that in a bit but um run and then they pelt off into cover and then their their parents will feed them white bait and all that for quite a while so in regards to management so this is the some data we 've got on the um a little turn in the manning region so these are the number of eggs recorded from 1993 to 2020 and yeah this is the number of leads so what which what we try to do is keep the number of little turned eggs and the number of sleds fairly at the same level you 're going to have you don 't have not all of them survive of course depending on a number of factors about control but we try to keep it keep it kind of relevant there 's two years i 'll draw your attention to where that didn 't happen and that was 2001 where we had a number of eggs but zero thirds and that was due to a fox and in 2017 it went down to just one or two successful fledged birds and that was due to full drive activity and then here from the little turns and they went down to window whopper uh that time dan talked next and then they were starting to get numbers back up again but there is a slight downward trend in there oh i don 't know if that 's across the board with all of new south wales or just just here i don 't know but as i said earlier a little turn can to hang out in other countries so it could be other factors at play so when we get together with the management strategies we all band together all those people in the first slide i showed you and we also we all start planning so we go over what worked the previous year um what didn 't work the previous year and what we need to do for this year 's breeding colony and allocate tasks and resources to the people and it just means that no one 's over inundated and things can get moving and then we set up a time frame so everything can be done in time so just to jump into some of that colony a little bit earlier in 2001 uh fox control and successful little bird a little turn and plateaus for catcher and uh beach bank early breathing is hand in hand you 've got to control the fox and that 's been known since we started doing this that or ever started being done back in the early 90s late 80s um so and this this requires a multi-agency approach private land holders crown lands local land services council we all get together and we start putting the baits out for the fox about three months before the shorebirds start arriving in the case of that 2001 example we think one fo uh was bait shy didn 't take the baits and it got into the colony over a couple of nights and and ate a lot if as we all communicate better and if the bait shy fox is determined then we 've got funding usually from the saving a species or even council to get in a uh a trapper and actually hunt down that errant fox and so the baits are buried and this is a and so we 'll know and then on the left here is the bait station 's an example but as i said earlier it extends out into private land and all the rest and um communication signage informing people that the baits are laid so the next uh the next major threat the numbers of the birds taken over the period here is avian predation and this is um this is crow 's crows uh seagulls and gulbill turns they they take eggs and chicks um some some previous management historically we 've we 've tried putting wire cages on the nests but after the eggs are being laid and that didn 't work the birds got those nests were abandoned but that would be expanded other ways to protect them is we 've tried the trial for a couple of years putting these shelters out and so the little chicks here that can just barely make out who would run into them they didn 't really work um crabs like them but those little birds didn 't uh so what what they do like when they 're at the driftwood they if that 's there that 's what they tend to run into um there 's a study where where in regards to protecting the eggs where um cyclist darnell the the ranger and university of newcastle were just starting out an honest project start looking at the management strategies to protect the eggs so that 's just starting so that 'll be interesting hopefully you might be able to give a talk on this next year when we start getting some results in also just out of interest when we as you can see here there 's a there 's a white tag where we will tag the nests to monitor them and back in the early days we would have used the cattle tag there and then the crows quickly figured out that when they saw the cattle tag there was a nest nearby and then the nests were hammered so that quickly got changed to that birds can 't determine it so something that you 've always got to be on the ball watching what 's happening and adapting quickly the other threat is people of dogs four-wheel drives and just walking on there on the nests and you i 've been out there plenty of times and you you do not throw the eggs they 're so camouflaged and they 're so much like rocks you will not see them until you 're really close so um the the best way we can to negate the people effect is fencing it 's cheap it 's quickly put out we we put out one strand of bacon so it 's really it 's really um quick and simple it 's just an indicator this is an example of harrington would put this net would put this out before the birds arrive we we know where they 're going to nest we get the eye and you know you know what they like and um we we fence it out and yeah no no four wheel drives no and no folder drivers will ever go in there it 's just it 's been working very well the next thing is of course signage so for four-wheel drives just directional arrows to say which way to go and endangered shorebird information a bunch of ecological information and then you know no cars no people and no domestic dogs or no dogs and what we found is that it was people had to get up there to have a look and it was a bit confusing messaging so now we 're trying out the the simple you know no dogs and a little bit of information there of um of the shorebirds uh just so when people are walking their dogs on the beach stick to the intertidal zone when the shore birds are breathing in summer don 't let your dog keep them on a leaf don 't let the mountain into that area and it 'll be fine because the the nests will smell like bird and it 'll attract the dogs to it if the in the area you can they actually find the nests they plodd along and find them and um it 's a delicious egg there uh the other signage is um just a general informative sign showing where the shorebirds uh go and where you can and can 't go and parking is educational this is like miley 's talk earlier it talks about um all the migratory shorebirds that come visit and need the area to feed a bit on the breeding shorebirds and a little bit of ecological information just to get interest into the in a bit of education uh and in regards to education so uh for four-wheel drivers there 's the brochure which is share the shore message into tidal zones they birds wouldn 't um nest or lay eggs in the intertidal zone get washed away so there 's that messaging and it 's working well national parks does educational for school children um for straw birds and then on community events we have uh education days where we have models and we have a little interactive display for the kids to build clay eggs and bury them in and so just to just to demonstrate just how easy it is to put them to disappear and some videos as well on on beach usage and shorebirds so the the third major threat is a big one and probably the biggest of all of them and and yeah that that takes out the most but uh the dynamic environment and this is where when we all work together as a group it makes it makes makes or breaks us really it doesn 't happen very often some seasons i 've never experienced but other seasons have um once the shorebirds at all turns have laid their eggs and they 're established you there 's there is leeway you can then raise the eggs up if it 's going to be inundated on sandbags and sand and they won 't get abandoned and also um in the 2013 14 years the the runners were collected into buckets when the inundation was happening when the water went away they were released again and um yeah that works well the parents still came back to feed them um there 's also other ways you could put flagging bunting out if they don 't want to nest in an area or you could put short models of shorebirds in another area to attract them there um that 's that 's the main management strategy for the other um the other we uh we 're collating all the 20 years of shorebird management strategies and data putting that together just a little guide to know what works what doesn 't just in case uh if we don 't trial the same things like the cages over the eggs that won 't be trialed again and focus on stuff that does work so or the trial and error of previous land managers and volunteers which is expensive but the volunteer network is expensive and that 's all being recorded well so i think that 's about it for me excellent thanks nick um so what we 'll do now is we 'll do a little bit of a panel and i 'll um both millie and nick to answer some more questions um that 's some great uh very interesting stuff that they 're working on there nick lots of different things happening for the shorebirds in the local area which is really fantastic um obviously it 's as millie mentioned before it 's mainly um our meeting area and then also down at winda wapa is there there was a bit finding that there 's birds turning up in smith 's lake area as well i uh for the for the playing of eggs i haven 't heard of it but that doesn 't mean that it 's not happening um these are the winter whopper in these two areas uh areas that i know about for for um eggs and and breathing but i i i don 't know it is the answer and if it does happen it would be good to contact council and let us know um because these birds seem to keep going back to the same areas every year but if something happens in one they may shift and or if the conditions that smith like change to a way that they like it 's usually the sand is open bit of spin effects and um close to close to uh or the ocean of course with white bait if if those conditions become better they may move there so it 's a dynamic changing environment so it 's always worth um being open to it perfect well i just i would just say that this job for a couple of years now and it 's very heartening to see the community come together and just just looking after the shorebirds and doing it just a little bit and it goes such a long way um keeping the like the four wheel drives are no longer a problem that 's going great the people not walking in there domestic dogs uh are a problem they just run in and go crazy a little bit every now and then but um i 'm just generally how much um yeah people are looking after the shorebirds um and i i do agree with nick on that one there 's been some really good surprises made move forward in the manning area in particular in the last few years and and it 's we 're great with that community uh so we have a couple of questions here now first one being do shorebirds go far from the nest feed yeah i i wouldn 't know how far but they definitely do they always um they they usually leave one one on the nest while the other one that if there 's like they like harrington at the moment so much i think it 's just that they can go in and get a white bait and come back to the egg and have to go too far because they only want a little fish to feed to the young um they don 't want to go too far because what what what tends to happen is that the if it 's a big colony of little turns and a seagull comes um they can defend they can defend the seagull quite effectively one could take i 've seen one little turn like defend like 15 seagulls have come along and it has just um zoomed around and got rid of them all but the more powerful they are in one area the more protective they are against gullible turns and seagulls so they don 't go too far from what i can tell but um that 's one of the important things about keeping these areas as people free as possible because um they want to be over their eggs and they want to be close to the guard will turn that swooping in can can have a look so um i don 't think it 's not it 's not from what i can tell it 's not very far and they are the eggs are protected fairly constantly another question uh sort of in relation to this mislake as well but um somebody 's saying that uh little turns used to be found in foster 20 years ago i 'm not aware of them being found down there but what about you nick i wouldn 't be surprised i wouldn 't be surprised like i don 't know but i i would i would say yeah traditions for good this is a good area for little turns and such a popular area i can 't believe it 's just been in these two sites and i reckon um they 've been coming here for generations and 20 years ago foster may have had something they liked and they would have capitalized um sort of more directed to you um because it so the question says it sounds like midcoast council with collaborators are quite active what about in places like fort stephens newcastle and lake macquarie council yes so um birdlife 's been working with hunter local land services uh recently to develop um these site action plans for migratory shorebirds the uh ports yeah for those three areas and one of my conservation lands as well so uh yes it 's been um not so much lake macquarie council uh we haven 't been engaged there but that doesn 't mean we won 't be in the future so um we are we 've been collaborating with local land managers and stakeholders and community groups to really uh focus on coming up with a list of actions that are specific to those particular sites to help manage migratory shorebirds so that we can improve habitat and expand the habitat that 's already there for those species because all of those sites are really important for migratory shorebirds something that um and i 'll reiterate what you and nick have said too like it 's been wonderful working with such an engaged community everybody here is um quite mindful of shorebirds and really wanting to little bit about foxes and predating on the eggs but the question 's been asked do you know if dingo is also eat the eggs also with the eggs well i would i i would say there 's a difference in the behavior so i would say what a fox would do is if a fox gets into an area where there 's eggs or bandicoots or whatever the animal is it would go and kill the lot it will take the lot out it won 't necessarily eat a lot but it will take a lot and what it will do is it will catch that means berry out the berry in the egg or berry in whatever it 's eating into another area because i believe i don 't know if this is true but i believe it 's always preparing for that winter that snowy winter the northern hemisphere winter that never comes to australia so i think it 's in its nature might be wrong there but i think it 's it 's always in its nature to kill everything and case everything um ajingo on an an egg um that i know of but if it did i don 't think it would do it 's the fox 's behavior of taking like it did in 2001 is all of them i can 't see that happening like a i can 't even see a cat doing that and cats aren 't much i 'd say that 's the main difference is that that 's why foxes and fox control is is pivotal to the success because one is a massive problem and um while we do get dingos in the area i 've yeah i haven 't seen them take an egg i do see their tracks in the morning but i don 't see them i haven 't seen it happen um but in saying that you know to tell the difference between dingo and domestic dogs is that there 's usually a human footprint close by um and that 's why you go oh yeah it 's probably someone 's pet that 's fun and it 's usually just squash the egg or something but um yeah that 's why the difference the lot um while the dog bingo wouldn 't okay awesome thank you so much um first of all i 'd just like to say thank you to you both for giving up an evening and presenting for us i would like to thank everybody for participating we had a really good crowd tonight and and thank you so much um a big thank you to hunter local land services who helped us put on these events um tonight 's event was part of our marine encatchment discovery series and it 's a regular program that we run the next event that we have is actually in two weeks time and that will be on our saving our species the many river turtle really interesting uh topic obviously very very topical to this area it 's an amazing species that is only found here and we 're we 're doing a lot of work to try and protect it so if you 're interested in attending that if you haven 't already signed up you can do so through the midcoast website um and then you 'll just get a you so much everybody for attending uh and we hope to see you next time _"

catchment and marine discovery series so this is a series that we one run quite regularly we invite a lot of our local scientists um to come and talk about the great work that they 're doing both in our region and in other areas that apply to this region so we have a great talk to for you tonight um i 'd like to thank hunter local land services for their partnership in this project and also the department of planning industry and environment who have doing great work with the manning river turtle so we 're going to talk about a few different things tonight we have representatives not only from dpie but also the men in conservation group sorry meeting total conservation group and also mid coast council and i would like to welcome them all this evening so first of all our first speaker is going to be andrew steed andrew is of planning industry and environment andrew is also widely known as steedy and works on our saving our species program as a species coordinator for the endangered manning river turtle steedy grew up with a pet freshwater turtle mortis the tortoise in sydney where he enjoyed feeding its snails and came to love their quiet charm city has been working with threatened species for 25 years and has never lost his passion for the natural world of which the manning river turtle is a particular favorite so i 'll pass it over to andrew for his presentation this evening yeah thanks erin i 'll um just start my presentation now and we see how we 'll go right thanks erin for the opportunity to present from information on the manning river turtle conservation program i will start with some general background information on the manning river turtle and then move on to the results of the surveys that we 've done so far i 'll then take a short break and the manning river turtle conservation group will tell their story before i would like to resume and provide a manning river turtle okay there are around 40 species of freshwater turtle according to the most recent book on freshwater turtles of australia that 's the image in the top right and there are two distinct groups based on the length of the neck either long-necked or short-necked eight fresh water turtles occur in new south wales including one feral the red-eared slider turtle which is mainly confined to sydney and we think it 's got into waterways because people have released pets that they didn 't want the other seven freshwater turtles are two long neck turtles and five short neck turtles four of these are in the genus my achilles and three of these are endangered all occurring in northern new south wales one on the one on the new england tableland and the other two in the bellinger and manning valleys the name my achilles comes from a combination of an aboriginal word miuna meaning clear water and a greek word chili 's meaning turtle the manning river turtle is named after a noted herpetologist from north sydney mr malcolm purvis there are three different types of long-necked turtle which is the one that you often see crossing roads and in farm dams they wander widely across the landscape sometimes without rhyme or reason their long necks can be fully retracted into the shell making it hard for predators to kill them the other two are both short neck turtles that do not leave rivers other than to nest they can 't fully retract their heads making them vulnerable to predation one is the native but introduced murray river turtle that inhabits inland rivers it has a pale cream stripe on its head and a very pale underside which is also known as the plastron the other one is the manning river turtle the one i 'm going to talk about today with bold gold markings which is more prominent on young males and with a very darkly orange gold mottled pattern on their underside the manning river turtle is often regarded as one of the most beautiful freshwater australian turtles making it highly sought after by turtle collectors and subject to illegal collection especially from readily accessible locations in the manning valley it tends to rest think it likes the colder water of the upper catchment it 's thought to come out to feed on fruits bugs and vegetation in shallow areas at night and around dusk and dawn it 's rarely seen as it often hides in the day having the amazing ability to be breathe through its bum this also allows it to stay underwater for very long periods of winter when cold water slows its metabolism down they 've recently been seen mating underwater in autumn and it is believed that they nest after the first good rains in late spring early summer they nest on sandy gravel beds close to water and we think it 's after good grains like happens in the other markerly species it is thought they may live between 30 to 40 years but this is yet to be confirmed and it will take quite a long study to work out exactly how long they can live the manning river turtle was listed endangered in new south wales in april 2017 and has been nominated as endangered nationally it was listed as endangered because turtle experts have noticed fragmented there was a very poor understanding of where it lives with few surveys in the remote upper catchments particularly in the northwest up there and in the west along the barnard river these areas have very few tracks are very rugged and have long sections of inaccessible rivers other than through walking threats include habitat degradation illegal collection predation and disease like the one that devastated its sister species the bellinger river turtle it is also vulnerable to competition and interbreeding with the introduced murray river turtle which is known to have adversely affected the bellinger river turtle by creating hybrids following its listing as endangered it was placed in the data deficient stream of the saving our species program this allowed us to attract funding for baseline surveys to determine where it lives in the manning valley we organised three ecologists to survey different parts of the manning valley using different techniques depending on river conditions where water clarity is poor nets were used there are two types of nests cathedral nests shown at the top are used in deeper pools and are long cylinders that stand up in through the bottom of the net where there are gaps in the netting and they go up through the various chambers to try and get the bait in the very top chamber fight nets shown on the top right are long tunnels with the tops out of the water and are used in shadow water they have two wings at the front to funnel animals into the net where water clarity is good snorkelers will enter the water and catch turtles by hand each turtle is caught each after each turtle is caught it is measured weighed inspected to determine its sex and saw any signs of disease and deformities the shells are also permanently marked without hurting them as shown in that photo on the bottom right this gives us information about movement and growth rates and eventually the size of the population they are then released back into the river where they were captured as well as turtles the nets capture a wide variety of other animals including platypus eels fish crayfish and even a goanna which would have been a challenge to get out of the the new south wales bionet a publicly accessible database of plant and animal sightings they 've also caught bull routes also known as freshwater stonefish and they have a series of poisonous spines around the body that cause excruciating pain if you get jabbed and i 've been with someone who 's been jabbed and i 've never seen anyone in so much pain one net on the mid manning caught eight of these bull routes requiring a very delicate operation to extract them without getting stung we have been lucky to work with such an enthusiastic and supportive community as the people of the marine valley over 115 landowners have allowed us to access rivers and creeks to do turtle surveys these range from large pastoral stations such as glen rock station out to here in the western part of the catchment um and the cupola carrier station up in the northwest through to small farms traveling stock reserves and small council reserves we can also do surveys where rivers are in state forests and national parks this has given us access to about 500 kilometres of riverfront which river turtle habitat not all parts of the rivers are suitable for surveys some parts are too shallow other paths too fast flowing sometimes high turbidity means that we can 't go snorkeling and sometimes there 's just an inability to get down to the water because of cliffs or thick impenetrable vegetation but honestly it 's been a real honour to work and celebrate the manning community and tell them all about the manning river turtle this is a time series of the known locations of manning river turtles which also shows the number of turtles caught at each site basically the warmer the color the higher the number of turtles we 've caught at a location the first surveys were back in 1973 with three sites they 're the purple crosses and then one in 1979 and two more in 1986. it was there nearly 30 years before any more surveys were done in 2013 the number of known sites was increased to nine locations in 2015 it increased to 11 locations and in 2017 there were just 13 known locations the manning river turtle was then listed the saving our species program in 2018 there were 31 known locations and in 2019 it jumped to 70 with another four added this year after surveys of fire affected locations around bourbon in this area to the north of wingham most of the sites remaining river turtles have been caught are in the upper catchments with the western flowing barnard river along this stretch out this way being a stronghold many river turtles were detected in the south of the manning valley down near gloucester in this part of the catchment in for the first time in 2019 and more effort will be made to survey other sites in this part of the valley from all the surveys court done so far nearly 400 manning turtles have been caught and most of them have been marked so far only 11 marked turtles have been re-caught with only one not caught at the place where it was originally marked this turtle had moved about three and a half kilometers upstream surveys have been done at over 140 sites with manning river turtles recorded at 84 or about 60 percent of over 42 kilometers of snorkeling have been done since 2018 the photo at the top shows what i regard as being prime manning river turtle habitat with a deep hole on the far bank logs the hide under and a stony shallow area for feeding this shallow area probably grades to a sandy gravel beach that are the sort of areas where they like to nest the bottom photo shows what i think is the cutest manning river turtle caught yet this graph shows the number of manning river turtles caught by their size and sex and tells us a bit about the structure of the population the yellow represents females the green the males and the blue young turtles whose sex couldn 't be determined you tell the sex of manning river turtles by the length of their tail with males having much longer tails tail length starts to change when the turtles are about 10 to 12 centimetres long and we think that 's somewhere between 5 and 10 years old females grow larger than males with the largest female we called at 23 centimeters and the largest was just seven centimeters corresponding in this in weight the heaviest turtle we caught was 1.64 kilos and the lightest was only 40 grams females represent about 60 of turtles possibly this is because they 're hungry and they go into the nets for the bait but it does indicate that there is a good healthy breeding cohort of females in the population and encouragedly there is a good range of sizes this means that there is predation is probably not decimating the populations like other turtles and the breeding is successful in many parts of the manning valley okay this is the end of the first session and i 'd like to hand over to the wonderful manning river turtle conservation group who 've done so much in the local community to raise awareness about the manning river turtle and its precarious existence without their links to many members of the manning valley community we wouldn 't have been able to do surveys at so many different locations in the last three years and these are photos of some of the locations that we 've done surveys at and surveys have said in some locations they 've never seen better aquatic habitat anywhere in new south wales so it 's quite a privilege to have such wonderful habitat in the manning valley and i will now pass over to the manning river turtle conservation group thanks andrew so um just before the turtle group we 're gonna have a great presentation from them as well um but we might just do some questions for andrew just on that first section of the um presentation so you can just use that q a function that 's down the bottom there as i mentioned and that will allow us to to read those questions um just while we 're waiting for people to ask some questions though andrew i guess i have a question um straight off the bat you mentioned that um you did some extra survey work um in areas that were burnt in last year 's bushfires um you did manage to find some turtles there how do you feel that the drought and the bushfires affected the turtle population was there any evidence of that um not we caught last year so it managed to get through a year of the last year of that drought when uh the creek it was in bourbon creek just became a series of disconnected pools and that part of bourbon creek was really heavily impacted by the fires so i think it 's a case of where the turtles were lucky enough to be in a pool that remained permanent the whole time they probably just lost some body condition and hunkered down and just waited it out then you 've got to remember these turtles have been around for 50 million years in that 50 million years we 've gone through a number of um ice ages and during ice ages the all the water 's basically locked up in ice caps and the climate becomes much more arid so i think that the manning river turtle probably has a lot of experience in dealing with climatic extremes but what i think it 's is its challenges is rapidly changing climate change like we 're undergoing at the moment and also the um the impacts of human settlement uh last 250 years um awesome just on uh sort of a bit of an extension to that alex has just asked how do turtles survive drought conditions and how much water do they need they need water to basically they need it for hydration they 're not able to survive for long periods out of water because they can 't perspire so they basically cook in their own our own juices if they 're not able to cool themselves down it 's not a very pleasant death and we really don 't understand a lot of the physiology of turtles um many river tours in particular are very difficult to study because we know so little about them we 're just getting into the stage where we are really looking to set up a more detailed research program hopefully with the university of newcastle to engage a phd student to do a much longer term study of ecology doing radio tracking diet studies and looking at their mating behavior their nesting behavior so there 's a lot more that we can do and there are still still a lot more an extension of that one too that answer there uh jamaica has asked how long does the many river turtle live for and does it have gills no it doesn 't have gills um it has a very similar structure to gill in its cloaca which is it 's re event that um it poos through and um urinates and also lays eggs so it 's a very similar structure it 's not technically a gill we don 't know how long they live that 's part of the marking so we can see how much a turtle grows in a year in good seasons when there 's plenty of food it will grow relatively quickly in those drought years when there 's a short supply of food it probably slows down its metabolism and doesn 't put on much weight the general thinking is 30 to 40 years different species probably live different times i just saw a video today of its sister turtle up on the tablelands and this female was 30 centimeters big and the ecologist who caught her estimated she could be 60 or more years basically but once we start doing these sort of studies we 'll start to get a better idea but at least a minimum i would say of 20 to 30 years okay awesome um andrew has asked was there any correlation between the numbers of turtles found and their relative proximity to the river riffle zones considering their clicker respiration and oxygen levels in the water i haven 't even thought about that um because we 've uh i 'd have to go back and actually look at the exact location of every turtle court and look at the river conditions in proximity to it um i would say yes there would be a correlation because they 're the areas where they 're going to come out and feed on the the invariable lava that typically inhabit the bottom of rocks and stones in those shallower areas where you get more sunlight so you get more photosynthesis of aquatic plants increase dissolves oxygen so i think that they 're probably a correlation between those areas where there 's steep pool near a riffle zone um but having said that it 's so much water movement okay excellent thank you so much um so there is some other questions here but some of it is on topics that we will cover later on so i 'll come back to those questions when we get to our other topics um so for now what we will do is we will hand over to the mening turtle conservation group and the conservation group is a small group of committed and passionate individuals from the mening valley who are dedicated to helping protect the endangered mening river helmeted turtle this group does a great job and we 're really happy to have them come and present to us tonight and tonight we have three members from the group carrie guppy bronwyn ellis and claire rook joining us so i 'm going to pass it over to kerry take it away thanks erin thank you very much for that uh introduction and thank you so much for midcoast council for inviting us to speak today we 'd also like to have uh pass on that thanks to stevie as well from dpie who 's been well so what we thought we would talk about tonight is about our group and how we formed the work that we have been doing and then what we see coming for the future as well so um the manning river turtle conservation group formed in early 2017 as a group of like-minded individuals who had taken an interest in the manning river turtle and we all heard about the turtle in different ways some of us heard peter scouten talking on the abc he did a podcast series um and others had heard from other from other avenues but we decided that we wanted to do something about manning river turtle and our first aim was to get their queer their community aware that the turtle even existed and that it was threatened though um when we first did start up it hadn 't officially been listed as endangered um which didn 't happen until april 2017 so as part of the wing and activation plan we ran the very first winter solstice walk in um june 2017 and you can see on the slideshow there we had a who came along and this was a free event for families we also did a colouring competition with the local schools in wingham and preschools and this promoted heaps of discussion um about the turtle in classrooms so from the success of this we actually then officially formed as a group under the auspice of the manning valley neighborhood service and we worked very closely with the wingham chamber of commerce as well to run our lantern walk on an annual basis we also set up a facebook page and began to be an advocacy group for the turtle with the survey showing that there were depleting numbers and stories like the bellingen river turtle population that had suffered from a virus the idea was established for a captive insurance population through aussie arc which is based at the australian reptile park you can see there on the screen the really cute little hatchling and i 'll just explain how that how we got to that point so the idea is that the turtles could be bred at this facility and then released into the wild when they 're old particularly important if there were effects such as severe conditions and we did have the drought and the bushfires or a virus like they 'd had in the belligerent river that we would still have a breeding population so the manning river turtle conservation group assisted tim forkman and dan ramsey by contacting business in businesses in the local area to partner with aussie arc or donate to the fundraising and we had a huge response from the businesses and the community which was meant that we were successful in raising a hundred and ten thousand dollars to build the enclosure and that 's now up and running and really exciting that there 's actually 20 hatchlings in there with seven adult turtles under their care so i 'm going to hand over now to bronwyn who 's going to run through a few more of the activities that we 've been up to thanks kerry for that a significant event was organized by the department of primary in uh planning industry and environment in june last year where wingham hosted a two-day workshop to convene turtle experts researchers land ensure the turtle 's survival from this a steering committee was formed which includes representatives from uh mid north mid coast council the department of planning industry and environment local land services and landcare tied with their indigenous ranges and of course our group the aim of the committee is to try and keep progressing with plans we made at the workshop as well as share information apply for grants and assist researchers and surveys and keep the community engaged from creating awareness of the turtle we moved into education we have held stalls at markets like envirofertari and killer bark as well as speaking at schools preschools and scouts tim faulkner has spoken at schools in manningnet and we continue to support the work of oziaca doing for collecting turtles for their breeding population we have also engaged with local media in print radio and tv to give updates on the turtle then this year um a manning river turtle was actually seen laying eggs by a very informed and engaged land holder and she was able to assist um aussie arc to retrieve the eggs she secured the predated by foxes and then aussie arc were able to come in and remove the eggs successfully before predicted flooding occurred so we 'd like to thank that land owner and acknowledge the great work she did um in being so observant and rescuing helping to rescue those eggs these were incubated at the reptile park and were released and will be released when suitable and now over to claire so from here we 're thinking we 've got more work to do so we would like to keep liaising with other groups who are doing awesome work for turtles in other areas like the belles turtle and the bellinger river turtle so we can learn from their successes we 'd like to increase citizen science opportunities especially for land holders because they have access to the river frontage where there are turtles and they can assist with monitoring the water quality the riparian vegetation and the health of the rivers and also protect with the breeding sites if if they see where they are we 'd like to assist these land holders with more knowledge and hopefully more funding habitat we 'd like to assist where we can with um fox control and but we are very mindful of the role of the dingo in relation to fox numbers we would like to continue to be advocates for the turtle and be a local support for government agencies university researchers not-for-profits like aussie arc we really want to keep the community engaged with science and the arts and we are really lucky to have artists such as um gemma cross you can see up on the screen made that beautiful felt turtle um peter scouten who 's a natural history illustrator um and jill watkins who made many river turtles on stilts so we really want to keep going with events and education and fundraising and this is where we 're calling on more community members to help what we 're also really mindful of is the fact that by protecting the turtle habitat in our area we can assist other threatened species in our area like um the platypus and the spiny crayfish but we can also protect the riparian flora for biodiversity and for corridors and for protecting the turtle will have a flow on effect for other special animals in our area so to find out more about what you can do you can go to these places our website is on the screen www.manygroverturtle.org we 've got a facebook page with this new logo which i 'm not sure if you can see on the screen but you 'll be there you can email us at any time on hello at manningriverturtle.org and we can even if it 's a question that 's not for us we can forward it on for you to researchers or other agencies who we think can help you if you see a turtle or you think you 've got a turtle or if you have um river frontage where you think there are turtles and you 'd like to provide access for surveyors please email andrew on the um email on your screen andrew.steed at dot environment.nsw.edu u um keep your eye out for turtles use turtle sat which is an app for recording turtle sightings and look for updates on the cute little hatchlings on the aussie arc another event which is coming up in september for threatened species month um it 's going to be promoted soon and it 's part of the threatened species trail through dpie and we thank dpie for assisting us with this so stay tuned on our webpage and facebook site for more information about this because it 's going to be limited numbers only we welcome your assistants with ideas and help with events always so please feel free to contact us on the email on the screen thank you so much claire carey bronwyn that was a fantastic presentation we know you guys are doing fantastic work and we definitely want people to get involved um from this point though we 're going to start taking some q a questions so if you 've got a question just use that q a function down the bottom and we 'll jump straight into some questions thanks claire thanks aaron so are there any plans to expand the captive management project further and involve other zoological institutes in the program yeah that 's i guess that 's up to tim faulkner and 's mostly um they 're aiming for 12 adult turtles and they 've already got the 20 hatchlings i think that might be their um capacity at the moment they are expanding into other turtles other freshwater turtles like the hunter turtle i think they 're trying to expand their assistance but i think yeah that 's that question is best directed at um aussie arc i think yeah no fairness and andrew yeah yeah not a problem at all andrew did you want to chime in at all did you have an answer for that one nor are you at this stage we don 't have any other plans um the other two organizations that do captive breeding for turtles are taronga park and the symbio wildlife park at helensburg and they both pretty much have their hands full with the bellinger river turtle so we 've um we 've sort of really tried to really just focus in on aussie arc because they have a lot of experience with turtles and down the track there may be opportunities but at this stage capacity is pretty much full across management so we 've got to be fairly careful about how many people are breeding many river turtles where they come from where they go back to so there 's a whole lot of management issues we need to be aware of and um just be cognizant of um there are risks associated with captive breeding and not just launch into it um willy-nilly excellent thank you um did anybody else have any other questions just uh type it into the q a down the bottom there um okay we have another question are the 10 hatchlings in the wild going to be returned uh yes they will go back to the nest site of the turtle that was found so that is actually quite an important consideration when we 're releasing hatchling turtles excellent thank you that looks like that 's all the questions for that section so um if we don 't have anything to add we 'll move back across to andrew and he can finish his presentation right i would now like to talk about some of the threats and issues that have risen from the little insights that we 've come across in the last couple of years okay manning river turtles are very vulnerable to predation because they cannot fully retract their head into their shell so they could basically have their heads bitten off by predators such as foxes cats pigs and possibly even goannas and quolls they are especially vulnerable when the females are laying eggs and the predators can smell them and get two courses at the same time both the eggs and the turtle the sister species bell 's turtle which occurs on the new england tableland has suffered greatly from predation there is there are very few young turtles in the populations and fox predation of nests is estimated to be greater than 95 unless this is decreased it is inevitable the species will eventually go extinct once all the adults die of old age or fox predation foxes are also eating turtle nesting turtles with the top photo showing six dead female bells turtles around a fox den on the new england tablelands this um video shows a fox raiding three nests in one night so you can the eggs goes finds another nest does the same thing and finally it moves on to the third nest a similar story also exists for the endemic population of the murray river turtle in the murray darling basin where nespredation is greater than 93 the lower amount of clearing in the marine valley compared to inland new south wales may be one reason for less fox predation because they don 't tend to go into densely vegetated areas but prefer the open pastoral or agricultural country another serious threat is from the murray river turtle it is introduced in the manning valley most likely being dumped as unwanted pets and put in the river to be kind to the turtle but not very kind to the manning river turtle they 're typically sold in pet shops but they are only endemic to the inland rivers of the murray darling basin murray river turtles are much larger than the manning river turtle the largest we 've caught was over 28 centimetres compared to 23 for the largest manning river turtle this means they can out compete the manning river turtle for manning river turtles diluting their genes and causing turtles with mixed features of both this is known to have happened to the sister species the bellinger river turtle the number of locations and murray of murray river turtles has increased over the year with 15 caught in one location in 2015 uh 13 that yellow dot at um that 's kundle flat and another four turtles caught in 2005 then when we started doing our surveys in 2018 we picked them up at six locations with ten turtles at cundill flat here rocky crossing down on the barrington river number one up on the now and dock kim brakai or kim bricky and carrick flatt which are very close together here in the mid manning river then last year in 2019 we caught 54 murray river turtles including turtles at dewitt on the little manning river and tibic on the little manning river and mccaffrey 's flat and a staggering 34 murray river turtles at the candle flat site so they are both increasing in numbers and moving up the rivers and have the capacity to move as much as their uh distribution so the fires of 2019-20 that roared through the north of the manning valley destroyed homes the bourbon school and infrastructure like power phone fences machinery and sheds it also roasted fire sensitive vegetation along rivers that shade rivers and creeks and contain fruiting trees like figs and lily police that provide important food for manning river turtles one quarter of the riparian vegetation in the manning river turtle habitat was burnt with much of it being killed due to its fire sensitivity it also caused huge amounts of leaf all into pool that rots down and decreases water quality it also caused trees to fall into creeks and while this can provide turtle shelter for turtles it makes this difficult for us to do snorkeling surveys as it is impossible to get around them the loss of ground cover vegetation and soil structure in the upper layers of the soil layer from the intense heat of the fire mobilises the soil and ash the next time it rained after rain it is then deposited as silt and ash in the pools where the turtles rest and of the surveys that we did this year in the creeks north of wingham they were taken in march 2020 about four to five months after the fires you can see that some river riparian vegetation is not resprouted meaning less shade so water temperatures increase this is not good for manning river turtles as it appears they prefer the cooler water of the upper catchment and rivers it also means less food as the fruit of lilly police and figs is important for turtles in response to the fire fires the hunter local land services organized for an ecologist to do surveys in the fire affected creeks north of winger he surveyed 17 sites and caught 19 manning river turtles including new locations at kipp axes up here in the head of dingo creek and the capra to the west of bouban encouragingly he re-caught a previously caught manning river turtle at the same location he quoted 2019 here at bourbon creek so it survived both the fires and the extended drought which i 'll talk about next every resident in the manning valley was impacted by the extended when all the rivers stopped flowing and they had tr had to truck water in for the people of gloucester no one trucked in water for the turtles however the barnard river one of the strongholds for the manning river turtle first stopped flowing around march 2019 and while there were occasional flash floods system flows never recovered until the rains of january february 2020 the graph on the left shows the percent of average animal discharge of for the main rivers of the manning valley the average annual is that red dotted line it shows the most recent drought where the rivers stop flowing entirely that circle on on the screen it also show it shows how they steadily dropped without any respite unlike the previous drought from 2000 to 2017 when there was a respite in the middle it also shows a trend with the droughts getting longer compared to previous ones in the last century so we 're getting an increased severity and an increased length of droughts in the manning valley and the photo on the there shows the barnard river completely dry when surveys were barnard river and the fires ranging all around the landscape meant that we were not allowed in to the upper banner because of the risk of getting trapped in there and fires coming out so it wasn 't until january 2020 that we got permission from national parks to go in and they organized for saving our species staff and the crew from aussie arc to go into carrick bundy national park to do food drops for brushtailed rock wallabies and to inspect manning river turtle habitat after a two and a half hour rough four-wheel drive in what we found was not good we found dead and emaciated brushed out rock bobbies dead and dying vegetation along the river and on hillsides long stretches of very dry riverbeds separated by shallow mud wallows and dead turtles where pools would become completely dry luckily the ranger told us about a deep permanent pool nearby and it was still holding a good amount of water so we decided that it was time to intervene and the aussie art crew jumped into the mud wallows and expertly wrangled 22 manning river turtles faulkner passing a turtle to a field officer in the photos there they also collected three turtles for their insurance population with the female that they collected laying 22 eggs in february this year and 11 successful hatchlings emerged in march this year it is planned to release young turtles in november this year at the place where their mother was caught on the barnard river in the rain of the late afternoon of february uh sorry friday the 17th of january this year a smitten freshwater turtle lover who lives at carrick flat on the mid manning found a female mani a river turtle laying eggs into a nest dug into the riverbank this is the first ever discovery of a manning river turtle nest and was about 20 centimetres deep and very close to the river in the sandy gravel beach area she waited for it to stop finished laying and then protected the nest with some netting to stop foxes digging up the eggs and eating them because the nest was vulnerable to predation in danger of being trampled by cattle who walked to the river to water levels returned to normal it was decided to move the eggs to the australian reptile park where they would be incubated and hatched and on march march the 5th all 10 eggs successfully hatched and they 'll be grown until they are able to fend for themselves in the wild and they will also be released the place where the eggs were collected this is a grainy video in because of the rain and low light of the nesting turtle at carrick flat and thanks goes to alex granger for providing the video so that was a spectacular find and we 're hoping to find more manning river turtles nest in the coming uh years following that rain we then um and following the devastating drought and ferocious fires the next natural disaster the manning valley was floods in relatively quick succession there was a big flood rapidly followed by a couple of smaller floods while replenishment of the parched rivers was welcome the flood sent down a wall of dirty water laden with years of collected fall and debris it 's sweeping away all in its path rivers and ash from fire grounds where all the understory and ground cover vegetation had been completely incinerated this was deposited on riverbeds and banks as the waters receded leaving sticky muddy banks and silty riverbeds that turn to opaque cloudy water when disturbed surveys in march 2020 in the relatively undisturbed rollies river where 16 manning river turtles were caught in march last year found none the bottom of the river was thick with fine silt that clouded the water when snorkeling through looking for turtles at the same time along the barnard river surveys only found manning river turtles resting in a small area of cobblestones on the bottom of the river and none where there were silt deposits as mentioned aussie arc have established an insurance population for the manning river turtle following the collection of the three turtles from a drought-ravaged barnard river in january this year in mid-march further surveys were undertaken to collect more turtles from several different locations one male was collected from each of four different locations the barnard river at corroboree flat where we have caught a good number of turtles over the manning and little little manning and barnard river a farm at kobach on the barrington river and from a private conservation area on uh kippax 's at on dingo creek a total of 12 adult manning river turtles will be collected with a survey planned in november this year to collect five adult females some of whom we are hoping may also be bearing eggs like the one from carica bundy national park the captive breeding program is being overseen by dr ricky spencer from the university of western sydney a well-known turtle ecologist so where to from here together with saving our species program and the mid coast council the hunted local land service has applied for an application for funding under the federal wildlife and habitat bushfire recovery program the application is for just shy of a quarter of a million dollars and has three main objectives to help recover manning river turtle habitat after the fires firstly there will be riparian vegetation restoration and rehabilitation including weeding and planting they 'll be fencing off of peri and vegetation to protect manning river turtle habitat and improve in the upper catchments where foxes and pigs are more prevalent we also are planning ongoing surveys and monitoring determined population size and structure revisiting some sites we 've been to before as part of a monitoring program as well as new sites not previously surveyed before we 're always looking for new places to survey so tell your friends relatives neighbours and anyone else you know with river frontage and ask them to get in contact with either me or the manning river turtle conservation group and thank you for your interest in the manning river turtle i can be contacted by email or phone as shown in the bottom of this slide and i will now answer uh questions that you may have thanks and keep keep up your enthusiasm for the manning with a turtle excellent thank you so much andrew that was a great presentation we really appreciate you being with us here this evening and uh we hope to look forward to learning more and hearing more about the meeting river turtle going forward yeah and if anyone has any questions they are more than manning river turtle and we 'll talk uh in my sleep about it thanks very much thank you so one of the things that we really recognize at midcoast council is just how important our waterways are and how important it is that we manage those waterways so we actually got a question asked just previously um about what we 're doing what what tools we 're using and what management techniques we 're using to protect our waterways and a really big part of that is the new catchment management plan that we 're writing for the many so i 'm actually going to invite louise duff who is our catchment coordinator to talk a little bit about that project and how it 's working and how you can get involved with the catchment management plan so over to you louis hi everyone thanks erin so i 'm louise duff the catchment coordinator with midcoast council i 'm in the natural systems team and i 'm leading development of a catchment management plan for the manning river particularly with the focus on the estuary as well and it is the system in terms of timeline that plan will be coming out next year so at the moment we 're in a phase where we 're doing issue analysis and we 're looking at a range of issues including fauna conservation which obviously this topic is really highly relevant to we 're also looking at riparian vegetation and maintaining and improving the riparian vegetation there 's quite a lot of issues all in all for the whole catchment things like acid sulfate soil water flow rates and quantity and also quality so we 're looking at diffuse source agriculture as part of that so yeah i would welcome anyone who would like to be consulted as part of development of that plan perhaps you could just put your name and email address in the chat and i 'll take a note of that and be in touch we will also be consulting of course with all the environmental groups and stakeholder agencies so um the turtle conservation group of course um platypus network and so on uh and that phase of consultation is sort of coming up between now and the work that the turtle group is doing it 's really exciting approach a real whole of community i love the arts work that you do and i 'm really looking looking forward to working with your group and making sure that your initiatives are built into that catchment plan um and that you know we can support your activities thanks louise that that was a really interesting information the catchment management plan is such an important project and we 're really happy to hear about it um if anybody is interested and would like to get involved please don 't hesitate to contact council another great project that we work on uh when it comes to our water quality in in the area is our annual catchment and waterways report card so you may have seen it around before we 've been doing it for about 10 years it 's a great project so the the report card is an annual project that we undertake with the department of planning industry and environment and the scientists from dpie come for about six months every year and they do testing they assign each of the waterways a score based on their water quality at the time of testing and we use that to produce a report card you can have a look at our website you can have a look by catchment if you 're on our website but if you want to have a look at everything um this is our report card down here and you can see um that we assign that that score it 's between a and f so much like a school report card a means good f means not so good um these are our scores from last year from 2019 and you can see that it 's throughout our catchments and it 's actually the material that we get from this the results that we get from this project are what we then use to help plan out our management actions throughout the year to try and improve the water quality or keep it going where we get good scores so the 2020 results will be out in about october or november keep an eye out um i think they 're going 've had extensive drought um bushfire events and flooding during that period as well um so there 'll be some more information coming out about that uh closer to the release date in october i just want to take this opportunity to say thank you so much to andrew claire bronwyn kerry and louise for presenting this evening it was so great to have you all along um to talk about all this amazing work that is happening throughout our catchments uh particularly here in the manning and what is being done to protect this amazing species it doesn 't exist anywhere else so we really need to do our best to preserve it and thank you so much for all of your hard work and for presenting this evening i also want to just take this opportunity to say thank you to all of you who attended uh we 've run this series over the last six weeks with several different presentations and we 've had a great turnout for all of them and honestly we couldn 't do this without you giving up your evening and coming along along and i 'd also like to thank hunter local land services without them we couldn 't put on this series uh this really is a partnership project and we really appreciate all of their help we will be doing a few more of these starting in august september so keep an eye out on your email and there will be another series of catchment and marine discovery events coming soon thank you all again for attending and we hope to see you in the future _"

    "text": "[Music] in 2020 eight neighbouring farms came together to protect more than 270 hectares of wetlands and restore the health of the branch river one of the key tributaries of the kuruwa river funding and support for this project was provided by hunter local land services through the marine estate management strategy landcare australia midcoast council as well as the farmers themselves this is the karua river it starts up in the barrington tops in the gondwana world heritage area and it flows down to port stephens it 's a river we all love we love swimming in it we love fishing in it we go boating we grow oysters we really need to keep this river clean agriculture is just one of many pressures on the river a lot of the catchment is farmed so we really need to work with the farmers to help improve water quality this project the crew catchment management grants project is a great example of what we can do if we all work together if a group of stakeholders or combine our resources we can create bigger projects and solve bigger problems than the branch river research has shown us that the branch river is a hot spot for pollution flowing into the karua so it 's great to see the farmers working together here to tackle nutrients and sediment it 's absolutely marvelous to see eight land holders landcare australia midcoast council and hunter local land services coming together to preserve the environment by working together this program 's benefits extend well beyond the farm gate linking habitat for wildlife right through the catchment this exciting program builds on the successes of the dernis borland landcare project which linked the mile lakes to the barrington tops world heritage area there 's a big issue here in the crew river the crew river is the culmination of everything that happens on the land finds its way into the river the karua river and the branch river are notoriously the most polluted areas these eight farmers have about 20 kilometers of river frontage and riparian dropping into the river and we 're trying to fence off these areas keep the cattle out of them and fence off the dams so that we can keep rivers this project has worked at minimising erosion sediments running into waterways and also nutrients not just in chemicals and fertilizers but also animal effluent back into our waterways we 've been very fortunate here in this area on the branch that we 're able to meet up with a landcare group and after a presentation we ended up with eight landholders prepared to sign up and and do a project in this very area so under the project we have actually been able to fence out 270 hectares of uh wetland which is just a fantastic result um and it 's a credit to the land holders they 've stuck in it together the land hold also does a lot of the work and they also put in money themselves but the biggest issue for them is that they are donating essentially this land to the environment so brian on this farm has fenced off 60 hectares so that 's nearly uh that 's over 150 acres of land that he 's fenced off on his own property here wetlands are extremely important to our environment to our water to be able to secure 270 hectares of wetland in this region we 're trying to stop the cattle from coming into this area and we 're fencing it off and which will help the water quality down the river you can see the cattle are bogging up the wetlands so we will only be using this pasture for once a year maybe and for stock use when it 's dry we want to keep the cattle off this area so that the wetlands will regenerate itself and it 'll give better water quality down the river and that 's the main reason for doing this i 'm using this sort of fencing uh to keep my cattle from the wetlands calves and other smaller animals can 't get through i 'm allowing it to be off the ground because of the salt on the wetlands and also having it up like that smaller kangaroos and stuff like that can get underneath it 's great to see that every farmer has a choice of the type of fencing he wants to put on his property this dam is a natural see it 's stacked with reeds the reeds and the plants in this dam act to purify the water under this project these dams will be all fenced with electric fences to exclude the cattle so the cattle can 't get in and trample the reefs and this makes the whole system function a lot better the farmer gets a good return out of this project there 's something in it for him and there 's something in it for the wider public as well the wider public gets the environmental benefits protection of the wetlands reducing nutrients from the cattle going into the waterways the farmer gets support to manage his property more infrastructure going in to manage his cattle to help him look after his own property so there 's something in it for everyone a good chance to use these projects to show others in the catchment what can be done what they can take out of it and adapt on their own properties to protect the river and protect the wider catchment [Music] you _"

    "text": "[Music] conventional bread it doesn 't have living organisms in it you can have conventional bread that never goes off i know for a fact that there are some big big uh food industry big fast food outlets out there whose their food never goes off um starts with m and ends in mcdonald 's um and so what we 've done is we 've basically just stopped the natural cycle of life that needs to occur in our food in order for us to digest it so our food is now manufactured most of the breads that we consume are manufactured foods where we are using chemists to make our foods instead of cooks now what happens is manufactured food is it doesn 't have all the enzymes and the bacteria in it so when we introduce that into our stomach our stomach doesn 't know what to do with that because we simply do not have enzymes for these manufactured foods because we will be getting gluten straight into the stomach we 're not supposed to have gluten entering the stomach we are supposed to have gluten broken stomach can handle but the stomach doesn 't know what to do with just gluten and so when we have manufactured breads they pump isolated gluten into i did it like they use a needle they probably don 't inject it they pump into the bread the gluten and that 's why our bread is consistent it all looks the same it 's spongy it 's um tasteless it 's it 's that kind of it 's all the same consistency it 's fluffy it rises really well we 've got the same looking bread and all the breads in all the shelves um in all the supermarkets and then they make it sound a little bit healthier so maybe they 'll dye it brown and then it 's brown or maybe they 'll just add in some whole grains which again we can 't really digest um whole grains and i 'll explain that in a little bit uh so there 's all these things added to the bread really really hard to break it down so sourdough bread so that 's your conventional bread we 've got that of interaction there you go don 't strain a muscle um and now we have sourdough bread so sourdough bread technically it 's it 's sour because of the fact that there 's microorganisms the lactobacillus bacteria producing lactic acid which makes the sour flavor so the lactic acid that 's produced by the bacteria makes the sour flavor so that 's technically what sourdough is it 's using those microorganisms to make the bread now i 'm going to talk about homemade sourdough because again you can go and get bacon 's delight sourdough which is more a manufactured sourdough it 's not necessarily a digestible sourdough and that 's what we 've got to really be aware and learn ask questions and demand that we know what 's in our food because we 're not being told so sourdough basically all you need is sourdough is flour and preferably you want flour that 's organic so that the microorganisms can grow there 's no roundup sprayed on it so the microorganisms aren 't being killed you want to make sure that some of the flour has the fiber stone ground um you want to make sure you have filtered water okay this is a really important thing for sourdough because filtered water is void of chlorine and chlorine kills bacteria so we have filtered water and then we have salt and we use the salt to regulate the microorganisms because we don 't want them to just go crazy we want them to grow at the pace we want them to grow and then the magical ingredient as i 've touched on before which comes from growing your sourdough starter is the microorganisms the culture the beneficial yeast and so what happens is you make this it mix all these ingredients together you put them in the right environment you let them sit together for half a day a day depending on the temperature and what happens during that process is the microorganisms feed off the gluten feed off the sugar feed off the fiber and they release lactic acid as i said before and the lactic acid makes the environment nice and acidic which prevents pathogenic microorganisms from growing so the acidic lactic acid helps and preserve we don 't want so that 's a really important thing to understand so it becomes a kind of natural preservative the way we want it and then when the bacterias release the lactic acid then the specific types of yeast grow that like that acidic environment and then they break down all those things i was referring to before on behalf of us and they release gas so you 'll see bubbles start to grow so if you know like kombucha is fizzy because of the gas released by the microorganisms so what happens is you start with this little loaf of dough you start with this little dough and what happens is over time it doubles in size and that doubling in size is actually the wheat being digested and the microorganisms excreting what they are the the excretion that 's it let 's just put it there um so they double in size and so when you then bake it in the oven what happens as well is it then doubles in size again so you 've started with this tiny little bit of dough and you really sensible it 's a really intelligent connection to nature that we have and then what happens is when we eat it guess what i now have nutrients that are accessible for my enzymes there 's living microorganisms in the sourdough that can tell my body how to work and these micro organisms are essential for us we need lots of bugs around us we need lots of bugs growing inside of us and we need the diverse ones so as i said before the microorganisms break down the gluten into gluten and gliadinine which our body then knows what to do with the alternative is we don 't know what to do with gluten and that damages the lining of our gut and that is actually a big driver of autoimmune diseases and other issues that we 're seeing in chronic illness so this is pretty significant if you 're able to digest um the sourdough that you 're making and again some people just have different levels of sensitivities so if you really can 't digest any wheat or any gluten then that 's when you 'd want better than just conventional salad um conventional gluten-free bread as well okay so i hope that makes sense for you why i 'm teaching this workshop to you and why as a nutritionist i think it 's quite important we understand the relationship between the food we eat and how it impacts our body so when someone says to me i eat i eat bread that doesn 't tell me anything what brand of bread what are the ingredients where do you get it from because there 's a big difference between bread and bread yes yes okay so i 'm going to move on to making the starter and show you how to make a starter from scratch and if you have any questions about anything i just said please put that in the comments and i 'll get to that at the end but i hope you either learned something there or maybe just confirmed an inkling that you had or maybe you totally disagree and you want to take it up with me further which would be lovely as well okay so i 'm not one i this is my sourdough starter home this is my little sourdough mum as you can see she 's kind of filthy because she gets used a bit um this is a rye sourdough so i 'm using rye flour in here and it 's been active for about four years um so she 's very very active and how i know she is active is i can see bubbles on the top of her sets so i 'll just put the camera down so you can get an idea of and i don 't know how good your connection is but if you have a look in there can you see bubbles so you can see little bubbles in there and i can see little bubbles in there and and basically those bubbles have come out of nowhere i didn 't stir it i didn 't shake it up or anything just recently the bubbles have just come from the microorganisms so it 's a spontaneous fermentation and now what i can smell so if i smell the sourdough starter it smells acidic it smells like vinegar or dirty socks smells like cheese whatever it is that you associate it with but it smells sour it doesn 't smell off it 's a really important thing to understand there 's a difference between sour and off so you have to use your nose now the really important thing as well is there 's nothing weird growing on it so that means i 've got a really good acidic environment so this is my sourdough starter i basically just have to keep it alive all the time and i 'll teach you what that means but there she is okay so i fed her this morning and i 'm going to teach you how to make one from scratch so i 'm just going to bend you down there so i 'd recommend getting a jar i really like the jars that have the top like this because it 's easy to access easy to clean and you can kind of keep it open if you need to keep it open for whatever reason and cover it with a cloth so i prefer these jars you can use any jar absolutely sourdough starter is flour so i 'm going to do 20 grams and i 'm just going to use my eye because that 's what i that 's the way i cook so i 'm going to use roughly 20 grams so this is from scratch i 'm not even using any other starter here so 20 grams of flour and then i 'm going to do equal parts water so it just turns into a little paste i don 't know if you can see that i hope you can see what i 'm doing it just turns into a little paste so i stir it really really well and make sure there 's absolutely no dry bits so i 'm going to add a little bit water a little bit more water because i want it a little bit more liquid than now the consistency of your sourdough starter it actually doesn 't really matter as long as it 's active it doesn 't matter the consistency but bacons will tell you something different but in terms of in guatemala my sourdough starter looked completely different to the breads so you just stir that really really well and see there 's no there 's some little lumps but that 's okay it 's okay to have lumps but you just want to make sure there 's no dry bits so make sure they 're wet love so this is day one this is my starter ready to go so all i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to put the lid on this i 'm going to shut it and what 's going to happen is this is not airtight so all around us right now we are breathing in and exhaling microorganisms and they 're all around us and so these beautiful microorganisms are going to come in and they 're going to seep into the jar and start to feed off the food i provided for them now i let this sit for one day only one day no more so just one day i let this sit and what happens is tomorrow i wake up and i jump out of bed and i check on it and all i 'm going to to feed my starter and i 'm going to repeat this process for about a week to two weeks and that just basically means so this is the very complicated process of feeding feeding is just one tablespoon of 20 grams of flour and water and that is it fed so i do this until it 's active okay now what you will notice is after three days you 'll actually have quite a full jar so it 's highly recommended for the strength of the starter that you actually tip out half the starter and then you feed the starter half and half the amount that 's roughly in there so roughly the amount you tipped out you feed back in with fresh flour and water but you don 't have to be perfect with it either but i do highly recommend tipping out half your starter before you feed it every time so this is day two i fed my starter day two and again i just put the lid back on now it 's really important where you store your starter you mustn 't store your starter that are going to grow you want to store this starter in shade okay it does better in a place that 's kind of warmer so you don 't want it to be like in your freezing cellar you do want it somewhere where there 's air flow so you do want to make sure that there 's a lot of airflow around so that the microorganisms can come in so if you live like in a unit in sydney with no airflow it 's going to be tricky for you to keep this alive uh okay so that 's basically all you do and as i said how do i know when it 's active well there 's a few things you do first of all you feed it okay so after about five days let 's just say five days i 'm going to feed my starter so i 'll tip out half i 'll feed the starter and then just with a little sharpie i 'm just going to mark or maybe with a rubber band i 'm just going to put a see if this rubber where the starter comes up to so i 'll just put the rubber band around it and that 's how high the starter is that 's how high it is so what 's going to happen is if it 's active and growing i want this to double in size and when it 's doubled in size that 's when i can use it to make sourdough that is the best time to make sourdough when it 's doubled in size and then i will open the lid and have a little look and i will see there 's bubbles in it yes that 's great it smells sour and there 's nothing weird growing on it no like red stuff or purple stuff or anything like that and that is how i know my starter is ready now i want to keep my starter alive forever so when i make sourdough bread i will be taking some of the starter away to make the bread but i always keep a little bit of starter in the bottom so that when i finish making the dough i put some fresh if you don 't want to feed your starter every single day because you just don 't have the time or the memory or the lifestyle once your starter is active you can put it in the fridge and when it 's in the fridge it can stay there for weeks and months you just take it out the day before you want to make sourdough bread you remove half of it so you stir and you 'll see like some black stuff growing on top of it that 's okay as long as it 's not red or purple or bright green bright um green or bright yellow or red anything like that you don 't want that you throw it out burn your house down run away but the black stuff is normal that 's really normal especially if it 's been in the fridge for a couple of months or a couple of weeks so you just stir it really well tip out half feed it the day before then you tip out half and then you feed it the morning of or when you 're planning three hours before you plan to make sourdough bread then you feed it and then it 's ready to make sourdough so that 's it that 's really easy and so once it 's active what you can actually do is share it with people so if you have a mom or a friend or a neighbor who wants to make sourdough bread you can simply just hey here 's your little jar you just give them some of your starter and they don 't have to worry about making it active and this will never die as long as you keep it alive which is um you know up to you so if i can keep my daughter alive you can take your starter alive now i 'm going to move on to how to make the sourdough bread i just want to make sure you kind of have an understanding of the sourdough starter is there any questions i can take some questions now if you want before i move on just so you have a clear idea of what to do with the starter so uh lydia question it 's probably easier just to unmute yourself and and answer questions yeah go for it if you 've got a burning burning question i 'm going to take a sip of water yeah i like to ask the question um i notice you close the jar with the clip how can the whatever you say the air stuff comes in if you 've locked it because um microorganisms are microscopic so they can easily get through that that 's like a highway that 's heaps of snakes if you had something airtight no that wouldn 't work so if you have an airtight container you would want to pop the lid on it and put a tea towel over it and you could use a tea towel instead for the whole time if you 're really concerned about there not being enough air flow or enough um access for the microorganisms that 's a really good question it just looked like with the rubber it looks like it 's air tight yeah it 's i mean that 's um it doesn 't smell yeah that 's not airtight i do drop a lot of things okay thank you that 's okay any other questions before we move on about this little guy okay the other thing i just went off the back of sylvia 's question once my microorganisms are in here i actually don 't need any more coming in because they 've made a home and they 're just going to live in there now i don 't actually need heat small coming in because they 're living here they 're making babies they 're having fun so they 're happy i don 't really need more coming in something i will say however uh temperature really influences fermentation so in summer making a starter you could probably make a starter in three days in 40 degree heat in somewhere that 's quite humid and somewhere quite dry you may have a little more time a little more struggle um but yeah if you 're living in a hot climate you will make a starter in three days if you 're in the dead of winter and it 's like minus five or something it will starter unless of course you have a hot house and then your house will speed up the process but the length of time depends on the temperature the humidity and air flow same as with kombucha exactly all ferments we 're all they 're all influenced by nature um by the the environment so if you live somewhere where you grow grapes on the vines or if you grow blueberries or you can have stone fruits uh and you 're particularly worried about your starter not activating you can actually go pick as long as it 's organic and fruit and pop it in your starter jar and it can help activate your starter because all our fruits and that 's how they make wine all our fruits all our plants actually have yeast growing on them already so to make wine it 's not you don 't actually have to add any yeast if you were making it the way our ancestors were making it you just crush the grate and the yeast is already in there and the yeast feeds off the sugar just like chelsea just like it it 's quite active it 's a fermentation it helps fermentation it 's got the yeast in it coming from the pollen so um yeah so i digress or you could put honey in there that would be yummy um all right don 't ever put salt in your starter never put salt in your starter it will kill your starter never put chlorine in there either so always make sure it 's filtered water that will kill your starter i think we 're ready to learn how to make sourdough bread what do you think okay so and i 'm gonna put you down here all right so um you want to make sure so the recipe that i use is one part starter so one part starter and two parts is it two parts water and three parts flour i just had a mental block there for a moment so one part starter two parts water and three parts flour all right so what that 's going to look like tonight is i 'm going to use 200 grams of starter i 'm going to use 400 recommend you double that amount if you want to make a really lovely loaf of bread because that 's more of a decent size is double that amount whereas this is quite a small loaf so i 'm going to put the water in first so i 'm just going to use a measuring cup bakers love to use scales and i highly recommend using scales so 20 grams is the same as 20 ml so i 'm just going to put four i 'm sorry not 20 200 so i 'm gonna put 400 water in now i 'm going to do 200 starter now we want our starter to float i 'm not going to measure it in the jar because i kind of know off looking but i want to make sure oh there 's my dog hey what do you want what 's up i have to show you him to you at the end he is so dirty okay so let 's see all right so this one is floating a little bit can you see how it 's kind of floating on the top that 's quite good it i would prefer it to float a little bit more but because i was working all day today i didn 't have time to feed it at the exact time i wanted to feed it so we have to do what we do we have to do the best we can with what we 've got perfection is definitely not something i 'm good at okay so there 's about 200 grams of starter in there and i 'm just going to mix that so now with this starter i 'm just going to put this starter to the side and i 'll feed that later i 'm just going to mix the flour and the water together excuse me the starter and the water together so if you 've ever made bread this is like the time when you are putting the yeast in the water okay so this is putting the yeast in the water that 's what i 'm doing right now so stir that really well and now i 'm going to put my bread in excuse me my flowering so you want to do maybe um 60 white flour and 40 like a whole meal that makes a really really nice uh bread so i 'm just going to put one cup of white in um and so i 'm aiming for this to be uh 600 grams but i 'll probably i 'll just use my eye because i think the eye is better than anything else and i use this brand of flower demeter if you can see that um it 's organic so i 'm gonna put one and i 'll put another one of this in and so then what we do is we just get uh one hand and we mix it quite well together now before i do that i 'm just gonna put a bit more flour in it because i think it 's gonna be perfect and while you 're doing this there 's a few things you can do to feed your starter you can do the process called back backslopping where you simply just take some of this flour and water and put it back into the starter or you fresh flour and make a little bit of a mess and some fresh water and i recommend you feeding it at the start so you don 't forget to do it later and i 'll put the starter back in its little house where it looks okay so now i 'm going to add salt into the dough into the mixture you do not want to accidentally put salt in here and then put salt into your starter because it will kill your starter so i 'm gonna put about a tablespoon of salt i 'm quite generous with salt but you can put two teaspoons to a tablespoon and i 'm just going to use rock salt i 'm using himalayan rock salt you don 't want to use bleach salt you don 't want to use iodized salt i 'm going to use either self celtic salt or a himalayan so i 'm going to put quite a bit in you guys are about a tablespoon of salt now with one hand let 's mix everything together so you want to make sure that your water isn 't 're using room temperature water or you can use um you can use warm water if you really want to make it nice and active but remember with making sourdough you want to make it active but you don 't want to make it overactive you want the perfect amount of active so as you can see here i 'm doing a few techniques i 'm spinning it around i 'm also using my hand to kind of crush up all the dry bits now this is too wet okay i want it drier than this and this is what happens when you don 't measure things but this is the best way to learn this is the best way to learn your power and to connect in with it and what you want and then once you 've baked it you know okay maybe it was a bit dry with that flour so next time you know i make it more spongy so i 'll hydrate it more i 'll increase the hydration so olivia just there 's just a question come up can i interrupt you for a wait between feeding and making bread yeah so again it just depends on the temperature um there isn 't a rule around actually the time but i like the rule of feed the starter at night time and make the dough in the morning um that 's kind of my rough rule uh because you want so the ideal time is when the starter has doubled in size and hasn 't fallen that 's the best time to make sourdough so that 's why you mark you mark on the side it 's height and when it doubles in size that 's when is the best time to make sourdough so in summer i 've definitely managed to achieve that within two hours um and in winter sometimes it 's 12 hours because i live in a my house is like a tent it 's very much whatever temperature it is outside it 's usually either hotter or colder in here um so see that consistency so for your first couple of loaves you don 't want it too wet because the kind of thicker it is what 's the that 's going to be an easier um easier for you to use uh easy for you to manipulate and easier for you to need as well so for the first one i recommend about that consistency so can i hope you can see that consistency and i don 't want to waste any of the dough so i 'm going to put it back in and remember the awesome thing is i have all these lovely microorganisms on my hand and they 're influencing the awesome microorganisms in here you don 't have to use a stainless steel uh bowl i usually use a ceramic one so you don 't have to use anything particularly sterile so what i 've done is i 've just mixed this and then what i would usually do is i 'd let this sit look at my scary hands let 's sit for 20 minutes and during that time it 's going to become much easier to knead it so in your favor would be kneading sorry this isn 't the kneading mixing letting it sit for 20 minutes and then coming back time so i 'm gonna wash my hands and i 'm going to show you how to knead it okay so you want your hands as clean as possible for this process not in terms of like um soap i mean you don 't want dirty hands like dirt or mud or anything like that but you um you want to make sure you don 't have too much dough on your hands because everything will stick to one another i like to knead on the table i like to pour things out and meet on the table because it makes a lot of mess and that 's fun so i 'm just going to dust a little bit of flour onto the surface and smooth that out i 'm going to tip my dough out onto the flour now we don 't want to get over we don 't want to we don 't want to add too much flour during this stage we want to try to add as minimal flour as possible because it 's always going to get sticky and the stickiness is reduced not just knead it properly then the stickiness reduces so i 'm just going to dust a little bit of flour on there and i 'm just going to fold the edges in now something significant to understand is that this isn 't holding together right now see it 's just like kind of falling apart and nothing 's really holding it together so the purpose of kneading is to stretch the fibers stretch the gluten activate the gluten so it becomes more like chewing gum where you can actually stretch it and fold it so i 'm just going to do some gentle folds until it gets stronger so i 'm just folding it now something really important to understand is to make it as easy as possible for you you want to be folding into the center okay so you want to decide that one side is going to be the face and one side is going to be the bum and that 's how you get the dough doing what you want it to do because you 're not then making a mess of it all right so i firm but something to really understand is i 'm not like pushing it down really hard i 'm not like making scones i 'm like battering it because i want there to be air in it i 'm trying to put keep the air but i am still quite firm okay so you are firm with it but you 're not um battering it okay so now i feel like it 's holding much more shape so i just keep doing this where i 'm folding it over and then i get to a stage where i get a bit more confident and i can actually lift it up so i 'm just going to add little bits of flour as i go little bits but not too much i don 't want to add heat because then it 's going to get too stiff and too solid so now it 's getting enough that i can lift it up and i 'm just going to bang it down and fold it over a little bit okay and that 's a really good way to help strengthen the gluten all 't have the gluten in there so you will be uh it will be hard for you to get it nice and stretchy so don 't expect it to get stretchy you just kind of want to get it formed so nice and smooth and formed so you just keep doing this and kneading takes a while so you usually you know put on some music have a conversation take your time with it and you can take out all the angers of your day on it so i 'm just going to quickly talk you through how to make gluten free starter so to make a gluten free starter honestly it 's exactly the same process but you just use gluten-free flour and you want to make sure you have a gluten-free flour that 's quite sugary quite high in sugar so that would be like a rice flour um you could even put it like a combination of rice flour and tapioca but i would recommend just you know your standard like gluten-free baking flour or a nice you know organic one or a nice um uh yeah and you just feed it water the exact same way you make the other one so it 's quite straightforward and you know it 's active at the same time the gluten-free starters are usually a bit more um a bit whiter and a bit more gluey but that 's normal rather than like ballooning so as you can see now i 'm getting a little bit harder and a little bit more formed and i just keep going around remember here 's the head and you can do this nice technique where you basically just put your fingers underneath and you let it fall over your fingers you can see it 's really holding together now i don 't want to put i don 't want it to stick to my fingers too much so if you start getting frustrated about how sticky it is just go wash your hands and then come back again with clean hands okay because that really helps the process you don 't want to get tempted to just keep adding flour okay so for the sake of time i 'm going to just it should look like after you 've kneaded it net it for a while and this is a really nice technique where you as i said stretch it out and again it 's all just folding into where the bum is and fold it over so this would be a really good time to go wash your hands because this just gets frustrating when you 've got heats on your hands it 's sticking to you you want it to be so you 're not touching it too much and this is if there 's any potters out there this is what you do with the clay isn 't it preparing the clay similar thing okay so you need it until i don 't know if you can yep you can so you need it until you make a nice little ball and it sits and holds its shape and it doesn 't fall okay so it holds its shape quite nicely i think this one has a little bit too much flour if i 'm honest and you poke it and it 's quite bouncy and it 's not too much flour in it but you poke it and it kind of holds holds its form and it bounces back that 's what you 're kind of aiming for so you see that that 's what you want to end up with um but preferably through lots of kneading rather than from adding more flour which is what i did do this evening just to speed up the process now what will happen is just some troubleshooting once you get it there if you keep kneading it it will keep getting sticky it will get stickier and stickier you can also use olive oil instead of adding in more flour and the olive oil really helps but you don 't want to overwhelm you don 't want to use too much olive oil because what will happen is then this just won 't even stick to itself because it 's too oiled up so it 's a delicate balance okay so once it 's holding its form really nicely it 's still always going to be a little bit sticky but you do you do want to spend quite no longer sticky not from you adding more flour but from the kneading process then what you 're going to do is i would recommend lining your bowl with a tea towel and you put the tea towel inside the bowl and then you put your little scary fingers and you put your dough so besides the face besides the bun you put your dough into the bowl like so and then we cover it up we tuck it into bed with the little tea towel and we put it to bed and this is going to sleep for 12 hours or until it doubles in size so this is where we have to connect in more with what 's actually going on with our sourdough bread instead of just putting a timer on so you just come back and check it after four hours and you simply just put a little mark on the side of the bowl to tell you the size of it and what will happen is the whole baby will double in size and then what you do so we 've just gone forward in we are going to tip so this is grown so we 're going to delicately tip it out onto a very lightly floured surface very lightly floured surface and we 're just going to shape it so shaping there 's many ways to shape the dough but shaping basically is so that the bottom is nice and i 'm making a mess of this because i need to wash my hands but the bottom is nice and knitted together and the top is nice and smooth okay so that 's what shaping is and then what you do is we talk about baking okay so i shape it i then let it sit for a little like 20 minutes or something just to get comfy in the pot that i 'm gonna bake it in and then i um bake it so i 'm gonna wash my hands and talk about that did someone have a question oh what is the um 30-hour sourdough we hear about so 30-hour sourdough is simply just letting it sit for 30 hours instead of 12 hours so um what you would do is five hours or two hours and then you 'd put it in the fridge and you 'd let it ferment in the fridge what you want to make sure and it 's okay to let it ferment in the fridge because that 's actually a really nice way of letting it rise really slowly you don 't want to let it sit for 30 hours and it over ferments so it doubles in size and then it stinks and then it 's really sticky and it really smells really sour you don 't want that to happen so you want to make sure that it 's doubling in size and you can use a refrigerator to slow that process the longer it ferments the more digestible as well baking all right if you have a dutch oven which is basically just a casserole dish with a lid on it that you can go on the oven i recommend that to be the best thing for baking now you want to cook on a really high temperature so heat up on 250 put it down to 220 and then put it really important to understand is when you 're baking you want the dough to be baking in a moist environment you don 't want it to bake in a really dry environment so if you only have um if you only have loaf tins uh make sure you oil the loaf tin really well and then put a tray in the oven and then fill it up with water or you can put ice cubes in there to mimic not to mimic but to create steam and the steam in the oven keeps the environment nice and moist so the dough can grow to its fullest potential before the crust sets in if the oven is too dry the dough will crust and it won 't get very big it will get stuck and then you can have breakages where it kind of falls out the side or whatever something else that 's really important is you have to cut you have to score the top of your dough before you put it in the oven otherwise it will crack where you don 't want it to crack when it than undercook okay so if you 're not sure it 's ready leave it in longer it 's better to have overcooked bread than undercooked bread so it cooks for about an hour to an hour and a half depending on how strong your oven is and depending on how big the loaf is usually around an hour hour and a half is it should be done by then and again that 's on a high temperature so it 's a quite a solid thing that you 're cooking it 's not just like a cake you 're really making quite a solid um food um these are some great loaf tins that i just put on top of one another and that also helps me have a nice rise with the dough and something really important with a dough is again i did say make sure it 's lined really well with oil would be good you 've got to choose one or the other either you 're using oil or you 're using a type of grain or like a semolina or wheat to prevent the sticking choose you make um glue so make sure when you put the dough in the vessel you 're going to use to make to cook that the dough takes up a large part of the size of the bottom of the vessel because that 's how you 're going to guarantee a nice rise if i put into here this tiny little bun it will spread out and i 'll get a flat pancake so i 'm not a baker i don 't have a baker 's oven bakers can get away with all sorts of fancy things um i prefer to use my cheap things which is vessels that the dough fits the bottom of the pan or the dutch oven so that it can rise instead of flattened out really important when you have cooked your brand do not do not slice it straight away do not do that because your bread is still cooking on the inside so you want to wait 20 minutes it 's still going to be hot don 't give me that face it 's still going to be fresh and delicious you just day if you cut it too soon trust me from experience even though i was told don 't cut it i was like i 'm impatient don 't cut it okay wait 20 minutes let it fully cook on the inside um when you 're making gluten-free bread as i said before you just add in the gluten-free flours but it 's really um it 's really important that you put in psyllium husk okay psyllium husk is an important ingredient in gluten-free bread because psyllium husk is kind of like the gluten that 's not there it works in that in that way okay now i 've made bread so i will be cooking this tomorrow morning just so you 're all aware i 'll let this sit out of the fridge and i 'll let it cook i 'll cook it in the morning tomorrow so um before i wrap up uh any questions about sourdough and then i 'll just do a little conclusion if there 's no questions did you mention the temperature of the oven yeah so start at 250 and then drop down to two days before you actually cook it would that be right you get it out one day it stays that you feed it and then overnight and then you let it sit so um it 's one day one day so but if you 're talking about the starter it 's probably two days from when you got the starter active yep okay right yeah yeah and it 's one day or 12 hours um between making the dough and cooking the dough and again that time can change based on you know temperature and if you 're putting it in the fridge and what you 're wanting to do but yeah that 's exactly it wonderful uh just to cook through um uh so making your sourdough bread isn 't that hard you just need patience and if the first loaf doesn 't work out it 's a really cheap investment don 't worry the chooks will love it or you can turn it into kavas you can make kabus out of bread which is my workshop on saturday so you know there 's always another home for it worry too much if it doesn 't work out the first time just keep trying um with your starter everyone 's starters look different so don 't be you know my starter doesn 't look like my neighbors start out that 's fine starters change based on where you 're at and what 's going on and so i 'm gonna do a little self promo to finish this off um my business is internal instinct you can follow me on instagram you can follow me on facebook i work as a nutritionist so i see clients one-on-one supporting them with all sorts of things to do with health and focusing on gut health and making food digestible and delicious which is important part of eating i work in wingham and i work in foster and i 've recently just relocated with foster yoga studio to a beautiful new clinic overlooking the lake on wall street foster and i have a workshop on saturday sauerkraut and kevath so i think there 's some space i hope you all learned something i hope you were able to make sourdough now or to do it and again don 't be afraid just have a go i was going to show you my dog but he 's fast asleep and i think that 's a bit cool we 'll leave him we 'll leave into it thank you everyone so much for your attention this evening and nice to see some faces i haven 't [Music] seen [Music]

    "text": "[Music] in 2019 we adopted a resolution to prepare a climate change policy and action plan soon after we joined many other councils agencies organizations and government bodies from across the world and declared a climate emergency the impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly prevalent in the past 18 months alone our region has experienced severe heat waves the worst drought on record devastating bush fires flooding and coastal erosion any predictions are correct these events will only continue to occur more rapidly in the future as a council we have set ourselves a target of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. climate change is not going away it 's not something we can choose to ignore we all need to work together to make changes for our community our country and our world as you 'll see we are already making changes to the way we operate and to our future planning to lower our carbon footprint you can provide feedback in our climate change strategy on the have your say page on our website a climate change policy is council 's commitment to addressing climate change it framework for action a climate change strategy presents the actions required to meet our targets to reduce our missions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change this is the first stage of council 's approach to addressing climate change and is all about addressing council zone emissions so we can lead by example the next phase of the project will be to work with the community to help them develop a plan to reduce their own emissions 85 percent of councils our emissions are from using electricity with the remaining 15 percent from fuel use in our vehicle fleet the strategy presents over 150 actions to reduce our energy use and includes things like energy efficiency actions and investing in renewable energy council has a target of 100 renewable energy by 2040 we will largely be investing in solar energy to achieve this target and in the future looking at opportunities to develop a solar farm on council land and in partnership with our community whilst we 've been talking about climate emergency of late climate change really has been fundamentally part of our water and sewer businesses that in their long-term planning over the last 20 years we 've been developing the naviance water supply scheme at the moment it can supply up to 50 of our daily demands and that 's simply based on the size of the scheme and with our future expansion plans that will push up towards 75 and ultimately 100 we 've also got our long-term plans we 've we are the owner of land for a future prospective dam that will be a major supply system coming forward and we 're also looking hard at the way that we treat our recycling of effluent we do a lot with agricultural reuse but there really is an opportunity for us in the long term to consider how we can better use that resource in the future we 're looking forward to seeing the technology as it emerges and gets better our ability to control the processes is getting better and at the moment we 're really keen to see all options on the table when we 're looking at that long-term water security one of the number one things in regards to the amount of waste to landfill and one of those key areas is in education one of the main things that we need to provide as a council is somewhere where people can actually see how they can actually reduce their waste in their home as part of our plan we have the education sustainability centre that we 're looking at building at tung curry to showcase some of those things council 's role is to provide the community with maximum opportunities to reduce their waste to landfill reducing reusing and recycling is one of the easiest ways that we can reduce our carbon footprint when we were designing the building the councillors chose to put solar panels on the roof they wanted to do this in order to reduce cost and also to reduce our carbon footprint there 's 160 kilowatt system on the roof which is 800 square meters in size it does significantly reduce our cost of operation of the buildings now we 've got solar panels on the roof that run the majority of the power needs for the building and also the the carbon output considerations were always at the forefront of our mind some of the other sustainability initiatives that we used in the building are things like rainwater tanks that we reuse the rain off the roof in our toilets and to water our gardens we also have four electric vehicle charging points we 've also used water efficient appliances throughout the building as well as low energy appliances we 've used led lighting which is far more energy efficient than your traditional lighting we also have did extensive planting inside the alfresco area and outside we planted over 13 000 native plants it 's clear that the longer term future is going to be that our council vehicles and the really drivable vehicles i 'll talk about our council fleet uh are going to not be able to use fossil fuels in the future the question question 's really about what the time frame is and also what the technology pathway is that we should take to get there so with that longer term direction what we 're interested in doing now is finding really a practical approach so things that are is to introduce hybrid vehicles as a part of a transition to more electric vehicles in the future the procurement function in council we look to include sustainability and under that term we include factors like our local preference our social responsibility as well as environmental considerations we have very clear targets to work towards and we hope to see more and more people in the community joining us on this climate action journey to find out more search climate change on our website _"

    "text": "I 'm Matt Bell I 'm council senior ecologist Miniver is located east of Nabi Achatz on the on the western shore line of the larval amber River it 's an extensive sand mass and an ancient sin mass that was laid down during geological history it 's very old eighty to two hundred and sixty thousand years old because of the nature of it it 's it 's quite a unique area biologically it has plants and animal species in it that are that are quite restricted in range it 's early days now so what we 've been doing is monitoring we 've established a series of motion activated cameras with different lure types to try and understand where and what has happened with the wildlife of the area we 've undertaken some pest animal control work we 're particularly concerned about the long-nosed pottery which we know to occur in in in this area in quite good numbers and it 's a threatened species and has been heavily impacted by population decline in the past through the effects of fox predation and loss of habitat we 've it 's been fire affected quite intensively in patches but the the level of regeneration is very good and and we do know that Potteries have survived the fires in this location my name 's Peter Coonan I 'm the Environmental Officer projects work on a broad range of projects basically in the biodiversity and s tree management field the member area has such a diverse range of vegetation types that we get a a pretty good mix of species that elicited threatened either in New South Wales or nationally so as far as they are on ground species what things like the long nose potoroo new holland mouths and we also have records of the eastern ground parrot we get things like squirrel gliders brushed out fast Eagles plenty of bird life varied settlers little lorikeets glossy black cockatoos there are records of Eastern gras sales in the minibar sand plane and also plenty of wall and froglets so we 're working on long notes Potter ooh in this area there are the long notes pottery is listed in New South Wales and federally as their vulnerable species so the wild they require a very thick ground layer pottery as they forage on the ground eating things like underground fungi tubers roots and small insects they 're very heavily impacted by fires as in this landscape high-intensity fires really degrade their habitat so it 's really important that we can we can put in some on ground management actions to address the rest of the species obviously this area 's been pretty heavily impacted by by bush fires one of the main threats due to the long nose pottery particularly after bush forest predation from things like foxes and feral cats it 's really that there 's not much place from the shelves and once a fire comes through and those animals are very opportunistic predators so we undertake broad scale Fox control across these lands combination of trapping and and baiting work we 've had some pretty good results in the past out in this type of landscape the important thing is we we let this vegetation naturally regenerate that 's the key there 's only so much we can do there 's not a lot of weeds so we 'll let that native vegetation regenerate in a rural setting particularly for the potoroo it 's really important that that fire is managed unplanned fires severe fires frequent fires really just destroy the ground layer and the vegetation a lot of our ground dwelling mammals need that vegetation cover to avoid predators and to find food it 's really important that people manage that risk if you have the opportunity plant trees protect remnant native vegetation on properties undertake Fox control where possible really important also that if you have if you have cats you keep them inside or in a cat enclosure as they will come out they will will predating many of our small animals in the bush land there 's some of the key things that people can do to to help some of our threatened animals so this area of Foster particularly through golden ponds of southern Parkway is a bit of a stronghold for the vulnerable squirrel glider which is a small gliding possum that live in Halle Berry trees in these reserves they live in in the hollows they make a nest and they sleep during the daytime coming up night time to feed their general and indicator are very healthy forests so it goes to show that some of our bushland reserves in foster actually in very good condition from a vegetation point of view the fire is obviously impacted that severely loss of food resources death of a lot of these hollow bearing trees some of them have since fallen over and just completely been burnt out they can persist but they would obviously have been some direct mortality to the species in this area Council has been lucky we 've had a three year project funded through the state government through the environmental trust to restore about 60 hectares of bush land reserves from golden ponds up through Sam your place has been dry off Carlos Street reserves so we 've been using that money to tackle weeds pest animals foxes cats we 've installed a lot in lot of nesting boxes so the reserve here at the southern Parkway and golden ponds we had about 35 nesting boxes for squirrel was installed through this habitat with the fires we 've come back through where we 're starting to replace some of those boxes we had a pretty good population of squirrel waters in this area and will continue to work now to to strengthen that and help this this land recover since the fire Council has been fortunate enough to get support from conservation volunteers Australia and fauna to supply they 've been supplying us with nest boxes out in this reserve here we 've replaced ten boxes from conservation volunteers in this reserve that Western Ian today it 's been really good we 're going to continue to roll out boxes with the help of fauna through this reserve here and through many of our reserves through urban foster and also out in some of our rural lands and the squirrel guavas in foster a very they 're a very important population but they 're at risk of losing their habitat it 's prime urban development land they 're impacted by things like people dumping garden waste into reserves that spreads weeds it just native vegetation in their habitat cats in the in the urban landscape cats trees to prey on squirrel gliders we 're not just talking feral we 're talking domestic cats so really people can help by ensuring their cats are kept inside or at least in an enclosure especially at nighttime to help protect these squirrel waters if people have the opportunity plants and native trees and shrubs in your yard put up a nesting box if you 've got the possibility there 's lots of things people can do sustainable gardening practice sustainable gardening removing weeds and those types of things my name is Gayle well I live at Rainbow flat and I 'm with the fauna Wildlife Rescue Service which is for Australian native animals in need of aid and I 'm the southern one of the southern bird coordinators we are licensed to look after most or any species native species since the fires there 's so much habitat lost and you know we really have had to get in and care for a lot of animals and and make sure that there 's continuous feeding of animals needing food because their habitats were lost and they just didn 't of the public who donated you know some some great assistance to us and in financially in donations we were able to to use those significant funds to set up a couple of programs now the the first one was what we call food for wildlife fauna was able to set up 30 collection points where bins were made available with pellets for the Kangaroos and and the macropods and we had bins of food wildlife food for the birds so we were asking their members of the public to come and scoop out some of that food and take and put out on the grounds for the wildlife particularly those people whose properties had been severely damaged you know we wanted them to make use of those suppliers and that 's what they did the next one was the what we call the nest box program and fauna commissioned nest boxes to be made because we 've got species out there ago and their habitats destroyed and they need hollows to be housed in with the hollows being burnt and destroyed when we receive delivery of those nest boxes interested in putting them on to their properties the people whose properties were badly affected and it was really lovely to see that so many people were so positive yes we want to put them on our properties so we were able to get quite a few out at that time and we 're also working with the council to be able to put a lot of the ones that we 've we 've had made put up into the council areas as well so looking forward to getting that done and creating homes again for some of the species that really need those those nest boxes because they don 't have their hollows if people want to you know help in any way they 're able to contact us and talk to us about what they might like to to do some people want to just become rescuers other people want to do caring it just depends on what they feel they 'd like to do my name is Ben Z and this is my husband Muntz we are both former members and have been with fauna for over have gone through New South Wales this year we have felt that we needed to participate with fauna to help our wildlife and so what we have done is we have made nesting boxes that we 've just delivered to Council today and hopefully they 'll go out and become homes for some of the endangered animals the boxes that we have made we 've made four different types of boxes we 've made micro bat boxes small parrot boxes we 've made for sugar gliders and the smaller gliders they 're pygmy possums and so on well do two the terrible fires a lot of nesting boxes have been lost and of course also the natural habitats that are created in old trees so therefore it is incredibly important that we get these nesting boxes out to help the animals survive and thrive my name 's Nick Coleman I 'm in the environmental projects off a certain vindicates Council and part of my job here is to sort out the habitat requirements of the animals in our native forests donations of nest boxes such as ones given by fauna go out into our forests and what they do is they provide habitat for our possums gliders fatzke gals pretty much all manner of Australian native animals that need hollows in their trees to survive with the recent fires a lot of these hollows have been destroyed and also the nest boxes we 've put out initially have been in fire affected areas as well so donations such as this will help put out habitat which will allow animals to come back into the forests and do the role that they would have done initially so pest species control our pest insect control and help pollination of plants which will help the forest is rebound much quicker than they otherwise would have these nest boxes will be installed across a lot of councils reserves that have been burnt they 'll also be installed on private land and in Landcare sites as well [Music] _"

    "text": "[Music] okay so i 'll start off just by introducing adriana so adriana verges is a associate professor and she leads a group within the center of marine science and innovation at the university of new south wales her research focuses on the ecological impacts of climate change and the conservation of the world 's algae forests and seagrass meadows which are increasingly under threat she has worked in temperate ecosystems and tropical coral reefs from around the world and much of her research is experimental so adriana i 'd like to throw it across to you and you can tell us a little of your interesting research tonight it 's a great pleasure uh to be talking to the mid coast council today via zoom and i 'm gonna now share my screen and show you a powerpoint right so my name is adriana verges and i 'm based at unsw sydney and the sydney institute of marine science and the work that i 'm going to be talking to you about today is two restoration projects that we have been working on a big team of us have and it includes a very strong community engagement component so i 'll be talking a little bit about that the two projects are called operation cray with an operation posidonia and the way that i 'll run this is that i 'll first talk about operation craving and um and then we 'll have some time for questions and then i 'll switch over to operation pacidonia and that way hopefully we make this a bit more dynamic there 's less of me talking and new listening and we make it more yeah interactive um so the research that i will be presenting was done on the lands of underwaters of the dharawal gadigal fichigal dark king jung and were my people and i pay my respects to elders past present and emerging so let me start by asking you to imagine losing a forest along 70 kilometers of coastline um on land imagine this happening right next to australia 's most populated city something kind of slightly similar happened to sydney where i live not so long ago and there were huge protests and that 's what you would forest however when that kind of loss happens on the water it often just goes out of sight out of mind and and this is the story of the loss of a very important seaweed species called cray wheat the latin name is uh phyllospracomosa so this species makes beautiful lush underwater forests and craywood is distributed along the whole of the east coast of australia around victoria around tasmania and it went missing along the 70 kilometers of coastline right next to australia 's biggest city sydney and nobody even noticed for decades until melinda coleman and brendan kelleher and some colleagues first wrote about it now we don 't know why kravit disappeared basically because we can 't go back in time but we think it 's very strongly linked to the sewage problems that were happening in sydney at the time so back before the 1990s sewage used to be discharged right on the coastline and that meant that the water quality was awful so places like bondi beach used to be closed for swimming eighty percent of the time because of um this sewage problem and the 1990s with the installation of deep water ocean outfalls now what happens now is that the sewage is better treated and it 's discharged in deep pipes that are two to four kilometers long and they discharge the sewage you know in deep waters which means that the sewage is immediately diluted in the water column so it has a lot less impact so the water quality now is actually amazing considering the amount of people that live in sydney our colleagues mel coleman brendan callahan peter steinberg and others realized that krawit had gone missing um around 2010 we started thinking should we bring it back um should we try and restore this species but before we launched into doing this we asked ourselves well are we sure that it plays a unique role in the ecosystem or could it be that crayweed actually plays a very similar ecological role to other seaweeds in the system which did return to the sydney coastline by themselves and so the first study that we did as part of this project was to do some surveys to look at the biodiversity area and to cut a long story short i 'll i 'll tell you that craywood does support very unique biodiversity and in particular it supports very high numbers of two species that are commercially incredibly important the rock lobster and abalone they 're the two most valuable fisheries in the whole of australia and kravit also supports tiny um we call it epifauna and that are unique the composition of this epiphone is actually different to the little creatures that you find in other seaweeds so yes gravity is unique so then we thought okay well let 's try and restore it this is just a graph to show you um because i 'm a scientist with numbers that indeed cray wheat which is this one here has a lot more abalone than other seaweeds in the same site and this is a study we did in two sites okay so we know that it 's unique and it 's special now can we restore it is the water quality now good enough for crawly to survive that 's the first question that we had and here 's my when we restore it is that we take the the cray wheat from nearby places north of palm beach south of granola and we attach it to mats that we deploy in the sea floor uh with this cable try system and this is what a restored crayola patch looks like so this is the first site that we did um first in long bay and in little way in sydney and again some graphs just to demonstrate i 'm a scientist this basically is just to show you that the survival of the crayot in two experiments that we did with crevice from different places either from pan beach from granola it survived incredibly well it 's arrived as well as plants that we haven 't touched from nearby forests and other experimental treatments that we 've tried that we did but the most exciting thing about this project is that about six months after the restoration we start seeing natural recruits of craven so this is a cravat that was transplanted the process of transplanting it is stressful enough because we need to take the seaweed out of we put it back again and this process is so stressful that the first thing that the plants do when they are in their new habitat is they release the reproductive cabinets kind of going okay we may die here this is very stressful before we die let 's try and reproduce and of course after reproduction you have babies and we call them cravies and this is what they look like and they start appearing about six to nine months after the transplant and this is the beginning of the self-sustaining population so this is not attached to any math this is not artificial at all these are now plants that are growing again in sites where they used to be and but where they had disappeared for you know more than 20 years so this is just a graph that shows how much cray weed has expanded after every initial restoration effort so and this is long bay the side of the northern side of long bay and this is where we planted our first mats and basically once once the plants survive these cravies start growing up the plants the the seaweed starts reproducing and kind of expanding by itself without any assistance from aft so it 's self-propagation hundreds of meters away from the initial side and this is the beginning of yeah a new population now another key question for us was like well um when we do the craving restoration are we just bringing back the seaweed or actually are we managing to bring back the little creatures that associate with it this is a scientific graph where each point is essentially symbolizing an ecological community of one seaweed plant all i want you to get from this is that these ones here are the ones that are restored cray wheat the closer the points the more similar they are and what we can see is that they 're starting to remem resemble the reference populations of grey wheat which is a great thing and they are different to other seaweeds in the system so we are contributing to new biodiversity if you like at this point in the in this kind of big project what we knew was that city water was quali babies and the adults that our restoration methods work and that we can bring crave it back and it 's associated biodiversity so the next thing that we wanted to do was to scale up this project we had the proof of concept something else that we wanted to do and we talked about this from the very beginning of the project when we kind of when we were dreaming about you know are we going to be successful is this going to work from the very beginning we said if this works we really need to make a concerted effort to tell the world about it communicate because this would be a rare goodness story that deserves to be heard and i think especially in marine environments we we hear a lot about the many environmental problems that we face and there are many we hear a lot about the losses of entire ecosystems and that is true it 's happening and there 's a lot of big problems that we need to fix but i we felt that we often don 't hear about the problems that get people and promote more conservation so we wanted to make sure that if it worked we would tell the world about it so that 's how the project you know the the kind of brand if you like operation cravit was born so we got a lot of friends together they helped us you know draw this logo they you know they helped us come up with a name we created a website and a facebook site an instagram account twitter you name it social media and with this we wanted to really kind of tell the story of what we were achieving in sydney and also to try and get some money to scale up um the restoration and so we did a crowdfunding campaign it was just before christmas and and we were asking people to give an underwater tree for christmas and it became it became a really kind of big kind of news story we went the day we launched the project we were on the news in channel in the abc in channel 9 we ended up making it to the bbc and beyond and about the project they 'd go online they 'd help us you know by either giving twenty dollars for one underwater tree or fifty dollars for a family five hundred dollars for a patch and in this way we actually managed to raise forty thousand dollars which helped us start to scale up and then subsequently we 've obtained a number of grants from the federal government and the state government that is allowing us to keep growing and keep restoring craving but another way that we have put a lot of emphasis on is to try and reach out a bigger a bigger audience a greater audience we 've been collaborating with artists and in particular we 've been collaborating with jennifer terpin mikhail crawford and christine statham from studio tcs and they 've been helping us to communicate our story but through the medium of art so one example of one of the projects that we 've been working together with them on was sculptures by the sea exhibition that happened in 2016 where the artists they were actually invited to participate in the exhibition they heard about us to see whether we 'd be interested in doing like an art meet science collaboration where we would do the restoration of grey wheat here which is in south online and they their artwork would be making an artwork side fence that would try to bring attention to what was happening on the water kind of make um what was happening underwater visible and to the world above so they created this kind of fence around with kind of maritime elements and we also did a whole lot of workshops with school children in particular we work with 100 schools from around the the bondi area primary schools and some secondary schools and what we did is we we brought the kids to see the graywood restoration site and then we brought cravit to their lab here it is here and then we showed them the little creatures that live in and amongst the craving and then they made wearable art costumes in the shape of those creatures which they then paraded as part of the exhibition and there was even some music it was it ended up being this was the launch for example in bondi beach and they sang um we are leaving a yellow cray wheat which was really exciting um this is another art meat science project that we created this was part of the ocean lovers festival uh where we printed a giant crate that was placed on the floor of this swimming pool here the these icebergs in bunda and then we had an underwater craving for us that was also in the pool and that people could visit and snorkel you know in a safe environment and we did this in association with our colleagues from the living sea walls team as well and then essentially as we go to new sites we try and get funds to do new art with science collaborations that allow us to connect with the local communities so this is um an activity that we did when we planted it manly where we connected with children from balgala north public schools and the the kids actually building on the artwork and the costumes of the first kind of group of children they made an animated film was launched by salish tegel in november last year so where are we at with this now so at the moment we have six sites where we have self-sustaining kind of forests that are growing we have seats six sides where we 're still working um trying to improve the method or you know something 's not quite working so we 're still it 's still working progress and then this year we got funding to do another three sites so the project is still growing the dream here is to bring gravy back to the entire metropolitan coastline so we still have a lot of work to do just to finish up about this project just to mention that there are other things that we 're doing as well as just restoring so for example this is the work led by phd student georgina wood who 's just finished her phd and a lot of her work involved looking at the genetics so this is a complex graph all i want you to take from this is that we 're measuring the genetic makeup of cray wheat we 're and what we 're trying to do is simulate the genetic diversity and structure from nearby places and these little circles here show the the genetic structure of the little cravis and basically we are being successful at risk at um simulating the genetic structure of the nearby populations and then just to finish up and i 'll take questions after this um i just wanted to introduce to you the people that operation craving is there 's actually one person missing here but yeah so this is work that um ziggy marcinelli from sydney university alex campbell university of the sunshine coast now used to be unsw um peter steinberg director of sims um and professor at unsw melinda coleman from new south wales cpi brendan kelleher from sand cross university this was the original team and then as we started growing we brought students and research assistants with us georgina wood and lana cashley phd students very cruz and maddie langley research assistants and damon bolton who 's also and helping us on and off throughout the project and the person missing here is a new student kate um i 'll be happy to take any questions that you may have i 'll stop sharing okay thanks adriana this sounds like an amazing project and particularly the community engagement part of this it sounds like you really got a lot of buying from the community is that something that you think changed the nature of the project would it have been as successful without the community engagement how did that help or hinder the actual project yeah i mean i think i think involving the community is incredibly important and there 's actually a lot of studies that show that restoration is a lot more successful when local communities get involved because um they start kind of taking ownership of their area and for example in in the place that the latest restoration site that is manly like we often get photographs from swimmers divers people that know the project they swim over it whenever they see any interesting kind of wildlife interaction they they send us a photo and that 's really useful for us to know one of the biggest problems that we have with craywood or by fish so local communities can let us know about that and then we can do a bit of a top-up to replace any plants that have been lost so i think that 's really really helpful but also um it 's it 's about um yeah it 's about people kind of becoming stewards of their local kind of coastal patch you know so if people know what 's underwater and if they start kind of learning about the different species and what they do they 're more likely to to be supportive of conservation projects and these kind of filters through so i think a lot of the funding that we have got is partly because you know like if a funding organization sees that every day mom and dad people put in their own money to try and bring this craving for us back i think that the government 's going on is going to go well yes this is what is something that people care about so we 're going to support it so i think it 's all connected awesome okay so we have adjusting the techniques to make the growth more successful what are some examples of these so there 's a lot of kind of nitty-gritty things that we kind of keep touching up on and this is basically from you know how we drill how many holes how many you know this and that so there 's that practical side of things there 's also the genetics so that 's something that is new so you know we basically um mix populations from the north from the south in a very deliberate way to try and have this outcome of having you know genetic structure that was similar to the natural populations we have tried other things that haven 't worked so we tried um a bag system that you know with the storms it just got destroyed we 've tried a lot of um biodegradable materials and so obviously we don 't want to put plastic into the environment so instead of the plastic mats we tried coconut fiber we tried lots of things and nothing worked so at the moment we 're still using plastic but then we just own but yes so this kind of trial and error is constantly kind of going on as we plant new sites awesome next question how well do the restored communities look to fare in the warming and acidified waters of the coming decades to what extent will they be cooling influences in the local ecosystem yeah that 's very good question um so georgina woods work besides looking at the genetic kind of structure she 's also done like the first steps to try and see is there any evidence that some populations are more warm adapted than others and so at the moment um craywood you find it all the way to port macquarie so if that 's the warm edge of the population you know there 's still quite a distance between for the aquarium sydney so that 's kind of our buffer you know so for the sydney populations to be affected by warming waters it needs to get warmer than it is in port macquarie today and however if saves the port macquarie are already a little bit warm adapted something we 're considering is could in sydney to to prep them for the warmer waters that are ahead and that 's um that 's research that is ongoing it 's pretty blue sky it 's a little bit like what they 're doing in coral reefs trying to create like super corals and you know that are able to sustain um warmer temperatures so that is something that we are interested in and we 're starting to do some work on but i will also say like obviously with regards to climate change yes we can do a few things to try and warm adapt our populations but the most important thing in terms of management and conservation we need to do is reduce our co2 emissions of course um so you mentioned poor macquarie we 've actually had a few different people ask about what the population of cray weed is like off the mid coast and how is it fairing in this area um well it 's beautiful i mean it 's um it 's really quite lush and it 's quite interesting how north like north of sydney and the whole of the kind of just below the intertidal and that 's where you find a really thick forest but then as in tasmania you actually find it in really deep waters um some of the most spectacular populations i 've seen are in montague island and just off um kind of near batemans bay so yeah they 're basically they are really large north and south of sydney okay awesome um just on the second half of that question somebody had also asked do you think that the bushfires and runoff from the bushfires could have potentially harmed the populations locally we haven 't_''_1418.96 observed that we were a bit nervous um you know there was a fires and then it was really dry and then you may remember there was a big big big storm and that that 's when everything was got flushed and and then the visibility was awful for quite a while so the first time that we went diving after that we were nervous going oh my god what 's gonna but everything was still there we haven 't detected any mortality due to this i open kind of coastal areas so it doesn 't it doesn 't exist in in estuaries so you know it 's a more kind of flushed environment okay excellent i think that 's it for the moment um if we didn 't answer your question i 'll have a look that we have some extra ones there and we will be able to get back to you via email um but in the meantime we 'll move on to the second half of the presentation the other project that i want to talk about today is called operation macedonia and it 's also about restoration but this time instead of restoring us seaweed we 're restoring a sea grass and um we like to think of seagrasses as kind of like the dolphins amongst the plants so if you think about like you know all life originally you know came from the sea you know seaweeds some seaweeds started to colonize the land and with time and these developed into flowering plants completely adapted to life in terrestrial systems and then some of these plants were actually able to recolonize grasses so they 're they 're very different to seaweeds they 're actually um a lot more kind of seaweeds are a lot more simple and and they you know they 're a lot more ancient in evolutionary terms so it 's a little bit like the story of the mammals that came from land mammals that recolonized the ocean and then adapted to live completely in the marine environment so because they are flowering plants they have flowers this is what they look like um they also have roots and rhizomes and fruits so they 're a lot more complex than seaweeds the species that we are restoring is called posit on the australis and this is what a meadow of macedonia looks like they 're often monospecific and they 're often really really extensive and sea grass meadows like the ones of macedonia astralis are incredibly important in the ecosystem for many reasons so they contribute to having better water quality because um nutrients and sediments etc they settle and they kind of stick within the sea grass meadow they protect shorelines from erosion they 're incredibly important up to 30 times more carbon than terrestrial forest they provide habitat for a lot of species including some of you know the most beautiful kind of emblematics you know fish like the sea horses they also have a lot of epi fauna just like cray wheat and they 're also very important nursery areas for prawns for example or for blue swimmer crabs etc and they provide um they support a lot of very important fishery species now positive australis is one of the dominant seagrass it 's the most complex of the seagrasses in australia and you find it along the entire southern half of australia so this dark blue area and even at the top of tasmania here and it 's kind of healthy everywhere except in new south wales there are six estuaries where position is declining so fast that is now being classified as endangered so it was classified as an endangered species by the nissan government in 2011 and in 2015 it was classified as an endangered ecological community by the epbc act so this means that unless we do something about it this now why there 's many reasons uh the thing about sea grasses like pasadena especially in new south wales they like to grow in places that are sheltered um and and that means they 're the same places where we like to build our houses etc so there 's a lot of kind of conflict with humans um some of the historical causes of decline are pollution and building off marinas and and you know dredging to develop the coastline shading associated with sedimentation nutrient structure so all of these have contributed to the historical decline but one of the factors that is leading to really fast decline at the moment is both moorings so here what you see this is a photograph of lake macquarie everything that is dark is posidonia everything that is light is um basically the mooring scar so these are sewing moorings there 's a chain that drags along the sea floor and it just basically scrapes everything that is underneath it and as the wind and the tide change the scar keeps getting bigger and bigger and and that can lead to really big scars as large as 700 meter squares have been recorded and the thing about this morning damage is that it happens really quickly so this photograph for example shows how from the beginning of the mooring in april 2012 very quickly in just a few months you can start seeing very sizable scars that just keep growing and growing and growing and growing and so in just two years you have a massive scar and then when you have lots of scars together they start to merge and that 's kind of the beginning of the end so mooring damage happens very quickly and positizonia grows very slowly so one of the things about macedonia is that it 's the is one of the most slow it 's one of the species that grows most slowly in the whole of australia and because it grows so slowly and the impacts are still happening that 's what 's leading to experts to think that these species may become locally extinct within 15 years in some mysteries so what 's our proposed solution um the first thing with any restoration is the of the decline so if seagrasses are declining because of swing moorings with this chain that scrapes the bottom you need to fix that problem and what we 're suggesting here is using environmentally friendly moorings and we are by no means the first people to suggest that there 's been environmentally friendly mooring designs available for a few decades now and some work extremely well and they 're all over the world now um so what the key thing with an environmentally friendly design is that there 's no heavy chain that drags on the seafloor so this is either a neutrally buoy material maybe it 's rubber maybe it 's a synthetic material that is elastic but it just doesn 't drag along the silver now the thing about it is though that even say if we switch all the swing moorings and put environmentally friendly moorings in the whole of new south wales because bosnia grows so slowly it 's likely that the species will disappear before we see the recovery and that 's why we need to combine these environmentally friendly moorings with restoration now the that um because it 's endangered and protected and there 's not many healthy meadows left finding the donor material for the restoration is actually a challenge you know with cray we can literally just go north of palm beach and there 's so many healthy populations we can just take it from there take them to sydney and those populations will recover in a few years macedonia takes a lot longer to recover so we can 't just take it from a healthy meadow and then damage that so this is how we came up with a new concept called the operation posidonia storm squad where basically what we 're doing is recruiting volunteers to collect positive issues that become naturally detached after big storms so basically when they first become detached and this is inevitable with storm it 's a natural process when they 're still green they 're still alive so they can actually be rescued if you like and use for restoration so people collect them from the beach then they take them to a shoot collection station and i shall say that um this project we want to now move from port stephens to to other estuaries but the proof of concept everything we 've done today it has been imported stephen so this is a marina called the anchorage marina and where we have a station where people collect the shoots they can bring them to little plastic boxes that we have in here in this chest and then people just zip them down so that the shoots are stored on the water under until a technician from fisheries and nissan forest fisheries or collaborations comes in and brings this rescued cigarette shoots from the beach into these tanks where they 're kept until there 's enough of them um to do the restoration so kind of in a similar way to operation cray-weed we also created a website and a facebook presence but with operation posidonia the community engagement is actually essential because without people helping us to restore shoots we couldn 't do the restoration like we don 't have enough money to have somebody looking out and going to the beach and collecting shoes all the time so we really depend that go for a walk in the morning along the beach walking the dog they collect the seagrass put it in this um in this kind of system in the anchorage marina and then we use it for the restoration without them we couldn 't do it so the community engagement very important we have social media presence we also have done a whole lot of um school visits um to try and get obviously the new generations um involved and then we 've also done things like um kind of guided walks and the whole thing has been incredibly successful so in the first one and a half years uh volunteers collected over a thousand five hundred positive australis shoots this is kind of what they look like with the rhizome at the bottom so it 's been a really kind of encouraging project to work on so this work is being done by phd student julia ferreta she 's been the driving force be behind all the restoration and this is um shows all the different plots that have been planted so far so there 's been 10 of them the ones in red no the ones in blue anyway some of them actually have environmentally friendly moorings the other ones were old scars where the mooring has been removed and this is what it looks like so we are testing a few different things um julia 's doing a whole lot of science about what traits of the seagrass best predict should survival but other things that we 're looking at in a kind of scientific way is how different methods um [Music] facilitate survival so in one of the treatments we have these truth mats that we were thinking would help stabilize the sediment and may lead to to greater survival versus other treatments where there 's no juice mat at all and this is just some preliminary data from two time points and four different scars and basically this is the survival and this for seagrasses is really good so we 're getting you know and we 're getting more survival when we plant in the winter than in the summer so far and in the winter we 're getting good survival of somewhere between here are with and without tooth mass and essentially what we see is that when they have an impact it 's a positive one so with jude more survival than without but often there 's actually no difference so so far what we have found with this project is that yes basically we didn 't know whether this method of using positonia that has been detached and found on the beach whether this would be actually viable sources for for restoration and we found that yes it is so this the transplant stress of you know collecting it and replanting it all of this the plant can deal with this so these storm detached shoots are a viable source for restoration we 're getting up to 70 survival rate when planted in the winter and we 've also started to see that the fragments start producing completely new shoots in less than a year which is essentially because that 's obviously what 's going to be the beginning of the of the full meta so i just thought that to finish up i 'll show you a little video of we did and it was in november last year before the fires before covet different time um and here 's um so part of the team so here 's derek and maddie and this is julia um this is myself and um so this is what an efm looks like so you see instead of the chain there 's this kind of rubber system that doesn 't drag on the seafloor and this is one of the jute matte treatments and then we had some without tube mats here we only put this um poles on the side to mark the plots you know while we 're doing the measurements but of course all of this will be removed um after the restoration and julia is actually marking every single shoot with a number and so she can trace what traits of the seagrass lead to more survival and that 's what you know a new restored uh positive meadow looks like so to finish up i 'll just um acknowledge the many people that work in this project and so this project is a collaboration between sydney city marine primary industry and some colleagues from the university of western australia so they 've been doing restoration for a long time so we partner up with them to actually um increase the chances of of this you know working and taking off so from unsw we have um aleister pour and julia ferretto from sims we have maddie langley and derrick cruz and ph student lana kashlich some of um these guys obviously work in both private and macedonia from fisheries we have tim glasby and graham hasfield and from uwa we have elizabeth sinclair gary kendrick and john statten and last but not least um i just wanted to flag that um some of the craved restoration work is being featured in this tv um documentary series australia 's ocean odyssey it 's on tonight at 8 30. and in this in the episode tonight um there 's actually a fragment that talks about kelp forest and climate change um as well as talking about marine parks it 's a really really exciting kind of episode but in next week there 's a sequence on craywood restoration that um it 's it 's a really powerful kind of sequence because it shows some of the protests um of people in the 80s that were complaining about the sewage problem before it got fixed so it really kind of brings it home the fact that we 've managed to fix this problem and that was so huge back in the day and with that um i 'll stop sharing and i 'll thank you all for listening we do have one question from the last segment that i did miss at the time have you had any feedback from policymakers that they have seen the value of marine restoration for all for the all-important business of carbon cess questioning um there 's definitely a lot of interest in this and we are just about now starting to to to work at quantifying it so both seaweeds and seagrasses we think play a role in carbon sequestration but especially seagrasses because seagrasses are habitats where things sediment and the carbon effectively gets sequestered locally so once the the carbon accumulates once it 's below you know a certain depth in the it doesn 't kind of get respired out so it doesn 't exit you know so that 's why it 's sequestered and we haven 't yet done any quantification of current sequestration in in the pasadena the restored position yet but other people have and we 're interested in actually starting to look at the numbers here because um yeah i mean there 's increasing interest in trying you know in businesses and and private kind of individuals and wanting to offset the carbon that we emit so this could be a really good way to do it and you know it doesn 't get affected by fires so there 's a there 's a lot going for it and that 's with the seagrasses with the cray with um or kelp more generally it because it 's so productive and there 's so much biomass produced we think that 's also an important carbon sink because even though that carbon doesn 't get um sequestered locally because it doesn 't it doesn 't build on you know it doesn 't get sequestered on the rock a high proportion once it goes below one thousand two thousand meters it gets effectively kind of sequestered out of the system for a few thousand years so these are all this is this is really kind of cutting-edge science that scientists are working on right now awesome um we do have a question here about uh specific to wallace lake which is of course in foster tan curry about the dominant sea grasses um so in in wallace lake there is a lot of um posidonia it 's the range edge of bostonia and beautiful meadows but also zostra would probably be the other dominant species so positive is like thicker like one centimeter kind of bro thick or white and zostra is thinner it 's like half a centimeter and sometimes longer sometimes shorter both are very important but because positonia grows more slowly and it has higher biomass for things like carbon step question it 's more important whereas zoster is more important for a nursery for example for as a nursery for a lot of fish species um i might just throw in there as well that as a them each year in our report card documents so each year we produce a waterways and catchment report card so if anybody 's interested in that they can actually find that on our website if you just go to the main page and then search report card um it 's it also reports on water quality so if anybody 's interested you can find that there um i 'll throw it back to you adriana and we do have another question here which is quite an interesting one um i live on the northern side of port stephens and often see pacidonia shoots washed up on jimmy 's beach after storms if i was to collect them how would i store them before taking them to the anchorage that 's wonderful thank you um we actually used to have a um a place to store them in the northern side but um with the big one of the big storms the the chest got damaged but um if there was a lot of interest we could consider you know setting up a system again up in the north but um in a plastic bag so not in water so the like like what we want is to maintain the seagrass um moist so either a wet cloth would be ideal a a cloth that is like um soaked in seawater and then wrapped in a plastic bag for example that 's the best way to transport it and in this way if it 's a hot day put it in an esky with you know cool esky not with fresh water but um but yeah that 's the best that 's the best way that 's much better than say putting it in a butter in a pocket with water that that that tends to lead to it kind of starting to decompose really fast okay if there 's no more questions i haven 't got any more listed here so um i just want to say a huge thank you to adriana for presenting to us tonight that that 's some really interesting stuff i 've i 've got a few messages here that will say thank you these are really heartening projects you 're doing great work so to see what we 're doing um so thank you it 's been a pleasure and um yeah my my my email or where on facebook any any messages that you want to direct to us either through facebook or my email is is online easy to see easy to find i 'd be very happy to to answer any other questions well i want to say thank you to all for attending as well i know it 's late the evening but i hope you all enjoyed yourselves um this event tonight is part of our marine encatchment discovery series so it 's a series that we run as midcoast council in conjunction with hunter local land services _"

    "text": "the problem of plastic pollution is that a lot of it ends up in our oceans it 's estimated between 8 and 20 million tons of new plastic enters our ocean each year and that joins a plastic that 's already there and that plastic is choking our marine life quite literally take three is about making a difference on the issue of plastic pollution and particularly the plastic pollution that 's ending up in our oceans what we 're charging people to do is take three bits of plastic from the waterways beaches wherever you are wherever your special spot is and you 're making a difference take three also opens up a conversation on our own plastic footprint and how much plastic were in fact consuming a ways of reducing that plastic what we 're hoping we 'll get out of Project loggerhead is to create student leaders who aware and vocal on the issue of plastic waste and we want to see those student leaders getting out there and being impassioned and being the voice of change in their local communities and their schools spread the word of rubbish yeah reduce what we use I guess everyday people don 't really understand the effect that plastic has on the environment when it ends up in the ocean it doesn 't break down it breaks up and become small pieces and affects everyone more information I think it 's important that people know that like it just stays like it doesn 't go anywhere like while you may use it for a short period of time and then you 're done with it if you don 't want to affect other people and their clothes animals and after killing it it just stay there like the animal will fade away but like the plastic stays and goes on to do more damage for me it 's about connection and and without understanding you 're not going to care what we 're also doing with the students they 're learning to work together to create those key messages communicate it and take simple active actions within their school campus and community or and further afield to really make a difference when you say rubbish don 't leave it there it 's kind of oh my eyes up a bit more to the things that were using it 's made me think maybe we should maybe not use as much plastics and use more reusable things schools are have a really unique opportunity to communicate with a lot of people that can provide a leadership role in their community and so we 're hoping that they did some good things in their school but also take it beyond the green fence so a school uses a lot of plastic cutlery a lot of knives and forks stuff and instead of using the plastic I was thinking maybe you could change it over to bamboo and wooden stuff more biodegradable things our school has already done quite a few things to help with the environment but we 're thinking of putting a soft plastics bin in the canteen and contacting the suppliers and trying to get them to stop using so much plastic it 's really important to get those kids on board get their friends get their peers get their teachers and get everyone on board because we can all just think that it 's important for them to be able to adopt some leadership skills from today and incorporate them into our school routine at school so going to approaching the canteen asking them to possibly think about the plastic that they use and how we can reduce that kids that are bringing in plastics from homes their way they can reduce that to be an example to other people looking at okay both kids can do it them we can do it we have an environmental group at school and thought this would be a good way for some of our leaders to to be involved with some of the environmental issues that we have we need to get those students to go out there and talk about what they 've learned today but also to to generate interest and an action around it as well so to make people not only aware of it but also prepared to do something about it so these are the kids that we 're really trying to get engaged because it 's their future that they have to make this change really good to learn about the environment and ways to help out and yeah it 'll be good for everyone to find out about how to really help actually really good like very good learning opportunity and like you learn a lot more information than what you would do in your own independent research it 's really important for schools and student get involved because it 's really going to take a global effort every single person on the planet it 's got to do their bit to reduce their consumption and the amount of waste that ends up in the environment there 's a really key time for everyone not just the kids but for everyone to actually get on board make some lifestyle changes they 're not hard but simple things like saying no to single-use plastics choosing reusables opting for things that have less packaging the solution is to use less what we want everyone to do is to think about their plastic use and use less say no I don 't need that plastic bag I don 't need a plastic straw the opportunity is there the world 's ready for it you _"

    "text": "[Music] okay good evening everyone and welcome to tonight 's waterway encatchment report card event which is our manning river my name is erin masters and i 'm an environmental engagement officer here at midcoast council and i 'd just like to thank you all for joining us this evening so i think i guess i just want to start by acknowledging just how important the mid coast waterways are they really are some of the most important parts of our landscape and keeping them healthy keeps our communities thriving they 're important for wildlife they 're important for the health and activities that we undertake in them they 're a really important part of our environment and so to achieve the best outcomes for our waterways we rely heavily on things like research monitoring modeling and local knowledge to help us manage our waterways and that 's what we 're going to talk about this evening but we 're going to talk about it particularly in regards to the manning catchment the main catchment obviously is one of the largest in the mid coast area and you do have maybe don 't know is the same size as jamaica so we have a pretty large area and the manning catchment is one of the largest catchments in in our area um we 've had a few different research projects that have been taking place in the menin catchment we 're also currently working on the manning catchment management program and we 're going to talk about that as well as the mapping of coastal wetlands and some different information about the effects of acid sulfate soils this evening as well so first of all just before we um jump into our presentations i would like to introduce you to um our guests for this evening who are going to be presenting for us we have louise duff who works with midcoast council hi everyone and we also have martin sullivan and you 're great for joining us this evening as well hi guys okay so thanks for joining us everyone uh before we get started the the reason that we 're here this evening um is because we have just released our annual report card program so the report our waterways the health of our waterways and how they 're faring so this is the front cover of our 2020 waterway encatchment report card it is available on our website or if you would like a hard copy of it you can also give us um send us an email at environment.uh sorry environment midcoast.newssouthwales.gov.edu i 'll pop that into the chat later on so that you can email it if you would like a hard copy so each year we have independent scientists from the department of planning industry and environment who come in to check on the health of our waterways and they use a couple of different indicators to do this so first of all we 're looking at um chlorophyll-a which is the way that algae grows in our waterways we 're also looking at the turbidity which is the how clear our waterways are and we also monitor our seagrasses so we chose those indicators because they are a really clear indicator of ecological health in our waterways so just here on the screen you can see in a high conservation area or an very clear turbidity and lots of healthy sea grass as we go into a moderately disturbed environment that turbidity is less and we have a bit more algae and less growth of seagrass and in a heavily impacted lots of algae and very high turbidity so just to give you an idea um i think that everybody that lives in the mid coast area knows what a tough couple of years we 've had we 've had a very extended period of drought which really affects our waterways it affects the ability of vegetation to grow along our catchment areas and that that really um brings down the ability of holding in runoff from into our catchment when it does rain uh we did also have some very heavy uh sorry some very extreme bushfires through our area this year and then of course we had flooding conditions so three of the biggest climatic events that you can have all followed in quick succession um so to give you an idea just of the rainfall that we had this year you can see that in october through to january there february and still high rains in march as well and to put that into perspective we sampled six times during the period um between 2019 and 2020 so just here in the orange bars you can see are our sampling periods and the blue bars are the rain in between so you can see for the first three samples we had those heavy drought conditions not a lot of runoff but in that time we also had november december and january we also had the fires so we had two that two samples that were during bushfire conditions and then we had those uh moderate rains in january and flooding rains through february which then affected our last couple of samples now the other thing that does affect our um our results is the river versus lake estuaries so when we 're talking about it in relation to the manning the manning is a river estuary it 's long and linear with a very large catchment area and a large tidal range and the speed of the water flow when it rains it can get very high as well that wide and shallow so we 're really looking at the men in here and you can see under low rainfall conditions in both a river estuary and a lake history um very low flow very low algal levels um and in fact under these conditions the material that 's already in the waterway is what will drive the results um that 's different under moderate rainfall where you 're going to have high algae levels in both areas because of what 's called residence time and that 's the amount of time that the uh the water stays in the estuaries and allows that algae to grow but what is interesting and the reason that i 'm showing you this is because high rainfall events can have a a very different effect in um in the waterways between a lake history and a river estuary and and in terms of the manning this is what we saw happening during those flooding conditions in february and that is that the flood flow was so high and the water was moving so quickly through the system that we found that there was they could grow and that 's very different to in a uh in a lake estuary so let 's quickly have a look at the results for 2020 so each of our estuaries is given a result between a and f much like a school report card and this year we saw a drop in result for about half of our site so nine sites dropped a grade and the other nine stayed the same as they were last year now that 's not really unexpected considering the conditions that we 've had and in fact the fact that no sites dropped more than one grade is quite impressive given that drought uh bushfire flood component uh the many results are at the top here um and we 'll just go through those quickly so we have five sites in the manning catchment um you 've got now remembering that these are all in the estuary so it 's further down um but we 've got the five sites so we 've got the upper mid and lower estuary and then we also have the dawson river estuary and farquaad in a couple of those areas so that 's a b grade in parkour the lower meaning and the mid menu but we did drop a grade in both the upper mening and the dawson river estuaries dawson 's river s the the grade in dawson river was interesting because it was really driven by alby and you can see that here um that the black line is is the algae for this year compared to last year so you can see that that algae level was quite high uh and that was what was really driving the results there in the the dawson river although water clarity was also not so great um and the rv levels in the mid manning same thing a little bit higher than last year and a lot of these results could have been affected by the fire but we don 't know that because of that flooding condition that happened straight afterwards it 's really hard to um to uncombine those that 's not really a word but you know to to pull those um results apart from one another that that um flood just meant that those flooding conditions were washing all that fire debris into the water which does have an effect but it could also mean that it was just that flood condition as we would expect in a flooding condition anyway um farquaad inlet retained its good grade and we don 't know how the effect of the opening the entrance was actually affected um just because it happened at the same time as those um flood conditions so again uh those results are hard to untangle from one another so overall um we also saw um no growth of seagrass in the upper manning estuary and we saw a drop in the level of seagrasses in the uh the mid-many and um an increase in um the lower manning as well so interesting sea grass results there as well which are obviously affected by um things like tidal flow as well so that 's a really quick overview um there is some more information out there um so we have the full document uh which looks like this and as i said if you would like a hard me know and we 'll send it out in the mail it gives you a breakdown of all of the different results in all of the different areas and also a little bit of information on how we use the research of the monitoring modeling and management in order to look after our waterways and we also have this document which talks about how do bushfires and floods affect uh water waterways um so there 's some interesting information on there as well as some uh diagrams on the back that show how bushfires actually affect the waterways as well so if you 'd like a copy of either of those you can either look at our midcoast website um you just go and search report card otherwise you um can also email me and i 'll send you a hard copy all right just quickly uh before i wrap that up did anybody have any questions about any of that um some of you may have heard it last week i know that some of you came to our report card uh launch which was great thank you for 's just a quick run-through of the many results uh before we talk a little bit more about how the mining river works and some of the research that we 've been undertaking in the area this evening okay so john 's just asked uh do we have comparative data for the mini estuary with farquhar in that opened and closed so we do actually take these results each year um parkour inmate was only added in 2019 to the um as one of the sites that we were monitoring but it was closed in 2019 so it does give a little bit of an indication of the differences between open and close but obviously now that we have that site being done each year it will provide some baseline data for exactly what you 're asking there john to to see what happens when it 's open versus when it 's closed we do have results for the rest of the manning the upper mid and lower what will uh have all been being tested since 2014 so we would be able to look at those and see the the information on on when the outlet is open and closed um but it 's not something that we 've looked at at this time yet so i 'd like to introduce louise stuff who is the catchment management coordinator for uh midcoast council would you like to join us for hi uh so louise has been working with us for the last several years uh she 's leading uh work on the catchment management program uh working with a lot of our community stakeholders uh developing this new program for the many and that 's a little bit what she 's going to talk about tonight so i 'll hand over to you right well as as erin introduced me i 'm the catchment coordinator and our team 's role is to look after water quality and ecosystem health in the manning river and the estuary as well as all the other catchments in in this region so to help us do that we we are preparing the manning river estuary catchment management program at the moment working with a lot of community people and stakeholders and academics and approach to the plan um and we 're using science to underpin it so i 'm going to show you one of the pieces of work that 's been done for us by dr rebecca swanson from the department of planning industry and environment and it 's a history estuary health risk model so the reason we 're preparing a catchment program is because this is our community 's vision for the river we want to have beautiful healthy water we want to be able to go fishing and catch fish we want to go swimming and have our kids playing in in the river with really good water quality for that and of course beautiful riparian vegetation that is you know hosts wildlife and looks after water quality and what we don 't want is this so you can see compacted cleared soil you can see algae in the left from nutrients cattle in the river the top right is a plume from acid sulfate soil we have a fish kill from a black water event and weeds growing in the riparian veg so the purpose of doing this know work with all of our partners to best manage the river for that beautiful healthy vision that you saw in the last slide now why do we need a risk model well the manning catchment is huge as erin said it covers eight and a half almost eight and a half thousand kilometers square right from gloucester tops and barrington tops down to the coast to manage this catchment we need to know what 's the problem where is the problem and how do we invest to achieve the best outcomes so the estuary health risk model really started when we first looked at the new south wales marine estate threaten risk assessment so this risk assessment was done by state government and it covers the estuaries and marine waters of the whole coast as well as the northern region and the outcome from their process was a set of risks with the ratings we then looked at them more closely for the manning with our technical working group and you can see the sort of things that we came up with for the manning so we 've got effluent runoff but the two we were really interested in that are the subject of this presentation and our estuary health risk model were agricultural impacts particularly diffuse source runoff and stock in riparian vegetation we looked at what our knowledge gaps were for the manning and we really didn 't have as much information as we needed about these two impacts and and where and how we were best to manage them so um as we said we commissioned rebecca swanson to prepare the estuary health risk model and this looked at inputs from land use on water quality in the estuary and in particular it looks at nutrients so total nitrogen and total phosphorus as well as sediments in the form of total suspended solids now there 's a lot of other science that 's being done to underpin the plan and you 'll hear more about that from will and martin but this is just in particular the estuary health risk model so the estuary health risk model is made up of all these layers and um it 's like a layer cake if you like and data and then they 're combined into the final model so these layers represent likelihood and consequence so any risk assessment if you 've ever done say work health safety risk assessment or business risk assessment you look at the likelihood of a pressure having an impact and then the consequence and that 's exactly what 's been done with this model so in likelihood the model looks at surface flow of water sediment and nutrients as i 've said and also proximity to the estuary and then in terms of consequence it uses a hydrodynamic model so this is a bit what uh this is what aaron 's actually just showed you the differences between the river and the the lake estuaries it shows us the way water moves through the estuary how long it uh is retained in the estuary and therefore the sensitivity of the estuary to different sub catchments as they shed their surface flow carrying the pollutants so now let 's just have a look at some of those layers clearly surface flow has a major influence on agricultural runoff so this is the amount into the waterway the dark blue high flow areas relate to headwaters in the mountains with high rainfall and steep slopes and you can also get high flows where there 's been land modifications so if there 's clearing stock poor compact soil with low organics you 're going to get water running off much faster there as well and we 're hearing anecdotes from the farmers that you know it used to you used to have three days to get your pump out of the river uh if it rained in gloucester tops and you lived in mount george you know you had plenty of time to get your pumps out so they weren 't damaged and now it 's 24 hours because that runoff has just accelerated over the decades the next layer that the model looks at is erosion and sediment so sediment comes from a range of sources but this model in particular as i said focuses on agriculture so you get cattle packing of the banks cattle tracking up and down the hills causing a range of different types of erosion and then you can the january rain that um aaron was talking about and it was after the fire so you can see the really high level of sediment we obviously lost a lot of vegetation cover during that fire and that 's also led significantly to that high turbidity so why are we interested in sediment well sediment in the river reduces light in the water column it clogs the gills of fish and aquatic invertebrates and it smothers habitat so the sort of cobbles and rocks in the bottle bottom of the creeks and rivers that are important habitat for water bugs and things like that at the base of the food chain the sediment can also fill up refuge pools and it mobilizes nutrients so this is the um the layer in the estuary health risk model that comes from data and it 's about it 's on the generation rate of sediment the set generation rate for sediment is expressed as kilograms per hectare per year and the generation rate comes from the land use class so whether it 's grazing modified pasture native pasture irrigated pasture it 's going assigned a land use class and the pollutant loads in surface flow runoff are predicted for each of these land use classes so we use generation rate rather than total load because it 's seen as a better method in terms of predicting where the biggest issues are going to be and you can see the generation rates for the manning here the sub catchments with the highest generation rates are the estuary itself in that really dark brown um as well as the lower gloucester river and then in the northeast we 've got the lansdowne dingo creek cedar party creek and cadiz creek next the model considers nutrients so nutrients are caused by things like fertilizer in the paddock you can see in the top left cattle defecating and manure that 's then washed into the water in those rain events and it causes excess algae and you can clearly see that in the right which that photo was taken on a rapid assessment exercise we did in august and it also leads to fish kills and those that photo of the fish kill there was uh taken fish kill luckily in the manning uh compared to kempsie but we still did have a bit so what 's the problem with nutrients nutrients stimulate algae growth and then when you get that big algae bloom the as it dies off the bacteria decompose the dead algae as it does that the bacteria consumes oxygen and deoxygenates the water and then the fish and the aquatic fauna suffer excess algae also blocks light from the water column as well so that causes die off of submerged plants as well so this is the map of nutrient generation rates this one in particular is total nitrogen but our risk report also shows phosphorus and you can see here the um the highest risk again in that same northeast lansdowne dingo creek cedar party creek and cat eye as well as the lower manning estuary and upper manning so quite a similar picture to the to the sediment map the model also takes into account proximity so its focus is estuary health um that 's because we 're preparing this plan under the coastal management act and the marine estate management we do have a very strong focus on the estuary itself and clearly the subcatchments that are closest to the estuary like the lansdowne for example are going to have an imp bigger impact than rivers like say the barrington or bowman which have got plenty of land to attenuate those pollutants as they come down through the system in terms of the consequence layer it 's based on the hydro hydrodynamic model and um as we 've heard from uh aaron this is predicting how long water will be retained in the manning estuary the manning estuary even though it is a river estuary does have quite a long retention time i meant to check that figure before i spoke with you but i think it 's in the order of uh maybe 30 days so quite a long retention time compared to some other rivers and that makes it more sensitive to pollutants and you can see once you combine a mapping layer like nutrients with the hydrodynamic model you start to see which subcatchment has the biggest impact on the estuary itself the risk model was validated results were compared with water quality data that 's collected by mid coast water from 2001 to 2019 um this had actually a good level of validation so the observed concentrations through the data were a pretty good fit with the model water quality data um we sorry we also um did a ground treating exercise so we spent six weeks doing a rapid site assessment program right through the catchment we went to 206 sites and we did a whole lot of we filled out data forms during that exercise on things like in-stream condition as well as land use riparian vegetation weeds and all sorts of things and unfortunately because of the really extended drought which we were right in the middle of the water really varied a lot and we actually didn 't get a high level of validation through that ground truthing exercise for the model so this is the model itself and i guess as aaron 's been saying um with this report card you can also see the whole risk report this reports on the our manning river website and um there is a really interested in catch-up management to have a look at so what you can see here in the estuary health risk model combining all those layers that i 've just shown you is that the highest risk for two estuary health is surface runoff from the landsdowne river and cedar party creek so how do we use this information well the way that we approach catchment management is through an adaptive management cycle so this is a continuous sort of improvement process where we start by improving our understanding and as we 've done with that risk model we use that for our policy and planning which we 're doing now with the catchment management program that we 're developing and we then implement on-ground action now there 's a step between the model that i 've shown you and the implementation and that 's of course field investigations so before we you know the model is really just predictive we then need to get out on the ground but as we 've said eight and a half thousand um square kilometers almost for the catchment it 's really valuable those on groundwork sit down we have the continuous monitoring through the report card and we are also developing a monitoring program for the cmp and then we evaluate our results and go back into that research phase so it 's it 's a continuous cycle that 's helping us manage the catchment on evidence-based science um and these are the sort of management actions that we might take so on the left you 've got brian royce not in the manning catchment i 've got this photo actually from kuruwa but one of our team 's projects and he 's fenced cattle out of a wetland and that 's going to really allow that wetland to perform its buffering role in filtering out nutrients and sediment before they reach the estuary and you can also see on the right here a rock revetment which is stabilizing a bank of the lansdowne river so these are the sorts of works that are already ongoing in our catchments but um will be you know planned and i guess the cmp itself or the catch management program will become a platform to is anyone got any questions uh so we do have one question already from john uh why is the median clearance rate 30 days which is well above average do you know or what do you think causes that um i might ask um will if you might answer that will you might have more idea than me well i guess that depends on where you 're looking so if you 're looking down the bottom near the inner harrington or um farquhar it 's not that long it 's much much shorter but as you go further and further up the estuary you know what happens in these estuaries is that water goes in water goes out but then the bit that 's the next bit up it just goes back and forth and it doesn 't actually get flushed out so it takes a long time for that bit say up above taree to actually go a little bit down each time you know so it doesn 't actually get swapped all that unless there 's a big flow on the places like up a big swamp or above taree just take longer to go until there 's a bigger flow on thanks thanks will that was a good explanation that 's right for you john um okay so the next question um i 'm not sure if this is in relation to what louise was just talking about or report cards so i think we should both answer it louise um are we measuring for any toxins and or heavy metals so in terms of the report card we do only use a couple of indicators because we 're looking at overall ecological health of the waterway so no we 're not looking for toxins or heavy metals when we do that monitoring um we have a very specific set of standards that we do use but report card is definitely not the only monitoring that we do on the river so louise did you want to cover a little bit about what you guys do yeah i did read as part of our research for the catchment management program that our water services team was involved in a study of pesticides in the upper catchment it actually can 't remember who it was done by it was i think part of a much bigger project and it did find very low low rates of pesticides so they weren 't considered a risk factor okay so next up we have martin sullivan going to join us so martin is a spatial ecologist he 's got more than 15 years experience in vegetation mapping conservation and biodiversity assessment uh he works at ecological australia and martin is a principal ecologist and the national technical league for a team of more than 80 ecologists that 's a lot of people to manage one sorry but like it 's just a technical role so i don 't have to do the day today but certainly an exciting role um and and it says that you 're regularly engaged by local and state government as well as private industry to undertake vegetation mapping at landscape scale his recent mapping works include post-fire assessment of the gondwana rainforests of australia native plant communities of cooler tops and the coastal wetland mapping of the many in korea and mile catchments so i 'll to present chris next all right okay all right so hello everyone today i 'm going to be talking about some recent work we 've done mapping coaster wetlands in the manning estuary just like to start off i guess with a question about what is a wetland um there 's many different definitions of what wetlands are um but generally wetlands are areas of land which are temporarily seasonally or permanently covered or saturated with generally slow moving fresh brackish or saline water wetlands are obviously to most people characterized by the plants and animals which occur there that are adapted to a natural water cycle and importantly wetlands provide valuable services for the community and the environment by providing floor and fauna habitat protecting enhancing water quality reducing erosion flooding and storing blue carbon so our study area is the coastal area of the manning river catchment the estuarine portion of it seen here in a sort of dark blue hatching um it includes the manning river it 's tributaries in the flood plain up to the proximal tidal limit which is kind of between tari and wingham all the way westward up to the top of bangs and tops so the objectives of our project which will produce a fine scale a high resolution wetland type map and to accurately describe the wetland types present based on their physionomy which is the characteristic species in their structure their landscape position rich species richness condition disturbance and threats and protective protection under various state and federal legislation accurately defining wetland types is essential in assisting catchment management through improving habitat condition increasing connectivity by reducing fragmentation improving water quality through greater natural filtration and improving and maintaining fish habitat additions of wetland types to boost the adequacy and representativeness of public conservation system is quite important and hopefully this work will help with wetland reconstruction and restoration projects so the methods for our project um we reviewed a suite of existing maps uh for the studio we 're not the first and might be the last to look at wetland and other vegetation in the catchment there 's a large amount of data which is publicly available in through the department of planning environment industry such as bionet targeted survey uh following a gap analysis we did 22 flouristic plots which are sort of a 20 meter by 20 meter plot where we record all species present and over 280 rapid points those points include the photograph dominant species structure condition wetland types and threats importantly for this project we used a boat for a significant portion of the work because obviously having a boat in an estuarine environment allows you much greater access to wetland areas than possible on foot and allowed for identification of issues that you might not be able to see from the shore we also use drones to small consumer drones you can see me flying on there we took about 100 videos 400 photographs across 13 separate flights and these drones are obviously very useful for accessing terrain you couldn 't get to on foot and they also provide a different perspective when you 're undertaking mapping so how do we actually do vegetation mapping i guess i 've got this image here as a bit of a concept for you to be able to understand or at least visualize how we state-of-the-art technology and data such as high resolution imagery surface and elevation models to produce high quality mapping outputs uh we we have custom built hardware that we have here paired with special spatial software to undertake mapping in 3d it 's a much more advanced method than the old stereoscopy that was used prior to the invention of the sort of 3d analysis that we 've got here which allows us to map it at a very high resolution and by doing it in 3d you 're really seeing it 's like hanging out on the side of a helicopter and looking down you really see the landscape you see the mountains sticking out of the ground you see the wetlands you see different structure in the vegetation which really aids in undertaking mapping this is a bit of an example here this is a just a site in cloudy bay so you can see that it 's a relatively small area these wetlands occur on coastal sand mass with impeded drainage with very little topographic relief generally less than 10 meters so some of the wetlands such as obvious but other wetlands such as heath and shrublands are not that obvious just from aerophotography so in terms of our process we go out and undertake field-based surveys so those pink dots are rapid sights or full floristic surveys and we supplement those with drain imagery so we fly a drone around record video take photos and what that allows us to do particularly with the drain imagery is get a different perspective on landscape so this is a photo taken from that same location with an oblique view which allows you to see i guess firstly how flat the landscape is but then it allows you to see different features such as shrub lands within the sedge lands and forested wetlands and other forests in the landscape so onto digital elevation models i guess there 's it allows us to look at specific locations to really tease apart those topographical features so in this map blue represents the low areas and radar represents the high areas so for the most part those edgelands that i was talking about earlier are shining blue quite clearly low but it 's sedge land down in the um right hand side or south east of this image here which is perched it 's much higher than surrounding wetlands so when we undertake this mapping we modify the digital elevation model for particular areas to assist us with mapping and the final mapping product uh looks like this uh until it takes into account all these data this particular area has six different wetland types that we mapped and we map those boundaries in 3d using our customized hardware and software when we use the visual cues so like what what are the different vegetation communities look like as well as the hydrologic use through the elevation model and then we describe those communities based on field data i 've got a little visual demonstration here of i guess to help you visualize what it is that we 're doing in the landscape so this is sort of a 3d flight so i 'll just exit out of this presentation and switch to switch to this one share that again can you just confirm you can see that yep that 's working cool panning in here you 've got these large sedge lands in orange which are surrounded by broadleaf paperback forest with the non-wetland vegetation in the hills so you can see it 's quite flat the landscapes in this particular area is very flat um so in the flat areas obviously with impeded drainage you have more of the wetland type so let us pause pause there maybe come back a little bit in the in the center of the screen here you have this pink which is a freshwater reedland with phragmites and also freshwater lagoon so you 're talking about open water um with floating macrophages keep that going so there 's quite a lot of broadleaf paper bark in this particular area which is shown in that dark blue with swamp mongodb along the more estrone creeks and this is sort of panning back south heading over cloudy bay where in this part of the landscape which has been subject to previous sand mining you have sort of these linear linear wetlands running perpendicular to the beach which are the old sort of june swales and the um the south of crowdy bay so the results of our the work that we did we mapped 13 different wetland types totaling nearly 9 000 hectares of wetlands and we had a number of variants within each of those which resulted in 51 unique mapping units the main types that we mapped were in terms of sheer abundance swamp forest was the most abundant followed by broadleaf paperback sedgelands wet heath grey mangrove and salt marsh which often occur in a sort of apache mosaic in the landscape and then swap mahogany swamp forest importantly 86 of all the wetlands we mapped are currently protected under state or federal law four of them are threatened ecological communities under the biodiversity conservation act two are also federally listed under the environment protection biodiversity conservation act salt marsh which is also a threatened community and mangrove are actually protected as well under the fisheries management act because they provide important breeding and foraging habitat for a variety of marine species and the remainder of the non-protected vegetation is actually protected within rowdy bay national park so the sort of the sedge lands ecological community so this is our an overview i guess of our wetland type mapping the final mapping was produced over seven maps at a 160 000 scale so that scale for each of these map sheets sort of 18 kilometers on the diagonal and the spatial data has obviously been provided to council which is at a much higher resolution so you can interrogate it you know the site or the property scale i guess some of the positive news from the wetlands that we assessed are the majority nearly 70 percent uh we 're in considered in good or excellent condition with limited disturbance 19 of those were in fair condition are in fair condition which is a moderate level of disturbance which might include weeds historical clearing and surrounding intensive land use and 12 were considered to be in poor or very poor condition with high levels of disturbance including weed invasion small patch sizes and intensive land use so a range of disturbances were observed during this study including extensive floodplain clearing and drainage works uh bank stability and erosion which are particularly evident in areas relevant to the photo that louise had up earlier uh former sand mining as i mentioned in crowley bay park as crowdy bay national park has affected the current sort of distribution and condition of wetlands uh fire obviously fire is a natural process but the fires that were experienced last year are well above that the work that we did in karate bay at the time was prior to these flyers it was very dry none of the none of the sedge lands which would usually be almost permanently wet you could walk all the way through them some of the more permanent freshwater lagoons at harrington were completely full which was good but obviously a fire pushed through and burned parts of that national park not once but twice um drought obviously most of the wetlands i said were dry at the time uh wheat and pesticide and pest invasion i guess is part of that good news is that most of these wetlands are in relatively good condition but there are some areas that need targeted weed and pest control and die back including suspected myrtle rust the mapping every um wetland type that we 've mapped comes with the profile that you can see here it includes the vegetation class and formation the name of the community obviously whether it 's projected under various pieces of legislation how much was mapped like a layman 's description of the community as well as characteristic species and other information to help people understand the various components of each wetland type so i guess some of the key management considerations and recommendations that came out of the work that we did prioritizing wetland conservation and active management 's important to improve condition um need to consider whether local planning controls are suitable to minimise future development impacts and areas surrounding wetlands or in wetland catchments um and revising wetland boundaries in the coastal set which i 've got to slide on in a minute um i guess with consideration of climate change understanding where wetlands currently occur and where they can potentially go in the face of changing sea levels when you have things like mangroves which grow on the on the estuarine edge of the environment and salt all this existing vegetation that sits behind those where are they going to go in the face of changing sea levels there 's obviously potential research opportunities into looking at dieback into key species as i mentioned broadleaf paperback and really i 'm trying to understand some of the groundwater dependence of these wetlands um i think the general acceptance is that all wetlands have proportional or are completely dependent on groundwater as part of their life cycle and really understanding for some of those perched wetlands in the in the catchment how reliant they might be on groundwater uh there 's potential i guess to nominate some of the non-threatened communities as threatened communities potentially and preparing and implementing wetland conservation strategy for the catchment so if we look at this map demonstrates the current 20 i think 2019 coastal set wetland in the blue hatching and the extent of our wetland type mapping is in the green so as you can see there while the while on the whole the coastal set mapping includes a lot of our wetlands there 's still about 30 of wetlands which aren with a few pictures some slides of what some of these different land types look like so we 've got freshwater wetlands which are sort of coastal coastal lagoons most of them that we mapped are naturally occurring but you do get these wetlands occurring as a result of farm dams that are in good condition etc uh broadleaf paper bark which is a really common wetland type this one has a very strong sort of two meter tall sedge component but as you can see with the paper park here it doesn 't actually have a lot of leaves on it so it lost a lot of its foliage as a result of dieback um the wet heaths if you haven 't had a chance to go and look at the wet heaths in crowded bay i 'd strongly recommend it they 're some of the most beautiful beautiful heath lands to look at this time of year when they 're in flower there 's different types of wet heath too this wet heat 's dominated by small banks here um and some acacias and other things so there wetland types uh the typical sort of grey mangrove and salt marsh complex that occurs in the estrogen environment there sedgeland so this sedgeland in grady bay had a pretty new growth of banksia coming up in it which i imagine is more of a sort of transitional thing based on the dry conditions that were being experienced uh smart mahogany forest which most of you would be familiar with is a key habitat for koalas regent honey eaters a range of other sort of botanic birds and plants and animals and then finally just sort of with the reedland and swamp oak forest in the background so yeah that 's it for me thanks very much for your time everybody if you 've got any questions i 'd love to help help answer them for you okay so we do have a couple of questions here um the first one being mud flats and sand flats while not vegetated wetlands could be useful to know their extent as their important habitats for shorebirds and other species is something that you would think about looking into um yes i guess they weren 't vegetated um but i think a lot of those would be included in the salt marsh mosaic so if they were very large areas that would have been excluded obviously those areas are very important for oratory birds curlews and the like um certainly something that could be thought about in the future i know the government has the state government has um important shorebird habitat mapping that 's available for people to interrogate but certainly something we could have a look into more in the future excellent thank you um there 's another question here are any of the other wetlands in this area identified as being wallam uh so some of the wet heath uh types wallam i guess while them is a broad name that 's uh all different sorts of names that people use for vegetation women 's a community that 's like a heathland community dominated by particular banks here though we definitely have women banksia and vegetation that you design as wollon particularly in cloudy bay whether it 's actually a wetland some of it is some of it isn 't people have done in the region that kind of suggest that wallen itself is groundwater dependent so um i guess that 's kind of one of the things in talking about understanding the groundwater dependence of different wetland types is important because things that might be i guess outside of an area that you might think is a wetland it might actually be drawing you know all of its water source from groundwater and it might be a bit difficult to see that just from walking around driving around or even from the air um thank you that was a great presentation seeing seeing that uh flyover mapping too is really interesting and really shows you the uh the range that we have in this area and the different types i guess when you 're just sort of out for a drive on a sunday or something you don 't really pick that up and and it 's interesting to see how it 's all mapped and how it 's all a bit different um in different areas that 's really important um and actually there was one other question endangered ecological communities um you want to talk about the euc that 's in this area um yeah so a swamp um forest is listed as a threatened ecological community so basically under the biodiversity conservation act at a state level all native vegetation remaining on coastal flood plains is a threatened community and whether it 's swan park forest swamp sclarful forest which is kind of the swamp mahogany broad leaf paper bark or freshwater wetlands or salt marsh they 're all collectively threatened and listed but there is a federal listing kind of the epvc act for swamp forest as well so it has that two layers of protection under the federal act i believe this sort of stricter criteria for what actually might be considered a threatened community based on condition and patch size because as you 're probably aware swan pike is one of those species that if you have a wet paddock and it has some seed in it it will regenerate freely like we often find swamp growing in places where it wouldn 't naturally occur so um i guess there 's the whole that you have at a particular site certainly some of the um some of the swamp forests that we went into is like magnificent remnant forest that had never been cleared really diverse but it can be sort of really simple a really simplified community that like colonises uh after disturbance uh so will is an associate professor in uh sorry associate professor will glamor is a principal research fellow at the water research laboratory school of civil and environmental engineering at the university of new south wales sydney will is a church hill fellow member of marina state expert knowledge panel chair of the tugboat expert panel and chair of the world association for waterborne transport uh will also leads the eco engineering research group and has been researching international environments for more than 20 years and he 's going to have a bit of a chat to us about the work that 's being done in the manning area okay so yes thanks everyone for hanging around on a uh on a wednesday night at 6 30 so i i will try to keep my my my storyline how we manage things so this is a story about where when and how we should do restoration in the manning particularly on these intertidal wetlands now that mark was just talking about but it 's a story that includes many many people and i 'm just the the front man for it so i wanted to make sure that everyone including council and lls staff have all been involved get the credit they deserve the the takeaway really is we had these environments that were pristine and and beautiful and and full of marine life and really everything that we desired them to be now but then we went through and we trained them and we put in thousands of thousands of kilometers of drain lines and now what we 're saying is some of that just hasn 't worked out well and the high priority sites we should be fixing and i have a large group of researchers that work with me and that 's what we do for a living so we go around and find these places work out how we 're going to fix them to design and do it but the big question is where should we restore we don 't have endless amount of money uh when should we restore it and how should we go about doing that and maybe even why why should we do it in the first place so just a little background on the mating we 've seen a few other things if you look at a elevation map of the manning you can see that everything in blue here is a little bit blurred out there but everything blue is uh nearly at sea level or below so huge amounts of the lower estuary are really already at low lying elevations and you can you can envision that when we didn 't have all these levees and flood mitigation structures in that they would have been really wet and probably hold a fair bit of water through the system and been productive wetlands what 's happened is we 've taken that landscape and drained it so all the yellow lines are flood mitigation drains or floodplain drainage schemes that were put in to try to as soon off but we want to get as much water off the paddock as fast as we can and we spent a long amount of time trying to maximize that drainage capacity so it 's been a huge change to the system in a relatively short period and it was done in a very systematic way so people laid out the landscape and here in the picture left is is oxy island they let up the landscape put grids over the top of it and said we 're going to dig ditches wherever we can and we 're going to formalize and structure these so that they all work as as efficiently as possible and there were federal funded schemes that paid for this and they go right back to the beginning of european settlement and then was really um had an injection of of funds throughout the 60s and 70s after the 50 floods so it was done on a big scale in a in a really concerted way using large machinery uh dynamites this is a picture of them dynamiting a creek system so they could open up one lots of large machinery and we went in and drained the landscape and we see that everywhere now you know you drive from um cairns down to melbourne you can see these large floodplain landscapes that are just filled with drains but only you know less than 100 years ago they didn 't look like that they simply had a lot more water on them and that water stayed there for a longer time and all that vegetation that might was talking about was a lot more prolific and the problem is that draining them has caused many many issues and so martin was talking about the lack of of vegetation or the health of the remaining vegetation and usually what 's left is the land that we didn 't think we could turn into a farm so it was a land that we couldn 't actually get a drain in or we thought if we get a drain in that soil wasn 't good enough for um the farming anyway and still we everything else has been drained and that has created big problems with acetoid soils to begin on top left of the big swamp area where you know acid subway soils this is the cover of the acids of its oil manual and tells us exactly what we shouldn 't be doing so by draining the landscape we 've oxidized the the sulfur in the land the naturally occurring sulfur and that 's created acid some of the worst acid conditions in in the country exist in the manning and every time it rains um there 's water in the landscape that gets pushed off the land or it from the groundwater into the drains and then from the drains into the creeks and we 've seen you know a really big decline in oyster production uh we 've seen lots of uh fish kills and we and it 's not just the manning it 's this five million hectares of this up and down the uh the coast of australia and this is a story that i was involved in back in 2013 and there 's other stories from the 70s and 80s and uh in only last month that really highlight the same issues going so this is a picture of the of the water on kedai creek and it 's not an unusual occurrence that but the water shouldn 't have clouds of aluminium and iron running through it we shouldn 't have large uh plumes of iron running off into the oyster leases and we realize now that we can fix that so i did my phd and how do we restore this back in the late 90s and ever since then we 've been working towards larger and better solutions to actually fix up the landscape and come up with solutions that can be implemented on big scale and you need to think in big scale because if you look at the lower manning you know acid sulfate soils is everywhere so the maps done in the late 90s uh really just said what 's the high probability of assets of its oils and the low probability and this was as much detail as we had so we knew that nearly the entire lower manning was filled with a high probability of acetoid soils and so where do you start how do best bang for your buck to fix and and really what do you do once you figure that out so there 's a big problem needs a big solution but we can 't fix everything at once so how do we move forward bit by bit um so this is the question that i have been wrestling with for a couple decades now where should be restored how should it be restored why should it be restored and and ideally when is the best time to restore it so which bit of the land should we pull away and actually turn back into tighter wetlands for the best benefit to everyone so we 've come up with a process that goes around and looks at the landscape and tries to understand of all the land you 've got which bit you should target first so what it does is it looks at the amount of water that flows in to the site even if it 's clean water we want to pick it up because that water then quickly becomes acidic how much drainage is across the site because the we 're going to be taking from the ground into the the creek water what sort of structures are there that go between the landscape you know the farmland and the creek line so there 's flood gates or culverts or weirs and how are they uh impacting water how acidic is the landscape what level is the acid and how well does it flow through the landscape because it 's not just about how low the ph is it 's how well it actually moves in the soil and then how far is that particular paddock away from something that we really prize so something that we think is a sensitive receiver and martin 's data is part of that so how far away from an oyster reef or some sort of salt marsh or mangroves that we particularly want to make sure that it won 't be impacted because once the water gets into the creek it 'll eventually make its way down there and then of course how much flushing does the ocean provide so this was brought up before how much back and forth and and because if you 're right at the mouth of the estuary you 're going to have a lot of dilution and a lot of buffering but if you 're way up the back of caddo creek you 're going to have very little and then finally and probably most importantly how does the land holder want to manage their land moving forward most of this land we 're talking about is under uh currently under farming practice uh it tends to be the most marginal of land it tends to be the land that has the lowest return because it is the lowest land that has the highest acid but we need to be able to work with the land holder to try to come up with a solution that 's beneficial to everybody and so we 've got this mix of what i was just saying is then put into this map and says you know the highest areas the highest concerns or areas with lots of drainage lots of water flow lots of acid the acid moves quickly the acids near the surface and it 's near something 've gone through this process in the manning in fact now we 've gone through it in most of the large flood plains in new south wales and we 've through really detailed analysis of the of the field site so getting on to the paddocks and taking measurements for months at a time we 've been able to develop up one of the highest priorities and so here 's a map for the manning of what the highest priorities are and it 's um you know the moto guinea guinea and big swamp areas they 're the biggest exporters of acid that are having the biggest impact in our estuary and then once we 've worked out where the biggest ones are we then zoom in to those sites and we look at within those sites how we 're going to fix them and i 've just put the pictures up on the right of people who 've been involved in doing all that field work and helping make these maps and so here zoomed in those two areas that i i put circles on before because what we highest priority areas and what 's been important for us in doing this work is we find that you know 80 percent of the problem is coming from 20 percent of the areas and in the manning it 's even it 's even more intense than that so if we can then target those really high priority areas we can then say that 's where the council should or the state government should spend their money it 's justifiable to spend that because that 's where you get the biggest return in water quality and also then that 's where we shouldn 't spend all the money so it 's saying you know spend money in the high priority areas and don 't waste spending your money on the low priority areas that aren 't going to get you returned historically you know i 've been doing this for a long time now historically what we were doing is working with the nicest land holders who were most willing to work with us and who were most willing to put their hand up but what we found is in many all of the uh the hard yard they 're already managing their paddocks really well so we 've been trying to target these areas and working with um midcoast council to say these are the areas you should look at and then coming up within those highest areas what should be done on those paddocks so we 've zoomed right into that area and this area here is a good example where the big swamp region has been attacked and we have tried to as best as possible fix up the worst case areas so i 'll give you some examples of that on this site we working with council local land services and fisheries went through the process of saying within the high priorities there are the highest priorities and we 're then going to target those areas um and that was a big project so the council ended up purchasing or acquiring now it 's probably nearly up to a thousand hectares of land in this region and working with them we designed a new landscape for the area that would get the best return for the actual moving forward because obviously we want the site to work really well but we rarely do we have the funds to keep working on it and building it so you 've got to build the best site you can with the most upfront money you can you can acquire so on this site we actually designed a new river channel to encourage the tidal waters to get into the area and because that 's most important because we knew that the tidal wars are going to buffer the acid so we built a a whole new river channel and we also filled in uh many kilometers of the drain lines that are there so this picture on the left is a drain line that was kilometers long where we filled it in use the the old material that was there to fill in that levy fill in that channel recreate the old natural flow paths that were there and then the picture on the right is is an example of the new river channel we made through the system and i 'll just give you some before and afters of it if you get the opportunity so um this is taken from the hill looking down towards crowding and this is before the site so the ph on that site it doesn 't look so bad right now but the ph on there is typically about 2.7 maybe three it 's really highly acidic the iron and aluminium are up to toxic levels so over 100 milligrams a liter before it looked like this afterwards it looked like this so we built a whole new drain line through here which allowed the farmer who was still running this land to have good drainage through there in the process of doing that we created a new levee bund that buns off this whole area out through here about a thousand hectares and then the river channel that we built runs all the way back up through here and that is encouraging the tidal water to get up in through here and wet this whole area but also neutralize the acid using bicarbonates uh here 's another picture of the site before and after so we have a camera up in a large acid skull that was there it was well nothing would grow on it you know it was completely acidic a hard pan and uh full of arsenic and heavy metals and then we went from that to a few years later relatively quickly this is uh less than five years later you know we 've got organic material growing on it we 've got uh plants establishing and we 've got water inundating it and neutralizing the acid another angle is taken from this is from a a gps drone that goes to the same spot takes a photo uh before and after so that 's an image showing the extent of the new creek line or river line that we built and how we let the tide into there so that 's during a high tide uh image and showing how the water can get up across the site so and we 're talking about a lot of water a thousand hectares covers a big area and here 's some examples of uh of before during the construction while we 're actually building it working on it and and these are a little bit old we 're still getting photos and the site has really evolved now to where we 're getting really strong salt marsh and and mangrove growth across it and uh hopefully fixing up a lot of the water quality the site was awarded a green globe award which is a big deal for us and that was between uh recognizing the efforts of council so people like dave hopper and bob mcdonald and tanya who have really taken the risk on a project of this size and uh been paid off i think at least and what we 've achieved the next question is though and we get us all the time is why why would you spend the money to do a project like this you know a lot of people would see the the environmental benefit but why else would you do it and i guess our our experience now has been taking the knowledge that we can do it and then going through what we call cost-benefit analysis of showing that the economic returns from doing so so we 've done and on acquisition of other sites in the region and which ones would be the best and purely just based on on return on that land without looking at the environmental uh returns or the carbon returns but purely just the productivity returns from that from restoring that land we get a seven to one net positive ratio and that 's assuming we have no benefit from the site at all for the first five years so there 's no return at all we just said let it take five years to restore and then calculate the benefits as we know that have been done and that project is available and encouraged if you 're interested to have a read of that led by alice harrison so we 're working on this economic returns as well as the engineering and then now we 've uh working with council and lls have brad henderson doing his phd on zooming out from that site and that area to the entire manning estuary and saying all right well we have an understanding of how water moves through the estuary what is the hydrodynamics and mangroves exist and mud flats and sand flats exist based on the hydrodynamics and so how much they get wet and how often they get wet and how deep they get wet then we want to predict where we think these landscapes ecosystems will exist into the future so brad 's doing his phd on first looking at uh where we think everything was this is we had these huge areas like moto and and guinea and kubernuk and the list goes on and on pelican area pelican bay that are all um going to be really challenging to farm in the future a really small amount of sea level rise is going to make it difficult to keep farming that land because it just won 't drain you know without the drainage capacity because the tides rising and it 's below sea level it won 't drain so at some point the land use won 't be as productive as it is and the productivity we get from other options is going to increase so brad 's looking at what those options would be and in his phd fast is changing where it 's changing when these things should be undertaken and having some sense of on an economic argument what is the best time and location to be doing and so that all comes together to have a whole plan for the manning that says this is what we think would exist this is where we think it exists and this is the management regime that we would recommend you doing uh hopefully that gets picked up by by council and others that would then drive the communication and the engagement and and the acquisitions and the working with the locals to get the best movement forward so it 's all about this idea of valuing the ecosystem services and the things that are provided uh the buzzword right now is called nature-based solutions so trying to reduce flooding by having uh you know wetlands there or mangroves there and versus having levees there by sequestering carbon in these landscapes which we know is does a better job of holding carbon than pretty much any other ecosystem in the world and and quantifying those benefits and then skulls as the alternative so brad 's work is going to be looking at this and how sea level rise will be impacting and changing with time if you look at these bottom pictures here you very quickly can see the extent that um water levels at two meters ahd which is what we 'd have by 2100 virtually will do for inundation of the whole lower manning i mean it is quite astonishing what 's going to be wet most of the time and so we 're really thinking through this process and trying to plan forward so we end up with a better outcome and i should just mention that all this work is being supported by monitoring there 's been a range of uh at least on the big swamp site about five years worth or six or seven now of however the site is evolving with time from water quality uh photo points drone surveys there 's been ongoing fish surveys and vegetation changes with time we 're learning a lot from this that we 're then applying not just here but across the whole whole so this was the big swamp site after immediately after it had been restored and you can see as we 're moving forward the vegetation as is this was only a few months ago is really coming in strong we 're getting great mangrove and salt marsh vegetation coming through and the whole site is just brimming so that 's really the my story to where when how why we should be doing this and trying to get that that combination that would um really tell an easy story for anyone that says why you should invest in this sort of work uh in the next 50 areas and then i just need to finish again with pointing out that i 'm really just telling the story of what many people have been doing both council lls and and staff working with me at the university so that 's all from me okay perfect uh so if you 've got any questions for real pop them down the bottom here um so the first question that we have for you will what proportion of acid runoff is generated from natural i assume john wants this very specific answer i would suggest that in the manning system we don 't really have natural landscapes in the estuary well very few natural landscapes in the estuary and so in terms of a total acidity discharge the the acid sulfide air would be much much bigger um you know if i had to put a number out there it 'd be 90 percent of what 's coming out the ph and the metals are just ridiculously high and through the roof and then also the drainage lines are are are taking that acid and discharging into the estuary where in natural landscapes you when they 're flat and you don 't have drain lines there 's no reason why the acid would be moving from where it 's produced into the creek uh and jillian 's asked you 've talked about prioritizing land areas with respect to water quality and cost-effectiveness should we also be prioritizing areas for greatest carbon capture yeah so so that 's a great question and we are we are doing that so i 've got a number of where we are trying to have a uh the right mosaic where you 're saying it 's not just for acid it 's also for carbon it 's also for birds it 's also for vegetation it 's also for getting you know limiting mosquitoes and you know and everything we want to get the most value we can but what we know is that any time we create a tidal wetland system we are inherently creating the best carbon capture system that nature has invented and and that 's largely because these salty systems don 't uh have uh methane release and so since they don 't have methane release unlike freshwater systems they have a significantly greater carbon storage capacity and i 've actually got a a couple of postdocs who do this full time and we 're really trying to get some numbers down the challenge is there is no carbon market yet so you can come with all numbers in the world and and but i am working on that one there 's a emission reduction fund system and we 're trying to actually get uh tidal wetlands into the emission reduction fund awesome thank you there was just one other question but martin i think this was actually for you um during your presentation um is it true that mangrove forests uh are a unique ecosystem yeah well i guess mangroves occur in that intertidal area that we was just talking about they occur on sort of estuarine muds in um you do have we 've got two mangrove species i think there might even be a third in the catchment that i didn 't manage to get a look at but you 've got grey mangrove and river mangrove which occurs further upstream um so it 's kind of at the tidal reaches of the airstream and they 're really the interface between the estuary and other environments so they occur on a different type of soil to what other communities do and they 're subject to much frequent inundation so they 're definitely a unique um a unique system excellent well we 're reaching our closing time very rapidly so i just want to say thank you to martin will and louise for system it 's so it is unique it 's so different to some other systems and uh such an important part of the midcoast area so it 's great to see so much research being undertaken we have so many different research and scientific monitoring programs happening and with the new catchment management program uh we 're really working hard to make sure that we 're protecting the manning into the future so thank you all for presenting i would like to say thank you to everybody who attended i know it 's a lot to attend um on a wednesday evening and give up your time we couldn 't do this without you so thank you so much for attending you _"

    "text": "[Music] hi my name is Nick Coleman I 'm the environmental projects officer at Mid Coast Council and today we 're going to be talking about video due to the nature of the Purdue to actually change the June formation to the detriment of native animals and plants beauty Bush in 1999 was classified as a key threatening process Peru first arrived in the early 1900s in the ship ballasts and it got established around in Newcastle around 1910 and it was an accidental way that came here accidentally when the sand mining happened along the coast and some destruction of our forests it was picked up in the 1940s 50s and 60s as a way to stabilize them as way to stabilize the dunes but it we quickly learned that it wasn 't a very good idea it turned out that beauty bush wasn 't very good for June stabilization because of the nature of its growth patterns very shallow rooted if it 's about a meter high you can pull it out by hand and where it grows attracts and to it so it gets going higher and a hummock which is could be about three meters high and on the side of the hammock there 's no beauty bush so where they 're out when the breeze from the ocean comes forward it hits the hummock and gets channeled to the side so and it forms a channel of erosion and that salt air will then go through behind the June and start damaging the vegetation behind the June ok this is a classic example of Peters hammock formation process so we have one hummock on this side another on that side in between the two you get the air the channel of wind coming in and that erodes the soil and kills the vegetation behind it now these hammocks will continually grow as they catch more and more sand so they can get very high which will make this channel even deeper and channel the wind even further into the bush land behind it this is an example of what happens when because of the changing nature of the capabilities of the video to change the nature of the June and create channels of wind erosion into the side and start to damage the Jason behind it which was never used to be exposed to salt usually the June formation is more natural and gradual but because the bureau changes that salt air gets through the trees behind it can 't cope and it 's very hard for them to come back with the bureau still in place due to the dominating nature of bitter native trees we 'll never be able to establish here again and you really want the native trees to establish because they form a unified front which stops the breeze starting from a very low level all the way up to a higher level and channels it up so then you get a more natural June formation which is uniform across let 's the breeze go start up like a like a ski ramp and then be underneath there 's a microclimate for rainforest trees to develop but with the beauty here the native trees can 't establish so the process is is to systematically get rid of these bitter trees it 's a process that takes many years but it the removal process is spraying in the b2 with a weakened down chemical solution it 's weakened down in the winter months because the native trees are more dormant and the bitter is flowering and seeding at this time so they 're more susceptible to a weakened poisoned dose we target spray each beauty bush it will die slowly over the course of a week the structure of the beauty will stay in place for a very long time it will die but the the root systems and the the sticks of the video will stay there and what will happen then is that the hammock nature of the video will start to become less pronounced so that will eventually subside a little bit which will allow the more the more uniform June to form and that means channels like we described earlier won 't be won 't be existence that will fill in and then you 'll have a uniformed spray with a salt spray and wind spray protection barrier we keep a couple alive and come back to them later when the natives have established once the Bitterroot in there and plant with acacia species Pigface species species that will naturally be on the side of the June they will they will they will recolonize where they once were the benefit of having the native species is that they 're more than more climatized to the gene system they have better root systems but more importantly they have different size structures a successful June is to start at a very small plant like a spinifex or a pig face and then gradually build up to a bigger plant Peter who doesn 't do any of that but a native a native the Native assemblage of plants will eventually do that and that will mean that there 's a long term stability to the June and also the native trees on the other side of the high in June and even on the crest of the June they 're they 're not a shallow rooted _"

    "text": "[Music] welcome everybody to this evening 's waterway encatchment record report card share the science event it 's so great to have you all with us thank you my name is erin masters and i 'm an environmental officer with water quality and education with midcoast council so we 're really here tonight to talk about our waterways uh the midcoast waterways are really one of the most important parts of our landscape they 're important to everybody that lives here and in fact they 're the reason why a lot of us choose to live here and healthy waterways are so important to us they keep our communities thriving um they 're important for our wildlife and for just everything that lives in this region and so to achieve the best outcomes that we can for our waterways we rely on a variety of research monitoring modeling and and local knowledge to help manage our waterways and keep them as healthy as possible and tonight we 're going to talk about a couple of different things so for those of you who have joined us for some of our our annual waterway and catchment report card this evening so this is an annual uh report card that we do each year and i 'll just quickly take you through some of the results from that um and then we 'll be talking about some of the different research that we 're undertaking in our waterways particularly as it pertains to oyster reefs so western reefs are an endangered community and there 's there 's i 'm not going to explain too much i 'm going to let the scientists explain it um but they really are important they 're an important part of our area and they 're under threat so tonight we 're going to talk about the ways that we 're protecting those oyster reefs that are left and also helping to re-establish reefs where they have been lost um so just we 've got scientists joining us tonight from the department of primary industries fisheries and then also from local land services and the university of newcastle so i 'll introduce them all in just a moment but for the moment i 'm just going to little bit about the report card so this is our annual waterway and catchment report card and the way that this works is that annually we have scientists from the department of planning industry and environment come and visit our estuaries and undertake monitoring in our in our waterways and what they 're looking for is a couple of different ecological health indicators so they 're looking at the turbidity uh in our waterways and then also chlorophyll a which is a an indicator of algae present in the waterways and lastly we do seagrass monitoring as well so at the top here you can see areas that have a high conservation value have a very low turbidity few um algae present in the water and then also really healthy seagrasses which are home to a lot of different uh wildlife in a moderately disturbed catchment in the middle here you can see the turbidity gets a little bit worse and we have more alky present you can also see that our seagrasses aren 't looking quite so good and then in a heavily impacted environment turbidity is really high so that 's what we 're looking for when we actually undertake the report card monitoring now for everybody that lives in the mid coast they will know that 2019 and 20 was a very very difficult year uh we 've come out of extended drought period well and actually we were still in the extended drought period when we started sampling and then we also had extreme bushfires throughout a lot of our catchments followed by flooding rains so just on our screen here you can see that the 20 and 1920 while we didn 't have we had slightly higher than average rainfall what you can actually see is that nearly all of that rainfall fell in february and that 's you know much higher than our long-term averages in those periods so this is our sampling periods and you can see that we had um two or three sampling periods really in the orange lines that were in drought conditions we also had these two that were in fire conditions then we had a little bit of rain in january followed by a lot of flooding rain rain conditions as well so that really impacted the results this year they were impacted first of all by the drought conditions and the bushfire and the flood the other thing that that really impacted the results was the type of estuary that we 're actually looking for whether it was a river or a lake estuary because they actually respond slightly differently so you can see under rainfall conditions this is our river estuary over this side um really low flow small inputs and low algal levels and similar sort of thing happening in our lake even though it has a longer residence time which is just the amount of time that the water stays in the system under moderate rainfall though which is what happened in january we found that we had increased inputs particularly in january obviously those inputs included fire debris and also because of the extended drought period there wasn 't a lot of ground coverage so it allowed for more nutrients and sediment to get into the water and so you have those increased inputs you have increased turbidity and then also high algal what was really interesting this year and did affect the results is the way that those two different types of systems responded to high rainfall levels so when we had those flooding conditions in february our river estuaries had increased inputs but low algae levels because the flood conditions were were running through the system so quickly that there was no conditions for those algae to grow they were washed out into the ocean beforehand however in a lake system because of the resonance time the amount of time that that material stays in the system we still have those high algal levels and so you can see these differences between our wallace lake results compared to say our mending river results so here 's our report card for this year the results are a to f much like a school report card so a is obviously quite a healthy waterway b getting a little bit less and then right through to f now thankfully we don 't have any f 's in our systems the lowest that we do have is c and because of the increased conditions that different water quality issues we did find that half of our sites dropped a level uh level this year so um they they went from either a b to a c or an a to a b and then we had nine sites that also remained the same as last year so just quickly just because we 're going to be talking about the wallace system tonight i 'll just quickly take you over the wallace conditions um so we had uh three c 's and three b 's in wallace lake this year all of them except for one dropped a grade and that was the midway lambo estuary interestingly charlotte bay which has always been an a did drop to a b this year which shows that there was those increased inputs into the system and it just had those perfect algae conditions the water was hotter because of the drought conditions and then we had that runoff as well well amber cove and columbu look estuary were both driven by algae which shows that there 's input from those catchments piper 's creek drops from excellent to 's more of a return to normal for piper 's creek it it has a lot of input from a large suburban area and so we find that that that heavily urbanized catchment does have a bit of an effect and wallace lake dropped from excellent to good condition as well this year so if you would like more information on the report card or would like to see the results from any other catchment all you have to do is visit our website uh just go to the midcoast website and type in report card and that will take you to not only the results but a full technical report and the raw data is all on that side as well but now we 're going to talk a little bit more about what we 're doing in our estuaries to help work with these so once we get these results they 're not just results for us we actually use them to plan our management actions and undertake new works so what we 're going to do is ask some of our scientists to join us now so this evening they 're both from dpi fisheries charlotte jenkins is based on the far north coast of new south wales and has worked with fisheries for 15 years during this time she has primarily worked on the delivery of a broad range of fish habitat restoration and conservation projects and she is currently the fisheries manager in the new south wales oyster reef restoration team and dr vikki cole is also a scientist for the new south wales oyster reef restoration team at fisheries and is based in the port stephens fisheries institute so i 'll pass over and let these lovely ladies talk to you about moisture we 'll just start with some oyster reef basics and help provide some context for our talks today so young shellfish have an active tendency to form aggregates they like to stick together you just move on to the next slide thanks vicky um and over time they can actually build a dense multi-laid structure and this can be made up of living and also dead shell new south wales we oysters love each other they they tend to aggregate and patch of um oyster aggregation is important so we 're classing everything that 's greater than five square meters um or more than two shells thick um as an oyster if anything thinner than that yeah with you know it 's more of a oyster veneer um now the reef could be one continuous unit or it could be a mosaic of patches that 's interspersed with other habitats such as seagrass beds um sand or sediment and in new south wales we 've got several reforming species um but sydney rock oysters are the predominant intertidal reforming species in new south wales we 've also got other um shellfish species too such as mussels we also get different types of oyster reefs and oyster beds here 's a couple of examples so we can get these low profile beds um where we have a lot of clumping oysters or these very high profile complex beds um it 's an example of a low profile bed but a different type of species some people might not have seen this one this is actually leaf oysters um and then we also are a small little little critter but when we when we have them in these large dense aggregations they actually can make a really big impact and they provide a wealth of really important ecosystem services to coastal communities in new south wales so oyster reefs can attenuate wave energy and protect shorelines from erosion and in doing so can enhance the resilience of coastal communities to climate change and along that same thread they can also contribute to carbon sequestration so store carbon in their shells and also locking away organic carbon um in their pseudo feces so oysters are bivalves that means they 're natural filter feeders and they pump large volumes of water through their bodies and they capture tiny microscopic plankton on their cilia in doing this they also remove other particles from the water column helping improve water clarity so there 's one study that showed a single wild oyster can actually filter two liters of water an hour um so just imagine what a dense aggregation of oysters can do it 's quite phenomenal significantly these reefs also provide structure that serves as both a reef supported over 300 different marine animal species so that 's that 's pretty significant numbers there and this also included recreational and commercially important fish species and so where are these mythical super habitats well historical accounts um and harvest records actually indicate a really impressive pre-colonial abundance of oyster reefs across many new south wales estuaries here 's just one quote from one early european explorer where he said they were astronomical quality of seed oysters stretching for miles um we can delve deep into historical archives and study historical maps and place names can also help us build a picture of places that were perhaps once bountiful in shellfish so place names such as oyster harbour oyster point oyster creek and here in the manning on an 1840s map there was an oyster reach what happened where where have our oyster reefs go on well sadly much of these colossal shellfish beds were actually lost um very early on um in european arrival so there was a lot of destructive over-harvesting for food but also for lime for construction and there 's an image there of and the oysters in shelley mortar so historical sites in sydney have a lot of oyster shell embedded in them and this process was done often by a dredging so they removed all sizes of oysters alive and dead indiscriminate removal and also the hard substrate was removed too and that that 's critical really for the the future of of the oyster reefs as the population swelled and expanded then catchment clearing occurred um and this led to erosion and sedimentation and a smothering of a lot of estuarine habitats including oyster reefs so these impacts and stresses coupled with likely introduction of new or more virulent strains of pathogens things such as mudworm which decimated reefs in the late 1800s really led to the complete eradication of subtidal oyster reefs and a drastic reduction in intertidal oyster reef habitat the loss of shellfish ecosystems is widely recognized as one of the key drivers in the long-term degradation of coastal waterways and it 's not just an issue in new south wales so this losses occurred across australia in fact 99 of oyster reefs in australia are estimated to reefs in our systems but they may be in such low abundance they 're not providing those same functions i talked about earlier that they once did but also globally oyster reefs are heavily impacted and they 're actually estimated to be one of the most threatened marine ecosystems but not many people know about it so a lot of people know about coral reefs and the health of the the great barrier reef um but shellfish reefs were lost so long ago um and very early on in you know documented forms um of records that um people believe that something called generational amnesia has occurred so the loss of the ecosystem occurred so long ago it 's actually outside of living memory so what 's being done about it well um the restoration of these habitats has been gaining momentum globally um and the usa has certainly been leading the charge in this area and for the last uh two decades they 've been doing a lot of work in this space but large-scale projects are starting to get underway in australia now which is great um and such as sterile shells so it could be oyster shells or other shellfish limestone or other types of rocks and in some cases overseas they 've used concrete and prefabricated structures as well so this substrate provides a suitable surface for young juvenile oysters or spat to settle on and this forms the foundation of a reef and serves to elevate the developing reef out of the sediment um so this new substrate is often placed in an area where there 's known good levels of natural spat fall so the reef can regenerate naturally um however in some cases where oysters have been so heavily decimated there often isn 't a natural recruitment anymore in the system and in this scenario then a hatchery red spat is introduced to the new reef substructure and these images here are from the port phillip bay restoration site and they had to do just that they had to use hatchery red spat so over time in the right conditions a self-sustaining complex ecosystem forms um why why do restoration um as we learn more about the value of oyster reef habitat and more and more the significance of the loss of this habitat um we can um obviously see the benefits of restoring these type of habitats to our systems like aaron was saying you know some of our systems are heavily impacted and oyster reefs have been shown to have a benefit um in areas where oysters can still survive so there 's um shown to enhance biodiversity one study as an example showed that there was a 212 percent increase in fish and invertebrate biomass from a reef restoration project and compared to a mud bottom so mud bottom still provides habitat but the reef was providing more more structure and there was a greater biomass there increases in estuary productivity it can provide a conduit for waste product management um and that 's the shell from oyster aquaculture produced in the same system that can be put back into that system and used as a one of those substrates for recruitment and we also get really great positive community engagement from from these kind of projects and really help foster stewardship in the local community for um doing something into enhanced recreational tourism opportunities and can provide really big boosts to regional economies um one estimate for a project off kangaroo island for example put the economic value um just from fishing tourism alone uh from a reef restoration project at 1.7 million per annum um so pretty significant numbers and that that 's just from fishing tourism so there 's lots of other benefits too so what 's happening in new south wales well um in late 2018 the new south wales government released a new marine estate management strategy and this is to guide protection and improvements across the marine estate so all the coastal lakes and estuaries lagoons um and this was built on what 's called a tara threat and risk risk assessment that identified key threats in the marine estates and set about a series of actions as to how to address those threats the tara had a huge amount of community and stakeholder input into it um and oyster restoration was selected as an important on-ground action under the key goal to improve water quality and so really important feature and quite unique on expertise from management and also science um so there 's a number of activities going on underneath the project so really great part um is trying to address that generational amnesia i mentioned earlier and really starting to try and share the story of oyster reefs and how important they are um to our estuaries and um and their loss and how you know we can we can restore them in in certain areas and so we 've produced a range of um education community communication products um they 're all on our website if you uh will provide that web address at the end we 've done a lot of direct stakeholder engagement and really some areas of social science with our key stakeholders so early on in the project we worked with the aquaculture industry and had a targeted survey um for them and really that was a way to um try and find out how much they knew about oyster reefs about oyster reef restoration about any beds and reefs that still exist in their local estuaries and also as a way to provide an avenue restoration to be raised so we had a really great participant rate there um we 've got a similar one open at the moment for recreational fishers we 've been starting engagement with the aboriginal community unfortunately that has been put on hold largely because of covid and we 're also really making sure that we engage well and uh liaison communicate and collaborate with our peers there 's a lot of work going on in shellfish reef restoration space at the moment and so there 's really great opportunities to learn from each other from practitioners and scientists of course um and community presentations such as this so we 're also really said paving the way really so trying to um set up products and information that others can do oyster reef restoration into the future so um the desire to do is really gaining momentum with community groups local councils and other government departments um so we 've we 've drafted and soon to be released how to um oyster reef restoration in new south wales and this is addressing a lot of the planning and um regulatory to do a project such as this um and providing advice for funding and then developing advice for local councils with with uh coastal management programs um we are also doing a lot of work internally so oyster reefs um you know it 's very much a buzzword at the moment um but it it is has been overlooked up till now in our current legislation so we 're working internally to get them recognized as a key fish habitat under our policies and working and liaising with our marine park staff and also aquaculture management um and lots of discussions going on about the the management of them currently in our systems and and future and how they interact with different activities that are going on in our contemporary estuaries so one thing with we 're doing um at the moment and what i was actually doing today out on the bellinger kalang river um is mapping mapping remnant reefs and so before we move forward with shellfish re-frustration in new south wales we really need to get a better understanding of what 's still there because there are and so we 're doing this through a six-step process that you can see here on the slide um and step one was for us to define the characteristics of a reef in new south wales you know we really didn 't want to um go and collect information about every single clump of oysters we came across so setting that um yeah setting that definition was really key and that 's what i provided you with at the very start um we worked with our gis team to create a geodatabase of information and in this is aerial and satellite imagery fed into that and then this is where the historical and local stakeholder information can be fed in um and part of this we 've also developed a online citizen science opportunity so there 's a shellfish reef reporter it 's a tool online and anyone can go on and drop a virtual pin on a map to identify a shellfish wreath in their local estuaries so if anyone knows of any plea please go and find that and drop them in and help us create this database in the field like our colleague there in the top there that 's jill she 's on the south coast we go out in the film we verify and collect information that then gets rechecked back in the office and we compile a map for each estuary and um create a shellfish reef map and they look something like this so this um a south coast estuary this is walgonga inlet and you can see the different colors there that 's different um types of reef that have been mapped so there 's some high profile ones there in wagonga a couple of low profile um looks like jill recorded some clumping oysters too and the beauty of having um the map digitally means we can then really um use this tool for future projects and planning and we can overlay that information with other um map layers that are available so wagonga is within a marine park so we can overlay the marine park zone map um also on here we 've got oyster um aquaculture areas that are active at the moment um and then we 've also can overlay any information we 've got digitally as a map so it could be um bathymetries that 's important for our oysters um we could more logistical things such as um any conflicts like boating and shipping lanes that can be added in um any impacts that are known such as acid sulfate style hot spots so really is a great tool for future um planning of restoration projects um so we 're this is underway at the moment we 've currently um done the field validation of 14 estuaries they 're complete and we 're still working on others the midcoast council region um is planned primarily for early 2021 so we are getting there um and the completed maps will be available online um or you know send us an email we can provide them to you once once we 've had them all verified and we 've developed a mapping video to show just how we 're going through that process if you 're interested that 's on youtube and so finally i 'll i 'll finish off on one of our really our biggest achievements restoration project in port stevens and i must highlight that our colleague kirk dally was responsible for the successful delivery of these works um so like many new south wales estuaries the poor the um the lack of suitable substrate is thought to be the significant limiting limiting factor in the natural regeneration of oyster reef um so this site was chosen as the as the pilot so the works for time to be placed at the peak settlement period for native sydney rock oysters um to try and maximize their recruitment above other encrusting species last thing we wanted was to try and uh set up a sydney rock oyster reef and have it encrusted with pacifics or or another species and so that period is january to march um and so two restoration locations were chosen you can see here on the map down the bottom we 've got the mile site at the um eastern side of the port it 's very marine influenced and um it was built on a large intertidal sand flat area there and then the crew are the other pin there on lot more estuarine it has more fine mud and sediment and poorer water quality and also significantly about this site also has a large abundance of abandoned oyster lease lease infrastructure um so public consultation with organizing started in late 2018 to assist with project development and approval and license application because even though a government department we still need licensing and approvals to do this kind of work so that was all lodged um as well and we really were testing new new uh ground here it was new crown lands legislation we we were working under um oyster restoration was viewed as a new type of of on-ground works um so as you can imagine there were many uh wrinkles for kirk to iron out and certainly tested the patience of the port stevens team um but really really um proud to say the project has been successful um so this is these are just a couple more images on the left there you 've got the the mile um barge loading site at the top and that 's the barge being loaded up there um and then with the with the rock and the restoration treatment was simply to provide a suitable oyster sediment substrate so here the rock local quarried rock was used um and also oyster shell that had been collected by oyster farmers in the port for 12 months per for the whole 12 months leading up to the project um the construction took 75 days and in total uh 3 300 tons of rock and 180 cubic meters of oyster shell was used and that created just over one hectare of oyster reef base in total so that was a third at the mile site there on the left you can see some of the finished uh reef structures and two-thirds at the kuruwa site um and it is interspersed amongst the aquaculture legacy infrastructure there so one year of pre-monitoring was conducted in the port and now the post monitoring is underway um and so on that note and sorry for the technical glitches at the start i will hand over to our team scientist vicki cole and she 's going to explain the science behind reef restoration so research started off and also to understand the ecological variability in remnant oysters we do a small pilot study to see if locally sourced rock or clean gel was better for oyster recruitment but i guess the main part of the work is to excrementally test if oyster frustration is successful roman oyster reefs in the bay are generally either small natural ways or historical rock leases like in this video our research focused on the ecological benefits of oysters through pre and post construction monitoring of natural sediment of oysters invertebrates and fish in the west basin we tested augmentation of an old broccolis which is to fill the spaces part of our situation works old broccoli um was making up approximately 6 000 square meters i 'm going to focus on the results of the mile site where we tested the construction of the new oyster eve so the site was predominantly sand with existing oysters only about 100 square meters this is how we hypothesize the results of our new study so what oyster restoration should look like if it 's successful we start off with the pre sampling in oystery frustration sites i 'm sorry reference site and their sediment control sites we 're currently in the rest duration um like the post restoration stage and we 're looking to see if the monitoring will show us how long it will take us the restoration site to increase and become similar to the natural oyster rigs this plot here shows the of oysters and the vertebrates they were assembled in the reference oyster size and the cinnamon sides and the sides that were going to be restored so basically shapes that are close together represent samples that are more similar every year we observe more than 40 species of invertebrates mostly models such as gastros barbells crustaceans including crabs and amphipods and worms such as pollock keys clearly assemblages in the oyster reef reference sides which are in the light blue are very different from their control cinnamon sides red and their pre-restoration site in dark blue one example was the snail then by sim over item that although the abundance varied over time you can see they were exclusively on oyster reefs we also sampled fishes those were weighted frame that was baited with cultures previous research has shown many brands to be successful for sampling fishes in enchilada and complex habitat we identified more than 55 species of fish with the bremen glassfish bloomies gobies rays and whitening being the most abundant oyster site had many more species than the sand and this is pretty consistent throughout the year earlier this year the restoration work was completed as child explained combined between the kura and mile size the area of the new roof footprint was one hectare and this was nearly doubled with twice the area or streets at the sites so it 's been approximately nine months since the on-ground works were completed there has been considerable natural equipment of sydney morocco 's and some are already quite large we have conservatively estimated that there are more than 50 million oysters naturally recruited to the rocking shell the goal is the sizes with baby voices shown in this top panel to grow up and become like an established oyster as shown in the bottom panel many fish including brim showed a rapid response to the on-ground very few in the control side but with the addition of rock rocking shell brim numbers increased a lazy sea and by march the restoration that has similar average abundance to those detected in the oyster reefs we also do some experiments comparing filtration by established oyster reefs in situ compared to new restoration style control chambers were placed over a bare sand is subjected from the estimates of filtration by reefs to account for any settling particles this graph here shows per chamber the filtration rate by baby oysters on the restored wave compared to the established reef conceived that after a very short time the babies on the new reef were already filtering quite a lot which calculated to be over 400 000 liters of water per hour so just to summarize the main results of our semi resembled eight sites twice the season for the year at the korea and mile size we found oyster bees support more than 40 species of bed beds and more than 55 species of fish and then the nine-month students restoration work began on the one point on the one hit moisturize more than 50 million oysters have recruited and these babies are already filtering more than 400 liters of water per hour and they 're supporting um lots of habitat for many fish and invertebrates which will only increase over time so in addition to dpi 's monitoring work of the porsche main riffs we 're also involved in a number of collaborations on oyster refrigeration we 're working with the university of newcastle to create a novel method of sampling fish in oysters with environmental dna from samples of water and comparing them to brows we 're also working with macquarie university um we were trying new method um using biodegradable oysters structures made from potato starch these trials will be done in port siemens poi hacking and bermude up now we 're also working with san cross university on the species of oysters that very little is known about called the lifostyle what 's really interesting is it lives in areas that many native voices don 't do very well and finally we 're involved in a large collaborative project that looks at what factors influence the types shape of oysters should be really important for future restoration thank you everyone for more information you can read about our work on the men 's website or contact charlie or myself excellent thank you so much charlotte and vicki really great presentation some really interesting stuff going on in in that area i think that probably there 's very few people that that have any knowledge of oyster reefs or just how important they are and and we 've lost so many so it 's really great to see so much uh interesting work happening trying to to bring these guys back and rehabilitate those oyster reefs vicky that that information about um what 's happening down in the mile site is is really interesting and to see see what 's happening and see how those those different the results of the different research and what it 's bringing back and and that it 's not just um restoring the reefs that we 're actually researching what 's working what 's not working and those sorts of things um that 's i think so important because moving forward you um so is there any other places in the mid coast that this sort of um brian and troy are going to talk later about the lamba but um is it just sort of in the mile uh area or is there any further up or are you focusing on any other areas or just using this as a trial site yes so paul siemens was the first site in new south wales um so we did the one of the crew and the one in maya and they 're pretty much all there is sitting very small projects they 've looked at i guess bank a single bank or something quite small like that yep um yeah it 's quite quite new and i guess yeah what 's brian 's working on is also p knee so yeah well and that 's great because that 's as we said that 's that research side of things that 's that 's you know starting small and researching and finding out more and then bringing in more trial sites and those sorts of things so that 's that 's fantastic that on yeah so it 's exciting we get to choose the first one um yeah looking forward to new sites in your future yeah that 's kind of up to charlie and jill and all the way they do to decide where it 'll be some of those videos that you played earlier um just asking if they 're accessible to everyone or if you have a web page that has all this information or is this something that you 're just presenting um tonight and and not something that we can can access there 's a number of videos on our project um webpage i 'll type the address into the um into the chat in a second and it was it was on the end of our slide so yeah there 's a there 's a few videos on there that you can have a look at there 's there 's one of the construction one um yeah and we 're constantly uploading new materials so to have a look on on that project web web page so thank you again charlotte and victoria we 're really uh back in a few moments all right so we 're going to pass across to our next presenters and we have uh with us brian hughes who is an estuary and marine officer with 14 years experience that works with lls brian 's a bit of a local legend and definitely an expert on the region um he 's undertaking all sorts of works uh through the mid coast area he he works on different education projects and then also on groundworks which is what he 's going to be talking about tonight so we thank him for joining us and then we also have associate professor troy gaston who is an estrogen ecologist at the university of newcastle they spent the last time nine years investigating estuarine function and productivity troy works with local councils state government like lls uh industry and community groups to increase our understanding of how estuaries work and his team the marine and coastal science team at the university have a long history with lawrence lake and and they have a few different projects underway at the moment so um i 'm going to 're going to chat to us about the projects that are happening in the woodland river um yeah thanks for the introduction um erin um and yeah it has been a really um exciting project for us um and been great to see all the work that dpi fisheries have been doing down in port stevens so really lucky to have that in our hunter lls region lots of work happening and um obviously working in the port stevens great lakes marine park down there so that 's um really fantastic to see um and really great collaboration with the oyster industry and um so my opening slide just shows yeah where our initial work happened at gariba island um which is in the willamba river in wallace lake and yeah it 's um i 'll just firstly just a little bit of background why why do oyster reef frustration in wallace lake in particular well um charlie and talked about the loss of oyster race across australia and the world but um in wallace lake in particular you know our seafood industry so oyster farmers and fishermen are needing the market wants in terms of oysters for consumption so there 's been a change from the older stick oysters um to single seed oysters we 've seen lots of changes in the catchment as aaron spoke about we 've had um the training of the entrance with walls which has changed the tidal regime of the estuary lots of changes to land use we 're seeing changes to the climate so rainfall patterns and the amount of rainfall we 're getting and temperatures increasing etc and all those things affect habitat fish stocks and um you know oyster production tends to suffer when we do have high rainfall periods um and so in response to that um oyster farmers in particular have tried to adapt and change their cultivation techniques and the kind of infrastructure they 're using but fishermen especially commercial fishermen really value some of that older type of infrastructure which the oyster farmers are moving away from there 's really good habitat so one of the things we thought and i guess we 're testing out is that oyster reefs and um construction of those might changes in habitat as the infrastructure changes so um this is a really good example of um the two main seafood industries working together that um on the left is danny elliot he 's a local um commercial fisherman and on the right it 's anthony saka he 's a like oyster farmer and they 've both been very active in a whole range of environmental projects and and here they 're filling up a uh koia bag for our restoration project we have actually tended not to use the bags so much um but this was early on and um you know we 've had a lot of discussions with the two industries about how they can i guess co-adapt to some of the changes that are taking place um yeah we 've worked with troy 's team to try and understand how i 'll just go back you can kind of see in the background behind anthony there 's a big pile of um sticks uh treated sticks and that 's one of the things that has been changing in wallace lake and um and the rest of they 're tending to use different gear now sometimes you know getting spat from hatchery or they 're catching spat on slats rather than the old coated sticks and then um those what we call single seed oysters go out in different kinds of gear and here you can see some some tumblers and that 's tim smith who is with james cook uni now but previously worked with troy and um heading out to do some sampling of the kind of fish and invertebrates that are found around this type of gear as opposed to some of the old stick infrastructure so um in wallace lake there this is a basically shows the lower end of the lambor river you can see a little channel on the left is what we call the cut and there are some um historical records that or from a local bit of a tree like legend vic bramble that aboriginal people used to come across from the left where there 's a tip of minimal across to um right across to tonkari where you can see those houses on the right there um like we do have a fair bit of um remnant oyster reef some of this is probably natural but then there 's also some structures that are related to previous forms of cultivation so this is a point road tongue curry you can see some newer gear there i think there 's slats catching spat there but in this area here you 've got um these shell beds and that um a long time ago that was how they actually cultivated the oysters they said it was back-breaking work um they basically create an intertidal habitat using um sand and cabbage tree palms and then spread um the oysters on top of that structure and they would rake them regularly to get good shape um and when they stop doing that some of these areas they dredged but other areas they left behind and they 've um had more baby oysters come and settle on them and and they 've actually become oyster reefs at in the way that um charlie described earlier um we also have similar structures to what um was shown in vicky 's talk where we there were old um rack and rail of um the stick cultivation where that stuff 's degraded but it 's had lots of oysters catch on it so we have that in wallace lake too and this is just a photo of over near wallace island um where we have some of these um kind of structures uh and this is a yeah a close-up view that 's anthony saka there on on one of his leases where you 've still got this shell bed and you can say um in addition to the oysters which have a very healthy growing edge on them there you 've got mussels and i can tell you there 's lots of other things some happily growing um in amongst there some of the snails that vicky mentioned and um algae and right next door to that you 'd see some of that sea grass so his very healthy ecosystem within a commercial oyster leaf um the goriba site that we worked on um is shown here in the willamba river um right on the tip of guerrero island the upstream end um i where you can see all these posts um there 's some queer logs which are just remaining at that point um but they um had also planted some mangroves behind about one per meter which you can see and um you know it 's actively eroding site and i 'm really concerned about um the loss of the coil logs and those mangroves that they planted being washed out again so we decided to do something new and that was to add some oysters um fairly thickly on the bank so again similar to port stevens we were using um oysters that would otherwise have just been discarded so we 're reusing those from within wallace lake and i 'm placing those around the mangroves without um damaging the mangroves trying to hold that bank together in the bed and letting those mangroves continue to grow and eventually what we 're hoping is we 'll have a the oyster voices will catch more spat and they will form a wreath and the mangroves will continue to grow and we 'll get a stable stable bank so this is from the to work things out you can see we have these one cubic meter bins of oyster shell we 're placing that oyster shell in between the mangroves and yet building that up against the bank um and this is um just looking upstream on gariba island you can see um the mangrove is poking out of the oyster shell and um you can see that we 've put those oysters fairly thickly right up to the almost the top of the bank there um and those oysters are holding pretty well um they have been moved around this was about 18 months ago when we first started doing the work and but one of my theories is that if we can at least stabilize the bed so the oysters get firmly placed into the bed that will stop the bed eroding and the mangroves will continue to grow we have been impacted by the fires there we lost a few mangroves as the fire swept over from minima across um the island but generally we were pretty pretty well spared there um so and then we also had a minor yeah the site 's fared pretty well since then um so this is a photo following that in this situation we actually have a lot of natural recruitment of mangroves you can see they 're pretty close together we actually placed the oysters in front of those mangroves but there was there is a lot of boat activity in this part of the river and all that boat wash actually washed all those oysters even closer to the bank so actually helped us out which was an interesting um observation um so we now have a um permit from fisheries to do some more of this kind of work um and so this was the original site up at the top of goriba and we 're going right down um the channel here um down from gariba island down to chapman 's island and along um east foreshore here at chapman 's road so yeah we 've started doing some work there but we 've had to change tack a little bit so we we 're just using the seed oysters um so we don 't have any ices with _''_3342.48 get the volume of voices to do significant reaches of the river so we 've just shifted to using less oysters as you can see here not right to the top of the bank but trying to get that wave protection by using what we 're calling timber fillets some of you may have seen rock fillets before that protect the tile of the bank so we 're trying to use some more natural materials um to achieve a similar outcome and we 've started that process a few months ago and i 'm trying um steam is is monitoring that as well as the original site at cariba so i 'll just show you a few photos of that this is one of the oyster farm farmer laborers um hayden on a site you can see um we 've virtually well we haven 't_''_3393.92 disturbed the the bank or any of the vegetation at all um all the mangroves whatever mangroves have survived in the erosion they 're still there and we are hoping to to plant some more if need be but we 're also monitoring you know about 20 meters in between where the mangroves are you know reasonably healthy like um on the left there and that 's um that photo shows darren coombs who 's been really one of the oyster farmers but he also does some other work um and really good with an excavator and those sorts of things so he 's been really valuable in in this trying this new technique um some of those bags i mentioned before we 're sort of using to complement these structures um sort of blocking up well putting them at the ends to rent some of those erosive waves coming in and eroding the bank we have had some breaches of the rock fillet so we 've added a few bags in there which will hopefully help speed up the mangrove recruitment in those areas and possibly some oyster reformation behind the rock village and yeah that 's a pretty much an overview of what we 've been doing um troy will talk now and then i 've got one more slide after he finishes so thank you brian so all these projects are just the best way to tackle these issues which we have throughout our estuaries so brian 's alluded to the project that 's going on and we 've come in to work with brian and his team uh to try and understand um how these systems are are they recovering are we having an effect uh because as aaron mentioned previously one of my work is about and the group that i work with is how do we best target our one ground action so we can get the best bang for our buck with repairing our systems so we 've already had a brief background to uh oyster reefs what they can do what they used to do what we want them to do again brian 's just given a great background to this project so i 'm just going to talk about uh what it is we 've done and some of the preliminary monitoring data some of that science uh that we actually need to to know what we 're doing uh is it the best thing that we 're doing on ground brian 's just alluded to bank stabilization issue what can we add to that to get these healthy ecosystems because we 've got concern over for sure erosion this loss of natural habitat the oysters we 've lost was at 85 percent up to 85 globally we 've got lots of stresses going on in our waterways we want to keep using them so what can we do uh to help these systems repair is there a natural alternative and brian 's just talked about some of these natural uh materials that we can use to help the ecosystem along with its repair so i 've had the coil logs were used they had limited uh success so we 're going to use oyster shells wallace lake has got the industry to do this although we 're probably going to have um not enough oyster shells if we 're building oyster reefs uh in port stephens and other areas of the coast we want to use a foreshore stabilization maybe this is a push by the oyster industry for us to eat a whole lot more oysters because we need more oyster shells we 've 's projects how oyster reefs can improve water quality they do reduce erosion we can improve local biodiversity we can increase fishing productivity we can get healthy ecosystems back by getting these habitats that we 've lost back into the system so what we 're doing in this project was using the oyster shell and live oyster rock as a foreshore stabilization and rehabilitation tool uh so it 's it 's basically creating a foreshore oyster reef and can we facilitate that natural rehabilitation uh of of the state of the europe the bank there and we can see uh the extent of some b erosion so this project was actually to look at providing some baseline data before and after now vicky alluded to that with the the figure showing this is what natural reefs systems will look like is if we have a an affected system can we go from an affected system state to a natural state by some sort of intervention so we need that before and after data to really understand what 's going on in the system so that 's what we did brian we did actually have a an area that had not been touched that is not near where this uh stabilization is going on and that 's our control location so we can see what 's happening naturally we 've got areas where the coil ropes have been staked out and then we 've brought the oyster shell in uh and in some areas there 's just a bare oyster shell nothing else on the against the bank and then we 've got koi ropes and oyster shell and sometimes we had a mix of koi rope oyster shell and oyster rock going in so we sampled before and after all of this happened uh we 'll measure measuring some of the physical and biological variables and also we 're measuring fish as well because that 's often the proximal link to to us to humans and perhaps how we a lot of people use these waterways which is from a recreational fishing perspective so the boys have had a lot of fun doing the field work uh for so we 're actually measuring the sediment characteristics uh are we seeing want to make sure we 're not doing that and then we also wanted to measure what was going on with the biology so looking at the formal communities uh are we getting natural oyster recruitment uh are we seeing macroinvertebrates come back which is living in the sediment and they 're often or living within the oyster shell matrix and that 's they 're often food for other organisms and then we 're getting the fish back and we were using a range of methods there we 're using the fish traps we tried using some underwater cameras and we 've even started using underwater sonar simply because the sonar works in complete darkness and really highly turbid water whereas visual cameras aren 't so good there so what have we found so i 've got a few graphs for you here the first one i want you to look at is in the top right hand corner we 're just here measuring uh what 's actually happening with the sediment accretion so what we can see here anything that is above zero in that top graph means we measured this by putting out stakes that are at a known height and we looked at how much the sediment had moved up those stakes and at the sites where uh the states remained uh because as brian alluded to we 've had flood we 've had fire we 've got lots of wave action we are actually seeing uh over time the sediments are now staying in the system but they 're actually coming back which is great for bank stability now this was a little bit variable so that 's the bottom graph on the right here we 've got our different sites where we 've added uh the oyster shell if it 's at zero that means there 's been no bank erosion or bank accretion um and then we can see that some sites we 've had a little bit of uh accretion of the bank so it 's actually growing back out into the the waterway but then at other sites the bank is still eroding so we haven 't quite stopped all the erosion yet but we 've at least stopped it or uh for the animal for other sediment characteristics one thing we want to do is to see more of the fine-grained sediments so what we 've got here the top row of graphs is before any work was done the bottom row of graphs is the work uh are the results after the shells went in and what we can see if you focus on the bottom color which i guess is a brown and a purple they 're the coarse grains that we typically find in estuary sediments and we actually want to see less of those we 're in an estuary we 're upstream we expect to find a lot more fine grained sediments so by putting in the oyster shells we 've actually lost a lot of the uh coarse gr and gravel grain sizes and we 're seeing more of the medium and fine ones and that would be because the oyster shells are actually buffering some of that wave action and allowing those medium and fine grain sediments to actually settle out and become part of the foreshore again and that 's something we actually wanted going to have to keep monitoring this one over time for the animals as uh vicky and charlotte alluded to we want to put out these reefs we want to see the oysters coming back naturally and what we actually did find regardless of which site you are at and this is the graph on the right hand side there and it didn 't matter if you were low on the shore or high on the shore where we put that oyster shells out there were new recruits so the natural spat was actually settling out on these reefs and helped to create a better for sure reef we also noticed that with the macroinvertebrates and that 's the picture in the bottom left-hand corner there we were seeing a lot more animals living in the sediments after we 'd actually put these reefs in now it 's early days yet because you 've got to wait for the sediments to come back in and start to build up and then the macroinvertebrates will move in after that so it wasn 't a huge increase that we saw but we diversity which is very promising for such an early stage in this rehabilitation process the for the fish and looking at the picture on the left hand side there that 's a video grab so we don 't always get the best water quality it 's not super clear and that 's not unexpected for being this far upstream an estuary but you can see uh it 's either a brim or a tar line on the left-hand side there i can 't quite see it snout because it 's really hard to use a visual camera uh the image on the right there we 're just we 're deploying an underwater sonar which uses sound to give us an image of the fish that are swimming around so we want to see if the larger bodied fish are actually coming in and using these reefs uh that we 're putting on the foreshore so are we seeing that whole ecosystem coming back and that 's what this research is all about so just to wrap up what that actually means we 're seeing new oyster recruits which is great stabilization has been wherever you put the oyster shower shell we 're actually seeing new oyster recruits we 've seen some sediment appreciate accretion uh with the fine and medium-sized grains which is exactly what we want so there 's a little bit of bank stabilization uh in progress there but it will be a very very slow process we 're seeing some the species richness and abundance of the macroinvertebrates increasing however it 's not a huge increase but that will also be slow and as brian alluded to we 've got mangroves can actually colonize and start to grow behind where those oyster shells have actually been put in so what 's actually happening now is as as brian said we 've we 've got more sites he 's got approval from dpi to do that we 're actually going to continue the monitoring for another two and a half years and we 've refined our methods especially with the fish to make sure we can see any changes that our on-ground works uh actually bringing to the ecosystem because we really want to know what is the repair of our waterways so that 's what uon 's up to at the moment working on this project with lls and i guess we 're all quite happy now to take a few questions if you 've got some thank you so much brian and troy for that presentation that was fantastic so great to see this work happening in the mid coast area um obviously uh the lambeau river and the report card results show that that area is is quite heavily impacted by the catchment and around it so it 's great to see these works happening to try and reduce those impacts so troy you said that that you 're going to continue monitoring for another two and a half years uh this is a question to both of you what are you thinking long term after that monitoring is this something that you would continue doing or is it something that you 're then looking to to get those results of that research and possibly move to other areas in the mid coast yeah i guess what we 're trying to understand is the principles certainly and that i did have one more slide which i don 't need to show but we we do have another project with the university of sunshine coast they 've done some interesting work up around noosa looking at you know where you might put oyster reefs within a system and i know that um charlie and the guys at dpi are looking at that and how councils can prioritize oyster reef restoration in their coastal management programs that coastal councils are working on at the moment so we 've got that project happening well it 's like ben 's been stuck in queensland with all the coronavirus stuff but um i 'm hoping that um he 'll be able to get down and do some field work early in the new year and and i 'm also hopeful that we could do a similar project in the manning and um you know charlie mentioned um previously about you know finishing the mapping for the mid coast area so hopefully those things will sort of tie into each other and we can work together on that and um yeah obviously the goriba island site is you know we 're trying to get multiple outcomes and in some ways um if we get a stable for sure and the oysters don 't quite take i 'll i 'd still be happy but you know if we get a better understanding of how all the estuarine different estuarine habitats are connected within say wallace lake and where might be particularly good spots to put an oyster reef just for that habitat and we 'll have a good idea of where we could put that and we can go through the similar painful process that kirk went through in port stephens should i get all the approvals necessary and um create some good habitat but what we what we now know is with those break walls you know basically change was like forever and so we 're not so much trying to restore it to what it was but we 're trying to adapt with it as it changes to that new title regime and becomes a different type of estuary and so we can continue to um have a good um we might end up trying to do some sites further downstream um where it might be bit easier to get those voices to to grow and recruit yeah yeah and will amber is so impacted by so many different things um as you mentioned you know the boat wash and then also the catchment um so it 's it 's really good to see those different things happening where would you see oyster reefs in 10 years like we 're we 're in these early phases of research and we 're looking at trying to restore them what are you hoping for in the next 10 years in terms of this oyster reef area um i guess what we should mention is there 's been um a large program that 's just been announced um with the nature conservancy with funding from the federal government um so that is going to start delivering more oyster reef restoration projects on the ground in the next um five three to four years so that 's a short term that that 's what be happening obviously we 're conducting the mapping and looking said with other organizations and get more happening on the ground we 're really keen to develop what we 're doing further based on the science that we 're going to find from this arc linkage program um and from the leaf oyster project and all these great research projects that are going on and start looking at some other kind of you know novel things to do with oyster frustration so maybe different species so there 's a lot of work obviously in new south wales moment with sydney rock um south coast projects may start looking more angazi so our native flat oyster which was really heavily decimated um but then also the leaf oyster that vicky mentioned you know it 's it 's could be this um it 's surviving in areas where sydney rocks um don 't really like you know it 's quite silty i should say um ph issues from acid so it could um potentially be be a really good um oyster to use for future projects so we 're just kind of looking at different um yeah different novel approaches to how know who will be doing it so it might not be you know it might not be us or brian it might be a community group or it might be the oyster farmers themselves you know i really see that 's what that 's where it 's going there 's a lot of momentum in this space at the moment um and certainly there 's a lot of growing enthusiasm and interest to see you know these kind of works being done in people 's local estuaries and you know popular fishing spots and that kind of thing so i think the next 10 years is a really exciting space for um for shower fishery restoration we also need to remember that our estuaries are what i would call mosaic of habitat so oyster reefs is that 's one we 're now understanding more about and there 's still a lot more to learn as scientists we always uh remember the more we know the more we realize we don 't know so with the oyster reefs we 've got different types of foreshore stable isolation going on we 're so we need to look at all the different habitats an estuary would would ordinarily have and as brian alluded to where could those areas actually be put back in our estuaries we 're not quite sure where they used to be 200 a thousand two thousand years ago so as scientists we 're trying to piece together and the historical information that charlie and vicky have been using have helped us decide well this is where the oyster reefs used to be in our lifetimes so let 's try and get them back there and now we need to try and work out where were there all these other habitats that used to be in our estuary and can we get them back there this is and all just to embrace and increase our waterway health and productivity our system so we can continue to enjoy them excellent thank you that that 's really interesting because i think sometimes uh particularly in the research like we start so small and as you said we don 't know what we don 't know until we and and as we learn even more um so it 's great to sort of think of that that project in 10 years time and see how it goes um so we 've approached our time this evening i would like to just start off by saying thank you so much to troy brian charlotte and victoria for joining us this evening um it was great to hear from you all uh i think that the science behind the management is is really important part of what we 're doing so thank you all for joining us it was really nice to have you all [Music] you _"

    "text": "um so welcome to our webinar on the power of hashtags so this is the second of the webinars that the destination Bank Co steamer are hosting before I get stuck in I just want to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which I work and live and recognize their continuing connection to land water and community and I pay respect to Elvis past present and emerging so these these webinars were brought about during the Cova 19 lockdown restrictions businesses asking what they can do to improve their skills so it 's in conjunction with the economic development and tourism team that we came up with three webinars that the destination management team could run I might just say that I 've also got my seven month old in the room with me at the moment on home solo working from home solo today so um if you hear any weird noises that 's just him and I may need to duck off and try to my team members at any point yeah so basically this is the second of the webinars and we 're running it weren 't too sure about our hashtags work on social media my team and I we are pretty invested in the social media scene especially Facebook and Instagram we Mountain coast so I bet enters on the research and marketing team leader for the destination marketing side of the destination management team I 've also got in my team Mikayla who was on with us today so she might jump in at any point and she looks after our social media channels as well as some content on our website so she 's go to for all the UM for the social media questions and she 's also responsible for some beginning posts that you may have seen in the last couple of days especially around the snow up in Barrington tops which is reached over 130,000 people so for us that 's that 's sort of going viral a bit which is really good so we color does a great job on those platforms for us and we 've got Thomas Davey as well another marketing officer he 's based out of Gloucester he 's no slouch when it the banking tops tourism platforms and got them to a terrific sort of exposure up to 20,000 followers on Facebook and I think he just cracked over a thousand on Instagram before we merged into bones and coasts he 's a wealth of knowledge as well and Thomas looks after our industry newsletter content that some of you may have seen that could send out weekly and also a lot of the website content and he 's my go-to for any any copy as well we 've also got sharin multitude on as well so she 's the destination management coordinator or our fearless leader so she 's jumped on to UM see what sort of presentation I give I think to learn something been nice so um so look welcome to everyone we March jump into it so I don 't know how much you 're aware of the destination big coast council but we are the destination brand is Barrington coast so we 're responsible for delivering the marketing strategy for the the destination brand and like I said a big part of that is social media channels webinar this one 's a bit more specific so it 's all about hashtags and hear what they are how you can use them and how you can develop a strategy to use them in a way that will benefit you and your business so we might get stuck in there will be um because there 's only so few of us I don 't mind if you jump in at any point with questions I 'll stop during certain parts of the presentation just to ask if there are any questions but please feel free to just jump in and ask on the spot because often you 'll forget if you wait for me to ask if there 's any questions later on sir feel free to jump in when you want so basically what we 'll be covering are dismission so what is a hashtag and why I use them and developing a hashtag strategy so we 'll look at some examples of what we do as Bank and Coast and then certain tips on what you can do as well so I started last week so I what what we 're talking about today it 's it 's quite hard to come up with these these presentations not knowing where what level or what understanding everyone is that so it 's a good place to start that a hashtag is a word phrase preceded by a hash thorn and some of you know it as the pound sign as well I 'm used on social media websites and applications to identify messages on a specific topic that 's a bit what you say simplified hashtags are used within a social media post to help those who may be interested in a topic to be able to find it when they search for it or when it is trending another big thing about hashtags is that they encourage interaction so a hashtag so a single word or a phrase after the the hash sign or the pound sign it turns into a clickable link it 's also searchable on the platforms and on some of the platforms you can also follow it as well what you would another profile so they 're pretty powerful I thought we just of came from so in the late nineties it was beginning to be used on content management systems like on the web as a way to group button categorize content and then it wasn 't until 2007 that when Twitter was on the scene that a guy named Chris Messina first ask the question should we group this conversation with a hashtag and it sort of rose from there so in 2009 Twitter formally adopted the use of it into their code making it searchable and trackable and then in 2011 Instagram and Google+ which is no longer a platform but they introduced hashtags onto their platforms as well just showing out the rise of it and the usage of it you can see there in January of 13 2013 was a pretty big year for vine was introduced into the social media landscape zones a video sharing platform it no longer exists but they were the first to launch with it already supported hashtags supported in their system Flickr again it adds the compatibility of hashtags in 2013 and then Facebook they were pretty late to the scene with to do anything but then they added compatibility in the middle of 2013 so like I said pretty late with the same considering they came to the party in 2004 but they 've added it and then since you 've got YouTube who we 're seeing the use of it across their platform and they finally introduced the way for people to filter and search by hashtags it 's rare to see now like up until today like you look at platforms like tic toc it 's completely hash tag compatible was launched with it lots of other sites are using hashtags to UM to categorize their content you you begin to begin to begin to see it in other platforms so on TV commercials you see it you see it in signage as well around like on the front of shops and that 's a hashtag you 're even find that most of us are being able to read hashtags easy even though there 's no spaces and no punctuation or no you know capital letters where our mind is beginning to be able to read hashtags so it more prevalent these days right I put this in there I thought it was interesting just to show some of the most common hashtags that are used across social media and it 's most likely that you 've seen probably these used at some point and it 's and it 's crazy just to see how how many posts they 've been used in as well so when you look at those top three like the over the 1 billion mark or close to it it 's um it 's crazy to think that there 's that many poster up there with with these hashtags in there um it 's also worth noting that just because these hashtags are the most used doesn 't mean they 're the most there will be of most benefit to you to use them you can imagine that if you use the post with hashtag love in it that it will go into the pool of 1.8 billion pieces of content on social media and get lost so we 'll talk a bit about being specific with your hashtags a bit later but Isis these and it 's not to say that it 's wrong to use them but it just probably doesn 't get get you much bang for buck so photo of the day for instance we 've used photography pic of the day those sorts of ones that probably didn 't get us any traction but I just thought it was interesting to show the most used ones our hashtag our branded hash tag hash tag Barrington toast so we began using that in December 2018 it 's so we 've we use it in every single post so if you think we do one every single day we 've probably posted over 2,000 pieces of content with it but to look at the users who have posted using it as well we 've got over 24,000 posts it 's um it 's come along quite well our own branded hash tagging shows just the power of them of how far it can get sometimes I just want to touch on a bit of the basics of hash tags as well in this section so when using a phrase as a in it so you see and I see a lot of businesses do this local businesses as well no spaces are needed so the example there so using hash tags once you put a space in there no longer becomes a clickable link for what you want it to be so if there was a space in there the clickable link would be using as opposed to using hash tags so no spaces hash tags can include numbers but not symbols or punctuation so that 's another thing to keep in mind they can include emojis that knows cymbals so no no question mark or exclamation point ashes can be placed at the beginning middle or end of your social media post or comment so a lot of people think they all have to be lumped at the end of your comment oh of your post whereas you can filter them through your captions which is one tip that we recommend or you can actually post them in the comment below and it has the same effect um hashtags allow for what you have written to be indexed by the most important points that your your content and hashed actually use with it will then have a bearing on where it appears on other platforms or other people 's feeds particularly on Facebook and Instagram so it 's if you 're using a trending topic whatever it might be at that time then it 's likely for your content to be indexed and featured on to other people that aren 't necessarily in your audience sorry can you explain that a little bit more for you say for example I don 't know the Barrington Coast when the UM snow like that one 's gone off recently but can you can you give us an example of how you how the led Nyx 's yeah yeah it 's a bit of an unknown but it 's more about trending hashtags so they 're ones that get featured say on instagrams explorer page so a trending hashtag is one that 's being used all of a sudden by lots of people so you 'll find that likes a bank and coast lock out our post it went really well the other when when there are lots of visitors here we get a big spike in the use of the hashtag Barrington Coast then that content is more likely to be featured on an explorer page or on a in any of the category pages like a travel page on Instagram they can filter by just because it 's there are more people using it at that time so there 's pages in the Instagram that have like the top-performing hashtags are the ones most people can go there to see what other people are looking at and talking about yeah particularly on topics as well so just ever been there yeah it 's funny like not not a lot of people use it I don 't use it too much but then when I go in there you see the breadth of the the content that is out there and how you can filter by it and a lot of people find their content that way so if you think of hashtags is a bit a bit like a key word and your your old CMS or your website now you pretty much the same thing so it can get found more easily by people that are outside your audience so yeah so that 's it moves on to this point sort of thing so a hashtag frankly allows people who are not your fans or followers to still find your content so this is one of the most important things so if you think on Instagram that you know your post will be seen by the majority of your followers to be organically found by someone else is pretty difficult but if you were to include hashtags you 're more likely to be exposed to people outside your followers again if you use targeted hashtags that are targeting your your niche or your target market you 're more likely to be put in front of someone that will connect with your business excuse me one second somewhat just there so before we move on were there any questions anyone had just on hashtags themselves and any other basics no all good all good great remember jumping at any time if you do all right so we touched on a little heap of reasons that the three most important ones the most important is to boost your post and profile reach so like I said you can organically boost your posts bridge and engagements just by including a hashtag in in the post it 's also great for providing repost permissions to other pages and for gaining it as well so you can compile your own list of user generated content by using hashtags you can also support causes or campaigns as well that are timely death at that moment in time so for instance we we jumped on the holiday here this year campaign after the bush fires earlier in the year that 's a that 's a hashtag that goes on and off but it helps us be seen in amongst the content that is that is promoting that campaign so I 've been about each of those so boost post and profile reach so you can reach new targeted audiences organically and it 's and it 's one of the only ways you can do this without paying advertising to reach your target markets like social media is paid advertising but you can also do it organically with hashtags with a bit of research and strategy into what to use and I 've got a great example with a post that we did that that shows how this works so and like I mentioned before an Instagram post particularly with a single hash tag has 12.6% more engagement than any than one without so I 'll be able to show you an example where that percentage is a lot higher a bit later on so reposting and permissions hashtags are common way for brands and businesses to repurpose user-generated content so you 'll see on the picture there that that 's a third of our homepage of our Instagram page when we 've got tagged hashtag boat and coast to be featured we monitored this tag pretty closely it using the brand hashtag indicates that you 're giving permission for the content to be shared on their platform it doesn 't necessarily mean that you own the photo or that you can use it in print advertising or or anywhere else but it 's a if you make reposting or potentially reposting images or video that fits your branded hashtag people were happy to do it and as long as you 're not trading on their copyright or or selling their image it 's it 's it 's a bit of a change from when it was when even I first started photographers were particularly a bit prickly about you sharing their images they wanted you to purchase their image that that 's their bread and butter I think it 's come a long way since and that they they now want you to share their images because it 's how they get more business but it 's a it 's a really important thing to remember that brands monitor their tag there at tags and their hashtags for inspiring content and a lot of the content they want to get is user-generated and on the flip that 's encouraging the use of your own branded hashtag is a great way for you to start building your own library of user-generated content so the Barrington Coast platforms I would add a guest say we used ninety percent user-generated the other five percent we capture on our own devices so and encouraging people to upload content with our hashtag is one of the main ways we find these great images and videos that we share and just there so most cost customers are happy to contribute and help promote brands and businesses that they love so for us at people that love the region love showing it often and they also get a bit of a kick out of being shown on on another person 's page people are just waiting for a simple opportunity and request to do so so that call to action for people to be featured about using hashtag is really powerful and it 's a really easy way as well it 's a it can be a single word just followed by hashtag for us to see it and and then share it on and can I jump in there just asked like obviously from a tourism organizational initiative like I 'm bouncing cows but say I 'm a news agency or from last week 's webinar laundromat um would you be expecting that I 'm sitting at home reading my crossword puzzle bought from the news agency or you know but when you do not just picked up from the laundromat can you ground it in some examples of that down the track there are some down the track but like for a news agency for instance like it can be seen to be quite easy for us because people want to show off the the region and take photos on their holidays and stuff yes which it is it 's great there 's a lot of content out there for us I suppose for those types of businesses you need to get creative with your hashtags and what you want people to share so if it 's a news agency if it 's selling a scratchy for instance it 's like yeah your call to action is like share a photo of your winnings like on this scratcher using hashtag told News Agency or something like that so you can find content and shared on your platforms as well I get what you mean it 's it 's it 's an interesting hashtag last video sorry webinars you know you 're looking at i 'm spice monkey and some of those ones and they 've got their take away and they 're taking photos and here 's a great meal but it 's just across our businesses locally i mean i guess if you know doing this can do it it 'd probably be harder for professional services like accountancy or yeah dentists like i grade the UM the in the examples I showed last week like the laundromat and just how to get a tweet there they 're marketing to suit social media is a great example of what you can do without going down the UM like the so many industries where it could you 'd need to be creative and what I would suggest for those businesses is to look at your competitors not just locally but like the big dogs that are doing this that employs social media companies to run their platforms so look at the content they 're sharing look and what is working for them you can you know that 's we we get copied what we 're doing and we consider it flattery sort of thing so a bit of research into what you know other accounting firms are doing on social media I would take it a guess that some of them are quite creative and a news humor to to maybe make something that can seem a bit of a boring task to be quite fun or something like that alternatively they might be very information focused in what they 're doing and their hashtags reflect that but but yeah I think and it 's a tip I say later on is is look at your competitors and look at the big dogs and what they 're doing that 's a great way to see to learn a bit as well and also see what 's working for them thanks man so a hashtag strategy so so you know what they 're good for but then how do you sort of put it into work so I thought it 's best just to look at a couple of points that are that are pretty key when you 're developing a strategy it knowing what works on each platform so with that in mind we might just look at each of the platforms so we 're just going to focus on Facebook and Instagram the ones that we 're most familiar with and then the beauties of working for me we focus more on Facebook and Instagram so I guess they 're the example today so they are different platforms so you have to use them differently so using hashtags on Facebook it can get you more exposure and that 's pretty much what we 're aiming for don 't use too many hashtags on Facebook I know we go on and on about hashtags and you hear hashtags everywhere and you might feel like you need to jam a bunch of hashtags into your post on Facebook it 's better to just use a few so we use about 4 to 6 on average on our posts but once or to post on Facebook is going to get you the best engagement yes if you use more than two on Facebook you 're gonna see less engagement so why I mean that for is to categorize your business or categorize your topic so if you make it too broad it 's going to confuse Facebook if you make it too broad it 's gonna confuse your customer so you really want to refine it and make it straight to the point using those topics make your Facebook post public so this is a really big one so obviously you can 't_''_1530.559 be found you can 't_''_1531.399 be searched if you 're private so there are some businesses out there that have created private groups instead of a public page you 're not going to get the engagement and the same with Instagram if you 're making a private account nobody can find you and nobody can see your contents so make sure it 's public and then it 's gonna go as far as possible yes thanks for Kayla you can see there the example we use I know in that comment there say use one or two hashtags with used to be out five there there 's a reason for that and we 'll go into that a bit later but the next slide which is our Instagram page so Instagram is a completely different beast so you can use up to 30 hashtags on a single post that 's certainly not what is recommended like Facebook it can seem a bit spammy if you are using too many so reports show that Instagram posts with 11 hashtags generate the highest levels of engagement you can see there in that post we 've used about 14 they 're all pretty pretty different in what they 're about but I 'll go into a bit about why we chose those hashtags and just going back to that that 's stat that 's pretty powerful that a single hashtag on an Instagram post can generate twelve point six more percent engagement on average so it 's really important that you incorporate some sort of hashtag strategy into your social media so I thought we done with delve into our strategy a bit and provide some tips on what you can use as well just base them on what we do so a constant brand hashtags so for us this is hashtag buried to on every single post that we do across both platforms we 've also got some constant hashtags that we use as well that we 've decided on these are most notably new south and hashtag see Australia so this allows us to be able to be shared on those platforms we also take hashtag New South Wales parks if it 's a national parks post again this is providing permission I our ideal goal is to be shared on those huge platforms and so so our content can reach a much wider audience we 've got our campaign hashtags as well that we have so hashtags that are used to support any number of campaigns it could be the recovery weekend it could be empty s key campaign by from the bush is a popular one right at the moment so we 've got a list of those that we use as well the pretty important ones that we 've identified hashtags that will expose our content to our target market so we 've got a list of the target audiences we 've done a bit of research into what engage with other operators that that are trying to target the same groups and see what they are using and working so with hashtags that we use depending on the content that will get each of our target markets we are tourism so we want some holiday inspo hashtags as well so things like escapes naps touring Australia East Coast those sorts of hashtags to include on post as well and we 've also got location hashtags so this is the location of where that it could be where your businesses or where the content is so for us picture of Salado Beach has the hashtag Salida you know and hashtag Salado Beach that you guys it would have the location of your business where your brick-and-mortar businesses or where you work from people followed geo tags and they also follow hashtags that are based on the location so a big one around here is hashtag foster it 's followed by a lot of people it 's used by a lot of people you might as well Chuck in where your business is to be a to be featured on many people follow that thank Foster like you know how you can see when your Instagram you can say how many followers we got can you see it 's you used to be I 'll do and then they took it away they um yeah so Foster was one of the most popular one around here Foster and Seal Rock and then they took that number away so now you can only see how many of your friends follow it but you can see how often it is used on Instagram so based on this so what I would recommend for for businesses is to have a constant brand hashtag and that they use in all their posts I would also say the target market hashtags it 's important to do some research into your target markets who you 're trying to attract to your business and seeing if you can come up with some hashtags based on them and then the location hashtags as well I think it 's a no-brainer for most businesses to put the hash tag of the location of the business just because like I people so this is the example that I was speaking about before just showing our strategy in action so you can see there that we 've used in this post we did this one last year and it was we use 21 hashtags a couple in the first in our caption so we got back to Kirsten holiday here this year and then we 've got another 19 in our first comment below so you can see there that we use we 're really using a strategy there we 've got our brand hashtag we 've got our campaigns we 've got our repost permissions and our constant hashtags see Australia New South Wales we 've got our keywords that identify our target markets a family getaway active family and our holiday inspirational hashtag so escape snaps exploring Australia now in the stats below there you can see that it reached at lunch eleven and a half thousand people 38 percent of them weren 't following us and how do they reach those 38 percent the work flow through hashtags so if we were to not include any hashtags in yellow box I would have reduced our impressions by 4200 people or content being shared so it 's pretty powerful when you look at it like that just to include 21 extra words in a caption actually I want to expose to 4,000 more people michaela do you mind if I check it to you for a sec yes so strategy tips so what can you guys do how can you apply this to your business so find out what your target audience things that is your number one you should be you know doing this first for everything else in your marketing but this is gonna be your number one thing to do first find your target audience and you 're gonna spend less time wasting you know wasting less time and wasting less money to get to those people look at the data so you know there 's so much floating around in there but look at the actual data which posts had my impressions due to your hashtags use them so like Ben said look at your competitors look at what other people are doing you can most comments copy that just you know you don 't have to reinvent the wheel look at what other people are doing be targeted so hashtag holiday it has a hundred and forty-one million posts now that sounds pretty impressive that sounds amazing but if you use that hashtag you 're getting lost in that 141 million other posts if you refine it you can use holiday foster for example and it has less than a thousand so you 're going to be visible for a longer period of time and to more people and to the more targeted people as well so if you used hashtag holiday that 's global so you don 't really want to talk to someone in Germany who may never travel to Australia but if you 're targeting with holiday foster most likely as the people that have already been here who are looking to come here and the target audiences of prolly people sitting in Sydney and Newcastle are using that hashtag or at least viewing that hashtag so it 's a lot more targeted using location tags is really important you can know where you are especially if your business is a lot more local if you want to just have customers from Gloucester then you need to make sure that they know you 're there tell them I 'm in Gloucester and I 'm here to sell observe you so using location tags is really important um if you find after all your research that you 've got a bunch of hashtags create a file on your phone with Instagram you can only use it on your mobile so that 's probably the best place to start your list and compile a file of your hashtags and then you can just copy and paste on to your posts and yeah make sure you you know you 're not just using up that 30 you know differ them up each time yeah thanks for Carla yeah it 's um it 's really handy especially you find it quite hard to remember the hash tag especially if you 've got a long list that it depends on the content that you 're sharing to so for us for instance we the hash tags the content we share so I 'm you know if it even is showing a family will use our active family hashtags and and a variety of holidays both hashtags so we 've each got files on our phones that just have them they 're ready to go because I certainly can 't remember them all but was identified those are the ones that work the slide previous said so this data you can see that on your Instagram pages this is organically through the through the app itself all you need to do is make sure that your profile is a business profile and not a personal profile and then you can see the impressions and where they come from so this is a great way for you to see if hashtags are working test something as well I didn 't have it on there but just test something out like you can see which one 's worked well previously you might have had 30 hashtags in a single post and it worked really well use 10 in that next use 10 in the next in ten in the and look as well like keep keep looking and seeing what works and what doesn 't we 're constantly doing it all the time and reevaluating if tagged even relevant anymore too broad if or if there were too niche as well to go back and look at your strategy you know once every couple of months I would suggest um only just a bit of hashtag best practice so just reiterating that no punctuation and no spaces when using your hashtags it 's really important I see businesses stuff this up all the time I would suggest incorporating hashtags into your sentences or your first comments so like I said people are becoming used to reading hashtags in amongst grammar correct copy so it 's nothing new to people and it just looks a bit better and and if you are choosing to put them at the bottom you 've just taken a few out that are in the bottom so you know just going to get this big block of hashtags at the bottom we often if we 've got a few like that post example before where below because you want your caption and what you 've written to Shawn you don 't sort of want it to be take the whole screen to be taken up by hashtags which is why we do that not it has no bearing on the indexing of the hashtag so it 'd be my recommendation to check them in the first comment or throughout your arm your copy um be consistent in their use like consistency is key like on social media and we said it last week as well just about posting and and if you 're going to have a social media page like use it be consistent with your hashtag use as well you 'll see the most benefits if you continue to use them if your goal is to be seen then use hashtags like that example before is a great way to show that you know well they 're big numbers and you might look at that yeah we can 't do that with our little business if you 're just looking at the same sort of percentages like to be exposed to thirty four didn 't use hashtags it 's pretty powerful numbers if you can think of it like that you don 't have to think that I 'll use a hashtag and four thousand people says the thirty four percent more paperwork some local examples this was a provided some of these last week and it was quite hard to find guys that are using their hashtags well but I thought these guys really stuck out to me so are in our property so they consistently use their hashtags as well and all their toes they 've got a brand hashtag that you can see they 're on our property they 've got a location tag and the Geo tag which is great because not only will people be able to find a GSA also CL defined by the Geo tag as well depending person 's preference on how they find it so that hashtag straight up there alongside the Stroud New South Wales under the profile name it 's just adding more ways for people to fall on them um but also the use of a niche hash tag as well hash tag property are pretty broad they 're probably not going to come up too much on an explore page or a top posts page I 'm using that hash tag but the hash tag hobby farm definitely likely to come up especially for one that 's well engaged with so um and they also use our hashtag with a lot vent on food another one so cafe and women again consistent use location tag they brand they used brand of business tags as well so that hashtag meant use master meats there which is allowing them to share the post as well they 've also got a got a good number there again they use our hashtag side and the final one beach bums cafe again consistent use they 've got a location tag their location tag is pretty specific in that its foster Main Beach I would probably chuck in foster as well as that one but that 's a good tag to have in there um and their brand and business hashtags and at tags really it 's this place is a really good example of how I don 't know how to say admit Fucci Makai berry smoothie and I 've got hash tag sake smoothie as well in there down below you see the first comment I 've got under there is from that brand so saying oh great so they 've seen it so we don 't know how they 've sent it might be through the at tag might also be through the hash tag as well but just based on using those two the hash tag and the app tag that have been exposed to this brain and that 's a really inspirational type of image that is likely to be shared by that company which you just give beach bums so much more exposure so it 's a really clever use of hashtags in you can see it sort of working that 's hashtags in a quick half hour Chuck together Prez oh I 'm hoping it might have answered some questions already you might had but if there 's anything else that you 'd like to throw it myself in the marketing team now 's your chance I 've got do you hit copy and paste them yeah we copy and paste and so like I said we 've got those files on our on our phone and on our computer as well it 's for Facebook where they 're tagging a couple so we 'll type them in but Instagram definitely that 's quite it 's quite easy to put a typo into a hash tag as well because you you just don 't pick up on a typo quite well your brain doesn 't even know we 're getting better at reading them it 's there it 's quite hard search especially when you 've got sorry about that when you 've got about 30 tags or 20 tags it 's a lot easier to just copy patience trading yes okay cool thank you I guess from my side the the underlying assumption is that there are people that are following the hashtag that you use so you 've got to get that part right don 't you yeah look and that 's a call to action as well for your audience as well it 's something probably hashtag because you don 't to see the curated content that we get and where you want to show off you see a bit more that 's what people follow location tags so much because especially if they 're locals and they live here they want to see what people are taking photos of in your local area and so insane and that 's why it 's very important for businesses to use them because they 'll just come up in that feed again this thing won 't necessarily be following you but they 'll follow hashtag rasa or hashtag Wingham or wherever it might be and you 're exposed to those people how do you follow it like I can see on Instagram how you can follow a hashtag but can you do the same on Facebook No so Facebook is only searchable and clickable so their URL links and they are indexed so in that they will appear if you 're engaging with the piece of countries no more that I so many hashtags in it that Facebook will tell the Facebook algorithm will show you more content 's indexed for you so why you can 't follow them yeah you can click and search and you can get more exposure by using them so I 'd have to say no to search on on Facebook though I do say hashtag foster business mm-hmm and assume that the other people that would be wanting to search on that and yeah it 's more about the being exposed to it as opposed to people searching for it I don 't know the research and what people search hashtags on Facebook I would as you guess it it 's not much but the real value is in being exposed the algorithm exposing your background its Instagram is more the user using the hashtag to find stuff Facebook is more background Facebook uses the hashtag more so than the user using the hashtag so like Ben said if you 're interacting with all these businesses in foster but you haven 't followed a certain business Facebook recognizes that because it will see that they 're using certain hashtags words locations it 's all building up a profile so it 's hashtags be-all and end-all it 's it 's part of all of that Facebook will show you stuff that is relevant to you so it 's just part of their background SEO it is a bit complicated it 's not just a they use it for that it 's yeah it 's definitely more powerful on Instagram there is worth in just being consistent across your platforms as well so drilling down that our brand message our brand tag is hashtag Barrington coast and people see it on whatever platform they 're following it might be the same person following us on both platforms do they consistently see it so there 's worth in that as well but yeah like Michaela said it 's use different way on both platforms I definitely think Instagram and Twitter if you 're on there that 's where it 's most powerful to use and you should definitely be incorporating it on those two platforms and it can come across to your Google searches as well so if you 're consistently using certain hashtags if somebody Google 's something pretty specific from you using those so it is across the platform in that way it also helps and that face value it tells you customers so much more if you said I don 't know here 's a coffee that 's nice where are you what else you do is it an organic coffee you know it just really refines exactly what you do for your customer as well yeah you can add a lot more of your story to it just by a single word instead of having a big lots of word copy in there that yes so organic coffee and all that and that your source local produce and whatever it may be a list of single word hashtags underneath tells that story where you can curate a short sharp piece of copy to engage your audience but yeah that 's where it 's powerful as well hmm I guess something that I wanted to bring up as well was these webinars are to help you guys sort of defuse the fear around social media we understand that people want stuff for a lot of you and that maybe it 's it like it but one of the things that we want to encourage you guys is to have fun with it just go out test stuff have fun go and stalk people just get into it and play around with it and that 's the best way that you 're going to learn and it 's the best way that you 'll defuse some of that overwhelming feeling with it and once you get those little wins if you start adding a few hashtags in and you see you 're getting a few more likes it 's almost addictive it 's really fun so you know just diffusing that fear is one of our big goals for this and yet like Ben said last time if there 's any questions that come later on that you 're a bit like I know I asked it just email us we 're more than happy to to help you out now I just need a webinar to get the training to take the photos while they 're on site and then that 's exactly right is just to encourage people to take photos complaining where we don 't share locations we can 't share something that doesn 't exist in terms of content we need the photos to share it so yeah that is a conversation you 'll need to have every day where 's me photos yeah forgot take photos always I 'm giving on to them don 't worry oh I died how are you going with a dog did you get the dog into the photos yeah big sign out the front so I would have liked I sitting in front of the sign yeah maybe when she stays so so she might be a little bit you guys just still be a puppy just say steak and then place your baby right I look forward to seeing it yeah she went to James today so she 's the trainee dog so I 'll get him just make some on the back of the truck maybe there might be a good idea now it 'll be awesome so with the time I 've got the Queen talk a little bit about or pick your brains about getting your customers to that and saying you know use your hashtag you know whatever the name of the business is and you know we 'll be looking at your pics and the best pic or the best thing you know wins attend all about or whatever sort of thing you 'd recommend people trying to get them to do definitely yes so you like Ben showed in the example is we have it in the top of our profile it 's right there so anybody that goes on the profile cassette we like today for a good example on our Instagram story we said his photos that people have shared if you want your photos shared tagged us so we do that quite often I 'm just added into the content asking people to add the hashtag so we can share it um so yeah like you mentioned competition can always be fun so saying and you can do it through different avenues so you can do it on your instagrams through a post you can make signs for your physical business you could have it on your business card a little one something really simple like that and like Ben mentioned people love seeing their content shared they love then sharing it with their friends you know that little bit of fun with your customers is well encouraging that so there 's lots of creativity you can get into with that video on your social was encourage people to use it physically in your shop encourage people to use it just tell people if you 're leaving a job or you 've just had a sortation with someone just say if you enjoy this or if you find yourself in my earth quirk take a pic and just tag us in it conversations and that 's the whole point of social media conversation yeah I think a good point is yeah just being direct with people that 's how brands get their hashtag use is a direct call to action to use our hashtag so put a post up on your platforms request that you can incentivize a lot Michaela said there 's lots of ways to do that whether it be sharing images on your own platform or a discount for you would also ask people to leave you a review in a sense for your business after they 've used the product so that 's as well as leave us a review on Google or tag us in the photo of the product that we sold you or the service we provided and uploading screen with this tags and it 's really important that 's really important Megan especially for businesses who are in the professional services so which is where the big problem as you mention is so I think the one thing to remember is that everybody who has a business I got some things in common yeah they 've got their own story and I got customers so we need to find that link between your own story and the customers and then get some get some social media gold out of that so if your bookkeeper it might be the fact that they help someone with their job keep the payments and you want to get like a testimonial from the customer that you can share on social media and it might be as simple as just then there were a thousand posts using the hash tag job keeper on it when you go on there there 's a photograph of the book keeper sitting with a client that you shared and she 's it 's a good news story about helping someone with a very current problem and that couldn 't be just something as simple as that yeah that 's really powerful have a good time for one more question yeah I guess picking up on that Thomas and I agree you know that 's that 's an interesting hashtag to follow then I guess for small businesses it 's it 's doing all this work and knowing that it 's going to convert into money in the till that 's really then it 's all well and good to have a photo of a bookkeeper doing that I 'm not dismissing that thing but as a small business owner I want to know I 'm going to make some money out of this rather than just getting more likes on my page how do you make sure that you close it out yeah marketing Neal isn 't it unless you can digital the way that you can track it but yeah look for us we get that question a fair bit from counselors and and the general public is like oh these numbers look great on social media but it does it mean the visitor economy is any better you just have to remember that you 're trying to like Thomas said tell a story and trying to for us inspire people to want to come here we know that when we have those big hitting posts and that when we have big numbers that it is resonating with a certain percentage of those people and at some on some level they 're connecting with us are they spending more money here are they are they staying longer we we can 't tell from from the use of the hash tag but when you when you look at the trends and on our social media platforms and then compare them to the local government area statistics that are released every year and we see an increase in spend and we see an increase 're putting that down to and you look at you know interest rates and you look at a whole raft of things then the promotion of the area has to fall in there somewhere and I suppose it 's how you gauge the success of any marketing that you do whether it be yes sorry I jump in sorry I just I 've just stepped back in sorry Megan hello what I would say though for a business it 's about potentially doing something slightly different to what we would do it 's driving potentially driving traffic to another platform say you 're site and actually pushing your business or your potential customers through that whole sales funnel so you 'll go from prospect to to customer so that whole purchase phase that whole funnel which you would normally push your customers through maybe you use the Facebook as a way as you say to inspire awareness get some awareness but then you need to drive them into your channels and actually that 's where you do your selling that 's like if you 're a cafe it 's like got and you can buy it if you go to menu log or whatever the other one yeah it 's it 's a call to action or if it 's more if you 're more of a service provider then it 's making sure you 're getting them into our you know getting into contact you or giving them a book or just something to get them in that to engage with you so you can then communicate again to them and you can have really sophisticated like Salesforce and all of that you can if you 're a big business you can go through that whole process and actually automate the whole lot of it but it 's about driving yeah I would say Facebook for most businesses about it it 's a yes we touched on that last way to sharing this is the platform to drive to your own channels yeah yeah so whereas Instagram is a very inspirational it 's an image sharing platform and more businesses are using it but I thought each other I think instead will go more that way in future to there to actually do that as well but yeah you 're right yeah sorry tags are about increasing awareness so it 's not directly increasing your customer number that 's that 's not the the goal of it it 's increasing awareness but percentage-wise and it 's increasing your chance of getting more customers that 's the point of it any other questions from anyone Megan anything else could you come prepared like Michaela said it 's yeah it can be daunting to throw their questions in these types of scenarios especially when the conversation goes somewhere further than with where you 're comfortable and so please just email us you can call and chat to any of the team at the audition we 'll be happy to help you this presentation will be available up on the shop Midcoast website as will the recording including my son jet screaming all the way through it I apologize for him but yeah like I said any questions please feel free to get in contact and hopefully we 've answered the questions that you may have had on the way it 's good this one too so thanks guys Oh hopefully you 're all jumping on next wake up see you then it 's up _"

    "text": "[Music] okay good evening everyone and welcome to tonight 's catchment discovery event i would like to start off this evening by just introducing myself i 'm aaron masters and i am an education and engagement officer with mid coast council so we have a really great event for you tonight as i said it 's part of our catchment discovery series so if you 've never been to one of our events before welcome but i know a lot of people have joined us in the past uh so the marine catchment discovery series is a great partnership program that mid coast council runs with local land services so it 's really a partnership but it 's also a way to get a lot of different scientists who are working on great projects here in the midcoast area in to tell us a little bit more about their work what they 're doing and give us a little bit more information about these great projects so of course the midcoast waterways are some of the most important parts of our landscape and it 's healthy waterways that really keep important for the wildlife that we live in our region as locals i think everybody knows that the last couple of years have been really really harsh here in the mid coast we 've had some really extreme climatic conditions um we 've obviously had years of droughts some extreme bushfires and spent a lot of flooding rains as well so all of this has an impact on our waterways and one of those special animals that live here in this region that can be impacted by these events is of course the platypus and that 's what we 're here to talk about tonight so first thing i 'm going to do is i would like to introduce dr gilad bino who is a researcher with the university of new south wales and he 's going to talk to us about the work he and his team recently undertook in the many attachments thanks for joining us on the virtual talk about the amazing platypus um and our i guess i 'll be talking about some of their recent research activities to conserve and learn more about this amazing and relaxing with the glass or cup of something i 've got my glass of wine here so i 'm ready to go hopefully i won 't start slurring by the end um before we begin um i would like to begin with acknowledging aboriginal people as the first people and nations of the lands and waters we live and work upon and pay my deepest and most sincere respects to their elders past present and emerging i acknowledge and truly respect the deep spiritual connection and the relationship that aboriginal and torres strait islander people have to country and their wisdom to live in harmony with nature uh in order to personalize this virtual space um i 'll start with a quick introduction uh my name is giddad and here 's a photo of me on a good day uh and here 's a photo of me on not such a good day um and there 's tanil who just completed her phd on the platypus and did much of the work i present here today and richard the director of our research center center for ecosystem science who in particular for many many years i 've been researching freshwater species for almost a decade at the university of new south wales and i 've been become become involved in platypus conservation about five years ago and formed the platypus conservation initiative as part of a greater research project with a broader aim of increasing our understanding of the platypus and improving our conservation of it and renewing our connection and respect um to this extraordinary animal and the rivers in which it inhabits um if you 'd like to know more about the platypus i guess i recommend two resources as a starting point one is of course the book called platypus you can 't misinterpret that one uh written by dr tom grant who spent a lifetime researching the platypus another lighter reads is a paper we wrote which gives a more concise review about our current knowledge of the species and the many threats to its existence for aboriginal people the platypus has many names um and spiritual connections we know that they were hunted for food by digging them from their burrows or spearing them it may be particularly important in cold conditions aboriginal people had a deep knowledge of the platypus in its black history which was unfortunately sometimes overlooked by early naturalists i 'm aware of two dreamtime stories uh one from the upper reaches of the darling river around naren begins with a young duck who disregarded her tribe 's warning of maluka the water devil and ventured down the creek far from her tribe the duck was then abducted by big a water rat who took her as his wife the duck eventually escaped and returned to her tribe where she laid two eggs which hatched as platypuses they had soft fur instead of feathers four webbed feet instead of two and spurs on their hind legs like the goons spear the walker rat but the duck and her two different children were banished from her tribe choosing to live far away in the mountains i like the story because it gives a geographic perspective a bit about the people that lived um in the in kind of within the murray-darling basin in the western flowing rivers um and their perspective the catchment a second dreaming from the central coast in new south wales begins with the ancestor spirits deciding on totems the bird marsupials fish all go and ask the platypus to join their particular family but then the platypus goes and consults with the echidna and the platypus graciously declines explaining that it shares traits with all good um with all groups and wishes to remain friends with all of them rather than belong to one single group uh the platypus then commemorates the great spirit for making all the animals different and respecting its wisdom now before we begin uh to address our number one question what is the plural term of platypus we get platypi we get platypuses well it 's platypuses yes the word comes from the greek not the latin word meaning flat foot unlike octopi which is latin if you wanted you can probably get away with platypods or even platypoda but i suspect that you 'd even sound sillier so we stay with particles what we know of the platypus has definitely been increasing picking up pace particularly since 1990 um you can accumulated number of studies sorry annual number of studies on the platypus um and today we know much better about the platypus than what was originally thought to be a hoax when the first specimens arrived england which kind of makes me wonder if that 's something which often happens uh happened back in the days um our knowledge is not uh from across the platypus 's entire range um we can see that on the map on the right in terms of indicating the number of studies that have been uh considering the platypus which kind of limits our ability to understand how it 's responding to both natural and human driven changes um to its environment and so that varies across you know the species distribution so i 'll get down into that soon ah our story begins um a story of the platypus begins millions years ago um when dinosaurs were still roaming the earth uh in a land called gondwana which was at the time a combination of south america antarctica and australia uh the first monarch trim evolved way before placental and marsupial diverged so a lineage that is seeded deep deep in time the platypus is truly an extraordinary animal it 's retaining uh involving many strange features all jumbled into one like gruffalo i don 't know if you know that children 's storybook and it displays both mammalian and reptilian characteristics it moves on the land more like a crocodile rather than most mammals um and but but swims rather gracefully with its webbed feet it 's got venomous spurs carried only by the males which if you would get spurred would deal pain for as much as six months so please be careful uh avoid platypuses um we suspect that their use of such deadly weapons are more to do with fending off other males for access to females during the breeding season then it is to do with defending against predators it has of course a leathery duck-like bill and for some reason um five pairs of sex chromosomes whereas you know we just have fun cute buggles platypuses um so the platypus is only one of five egg-like mammals building a nest in deep in burrows they build in of laying her eggs the little puggles emerge with tiny teeth which they we think might help them chew their way out of the egg but then they quickly lose them and platypuses are only left with grinding pads they are reared by their mom which has mammary glands and so the little puddles slap this milk up which secretes like the milk has very ant very potent antibacterial properties after about three months the platypuses leave and never to return uh in some cases uh jessica thomas she 's a researcher and amazing researcher at hillsville sanctuary um who 's um gave us these amazing photos she and sometimes she 's been reading platypuses for some quite time and she has noticed that on occasion female platypuses would actually push the her platypus young out into the water and and collapse the entrance in a sense you know figuratively speaking throwing away the keys the platypus is of course uh an australian icon and as such it really connects us with the natural environment uh particularly the you know the rivers and creeks of eastern australia which give us of its time in the water feeding on various macroinvertebrates so like bugs and larvae and things like that that inhabit uh creeks um and shallow lakes and they rely on really a healthy and productive riparian zone with lots of vegetation and stable earth banks and large overhanging trees and you know plenty of organic matter and complexity like fallen trees they love the pools which offer plenty of resources which are also really really important as refugia during particularly during dry conditions the platypus extends far from north queensland down to tasmania along australia 's east in both the eastern and western flowing rivers though in the latter the western flowing rivers um the rivers there have been severely degraded by water resource development and land clearing so and they occur also on two islands king island of tasmania in a small introduced population on kangaroo island there were attempts at introducing platypuses to wa but i don 't think they survived um so a mystery still to be discovered for our audience in the mid coast area so platypuses have been recorded relatively recently throughout demanding catchment of the catchment there are large number of human-driven threatening processes that are impacting platypuses across their range and their habitat starting with european hunting when thousands of furs were traded in the big markets where a single rug required more than 50 platypus skins as you can see down there in the middle the fur trade was finally banned in 1912 uh but then since la since then land clearing water resource development along with destruction of riparian vegetation and unrestricted access of livestock to rivers have been fragmenting populations destroying river banks increasing runoff and sedimentation which really smothers the rivers invasive species also increased the risk of predation during particularly during platypus overland movements during droughts when platypuses are known to kind of try and find deeper pools so they move we 've heard many accounts of fox dens with platypus bones around opera house traps which were just recently and finally banned in victoria and the act are still legal in some new south wales rivers uh and are a real death trap for platypuses uh they 're so cheap a person can fisher men could forget or never come back and one pla one trap can continuously kill platypuses so they 're really really dangerous um even hair ties and loose fishing lines can cause strangulation under the iucn red listing which is a global standard for assessing extinction risk of species the platypus is currently listed as near threatened which implies a decline not exceeding about a third in the species range and number over the course of three days three generations which is uh three platypus um generation sorry three decades which are three platypus generations um this at the time 2016 was only based on a small number of long-term monitoring programs that did detect declines in south australia the platypus is listed as threatened given it 's all but gone from the state and in victoria the platypus has just been nominated for listing as a threatened only a couple months ago given observed declines across the state and continued impact its habitat we 're yet to see the final call on this nomination at the federal level uh the platypus isn 't listed as threatened uh on the epbc act making a thorough assessment of current knowledge which i 'll share with you some of it um of past and present numbers so in relation recently sadil looked at historical newspaper articles which have been digitized by the australian national library and are available to anyone she looks for articles relating to platypuses documenting any records of observations and attitudes of people over the past century in her study we came across a number of articles mentioning platypus numbers which were much larger than what we see today in most places even when doing our best to capture them when we summarize historical observations along with uh any um survey data that someone has done in the area obviously trying to get the specific observation with in the same exact location as the survey is difficult uh but nonetheless some patterns still emerge um i think we noticed that in some areas uh in the past they used to record record far many platypuses uh people in sometimes i don 't know if they were exaggerating but people were referring to platypuses like a platypus migration observing platypuses in the mob of platypuses um and so i think today when we go out and survey and do all of the effort and we are you know we 've got 250 platypuses to date and the most we 've caught it was seven in one pool in a night whereas people used to see you know dozens there 's a term in psychology it 's called shifting baselines which refers to a shift in our collective memory of how we perceive the world around us and the changes that have occurred this happens uh when we don 't have good records or good data to to refer to but it 's quite apparent when we actually dig through our old records um and then it becomes quite apparent uh for example there 's the passive passenger pigeon which numbered in billions fine was described to darken the skies of north america but was driven to extinction very rapidly by humans uh another example are fish stocks which have been depleted from our oceans um this is one example you can see kind of the trophy fishing over the years in 1957 the water in 1980 look at how many and then in 2007 that 's it so without these documented photography you know images or surveys we wouldn 't know we would come and today you go and you see a couple of platypuses and you go oh wow i 've seen a couple of platypuses amazing so many but that might not have been the case um you know once maybe our rivers were seeming with platypuses and other wildlife i mean i 'm sure um as for the platypus specifically if we don 't know much uh to go when trying to assess changes in distribution uh we rely mostly on opportunistic sightings anyone that records an observation of platypus at any time we can see that the numbers of observations have definitely increased considerably uh particularly in the turn of the millennia as people decay have had more access to gps and smartphones um but in recent decades seems to taper it off i wouldn 't look at the last bracket because um 2020. so just if you look at um the second and third last um this sorry i 'm in the hunter valley um it this pattern doesn 't emerge when we look at other native species um so it does seem to suggest that maybe numbers have been dwindling or it 's just the probability of detection even though effort has increased um on the map on the right you can also see large areas where we simply don 't have any sightings but suspect they may occur those are marked in gray uh the last year of sighting there on the map on the right are you know anything red is we haven 't seen them for 30 years anything yellow is just like the past 20 years just you know 20 years uh green is over the past decade um in 2016 we embarked on a three-year research project to improve our understanding about the impacts of large dams and river regulation on platypus populations we traveled across new south western victoria we set up these mobile research camps from which we explored the platypuses and their habitats of course most of our work is at night we set out a few hours the rest of the night uh with the nets we set as the amazing wildlife that wakes up um we set nets either in shallow streams uh using fightnets um on your left and or in the pools we set a mesh net it 's kind of an unweighted mesh net and we go out with our tinny and we go back and forth and take any platypuses we catch or any fish and things like that we set back into the water immediately uh when we catch a platypus with all the efforts on average we catch two per night sometimes like i said the maximum is seven but when we do catch a platypus given solve the effort we make sure we examine it from all the angles literally uh and we take various samples um taking biopsies of blood and looking parasites swabbing here and there uh taking cheek pouch samples you can see there like we scoop out bits of food from inside the platypus 's cheek and we tag them so if we ever trap them again we get a better understanding of population size it as well as us go through the process in a peaceful and dreamy manner really we try to minimize our stress on the animals so that 's our kind of mobile setup um when in our surveys we found the platypus numbers varied across different rivers uh generally low in the upper murray where populations may still uh have been recovering from the millennium drought actually um so we did this in 2016 and you know um it 's been it wasn 't relatively in generation pilot first generation times it wasn 't_''_1344.64 that long um where um the lowest number of platypuses that we caught was directly darts downstream of dartmouth dam on the mid-midda which although was really beautiful on the outside was rather ugly on the inside so to speak uh in terms of platypus um and their prey uh really very very very again very low numbers of satypuses um and we suspect this is because the river is largely operated as an irrigation channel transporting water to hume dam and meeting irrigation demands uh constantly this has disrupted the natural flow regime of the on the snowy river directly downstream of giant divine dam where the large number of platypuses are probably a result of over a decade of significant water restoration returning uh some of the water back to the snowy after a long period of degradation um during this time uh by drawing water um away from the snowy into the west actually into the murray-darling basin so they 've slowly been returning a bit of the water and definitely noticeable drying up and droughts are one of the most extreme events to freshwater systems including platypuses either naturally or mediated through human development and climate change during the extreme dry conditions last year we received many phone calls and heard of many instances of platypus death deaths or you know platypus is stranded in in remnant pools um unfortunately there 's not much we can do uh given the really limited capacity of zoos to house platypuses uh which we 're hoping with some government support uh will improve in the future um we also really can 't take a platypus and move this to another river because that would impose also suffering um however there were there was one exception um platypus is in hidden villa nature reserve in the acet there 's a little there 's a sanctuary there and a mistake of ponds um and we know there are platypuses there but as the pools were drying out last year we went and collected uh seven platypuses from the sanctuary and transported them to taranga zoo for safe keeping since the water returned we put them happily back into the back into their home but this time with tiny trackers uh an array of listening stations so the stations what you see there are the photos they are not trackers and we 're hoping that will be able to track their movements across the different pools and see how they 're responding to varying conditions over the next year and a half so it would give us kind of a full uh full cycle of seasons to see when pools are drying up and they 're kind of when they move so we better understand how they respond to drought we 're already learning much more for example don 't know if you can see but you 'll have to trust me the relative uh you 'll notice on the left female platypuses the four maps there it seems like the female platypuses are you know more concentrated and localized in their movements but on the right in comparison the male is just moving all over the place and utilizing different uh pools that uh the people there at the denver didn 't realize um and so this is likely the the male platypus like he 's searching for female platypuses um during the prison breeding season which is um unfolding now we know in the wild platypuses can uh travel dozens of kilometers um and so yeah that i guess highlights the issue of fragmenting populations and things like that but um fire is an integral part of the australian environment um it interacts and is driven by many factors including the plants the climate uh and of course the topography uh fire of course impacts terrestrial environments i mean that 's a given but it also does impact freshwater uh the freshwater realm either directly often fire can increase runoff following extreme fires and then rains that increase runoff and sedimentation into the rivers which impact water quality even to the to the extent of mass fish skills um that were recently recorded in the matlab river um so following the large fires that swept through much of new south wales and the preceding dry conditions we 're really concerned for the platypuses and we wanted to try and gauge how the platypuses were impacted by such uh you know such ferocity of fires and droughts and we wanted to understand how the populations were resilient um and so we um without any knowledge about we didn 't have any knowledge about where platypuses occurred before the fire so we can come back after the fires and compare that that again that data it 's a bit of this catch-22 but that data doesn 't exist um so we we 've been working with midcoast council for a while collaborating with different uh research ideas and things like that and um conversations that we had we realized that uh looking at the mid coast council uh strategic in terms of assessing the impacts of fire on platypuses we focused on dingo creek that flows into the manning which was the both directly and indirectly impacted by the fire um and right on the other side of the range there 's the stone river that flows through combine which acted a bit of a bit of as a control it wasn 't impacted by the fire um and but was as uh equally impacted by the droughts we when we were there we heard stories by you know recollections by people noticing how the the river was drying out for the first time in the recollection so um we sat out we set out for two weeks between july and august uh you might have seen us driving around in our plat mobile and if you ever wondered why we have the boat facing the wrong way up particularly when it 's raining uh that 's because we carry so much equipment that doesn 't really fit in the car so we go around that boat sometimes have to fill it up empty it out um the and the throne were quite apparent as we were even setting up our nets for the night on the left you can see dingo creek six months after the fires and on the right the phone river the first thing that we noticed was the low understory vegetation which was really dominated by weeds along the many parts of dingo creek and what was really strange at night we also heard less frogs calling that was that became apparent when we started indigo and when we moved to the zone and we all of a sudden heard all these frogs we now became much more apparent the contrast between the two we also looked at bugs and the things that uh the yummy things that paliposes like to eat there were definitely still plenty of bugs in dingo creek but they seem to be less mayflies and yabbies and beetles in the upper reaches of dingo creek along capex road we only caught if you see there in these bubbles we can you see one way way up there we only caught one platypus over five nights using 20 nets unit effort it 's very very low uh jack just next to bobbin creek uh sorry just like the bob in school uh we caught on there marked in blue uh when we 're using our mesh nets in deeper parts of the river further down in really deep and lovely water holes near marley and duffs bridge we caught three platypuses um over two nights in comparison you can see on the throne there we caught two platypuses over two nights you 've got three there marked because one was a recapture damn you but it 's good to see that they 're definitely moving around so uh that was all right um and when we set traps out in a deep mesh mesh the pool in on the throne river um we caught four platypuses in one night um so as you can see the numbers were quite greater um on the uh unburnt area when using spikes in the upper reaches it seems to be ten times higher um we also noticed that we caught more males platypuses than females which really makes us wonder um why the dry conditions right before um has to do something with the the breeding season that was actually occurring at the time and so um yeah more to better you know more to still uncover during our survey really the one thing that stood out um were the deep pools and the habitat they offered they were amazing particularly during you know dry conditions they were so important several residents described to us that during these times they observed platypuses congregating in these pools um and since the water returned the numbers seem to have dwindled so maybe they 're returning back to their foraging grounds and burrows we 're hoping to return in march um after the breeding season um and to see how the platypuses uh are faring we really are excited to see maybe platypus young that will tell us about you know getting how they 're you know how resilient and the kind of the the bounce back of platypus populations uh are in the area um you know uh one of the most personally one of the most rewarding experiences in conservation is really engaging around us seeing kids eyes shine bright as with excitement we did this like platypus camp with amazing kids and to see their eyes shine by like with excitement when they see and touch a platypus for the first time like i said we anesthetize the animals sleeping and they can just like really get close and like touch and amazing um and of course uh my kids i 'm a bit biased but my kids they come with me and sometimes they help me uh survey platypuses which is amazing um yeah so it 's this is to see this excitement in kids it 's so worth the effort um there is still much to learn about platypus and you could definitely help there 's so much more to learn recording sightings of platypus if you see a platypus you can record that is very important and can easily be done through the atlas of living australia or an eye naturalist you can also download their app on your smartphone and become a real naturalist as you go recording you know you can start recording wild animals around you join land care initiatives that undertake inspiring and important restoration of vegetation and particularly repairing vegetation so local contact your local land care coordinator um fencing off the riparian vegetation to prevent livestock access is very important for maintaining stable banks and platypus habitat and and those kind of initiatives are often supported by the local land services um and also as i mentioned protecting identifying and protecting these deep water holes is critical uh for the resilience of many fresh water species and matt will after me we 'll talk about this uh without getting too political you can also vote wise at the local state and federal level you can make sure that your representatives representatives prioritize protecting the environment not at the expense of unsustainable development a balance can be struck unfortunately australia has a very very poor track record you know australia has the highest mammal extinction in the world and one of the worst land clearing rates in the world the highest in developing countries so we can do so much more to protect our environment and and and ensure you know our well-being um like to thank uh my deepest leaders thanks thanks uh to the lovely community um of the area that have allowed us into their homes particularly paulie megan who invited us to stay in their place on some cold and runny nights thank you so much really appreciate it uh the kids love the the pie um also my thanks to karen bethnik and uh who helped us uh coordinate uh the surveys and aaron mathis for obviously organizing this event um and our many thanks to wwf for the financial support on this project so thank you so much first of all thank you gillard for taking us through all that there 's some really interesting research there and so great to hear that these things are happening in the manning river as well with so much happening in this area it 's really interesting to see that this research is being undertaken um we do have one question straight off the bat and and you sort of talked about it a little bit at the end um but this was from kim talking about the uh the citizen you were just mentioning about um making sure that we um yeah we 're actually recording those those findings and and if you see one to to actually record it um so you actually talked about it a little bit anyway but kim to your friend that just saw them near walker that that 's a perfect way and um we can always put that um ala um atlas of living australia a link out there as well and as gillam said you can just download it to your mobile so that 's perfect yeah please like you you notice like we were really relying on these observations to try and detect changes over time and so if you could you saw when you looked at that map um there were large areas with gray so if you want to challenge yourself go out to one of those grazer areas and record a platypus for the first time like that would be amazing so yeah there 's really yeah the challenge is on well and that actually sort of leads us into that next question which um is from jackie river which is obviously because uh this particular study didn 't take place in the barrington we were we were taking intake in dingo creek but are you aware i know that they would definitely be up there but do you have any um knowledge or any information on those in that area if you if you want give me a call or you can go on the outlets of living australia just go there have a look you can see when was the last one yeah exactly and that 's why it 's so important to make sure that you 're recording those because absolutely at any time you can go and it 's not just the protocols obviously the atlas of living australia is a great resource for looking at lots of different species and what 's around and um those sorts of things for instance uh council representatives found a yellow belly glider the other night so with that you know with that and go on there so um really important to be making reference to those things and knowing what 's around what 's really yeah and rigor and things like that obviously there are biases in the data but we we try and consider those when we 're trying to you know uh evaluate different patterns and changes over time yeah yeah um and so just to follow up uh jackie also asked about a kidney so same thing you can you can upload any of that data with ca exactly um anything that you find um so what i 'll do is actually i 'll um you know in a moment we 'll be doing that presentation i 'll get the link for that and i 'll actually upload it into the chat so that everybody can see it if you 're interested to go and have a little bit more of a look at that that science um okay let 's sorry just having a look at some of the other questions here and actually i noticed people using the chat too so just if you do have questions if you could use the q a please um perfect um so this is an interesting question i 'm not really sure um that of the tasmanian devil 's into barrington top affect platypus numbers um i think probably the first thing to recognize there is that that release that was done is actually in uh a specialized area it 's actually an enclosed space um so it 's not actually um they 're not just being going down into the barrington top but it is just still an enclosed space just a larger area than what they 've had them previously but um yeah okay so so let 's let 's um predators of platypuses yeah yeah predators or platypuses i guess that would be an impact i mean the first of all by introducing the tasmanian devil there potentially you they would potentially suppress foxes um uh maybe cats as well and so i think suppressing these invasive species would then have obviously a you know top to bottom effect so potentially might suppress the predation of platypuses um so which could be our net benefit um the i i don 't know if the the devils are platypus predators i don 't think so i don 't think there 's any maybe the thailand scene in tiger was a predator snakes uh maybe they make their way into boroughs um i know the female the the female player says when she 's hearing young she blocks some of the tunnels so i think that might be a defensive mechanism against snakes maybe um you know may uh uh eagles you know maybe seagulls and things like that birds of prey um maybe in the past when you had like the big cods the 100 year old caused the big you know ones they could maybe even swallow a little puggle like the puggles i didn 't talk about the size of platypuses about maybe 60 centimeters long um there 's a big geographic variation so they get smaller up in the north maybe uh crocodiles i don 't know uh we have yet to wrestle crocodiles while we 're serving for platypuses maybe that 's like a limit to their overreaches uh it should be interesting um yeah i think that that that 's a big amount that i don 't like i think there 's i would assume releasing a would have a net benefit yeah okay awesome um so we um have a question from paul who lives in the merced river um he has noticed that the planet is in front of the house in a deep part of the river since the fires and water quality has declined um still but not back to normal and definitely a decline in platypus numbers um so we 're wondering if there 's anything we can do to monitor or help them so obviously um making sure that we 're we 're registering those sightings as well but you can have any other it depends how serious you are uh who is this who 's the user uh sorry the who 's the person uh his name is paul paul paul so you 're welcome to email me if you wanted to be serious about it and do like if we wanted to really track their go there maybe once every three months spend half an hour around dusk record how long you spent there record how many platypuses you saw make sure you know that um and you know 's you know track uh this over time so you just have to do this maybe four times a year track this over time uh and you know and that would allow us to better understand um how the population is recovering so in terms of increasing knowledge and in terms of getting active and land care and restoring riparian vegetation if you have there if there are any initiatives around there that that would be great making sure you know getting curious about you know the river and the health of the river and what you know sedimentation and things like that and making sure everyone in the catchment is responsible yeah there 's lots and lots and lots to do okay and we have a question from melaleuca who is seven um and she would like to know why platypus only come out at night my platypus has come only only at night maybe i can ask uh taito 's is just a bit over seven you want to try and answer why platypuses come only at night not sure um so maybe predators uh maybe the food sight when they dive and look for food they close their eyes they 've got relatively tiny eyes they close their eyes and they die for a minute to three minutes um and they have at the tip of their bill they have like electro receptors and even mechanoreceptors so they can feel electric current that animals put out water is a really good conductor so they they can sense their food with their bills so they close their eyes and they move forage at the bottom of creeks and rivers so they really don 't need the eyesight um so it doesn 't day or night does it really matter for them they 're more active in winter um so maybe there 's you know an around thermoregulation maybe the water is really nice and cool at night they don 't overheat i think that might be maybe the biggest driver there maybe like a physiological mechanism there um this is just me you know just spitting out but yeah yeah but but uh yeah so and and when the the stuff that they eat when they emerge that might actually are active when their food is active so it could be like a combination of these things but great great uh question and thank you um okay so we do have a lot more questions um i 'm just gonna ask one more and then uh if we 've got time at the end after our second presentation we 'll it back around and answer some more questions yeah let 's stay on for an hour um so the other question is from anne and she 's just asking do they have teeth do they have feet yeah they 've got four limbs yes they move really quickly on land um fortunately for us in relatively straight lines if they sometimes get away for uh you know when because we catch them and we move them to the um to the car in pillowcases we make sure the pillowcases uh tight and closed and all that and they relax but sometimes the like they can even scratch their way out and try and get their way back to the river so uh yeah so they 've got feet 're more stubby looking and so they fold them inside inwards into the tail and then they use the tail to navigate to maneuver in the water and they use their front uh hand limbs which are webbed and are quite agile yeah awesome okay so we 'll cut as i said we 'll cycle back to some of those questions and we 've got a second presentation so if you want to ask more questions keep using that q a function but thank you gilad that was fantastic really great presentation thank you for the moment so as i said at the beginning midcoast council is aware of just how important our waterways are and we 're working really hard to protect them not just for um water quality but also for the animals that live in them not just the platypus but many river turtles fish all sorts of different things as well um and this area has really had some difficulties with different climatic conditions in the last little while so midcoast council is aware of this and is working on a new project so i 'm us now and that 's going to talk a little bit about a refugee project that mint coast council is working on in conjunction with a few other partners so man if you would like to join us thank you gilad that was a fascinating presentation i learned a lot and and welcome and thank you to everybody who 's tuning in to this um i am council senior ecologist and i 've worked in the area since 2002 my fam my family hail from the wingham capara and bourbon area so i have a deep personal connection to this region its biodiversity its landscapes and its waterways uh the focus of tonight 's webinar is the platypus but it 's also a really good opportunity for us to discuss a project that council is delivering in partnership with hunter local land services and that project is focused on aquatic refuges and the council lead for the aquatic refuge project who i 'd recognise for her immense work on this is uh is dr karen batink what are aquatic refuges or hydrologic refugia uh so refugia is defined as areas period of unfavorable conditions in in an aquatic sense they are areas of relatively high water availability in a river creek or wetland system so when we think of aquatic refugee a picture of the deep enduring pools or the the spring fed pools the pools that are fed by by groundwater inflows or those persistent and and lowest parts of wetland systems so these are the areas we talk about when we speak about aquatic refuges and they can occur across the whole length of a watercourse and in importantly um at or near their headwaters um and the groundwater fed pools are particularly valuable i saw this personally when doing monitoring work after the fires in december of 2019 when when uh in the bougain creek area and despite the region not having any substantial rain for six months or so um there was a persistent base flow a very small very clean persistent base flow and these base flows are very important to the system and so are deep lasting pools when the riffles and the shallow pools are all completely dry uh these this is where uh have got to hold on until flows return so why are aquatic refuges important so they provide critical strongholds that allow aquatic plants aquatic and semi-aquatic animals and and even terrestrial animals that require access to surface water for drinking and other purposes they they provide those strongholds for them to persist during drought and other events and the types of animals we are talking about and not only the the platypus but species such as manning river helmeted turtles eel tailed catfish australian bass and freshwater mussels um as i say it also includes in-stream and riparian plants some frogs and a variety of land animals but not just environmentally these refuge pools are incredibly valued socially and recreationally for swimming canoeing fishing nature watching photography we all get a great buzz out of seeing platypus in the wild these refuge pools support local nature-based tourism we 're all very aware of how nature-based tourism contributes to our regional economy we think of some local iconic camping grounds that are centered around deep pools on our local rivers they 're really attractive places to visit and i personally go to and where i take my family to these springfield pools and the the deep pools do also provide and maintain water for the environment now as gilad uh has indicated the 2019 drought was particularly severe and that the 2019 drought highlighted the critical importance of local refuges our region received about one-third of our normal annual rainfall and this fell predominantly in the first half of the year there were many observations of fish kills of bass of mullet of gudgeons and catfish as well as the reports and observations of dead and dying platypus and turtles and local rivers significant predation was expected to have occurred to animals as the pools dried and and these and the the fauna within these streams were exposed or forced to undertake overland movement and uh arc significantly undertook rescue missions for manning river helmeted turtles and and platypus so our local rivers were significantly affected and thus the recovery of these affected species critically depends on their persistence in aquatic refuges so what threatens aquatic refuges and gilad covered this in in in commentary around what threatens platypus populations it 's stock access and other pollutants in waterways it 's water extraction or unsustainable water extraction it 's the degradation of riparian zones it 's weeds and feral pest animals climate change which the model suggests will create a hotter drier climate hydrological changes the dams that we use the barriers to fish passage as well as exploitation and thus we clearly recognize the value of aquatic refuges and their sensitivity to disturbance and impact so what do we do in order to protect them principally three things we need to understand the location and condition of important refuges we need to work together to better manage these assets for their social economic and environmental benefits and this needs to recognize that many of these important aquatic refuges occur on private freehold land rather than within the the public land system and finally we need to use knowledge to assist management efforts and that includes both scientific knowledge but also community knowledge which leads me to discuss our manning catchment hydrologic refugia project it is a pilot project and in in this respect we have engaged expert scientists from environment and they 're using a variety of scientific models and spatial assessment methods to identify the locations and types of aquatic refugees in two sub-catchments one is the dingo creek catchment and one is the the barnard river catchment and these have been chosen because they represent quite different sub-catchments of the mining system in terms of land uses vegetation cover hydrology and topography the science that from the models and the surveys and the assessments will be combined with community and land holder knowledge and the ultimate aim is to identify those areas of of those catchments that stay wet over over time particularly stay wet during periods of of dry times low rainfall and this is where the aquatic the hydrologic refugia will be located the project also a second part of the project also involves an examination of the distribution of key indicator species we 've chosen a small number of of animals that need water at all times to persist and which have relatively low mobility in the landscape and these species include freshwater macro invertebrates crayfish platypus freshwater mussels and the manning river helmeted occurrences to identify important refuges and to validate some of the modeling and spatial assessment work and we know that if we can protect these indicator species then we can also protect a range of other plants and animals in the landscape so they act as as umbrella species in terms of of conservation outcomes so in terms of the outcomes the project has an applied focus uh in this regard we refer to the quote knowing is not enough we must apply willing is not enough we must do so the outcomes that we seek are to understand where the important aquatic refuges are so we can work collectively to protect these refuges it 's to identify and deploy protection and restoration actions at priority sites um through through doing that we can achieve enhanced social environmental and biodiversity outcomes for the entire manning catchment the the protection and restoration actions that could be applied to specific priority refuges might include weed controls riparian enhancement stock exclusion fencing pest control in-stream restoration work such as introducing additional coarse woody debris in stream bank stabilizations conservation agreements as well as and many other plants and animals and ultimately our entire community if we can work together with the community with the with the research scientists and with the agencies to achieve these outcomes thank you that 's that 's the end of my presentation rose had the first question and she asked how often do platypus breed ever the short answer would be maybe every second year uh it really depends um tom granted the study so literally spent a lifetime 40 years going back to the same pool every year and really doing a survey so really the undertaking the hard work the actual surveys um that 's the only way we can know about demographics about breeding like uh you know their optimistic observations are really valuable um e-dna is is is great in some instances but really undertaking like actual mark you capture you mark you release over time gives you a good understanding of the population the demographics males and females and young and so it gives you the whole cycle um so tom grant spent 40 years going to the same pool so this is he found that you can you can give them the females a bit of oxytocin acidosis and see if they 're lactating um during the breeding season sorry tractor going by um and so he found that um yeah on like on average every second year that was females were breeding um and so males probably have access to a number of females as well so you know on a whole you have this like population dynamics going on does climate change or these bushfire and climate influences affect the balance of gender so if they 're more males and females i would say yes generally if we 're you know talking about the species in general i would say that that would have an impact you know i think in some cases you might have certain sexes more susceptible to drying maybe um and i think in some conditions like if some populations when the population is small they might be able to actually regulate some species i 'm not saying platypus but some species might be able to regulate sex ratios depending on population size fish you know pretty i don 't know in terms of their evolution and their capacity to regulate um sex and things like that but i would that would be a valid hypothesis to test well put like in that sense excellent um so you had an interesting question and matt you might be able to help me answer this one um it 's probably a little bit more council focused um and that is about the um the issues associated with um allowing livestock into waterways um now i 'll start off with backing up some of what matt said before which is that a lot of that waterway frontage is actually in private ownership so it 's not it 's not public finished land but i will say that um both midcoast council and hunter local land services are working really hard to work with land holders and to try to get those areas fenced off there 's different grants and things available different projects that we 're undertaking um so we 've been very focused on the manning tonight but for instance there was a local project undertaken in the with grant funding from midcoast council uh hunter local land services and then also funding from the land holders themselves and they 've actually fenced off uh large areas not only of the riparian zone but also wetland zones that were actually located on their properties and there 's now over 240 hectares of uh that wetland protected from livestock so it really is a partnership it 's working with landholders um to make sure that they 're aware of the issues associated with livestock into into waterways um working with them to help fence off those those riparian zones and things like that so um there 's certainly work being undertaken in that space but it 's it 's not all there yet we are working with land holders to try to get a little bit better at that matt did you have anything to add to that no i don 't think so i think yeah as you say it is definitely a partnership we 're dealing with private land holdings and yeah there are a he there is a history and of working with land holders to stock and there are often production benefits of that as well in terms of the provision the concurrent provision of offstream watering which stock prefer um it 's good for the water systems it 's good for the it 's good for the production system as well and so there will be continued programs to to work in in combination with private land holders to to continue the the work that 's been done to improve the the condition and health of the riparian zone for the for the benefit of the system definitely uh not many more questions left so if anybody have to add yeah yeah absolutely i 'm at the moment i 'm in the upper hunter and to be honest like some of these systems are like it it really pains to see some of these there 's so much like the bank erosion and degradation in some of these areas that haven 't been fenced off and protected like there 's no repair and meditation it 's just nah and it dries up the the refugia dry up really quickly you end up with really more it really breaks your heart um i 'm not too sure it should fall to be honest like i don 't want to stir the pot too much but i 'm not just like why does it have to fall on private um you know i 'm not saying don 't do it and go do it but uh you know the rivers in a sense are crown land um with the definition of the width of the river sometimes there 's a bit of ambiguity i guess and complexity there but uh you know this would be we 've seen the budget yeah put in riparian restoration there yeah yeah and and definitely there is if there is funding available for all of that now but i yeah yeah yeah they 're all like throwing all the money again so where 's the environment and i do um is that as well so thank you for reminding me about robin it 's excellent care project as well so it really was a partnership project there was lots of different people yes okay and i think if anybody 's landcare um midcoast has a land care program called new coaster tops and that involves a different landcare group so if anybody 's interested absolutely um search them out there on the internet on facebook and um there 's certainly more information out there for joining landcare as well so um thank you for reminding me rob and i apologize i missed that when i was talking about the partnership i think landcare also has sorry i think landcare also has like an uh like an important like bringing together the community in a shared activity is um you know so important and so you know beyond that there 's the benefit there 's the emotional benefit of getting together and doing something together and and you know and and shared version about protecting the environment certainly all right well we 've got a little bit over tonight so i 'll take this opportunity first of all to say thank you to both gilad and matt for presenting this evening that was fantastic um even i 've learnt things so this is fantastic um but i also want to say run these evenings without you you guys are really we thank you for giving up an evening and joining us and we certainly hope to see you again in the future _"

    "text": "[Music] thank you all for joining us tonight we 're really here it 's all about our waterways and catchments the midcoast waterways are some of the most important parts of the landscape that we have in this area we all know how important they are to us we all we all live here for a reason and a lot of that has to do with our waterways and it 's really the health of those waterways that keeps our communities thriving they 're also very important for wildlife that lives in our region there is so many benefits to having healthy waterways and so to achieve the best outcomes for our waterways we really rely on a variety of different research monitoring modeling and and local knowledge to to help guide us in how we look after our waterways and so tonight we 're going to be celebrating the science involved in all of this work so every year we welcome scientists from the department of planning industry environment and they come and visit our region and undertake sampling in our estuaries they do that for a couple of lot of different areas and it 's to look at how our waterways are faring when compared to other waterways throughout new south wales it 's really about getting some baseline data looking at how those waterways are doing from year to year and also just seeing what effects our management actions are having on our waterways so tonight we 're going to talk not only about the report card but also the results for 2020 so we 've obviously got some interesting things happening there and we 're also going to talk about the science behind the monitoring that we undertake the ways that we use our catchment modeling um and monitoring to help target our management actions and have the most positive outcomes for our waterways now obviously we we all live in this region and we 're all aware of the uh the interesting and and very hard uh climatic conditions that we 've been facing over the last couple of years uh obviously we 've had extreme drought bushfires flooding and all of that happened during 2020 sampling period so it was really influenced those climatic well so just before we get started for the evening and i introduce you to the special guests that will be talking to us i would like to play a video for you um it just gives you some background information on what the report card actually is what indicators the scientists use when undertaking the monitoring and what we 've been doing with this information [Music] so the first report card was released in 2011 and this was after the adoption of the great lakes water quality improvement plan and in the plan we identified the need for a report card that would help us track the health of our waterways what the report card also does is it helps us check that the strategic framework that we set up as part of that water quality improvement plan is actually working the value of the report card is that we have an independent assessment each year of the health of our waterways and this is completed by the department of planning industry and environment the two main issues that we have in our estuaries are the introduction of nutrients sediments and soils when we 're doing the monitoring we 're focusing on those two main causes of concern and we have indicators that respond to those so we measure the amount of algae in our water because that is a direct response to the amount of nutrients that we have in the water and we measure something called turbidity which is a way of measuring how clear or how murky the water is because that 's a direct response to the amount of soil and sediment that 's washing into the waterways soil and sediment can affect many aspects of what lives in our waterways it can harm our seagrasses which are critical for the ecology and for sheltering juvenile fission and other organisms and if we have too much algae in our systems it can cause problems for the fish and cause problems for the seagrass and it can just make the water not look very nice the main indicators for estuary health that we 're looking at are chlorophyll a concentrations and turbidity we also collect other contextual data looking at salinity temperature ph dissolved oxygen we of the estuaries up here we use a complex series of scientific investigations often we use models to help us get all of the information together and we use that information to predict how our actions will change our environment we use the report card results to work out how our waterways are faring in terms of their ecological health and when we see areas that need improvement it helps us target our programs to to improve the condition of the water running off of our catchments the results of the report card are affected by a number of diffuse sources of pollution so there 's no single solution to improving water quality council have a range of projects that we put in place to improve water quality and waterway health one of them is to conserve and restore wetlands and improve their function and and ability to filter nutrients and sediments in urban areas we undertake stormwater improvement projects things like wetlands and bioretentions are built into the urban form so that they can also filter the nutrients and sediments that come off our urban landscape on rivers we in the river we undertake partnerships with farmers and local land services to engage with farmers to improve the way they manage their land so that they can improve their production outcomes but also reduce the amount of runoff and impact on water quality we restore our bushland areas so that they can function effectively as filters for storm water and runoff from the catchment and that involves bush regeneration and weeding one of the more obvious pollution sources from our urban areas is litter so we 've got some integrated programs with with our community and local land services to reduce the amount of litter entering our estuaries the report card results don 't just belong to council our community have told us that our waterways are really important to them and keeping them healthy is one really important part of that each year we release the report cards and we share them with our community and we use that as an opportunity to engage with our community about the waterways how important they are and talk to them about the results i like keeping an eye on these always something new to look at and something interesting to see what i really like about working on the report card project is that i can see the use of evidence-based decision-making in action and we continue to refine our program so we get the best investment of council 's money and the best outcome for our waterways [Music] it 's a great overview of what the report card project is uh how long we 've been doing it but it 's been a long time that we 've been undertaking this project in the mid coast area um so it 's great that we get to do this annually and it 's a really important part not only for us but for our community to see what 's going on so i 'll start to introduce our scientists that are with us this evening so first of all we have joining us dr peters gaines who is the senior team leader of estuaries and catchment science for the department of planning industry and environment he leads a team of 15 scientists and has worked on estuary and coastal river involved in the report card project right from the very beginning we also have aaron wright who is our senior scientist with estuaries and catchments in the department of planning uh planning industry environment as well and he 's been working on a variety of different projects uh he has been involved in the report card and the monitoring that goes into that but he also uh is working on some specialist um science this year looking at the effects of the um the bushfires that happen not only here but on the south coast as well so he 'll be talking to us about that this evening and then finally we have dr angus ferguson who is a senior research scientist also with dpi he 's got over 30 years experience in utilizing best scientific method to plan management actions for environmental outcomes and this includes a lot of work with catchment modelling um both in other areas of new south wales and looking at some of the the work that 's been done here in the mid coast as well and finally we also have crew tucker who coast council she has over 20 years experience in estuary management including extensive works on the water quality improvement plan that was created for wars and mile lakes so i 'll hand over to peter to begin with he 's going to talk for us first and tell us all about the um work that he 's been undertaking and the results for this year yeah good evening everyone um so i 've really got two things to talk about i want to talk about the importance of monitoring and try and emphasize why the council put so much effort into their monitoring and getting their monitoring right and i 'm also going to do a quick presentation of this report card scores from this year 's report card okay so um if we think about management and decision making in management as a cycle we probably will start we 'll start up here with the research that goes on behind that work it 's about improving understanding of how the system works so that we can understand which levers to pull and what are the likely reactions of the and aaron we talking about is in this improved understanding once we 've got this improved understanding we can plan our policies and our future actions which can then be implemented and the next step is about monitoring so we need to monitor whether or not the actions that we 've implemented are having the the effects that we assume that they will or that we predict that they will have so this is a cycle and then we go back and we evaluate the results from the monitoring that improves our understanding and then we can make more informed decisions up here in new south wales we 've got a statewide program and that program looks at has looked at almost all of the estuaries in new south wales over the last few years it looks at the north region the central region and the south region once every third year and it deals with about 30 to 40 estuaries in each region so it doesn 't cover everything every year but many of the councils have chosen to build on that core program and increase the number of areas because it gives them more more information and that 's that 's the genesis of the program that produces the report cards that we 'll be talking about in the 1920 sampling period so we sample over summer so we talk about a summer the summer started in 2019 finished in 2020 it was one of the wettest years that we 've actually a summers that we 've actually had um for the last 20 odd years 24 years but it all came in one big dump so you can see in these graphs down the bottom here that for most of the summer we were well below average and then suddenly we got a quite a very large storm here which was produced something like four times four and a half times the average monthly rainfall so it 's that single event which has pushed this summer total rainfall well up into the high category this is the data from router and the data from tariq so it fell across virtually all of the local government area if we look in detail the bars here are where we so you can see that this daily rainfall fell between our fourth and fifth sample and that 's really quite important because it really affected the um the results i 'm not going to go into that in detail but if you look at the technical report you 'll be able to see that we had quite good scores in this first period when there was no rain and the scores deteriorated quite a bit after that heavy rainfall so this is the um the overall picture that we got from the local government area nine out of the eighteen sites dropped by one grade so the scores they got were worse than they were last year and we put this down to a combination of the drought fire and the flood it 's really not possible at the sort of scale of the sampling that we do to disentangle drought and fire and flood but we do understand how they have effects and that the effects are all mixed together or integrated in together to change the grades in some of the house in half of our sites i that i 'm going to show for for each place that we sample in this case cap and gate this year 's score is up here last the the scores over the last um 10 years are shown down here so in 2019 cap and got got a c and in this year it also got a c and this bar here shows our two indicators algae and water clarity the black is this year 's score and the further to the left it is the worse it is and the gray is last year 's score so you can see that algae was quite a bit worse and the water clarity was quite a bit worse in um in cap and gat if we look at the mid will amber estuary here we 've got the same structure except we the score was the same in the two years in this case the algae was slightly improved on last year and the water clarity was slightly worse than last year i 'll come back to some of these measures and the colors relate to where you fit in the deep green is an a which is in the best 20 of the state and you can go back through these other scores so we get on to the results i 'm taking the wallace lake catchment first the scores dropped in willamba cove over near sorry and in piper 's creek and charlotte 's bay charlotte 's bay for the first time since we 've been monitoring since 2007 didn 't score a so even charlotte 's bay was affected by that massive rainstorm we had um in the middle of wallace lake again with the scores went down and in the clung look estuary that went down and the medieval ambrose stream was pretty much the same as it was last year and for most of the last five years in the manning catchment we 've we 've got many sites but we 've grouped them together into the upper and the mid and the lower manning estuary the scores were went down in the upper manning estuary but stayed constant in the mid and the lower manning estuary we 've only got one other data point for than last year as far quite inlet we 've got the same grade that we did last year and at the cap and gat saltwater creek estuary site which is in the middle of a national park where you 've got one of the poorest scores that we 've had in the last 10 years and at that site and cap and gap was quite poorly and badly affected by the fires in the um mile lakes catchment we can see that the bomb abroad broad water arrow around the wrong one sorry the bomb abroad water the score went down from an a to a b this year but last year was the first time it got an a so it 's pretty much back where it is it 's interesting to see that every so often after big floods in the um in the mild catchment that the bomber score is very very poorly uh mile lake and the lower mile estuary were both had the same similar scores or the same scores as last year uh and the same story in the kuruwa the crew and the it indicates a reasonably large amount of disturbance in the system and in the crew and the branch that mostly relates to excessive growth of algae other scores this year were the same as the scores last year and smith 's lake again for the first time since we 've been doing this work back in 2011 scored a b rather than a so it indicates that that this was quite a pervasive event across the entire local government area and has pushed down scores in many of the sites that scored quite highly in the past so what i want to talk about now is getting onto the science and what we can do with these report card grades so sometimes people scoff at the report cards and say yeah the way we the calculation is great just dumbs everything down and i take exception to that because i think that there 's a lot more information involved in the way we calculate the report card scores and it doesn 't dumb things down it synthesizes the information in a way that we hope that the broader community can report card score when we calculate it is whether the percentage of time that the data that we collect a great greater than a guideline value and how far they are from the guideline value to what we call the worst value so if it 's right up here it 's a much worse outcome than if the data are here and just above the guideline value and i want to explore how we can use both this proportion value and the distance value to get more information so i 've chosen just four sites piper 's creek and charlotte 's bay and on the next slide i 'll talk about the willamba and the cap and gat estuaries so you can see that for most of the time piper 's creek this is the chlorophyll value and this is the proportion of time it doesn 't comply sits here on average around about 60 of the time it doesn 't comply but if we look at the average distance it 's only just by a very small amount that it 's not complying so it 's saying to us that are only just above the guideline value for chlorophyll and most the time they 're below the guideline value for for turbidity charlotte 's bay we see a similar sort of story but uh it 's better because only about 20 of the time does charlottesville not comply with algae and it always complies for turbidity but you can also see that sometimes we have these events which really increase the amount of time that oh sorry increase the distance that it is away from the guideline value so it gets much worse we had one of these events back in 2009 and this event in this year was the highest distance that was away from the value and that 's what created that poor value that we had or the poor score or the reduction in score that we saw this time around in cap and gat you see that most of the time it does comply but when it doesn 't it doesn 't by a long way so what we 're seeing is infrequent very large events particularly in turbidity that are causing the non-compliance in quite high particularly for turmerity and over time it 's gradually got complies more often and the times when it goes over it doesn 't go over by very much the algae in the amber however most of the time or virtually all the time it doesn 't comply and it seems like the distance away so that 's the severity of the non-compliance is actually getting worse over time and when we plot those data we can see that the amount of algae in the wallamba river is steadily increasing over time and that points to a need to really work hard to control the amount of nutrients that are coming into the wallamba river to stop this trend of increasing severity of the algal growth in the river so i know that was a bit technical but i put it in there just to show that there 's actually a lot of science and a lot more information that we can get from our report card information than simply the scores that we present back to you and and this information helps us analyze what 's going on or or further analysis of what sort of management actions need to be taken so in conclusion monitoring is actually absolutely essential to effective management so without effect without good monitoring you don 't know whether or not your management is having the desired effect and you need to go back and check that all the time we saw a general decrease in report card scores in this year which we put down to that extreme uh rainfall event which was preceded by the bushfires and the report card score calculations can tell us a lot more about the system and the trajectory or the pathway in the system of our indicators rather than simply the scores and the grades so thank you very much i 'll now hand over to my colleagues to continue thanks peter that was fantastic um so that that 's our report card scores for this year and as peter mentioned there was a few different things that were happening that were affecting our report card scores this year so next we 're going to hand over to aaron wright who has been doing a impacted waterways throughout new south wales hello everyone i hope you can hear me and see me my name is aaron wright i 'm a senior scientist in the estuaries and catchments team as aaron kindly introduced me earlier and this evening i 'm going to talk to you about the potential impact of bushfires on esterine water quality this evening i 'll give you a really brief rundown of the extent of the fires in the mid coast lga showing how bad things were basically um i spend most of my time presenting our conceptual understanding of the effects of fire and using a case study i 'll highlight how some of the impacts are being presented in real life and then quickly cover what can come next so this is mid coast lga or the catchments of the waterways within the lga at least so you 've got the manning river up in the north all the way down to the maya river entering port stephens in the south it 's quite the vast area and it 's got lots of beautiful waterways now this is the extent 2020 but also the severity of each fire um so the darker red and almost kind of black color is the is extreme severity and the lighter colors to the towards the green is low severity and what that really means is basically how hot the fire was and also how high um so at the lower end of the scale the you know the ground cover in the mid story um sorry the ground cover is quite burnt but the meat store in the canopy are left intact um but the upper end of the scale all strata in the vegetated area is damaged from the ground cover all the way up to the canopy and more or less full combustion now that 's really important because that controls the type of material left in the catchment after the fire is extinguished and and the type of material can have different varying degrees of impact once it finds its way to a waterway downstream so you can see the fires around cloudy bay just north of the manning entrance there it 's all black so that 's you know a spread of the other severity classes across the lga so this is some numbers behind those maps um you can see capping out creek the intermittently closed system just south of alba had over 80 of its catchment area impacted by fire and a number of other systems in the lga were also impacted fairly extensively the photos there try to convey the differences in the fire severity so low on the left hand side where you can see the canopy in the mid story is mostly intact you move along all the way to the other side the right hand side uh where almost everything is combusted to ash and ruin now onto our conceptual model um just just to point out this was developed by synthesizing current understanding and relevant literature discussions with relevant experts and also based on preliminary data and observations made in fire affected systems and this is mostly from data we 've collected on the new south wales south coast but similar estuary types to those impacted by fire um exist in the mid coast lga as well so the intimately closed systems point of comparison this is our understanding of a low disturbance system with a forested catchment before any fire water quality in this scenario is generally pretty good the intact vegetation does a lot to reduce runoff flow volumes and velocities during rainfall nutrients and sediment and organic matter are pretty well secure so the export to the waterways is pretty low this is a general model but it 's fairly true of most s3 types but of course different processes within the water column and sediments will be occurring in different at different rates based on the estuary type so following fire and heavy rain so lots of runoff shortly after these are the initial impact conditions what what would have been happening in the january and february in the mid coast area and you can say it 's pretty bad vegetation is reduced to debris charcoal ash and a mix of partially burnt and partially intact organic matter and from that you can expect an increase in stream power um and flow volumes due to ash laden hydrophobic soils um and this results in both real and channel amounts of sediments uh burnt unburnt and partially burnt organic matter and nutrients as well from the catchment area and this all ultimately ends up in a downstream waterway now it seems likely in this scenario that the export rates are modulated by fire severity so most of these processes are made worse with increasing severity in the receiving environment there 's this plume of highly turbid debris and organic matter rich fresh water and once that hits low energy environments like shallow margin habitats or deeper basins that material is deposited or sinks to the bottom or as some of it of course is exported to the ocean depending on the entrance conditions and the size of the rainfall but that plume can also produce strong stratification most most obvious in this first initial stage is in salinity because the fresh water turns the skirt across the top so everything is a bit of a mess in this scenario now the next stage is in you could call it the recovery period but from a catchment perspective only really um the vegetation begins to return and you start heading that 's modulated by the fire severity um in some really extreme cases in the far south coast for example um even this far along so many months after the fires we 're seeing cases where the vegetation just isn 't coming back but yeah the impacts of all the material deposited in the low energy environments of the waterways are still persisting and still being expressed so the excessive nutrient loads exported from the catchment and the breakdown of deposited organic matter both unburned and partially burnt fuels out growth which in turn results in mass oxygen consumption and once the blooms collapse the release of dissolved nutrients from the sediments of the estuary forces a feedback loop of further angle growth which again drives algal consumption and so on and so on so the whole biogeochemical cycling of an estuary is completely altered which may have um ongoing ecological consequences that are not truly recognized until months and months after the initial shock of the fires so we 've seen this happen or we are still seeing this happen um this is an example from the one boy by fire something like 90 percent of the catchment area burnt um and just like then just like up in the mid coast area it was lashed by back-to-back rainfall events shortly after i think there was back-to-back 100 mil and 200 mil rainfall events i 'm pretty sure so what the plots show is data from that post-fire recovery period so you know weeks to months after the heavy rain so you can see the strong stratification of salinity chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen is still evident along the entire length of the estuary right down at the ocean end all the way to the upstream limit um now with the coming summer you know warmer weather increased light what 's what we 're expecting to happen it 's probably going to start fueling further algal blooms and kickstart that process i mentioned before that feedback loop of ongoing blooms throughout the summer so again i feel like this is a almost like a precursor state to things that we might be witnessing in its full effect a bit later on um and this could be similar this could of um fire affected at systems of the same type in the mid coast council lga capping gut comes to mind it 's it 's an intermittently closed system with a bit of a deeper basin at the back and a tributary flowing in of course we don 't have any evidence to show that that 's um it is going on taking a look at our report card um where it dropped um is quite significantly the worst time in ten years it does suggest there is significant impact in that system uh of course rivers would be different um the data isn 't shown here but in the clyde river um down near batemans bay where we did similar vertical depth profiles to this along the whole length of the river and again it was a very extensive uh fire impact in the catchment but what we see is a mixed signal the whole way down so this might come back to residence time meaning a high residence time and poor flushing might mean a high risk to ecological ongoing ecological impact in the waterway so just to definitely had the potential to impact water quality in aquatic ecosystem hell um as peter pointed out the timing and the scale of these major climatic events makes it really difficult to identify the extent of the impact of the fire in the flood alone and instead we 're kind of viewing everything in all entangled together and we 're definitely leading towards um it seems that s3 type definitely modulates the impact so we have high residence time that and the system 's poorly flushed it 's probably going to be worse worse and low residence time uh in with welfare systems it there might be a bit more resilience in there so to keep going with this work to really get an understanding to unders to enhance our understanding of how fire impacts system i think long-term monitoring is absolutely essential as is targeted experiments i think that long-term monitoring would really support some experimental data and we 've got to start maybe we should think about sampling some relevant indicators organic matter for example and some indicators of pyrogenic carbon which will give us an idea of playing a role in influencing um the aquatic ecosystem health indicators ongoing assessment of stratification um characterizing the sediments is is very important because that 's where the sources of pressure are now coming from but also our work has been limited very much to the estrone receiving environment it would be really great to take this upstream and have a look at some of the streams and tributaries that flow into the into the larger systems and of course with our conceptual model we 've kind of got an idea for targeted sampling now so in the very frightening future of possible fires happening again and more floods we 're almost a bit more prepared for some more sampling um we hope they don 't happen but from an understanding of the processes it would be um it would be great to get out there and monitor these systems again so that 's all from me thank you very much excellent thank you aaron that was really informative um obviously in this area we were so heavily impacted by the fires so um this year what we 've actually our report card uh that that looks at how bush fires and the floods actually affected our waterways and um it 's got some information on there as well uh on the work that aaron and his team have been doing so um at the end of the session i 'll include some information on how to access these documents uh next up we have um dr angus ferguson is going to join us and angus is going to talk so we 've talked about monitoring and we 've talked about why we undertake that monitoring but in actual facts there 's a step before the monitoring and a step that you then continue after monitoring and that is uh catchment modeling so angus is going to talk us through a little bit about how that catchment modeling works hi everyone um sorry about that technical glitch yes um so i 'd like um tonight i 'll be talking about um modeling and further than just catchment modelling it 's what what we refer to as ecosystem response modeling which is really just a grab bag of different models that the different factors interact to result in the sort of impacts that we see in in receiving waters so i guess uh just a brief overview i 'll be talking about how these sort of models help us to link what happens in the catchment to um ecosystem responses that we see in systems like wallace lakes wild slave so i 'll be breaking that down a little bit further and talking about the catchment models that we use that describe the um the processes and uh that do go on within the catchments of those those systems um i 'll be talking about the hydrodynamic models which describe the way that the water moves through the systems and mixes um and then further on to the ecosystem response models which describe how the ecology of the systems responds to the input of fresh water and pollutants associated with that fresh water um and then then i just would like to move on to some um what we call effects based assessments these are these are case studies of examples about how we use the models to help management decide the impacts on of land use on receiving waters so the great lakes is obviously an area of you know great significance for many reasons it 's a popular tourist destination it 's um it supports a large commercial fishery and an oyster farming industry um and it also supports a vast array of ecological values um both in terms of fish but also um bird life and and and also lots of things that you probably don 't really notice on a day-to-day basis the animals that live in the sediments and um in the fringing wetland habitats so a recurrent question for management is well how can we maintain these values into the future especially in the face of increasing population and pressure on on natural resources i mean we can we can say we can take a general grab bag approach and just say well pollution is bad um but really our approach is to actually drill into the problem a bit further using these models supported by uh research and and data that 's collected and as peter and aaron have alluded to that ongoing monitoring system but also help us develop the models further and track how the system is is faring so i guess um the overall aim is to link land use activities to how the system responds and i 'll break this thinking down because it underpins our modeling approach um and it gives us it it will uh help you understand the rest of the uh the presentation so essentially what we look at is is pressures um what we call pressures and those things are the various land uses which produce the pollution so there are broadly i 'm just illustrating here with land use pressures such as grazing cattle grazing forest forested catchments and also urban catchments they will produce what we call stressors um these are things like sediments that are washed off the land and also nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus these these are exported from the land to the waterways and then they are mixed or transported and mixed into the receiving environment or aquatic environment and then we look at what the response is so what happens to the micro algae that grow in grows on the on the sediments of the system and things like the oysters and also the general habitat of the system so there is various measures of that habitat quality so our model setup is is comprised of a catchment model which basically describes the linkage between these pressures and the the the generation of sediments and nutrients we then use what we call a hydrodynamic model which describes the physics of the transport of that material through the system and the mixing with receiving waters and then we couple that with what we call an ecosystem response model which describes the the various processes and feedbacks associated with this um response side of the pin so the catcher models basically they 're telling us how much stuff is coming off the catchment and from where it 's coming so essentially they 're dealing they 're basically their basic uh processes which drive these models are the the the catchment area the elevation and topography of that area um the the land use types and the soil types that are associated with that we also can account for various as point sources or feedlots and and sewage treatment plants for example um maybe irrigation and cropping which which may may modify the way that water move through the landscape and also impairments or such as dams but essentially these models look at the the the input of rainfall over the landscape and they they predict the the flow off of water through streams and also through subsurface flows such as groundwater so essentially the the sort of inputs that we need for these these catchment models are things like um land use maps um that describe the different languages types that we see across the catchment each of these different land use types will have different sorts of pollutant generation rates we have we have the the catchment slope or topography and we have the the soil types and the sort of outputs that we get uh things like uh erosion rates the the production of total phosphorus or total nitrogen and also the the the amount of water that 's running off these landscapes um you 'll notice in these maps here these these they 're they 're that relates to what we call sub catchments so they 're individuals small streams have their own individual catchment before they sort of join other streams and then concentrate further downstream then we have what we call the hydrodynamic model this describes where the stuff goes once it hits the waterways so in the in the right hand panel you 'll see an animation of a runoff event discharging through the walema river into the wallace lake system so this really helps us understand put into perspective what the in this example um the the orlando river what that how far that material goes and how it is um affected by wind and tides and how it 's mixed into the into the lake itself excuse me so we can do this um for individual inputs in in isolation such as this this animation with the one amber river um or else we can do more realistic simulations where we simulate the runoff uh from all events at all inputs at once um so essentially then we we take those those outputs and then we run it through what we the processes that uh that that cycle the the nutrients and the suspended sediments within the receiving waters and how it affects the ecology so on the left hand we have what we call biogeochemical processes these are really the processes that um deal with the growth of microscopic plants and and bacteria in the system which essentially affects the availability of nutrients and light and then we have uh more general models which describe how that that feeds up the fruit food chain or food web so we have nitrogen and phosphorus coming into the system that feeds or fertilizes the tiny plants in the water the phytoplankton and also the micro algae on the sediment those are in turn and food for tiny animals in the water column what we call zooplankton excuse me and fish and further up the food webs and birds in the sediments we have another food web um which which flows all the way up to some of the things that people like to like to catch like crabs and and so essentially we 're really trying to sort of close the loop of what we do in the catchment on the things that we like to enjoy within the system such as birds fish crabs and prawns um so in terms of management the way we 're using these these these models um one of the one of the ways we use them is for what we call decks space assessments so we have we have our what we call our model suite which is uh you know this this integrated system of models catchment hydrodynamic and ecological response models the catchment model gives us a a measure of our pressures and these and the hydrodynamic and ecological response models give us what the how the system responds so if we if we run that we can basically we can derive this sort of relationship between a the pressure in this case the production of total nitrogen from from a land use or from a catchment and relate that to the the production of microalgae in the system in this case the measure of chlorophyll a which peter talked about as one of the indicators in the scorecards and basically what we nitrogen from the catchment we get a positive increase in the amount of phytoplankton so we might the community based on their their expectations for clear water and no algal blooms may may require a a state as a state such as this um and that may well represent which is basically better than what we 've got now um so it 's in this case it 's 20 less than the existing total nitrogen loads from the catchment if under um projected population growth within the catchment we don 't we don 't do anything to control the storm water quality in the urban development we can expect total nitrogen loads to increase and therefore the chlorophyll in the system to increase if the the council implements uh business as usual um water sensitive urban design to that that new um that new development and retrofitting we may expect a slight improvement in the situation if there 's a concerted effort well if otherwise they may opt to maintain the current uh the current scenario if on the other hand they they opt to invest in improving the situation the chlorophyll a uh concentrations but of course all of these come with a price tag and it is basically then up to management to to make that cost-benefit analysis about how much they they spend and for the new the predicted outcomes so this is one one um really powerful use of the modeling suites that we develop um the other the other is to to to test or predict and uh the the the benefits for different management practices that 's mps um and in this case we 're looking at the the power of riparian fencing and upper catchment to up attachments to reduce stock access to waterways um and so basically we have we have the ability to predict how those interventions might play out in this this particular area of the catchment and when we run those through the model we can sort of see what the benefits of those those sort of schemes might be in this case a 40 reduction in total phosphorus loads for this particular sub catchment um we can also use the uh the modeling to to prioritize where catchment are faced with um a really wicked problem you know the the the the system is there 's the problem is absolutely huge and they have limited funds and they really need a tool to help them prioritize where to spend their money to to create the best bang for buck in this example i 'll just draw on some work we did in the lake macquarie catchment further south um which was looking at the the impact of wastewater overflows from the sewage sewer network um and you 'll notice in this map of modern sewer overflows they 're occurring everywhere during every storm event the sewer overflows and you get a discharge of raw sewage to the system so the question that we were answering was well where which of those overflows are having the greatest impact on the system and obviously it 's we could either guess we could use the south park approach or we can use our modeling suite and and and that 's what we 've done so we 've basically used the model to help us pinpoint where the most that the greatest greater surety about how they can best use their their uh limited resources um so i 'll leave it there um thanks for listening thank you to all of our special guests tonight that was great to hear from from all of you uh peter it was so it 's so great to hear from you and and peter told us about how we were tracking compared to the other estuaries um how important the long-term monitoring is to track the ecological health of our waterways and and that link between the predictive modeling and the management effectiveness which angus also touched on as well um it was great to hear aaron talk about the impact of our estuaries under different climatic conditions and like really this year we have faced the absolute big three the the worst three that you could get really we 've had extended period of drought followed by the bushfires followed by the flood and that that has really had an impact so it 's great to hear a little bit more about that and also angus talking about that modeling and how we can i 'm going to ask all of our presenters to join us on screen now please excellent uh so just again we 've got peter aaron angus and also purutaka from midcoast council so we 're going to just do this as a panel as i said add those questions in there and and we 'll start talking about them so i 'll start off with one for you peter so given the long term data that we have available uh in this area now with with so many years of the report card how long do you think it will take for our waterways to to possibly return to that there 's slightly better grades what we 're used to seeing now that we 've had these events that has has dropped the score so significantly okay that 's an interesting question we know that the systems react quite quickly to the inputs you know a matter of um weeks to months so if it had been any other year i 've said it 'll get better straight away but as aaron pointed out if very large amounts of more coastal lake systems there 's potential for effects that could last many many months um we might expect to see places like cap and gat which had the um the really bad uh fire in its catchment and or for exchange through its entrance then it might last through this summer but it 'll it 'll get better over time and in the larger systems the rivers and even wallace lake i 'd expect it to be um the effects of last year to be gone by the time we get around to this year this summer thank you um aaron i 'll direct the next one to you and i noticed that you did type an answer but um just to have it on camera so that everybody can hear so the question was asked after the fires uh when the soil becomes hydrophobic how long does it take until water infiltration returns to normal good question and i don 't know that 's the honest answer look um i have done little bits of reading about things like this the various forms of recovery and um what well to contact with water but we have no data on that so i couldn 't say anything um anything with confidence that that could go on i imagine the the hydrophobic soil is a very um spatially variable across the fire impacted systems um you know very probably driven by a number of factors the condition of the or the soil characteristics and the vegetation characteristics before the fire but also the fire severity probably impacted that um so yeah i don 't i don 't i can 't say for sure what how that would be how that would go no problem that 's that 's how science works sometimes i don 't know until we do little bit more research and see how things go yeah but i mean it 's a it 's probably a good question for a soil scientist so yeah but but maybe not not an aspirin ecologist uh angus i 'll direct the next one to you so it 's kind of a little bit of a double barrel question so first of all um what field data has been collected for there as well and then there 's also the question being asked and obviously this is quite relevant um both in the wallace catchment and also manning as well and probably some of our other areas um does the catchment model consider acid sulfate soils great questions um first off the sort of data that we collect for the catchment models um aside from things like land use um distribution um the really important data we need is stream flow or stream discharge and also the the concentration of the pollutants in the in the water in particular during a runoff event so we know that that as as the water starts to rise material starts to get washed off the catchment um and basically the concentration of the material in the water varies as it rises and um and drops um so we we basically we have a program uh where where possible we we go out and do what we call flow weighted sampling so that 's some sampling at the outlets of major catchments during a rainfall event to collect those sort of data and those they us a good idea of how much material is moving off the catchment in terms of the acid sulfate soil question the models that i presented are really focused on um on the movement of nutrients and sediments from upper catchments they 're not really suited for acid sulfate soils we are in we are in the process of developing uh a different subset of models which can it can deal with acid sulfate soils but essentially you 're dealing with a very different problem and a different environment one that is um pretty much restricted to the floodplains and they and very much associated with groundwater movement through um through those vax form acid sulfate soil environments so um yeah there there are there are different um kettle fish and we definitely have the conceptual uh ideas about how to deal with them but we 're currently sort of developing those models in in collaboration with various universities around the country excellent thank you so much uh let 's jump to the next one so uh peter i 'll jump back to you uh there 's a question about time how is the manning been tracking over the last five to seven years um noting that that some of the sites were only added in the last few years uh the report card so we 've got data back to 2014 in the in the manning and it 's actually remarkably stable um the the lower mounting estuary hasn 't changed grades since 2014 so it hasn 't gotten any better it hasn 't got any worse and the same for the mid manning and and the only change that we 've seen is is drop one grade sampling immediately after the big floods in the upper morning so so the manning is actually quite stable and um tracking longer to be which is quite quite a good score for such a large river excellent thank you uh so peru i 'm gonna throw to you next so um the question is obviously we 've had so many years of the report card now um what is council doing in reaction to these report card results what sort of management actions are they undertaking um do you have any yeah cool so um we 've had a couple of examples where the report cards really helped us focus our efforts so in the olamba river when the water quality improvement plan was presented to us um in 2009 we noted that the walamba river and piper 's bay were two areas of piper 's creek with two areas we were quite concerned about so in the willamba river we 've focused our efforts over a number of years to actually rehabilitate the waterway itself like the actual manning river estuary there 's some areas along the river map along the wallamba river estuary which are actually just eroding into the estuary so that 's a direct source of sediment into the estuary and over the years we 've been able to um put erosion control by the way of um rock phillips in that location over six nearly six and a half kilometers of of river which is which is a great story to tell we 're also focusing on the woolamba catchment this this last financial year we 've identified three key locations where we 're stabilizing um really big source of sediment because you 're capturing all of the water off of those dirt roads and and that ends up into the river and then eventually into the estuary so we 've put some effort into the catchment in especially around those erosion issues the piper 's creek now this has been a real focus and particularly for my work program um piper 's creek actually drains the majority of foster so it has urban runoff um from a lot of land that hasn 't actually had any treatment so as you know when it rains in these hard surfaces that water 's fast-tracked into our estuary without treatment so what we tried to do in this part in this space is identify locations on public land where we could insert some sort of more natural systems into the into the interpreted urban urban form and that includes things like wetlands which naturally filter nutrients and sediments out of the stormwater and other filters like retention now we 've identified a lot of locations we 've got a few more to go but the other thing we in wallace smith the mile lakes is we 've put in place a development control plan for water quality and that development control plan puts controls on development so that no new impacts occur as a result of those developments going ahead so they need to manage their own stormwater on-site filter and treat it before it ends up into our estuaries so there 's a couple of examples is there any uh points or structural installations being installed um we have asked about and gavin thank you for the question um post-fire sediment entering the waterways um but i think really when we 're not looking necessarily directly at at the um point sources for post-fire sediment but crew did you want to talk a little bit about um what 's it and the things that we 're undertaking in order to try and stop all sources of pollution entering the waterways sure thanks erin so what i was talking about before was the um the focus on um water sensitive urban design and building natural features into the urban form in order to filter sediments and nutrients out the estuaries but just um in response to the fires yes you can put in place physical structures to slow down the water and to stop the runoff from entering into the estuaries one thing you can also do is just restore those natural systems so council staff have worked really hard to to get grants more recently to put in place some of those actions we 've got a few grants underway the first project is a three-year program that will undertake works on those fire affected lands and that will include things like bush regeneration the removal of weeds planting local tree species and koala food trees and installing nest boxes for the fauna that 's been displaced as a result of the fire there 's also an aspect of monitoring in that program to look at the recovery of that fauna and and that natural ecosystem in addition to this there 's we 've recently received funding for a one-year program and that 's to focus on the areas at minibar and qatar to help protect endangered species like the giant dragonfly and also a couple of year weed management program so obviously weeds are some of the primary colonisers in those fire affected areas and restoring our systems to their natural form is really the focus of this project and if you put in place the more natural ecosystem then there 's more chance that those systems with their deep breed of vegetation will start to operate more naturally and filter the nutrients and sediments out of out of any runoff so that program goes right across our local government area and it 's going to have a lot of on-ground works and that 'll happen over public and private land so there 's some exciting projects underway thank you um this one 's for you aaron and this is an interesting one something that i 've not necessarily thought about before um could the burnt material that enters the waterway provide nutrient to things like seagrass communities is there any any benefits to that side of things yeah it 's a good question um i have a partial answer that i might throw to angus to kind of finish me off but i mean i a double whammy of pressure um when it comes to responding to the fires firstly from the fact that initial those initial impact conditions that i showed before with lots of um fine ash material being sent out into the into the waterway which really reduces the light climate it 's the main thing it 's relying on for growth so that would have been a shock to the system definitely but then i 'd imagine also the the um bio-available nutrients that are available in the water column as the you know through that feedback loop that i showed you seagrass now has probably com it 's facing competition from phytoplankton growth and macroalgal growth as well that it would also be in there opportunistically utilizing that glut of bioavailable nutrients so yes providing nutrition for them um or providing you know competition i 'm not really sure um angus maybe you want to add something to that um no well i think you i think you sort of really nailed it um in terms of what we know um but i think uh i 'll just just um survey of uh fire affected catchments in the south coast and um our team that went down there to do to do surveys reported that virtually every sea glass bed they saw um the seagrass was looking unhealthy and had was was basically brown um especially in the shallow areas so we really don 't have an adequate explanation for that yet um it could be some sort of the the the after effects of some sort of acute exposure to to um fire runoff or an ongoing you know um effect of pyrogenic material on those communities so essentially that 's you know it 's one of those uh things that 's been we 've been alerted to that we we didn 't know you know from from being proactive and monitoring these things excellent um yeah showing showing how that science and research is so important and ongoing we we don 't always know everything we need to keep researching and monitoring and finding out new things which is fantastic um peter i 'll check the next one to you um how does the mending school compared to and you 're on mute what 's a catchphrase for 2020. yes um i didn 't have it on hand so i 've radically been trying to look for it um the general it 's much better so the last three times we 've done the richmond river it 's scored a d b and a c um whereas the manning 's consistently been a b so uh and the tweed was a c b and a c and and again the manning 's consistently b so it 's in slightly better condition um than the richmond and the tweed thank you for quickly looking them up for us that 's an issue um see how it is comparing to others um aaron there 's one here for you um i 'll just get on my horse a little bit more and that that um that illustrates the benefit of making sure that our monitoring is consistent across the state and making sure that the work that you 're doing is consistent with the statewide program because we can now start to make those those sorts of comparisons yeah and it is not just we 're not just here in isolation that 's where we 're part of a larger area so it 's nice to see um aaron i 'll talk back to you with this one any insight into sedimentation as one of the impacts of fires particularly in relation to shallowing and sediment sinks yeah it 's a good question again um and this touches on things that peter and i said in the presentations given i mean the fact that after the fires there was you know four times the monthly average of rainfall in in a couple of days it remains to be seen that there probably is sedimentation impacts but where they exacerbated by the fire um i guess the point i 'm trying to say is at that scale of rainfall and that scale of runoff there was going to be um mass amounts of sediment exported from the catchments of all the systems anyway so yeah it 's hard to say if you 're if we 're out sampling um and you know we 're collecting sediment concentrations in in during flood milligrams a liter or something when you normally you 're getting around two or three is that made worse by fires or is this is that just a flood signal it 's hard to say so um yeah so i definitely think at that scale of um rainfall event and the subsequent runoff there would be issues there probably is issues with um sediment built up in the system a lot of it would have been exported straight through the ocean in a lot of systems but when it did fall out there would be small changes but again um when you ask questions about before and after you 'd like to especially i saw in that in the q and a um there 's a question about the imagery so is it making areas more shallow um you would need a really comprehensive before survey and then after survey to answer that question comprehensively i can i can probably jump in um based on some data from one of our collaborators at southern cross university they had a long-term data set um collected by citizen science groups in the of the fire the the suspended sediment concentrations were five to ten fold higher than any other rainfall event previous so um they 're really you know and and also other other materials like phosphorus and nitrogen were many many times greater than in previous so there 's there 's that 's that 's you know direct evidence that the fires had a huge impact um and also we 've um we 've got uh photos from um from national parks down in kosciuszko um that showed drifts of sediment that burying roads by up to what was it peter you know nearly two meters yeah nearly two metres so basically you know massive um mud mud flows uh covering you know moving down these these um these systems after the fires but but i also think that everything that we 've said is that anger said is true that the amount of centering in the water and that creates shading problems for plants and things like that but the reality of that once it settles out is it really only represents a few millimeters of you know a few we need to separate this idea that the the sediment suspended in the water column is critical for many processes but it doesn 't necessarily lead in the estuaries um i 'm talking about not up in the rivers but in the estuaries to large changes in the depth of the estuaries it 's pretty much every time we 've looked at these questions of massive shallowing it 's been found to not be supported by the evidence that we can get but up in the rivers it 's a real issue i guess my just one final comment would be that i think that the impact of the sediment export in relation to the fires is that um while the catchments are still recovering there isn 't great vegetative cover um in all those at all those strata levels um you there 's going to be more material moved out um during the smaller events that wouldn 't normally mobilize material from a vegetated catchment so i think there 's probably um yeah like ongoing problems with sediment export and what that means for how it 's deposited into recover and it can start to to shore everything up again thank you all for jumping in there that that 's an excellent answer um so we 're starting to get close to the end of our time um there is one more question though uh that i 'm going to direct at peter but what i might actually do is i know that we have a great um graphic that will help you answer this question so just before we jump to peter i 'm just going to share my screen and show you where you can access all of this information tonight so we 've talked about the um the report card and the document itself is now available on our website so i 'm just going to bring that up for you wait for a moment okay so hopefully you can see this now um so this is the actual page on our our website so if you just go to midcoast council and type report card into the search function at the top here and and navigate to 2020 waterway and cat report card so all that you can actually watch from earlier this evening as well with our technical report which has a little bit more information uh on the science behind and and the actual results itself we 've also got the raw data included there for you to look at and our fact sheet on uh waterways and how they 're affected by bushfire one and then we 've got the report card document itself so here we are um with our great uh michael um who came and did our sampling for us this year showing how we actually undertake sampling now on the cover but peter the question that was actually asked was how oh it 's actually the wrong document sorry put in the wrong just one moment and i 'll bring it up okay so here 's the report and default incentives that you can actually print into um but peter question how does the entries respond to different um events so did you want to just chat about that and talk about this this graphic that was on the back here that talks about different estuary types as interaction between the the rain and and the river flow or the waterway flow uh and what 's in that water so when the water runs off the catchment it brings nutrients in now the plants grow in response to those nutrients but they don 't do it instantaneously it takes hours to days to grow if the water 's moving through the system so quickly that the microscopic algae gets swept away and they don 't grow quickly we actually don 't see a very strong response to the introduction of nutrients and that 's largely what happens in the big rivers if you have a small amount of rain that brings the nutrients in it doesn 't increase the flow then you see quite a strong response in the rivers because a lot of nutrients being brought in but the water 's not going so fast it washes it all away if you 've got high rainfall then the stuff gets washed through the river as quickly as the plants can grow and so we don 't see a strong response and that 's what we saw in hand if the water tends to get trapped in the system or move through the system very slowly which is the case in the mile lakes or capping out or wallace lakes then the nutrients are present for a much longer period of time and the algae are stimulated and able to grow and you see a strong response so it 's a bit counter-intuitive that in some circumstances when lots of stuff is washed in um if the waters are moving through like we 've got a flood then we don 't see a very strong response until the waters start to slow down slow down again but if you 're in a a system where you don 't have strong flows then you see a strong response um and that 's what we 've tried to explain in the graphics that 's on the screen um and that 's included in the report card so once again i would like to say thank you so much to peter aaron angus and proof for joining us this evening thank you so much for presenting and then also for answering the attendees that came i know it 's you 're giving up an evening um sort of around that downtime as well so we thank you so much for coming and being interested in what 's happening in our waterways we we couldn 't do this without you so thank you so much for attending and we hope to see you again in a future event [Music] you _"

    "text": "so [Music] hi my name 's shane mcclay i am an author a spiritual teacher and a consultant to the funeral industry and i 'm here today to share with you some conversations around death and dying for the past three years now i 've been working with midcoast council to bring an increased awareness around the subject of death and dying through the dying to no days and due to covert obviously we can 't go out and have the conversations in person that we 've been having so we 're now doing that through this medium and we hope that the information contained in these videos will help you help you make informative decisions help you have courageous conversations around death and dying with your family members and with the people in your lives death isn 't something that is taboo we can 't avoid it and by not talking about it won 't make it go away so to have an intelligent conversation with the people in our lives not only helps them understand what your final wishes are but it also gives them insight into who to have these conversations promote them amongst your family and friends talking around the subject of death dying and funerals won 't make it visit you anytime soon but it will help your family members and your loved ones have a better understanding about what you want as your final goodbye your funeral is your last opportunity to have your say i guess and to to have people remember who you truly were the essence of you as an individual a lot of people fail to communicate their wishes for a funeral and you end up with unfortunately what i would call a cookie cutter funeral where some nice music is played a couple of eulogies and it 's all over it 's really empowering to know that that isn 't what a funeral has to be a funeral should be a reflection of your life it should be a gathering of your friends your family the people who knew you and loved you and it should be a celebration of who you were and are so to settle for something less than that is a real disservice and unfortunately where because of our western culture and and our i guess denial of death and our embracement of material things we don 't want to talk about death and we don 't want to have those conversations that might make us feel uncomfortable or our loved ones feel uncomfortable but your funeral is your last opportunity to say goodbye and for people to say goodbye to you and i would like to refer to it more as a celebration of your life and the establishment of your legacy grief is a very normal part of life and it 's really important to understand that firstly there are no rules around grief or grieving there 's no time frame there 's no period of time that should pass before grief disappears we 're all unique in how we approach things how we 're made up our life experiences so therefore how we respond to grief and how we process grief will be different for each and every one of us so it 's really important that you understand this because grief is very real but it 's also important to know grief is it 's the process that happens when we lose something or someone that 's valuable or valued in our life so grief is actually the beginning of the healing process and do we ever stop missing somebody that we have loved no do our emotions and feelings change around the loss probably not and in most cases no but what 's important to recognize is that you have to let grief unfold in its own timing and you have to recognize when you need to reach out and ask for help it 's important to surround yourself with people who will encourage you and lift you up and help you through the process anyone who tells you that you just need to get over it doesn 't know what they 're talking about grief is real and it 's natural and you need to let it unfold in its own timing and don 't deny grief when it raises its head just go with it and let let that process unfold within you and as i said before when you need to ask for help don 't be a little bit about spirituality because whether you consider yourself religious or spiritual or not when it comes to your funeral if you haven 't communicated your wishes and your position people are going to make those decisions for you so it 's really important that you have had conversations around your belief system what 's important to you what what what the things that matter in your life and have significance from a spiritual or slash religious perspective it 's really important that you communicate your wishes around your spiritual slash religious views because ultimately if you haven 't done that the people left behind to make decisions for you will make those decisions based on assuming they know what you wanted what you believed in and what you thought there is no greater injustice than for somebody to be misrepresented or somebody 's spiritual position to be misrepresented at their funeral service in my view it 's a real tragedy and unfortunately it happens time and time again because people haven 't had those conversations around their wishes their belief systems what they view as spirituality or their position it 's okay to be completely immersed in a religious ritual or it 's okay just to be spiritual whatever is who you are is how it should be and i can 't stress that enough we see so many times the funeral process where boxes are ticked because people don 't know what to do spirituality is a very personal thing and we 've all been told i 'm sure you have that not to discuss politics or religion the world has changed since those times and those children should be seen and not heard comments we 've emerged into a much more awakened world where people take more responsibility and more interest in their own spirituality some of the traditional spiritual and religious concepts no longer work or apply to people 's lives and that 's okay it 's really important that again you communicate what your views are on those things so that people left behind to make decisions and to plan funeral services get it right if you haven 't had those conversations in the past or made those plans yourself it 's really important if you haven 't educated them on your position from a spiritual perspective or a religious perspective then they 're going to fill in the blanks and that could leave you really unhappy with the end result so have the courageous conversations don 't be afraid to talk about death and dying and if you haven 't thought about pre-arranging your funeral or pre-planning your funeral service now 's probably a good time there are a lot of people you can talk to any funeral director or any funeral celebrant or someone like myself and just have conversations and get some guidance and direction there are no obligations and it 's all about arming yourself with correct information unfortunately around the funeral topic and the subjects of death and dying there are so many myths urban myths that are completely incorrect and unfortunately that comes from a lack of education and a fear of having the conversations about death and dying so look at it in the sense that you 're actually taking control of the very last event in your life so you want to talk about living life your life well why would you hand the very last act of living over to somebody else and have had no input into that whole process it 's very important to think about these things to sit down with your loved ones and have those you know conversations that you might think are tough but after you 've had them you know you 're going to learn more about your loved ones they 're going to learn more about you and you know we should be talking more anyway in this age of uh digital and social media we should be having face-to-face conversations and getting to the depth of who we are on a daily basis it 's healthy for all of us so have those conversations don 't be afraid you 're not going to invite the grin reaper into your lounge room if you have that conversation we are all going to one day meet the same end and having a conversation around it will not preempt that death is a very natural part of living it is the flow of life and when we have some those things it makes it all a whole lot less scary so i hope this has helped you and i would encourage you to reach out to any of the people in these videos for some direction some guidance some advice we are a community of people that actually care about this subject and we actually care about people like yourself making informed and educated decisions about your final goodbye good morning my name 's colin rose and i have recently retired after 47 years in general practice in tahree i 've had the privilege during those years of looking after so many families as they 're born as they go through the challenges of life and as they prepare to die and it 's a great privilege to be here today to share some of my observations with you it 's interesting when one looks back over 30 years how fortunately things have loosened up in our approach to death we 're much more open now in talking about the death of loved ones and our own deaths hopefully compared to those 30 40 years ago when death was like to share some of these feelings with you that preparing for death is a privilege it need not be scary for you or for the people around you each of you have got a part to play in you arriving at having a good death the first thing i 'd like to examine is the question of who needs to talk about death with you my experience is if nobody talks to someone who 's approaching death they can often be quite frightened and isolated and longing to talk about issues so you don 't have to feel embarrassed by this and this preparation doesn 't have to come just in the last couple of weeks it can start months ahead if someone knows they have a progressive degenerating sort of disease it 's helpful if you 've got as a patient a little group of people carers and supporters around you who know where you 're up to and similarly you have an idea of where they 're up to because after your death they 're the ones who need to pick up the threat threads and and move on after you 've gone i think it 's really important that we realise that the patient remains the centre of any of our efforts to help prepare for death and family members doctors and others are all part of that team but it 's the patient who remains the the key pin in our preparation the other thing i 'd like to draw attention to is that many people have not had experience of watching someone prepare to die and perhaps sitting with them while they die we so often learn of death through newspaper articles or fairly vicious confronting pictures on television when in fact the vast majority of deaths are as simple as taking the next breath and that isn 't always possible i realize that but that 's what we should as carers be aiming for i think it 's very appropriate for people to share their thoughts of what sort of burial preparations they would like and disposal and i know there are trained people in this area talking as part of this program i think it 's certainly okay for a person approaching know because this certainly in my experience a real feeling of satisfaction at the end of a funeral when the family can leave and say we 've given such and such person what they wanted and this helps one move on there are all sorts of different combinations of things which are needed to help patients themselves and sorry i refer to patients when i should say people perhaps that 's an old custom i 'm afraid but patients themselves so often i find are not frightened of the process of dying these people may have spiritual beliefs they may not but it 's what goes before death that often frightens them the first thing that they usually request particularly of me as a doctor is that they be relieved of pain they also need to be relieved of anxiety and they need to be relieved of the feeling of copping out on family members who are going to be left behind the relief of pain obviously is of prime concern to a doctor in attendance and i 'm not blowing our own trumpets as doctors when i say it to include him or her in these preparations and discussions over the years i 've been struck a few times by people when i start talking about actually how they 'll die relieved people haven 't wanted to talk to them and they felt isolated and frightened and the classic situation from a doctor 's point of view is you can be visiting someone in hospital and the the patient is looking apprehensive and obviously wants to ask questions but feel they can 't and when you leave the parent the family i should say will catch you outside the door and start asking you all the things that should be asked in front of you the patient and it 's really important to include the patient in all of these activities it helps normalize things and it helps give people accurate information because quite often their expectations of what might happen are slewed by their experience with other friends or as i say with television and newspaper articles so helping them reach a point of death prepared and knowing how you 're going to respond as carers around them over a few weeks there is really nothing that one can 't ask as a patient preparing to die of the carers around you and it helps you maintain a feeling of authority and control over your own preparation i say this in terms of people having widely different needs but if you keep the patient involved and talking and listening as carers i think it 's very well done i 'd like just to finish with an anecdote which always strikes me as perhaps very very special i had the privilege of caring for a lady as she died just out of tahree i 'd been to see her a few times at home i was aware of her son-in-law mowing the lawn outside the door the room where she was and i liked the smell of fresh grass coming through the window and i thought oh this is what aromatherapy is that severe and eye opener as a doctor but most important this lady literally took her last breath three or four for family members there and after about five minutes her little granddaughter aged about six disappeared checking to see whether she could be involved reached forward with a little pair of scissors and snipped the long hairs off grandma 's chin everyone looked a bit taken back but this little girl said nanny told me when she died and she has died hasn 't she doctor manny told me when she died i could snip the whiskers off her chin and keep them and i thought that was a really great thing to do thank you for listening today and i hope this compiled information from so many talented people will help you re-look at the question of dying and how you might like to do it hello my name 's david freeman i 'm a pastor in the uniting church but i deal a lot with people to do with death and dying it 's a great privilege to be able to talk with families and individuals when there 's somebody has died today i 'd like to talk particularly about children and young people when they die for children under the age of seven they deal with death quite differently from children over the to teenagers as well sometimes death comes to them in the form that it might be a grandparent or it might be a pet it might be a friend of theirs who 's died and they then have to try and work that out in their own little minds about how to deal with it when children are little when they 're as i say under the age of seven they deal with things that uh appear real but aren 't necessarily real so things like the easter bunny the santa claus to the tooth fairy are very real to these children so when saying to children about heaven and for places that may not appear physically real to them they can really adopt those principles very easily it 's always worthwhile to listen to what children are saying recently i came across a little girl and she was she 'd really suffered lots and times in her young life from asthma and it was through this this uh having asthma she came from playing outside and she knew when she was getting an attack of asthma and she came and she said look it 's okay mum you don 't have to do too much my angel said to me that i 'm going to be with her soon and i can tell you that she did she passed away this little girl and her mother had great comfort in the fact that she 'd listened to her daughter she 'd listen to her and the comfort that she 'd got by addressing the fact that for her it was very real about her angel children can often see things that we can 't see children can often relate stories about what we would call make-believe people but it 's very real i really encourage you if you have a child who is ill or is seeing things to listen to them to honour their stories of course the other thing is that when children are being told that someone dies they sometimes go through the the feeling of feeling it 's their fault it 's really important not to blame children when someone dies you know children might have had an argument they might have been naughty they but it 's not about their fault and it 's really important to stress to children that it 's not their fault children cope with death in lots of different ways some children hibernate some children withdraw into themselves some children like to chatter and talk about it i like to think of it sometimes as being a bit like a daisy so with a daisy you 've got a middle of a daisy that 's you or that 's me and children like to when they 're very tiny go away for a little while and then come back go away for a little while and come back go away for a little while and come back it 's a bit like you 're the pedal station and they go away for a little time and come back but as they get a little bit older they go away for a little bit longer they go away for a bit longer then of course when they 're teenagers or older they go away for a lot longer and go away for a lot longer but they come back they come back to this central core and that 's you they see where their anchors are you might be a grandparent you might be a parent you might be an auntie or an uncle or a good just a good friend but it 's about being there for them that 's what 's really important for children for older children it 's a little bit of a different and it 's it 's different for boys and for girls for children younger than seven they 're mostly the same whether they 're boys or girls but when they get older boys will sort of start to become wanting to become a bit more manly wanting to become a bit more independent a bit more cool whereas girls like to flurry together they like to get together in in little groups they like to talk to each other boys not so much boys will often become very quiet boys will often peel away from their groups particularly as i said not necessarily being cool not it 's not cool to cry it 's not cool to show your emotions and so hug and a cuddle just as well as the girls do they need to be treated with dignity but with comfort as well as they go over the age of 12 things change you 've got of course puberty happening and little girls tend to grow up a little bit quicker than boys and so they tend to have a bit more of a mature outlook but inside they 're just as soft as they were they 're just still little girls or little boys as they get older in teenagers they start to find that there are people like their grandparents or their aunties or uncles that that die die for various reasons they might be older they may be that they 've got cancer they may have been killed tragically in a car accident every now and again they might find someone who 's died as a result of suicide in older children older teenagers sometimes they will find that their friends have taken their own life and that 's really sad when that happens and the ripple effect is enormous similar when there 's been a car just begun to drive and they 've had a car accident they 've either been seriously maimed or they might have died as a result of that that vehicle accident and it 's such a sad thing and the ripple effect is enormous in a community you 've got the parents and all their friends you 've got the grandparents and all their friends you 've got the aunties and uncles and all their friends if the child 's still at school they 've it 's all the teachers and all their school friends and then of course you 've got brothers and sisters and girlfriends and boyfriends and mates and people like that it 's it 's very it 's very sad for them it can affect a small community in a much different way to say someone involved in a in an urban environment such as a big city but it 's good to be able to understand for children what it is like for them one of the resources i use are books and i 'll sometimes visit a family and i 'll give them a stack different books picture books particularly children 's picture books and often you 'll find them in your town library if they haven 't got many in your town library i 'd encourage the librarian to have a look at what resources that they can produce for the community and they might and don 't be taken out much in the first 12 months but then they 'll become bursts of times when when those libraries are the books are taken out of the library altogether books such as the heart and the bottle they 're very good books for children just to be able to sit it on your coffee table and the child will pick it up just when they want it it might be a teenager or it might be a younger child but it 's about letting them decide when they want to pick it up and what they want to read i 'd suggest that you get a couple of books different books have got different effects for different children there are some quite educational books there 's a whole series of books like this one particularly good for little children who can read themselves but it 's also good to read to children the same book is actually produced here in this this book and it 's a big picture book to read to a lot of children some schools have borrowed this book from me and they 've photographed each page and then put it up on a powerpoint so that a school can understand what it 's like if a teacher dies or a student dies there are lots of different resources things like little teddy bears little hearts these are really handy resources these are called a palm heart and just to roll it around in your palm something tactile to hold on to for some children it may be a cross a cross or a religious background or it may be prayer beads they might have significant meaning and there 's things that are tactile for children to get a hold of let me encourage you firstly to believe what children are seeing and saying but also to understand that for what children want to do is to talk about it need to be left alone they need to be listened to let me encourage you to seek help seek help from a counsellor seek help from someone who might know them and let them in their own time have an anchor in someone they know and love thank you very much well my name is sarah julian i 'm a civil celebrant based in foster tung curry on the mid north coast and i 'm here to just tell you a few things about how the process goes uh when your employer celebrant to help you with your loved one 's funeral or memorial service so usually if you don 't approach a celebrant yourself you 'll go through a funeral director who will contact a male or female of your choice sometimes they are religious i 'm a civil celebrant so i don 't include religion unless you request it when a funeral director does approach me then i come and see you and your family we sit down we have some time together we get to know one another and i learn all about your loved one through is to celebrate the person 's life i like to share stories i like to gather tributes and memories from family members and close friends and i put it all together to create a really loving memorial or farewell or funeral service for you and your family with a civil celebrant we are able to include anything you would like within your loved ones farewell rituals um any little special type of celebration you would like we do floral tributes we can have petals we can do sand ceremonies there are so many things that we can do it 's that only your imagination is the limit which is a wonderful thing you select your music with us again i don 't think there is a wrong choice of music for somebody 's farewell we all have different tastes and music can definitely be representative of a person and remind all of those in attendance of the person that we are there to farewell i like to spend an hour or more with my families and i like to really get to know the person through discussion through hearing stories 's life and to find out more about their life story when i meet with a family i very quickly find a connection and there 's always a connection i don 't know what it is about the way that we end up with the families we do but it 's a very very special gift and a real privilege to do the job that we do do and to be able to become part of a family just for a short amount of time it can be a few days it can be a few weeks i 've done thousands of funeral services in my 13 years on the mid north coast as a celebrant i started off my job as a funeral celebrant and i will continue to do this job until i can do it no more it 's easy to process with a celebrant your friend or director will line you up with the right person and you are free to decide if you feel compatible with that person or not there is no obligation to use the person that they send to you but most i have a great passion for funerals for farewells i have done some bereavement work before with parents who have lost children i 'm a bereaved parent myself so i have done a little bit of grief counselling over the years which is of great benefit to the job that i do now i 'm also a former ambulance officer so i guess the empathy and compassion that i have comes from within and i really enjoy utilizing all those skills when dealing with bereaved families with a celebrant doing this role we 're very very flexible anything that you would like amended changed or added to your loved ones farewell is completely easily done it 's easily completed by us and i know personally i make changes even up to the minute the ceremony begins and sometimes i 'm interrupted during a service to add a last-minute speaker or you know add a few extra details which is no problem either during a service we like to offer things like a visual tribute that 's where we have a slideshow of photos with music behind it so that you 's a really lovely thing to do and we can do that just in the middle of a service whether we 're indoors or outdoors these days we 're very lucky that we 're able to use technology to its fullest effect and there are lots of little things that we can use today that they wouldn 't have been able to do in the past we can live stream a service we can play videos and we can use you know homemade film clips that people have been dancing in the kitchen and it 's a nice little reminder of what they were like as a person and the character that they encompassed i like to invite people to speak not out in the open at a service we like to pre-arrange that so i know who is going to speak but everyone 's welcome to have input i really like the idea of tributes as well so i encourage people that aren 't quite so comfortable to get up and speak in front of a room full of people to write down a memory and hand it to olden days it 's a really nice way of getting a few more stories from people and being able to celebrate that person 's life with other members of their family and their close friends again it 's just quite a simple process to for us to plan a funeral or a farewell we do this full-time i 'm do i do this full-time monday to monday to sunday i can be in any location at any time and any day that you choose and we definitely make sure that we honor your loved one the best way we can and include any rituals or stories memories that you would like us to do so we look forward to taking care of you your family and a loved one and thank you very much for your time my name 's anna hutchinson i 'm from hutchinson family funerals we 've been in the area for almost 50 years starting with my grandparents ellis and hope then my dad terry and now myself i remember as a little girl i would beg my part to let me do what he was do this so now here i am and i often wonder what he would think would he be still thinking little girls don 't do this or would be would he be quite proud of what i do now to continue to help the families of our community no question about funerals is a silly question because if you don 't ask you don 't know all sorts of misconceptions or things that you believed when you 're a child may not actually be true so the best way to find out whether it is or not is to ask and we 're always happy to answer any questions with us being directly opposite the hospital we often have people approach us immediately after they 've had a loved one pass and it can be really overwhelming for them what do they do next how do they go about arranging a funeral and we can sit explain options talk through what their loved one may have wanted to have and how they would like to honour their loved one to say farewell whether it be with a simple graveside service minister involved and it really comes down to knowing what your choices are and where they 're to help guide you and to weave it all together for a suitable farewell there 's so many benefits to having a pre-arranged funeral where you can stipulate the things that you would like it also eases the burden on the loved ones that you do leave behind once you have passed you can choose as intricately as what songs you 'd like to have played a preferred time you can even write your own eulogy we 've had many occasions where we have sealed envelopes that are not to be opened until the person has passed and it can be quite a surprise but it can be quite a relief for the family left behind as to what mum or dad had wanted to have happen it 's really important to when you have made plans for yourself that you let someone know whether you keep a business card of your chosen funeral director in your wallet or on the fridge and it 's a good conversation starter we have literature that a conversation with their children or with their partner and so they can express what it is that they would like to have and reassure them that choices have been made well good afternoon everybody lloyd from wt health funerals here this afternoon just to talk to you a bit a little bit about pre pre-planning your funeral service uh so i 'm going to talk about pre-paid quickly talk about prepaids pre-arrangement and and what a bond is uh just so starting with uh with uh pre-arrangement of course it 's just we just take your personal details and and we note them down keep them on record keep them on file your wishes and that 's down to your music and the place of your choice of funeral service and even down to your minister and your flowers you can just store them but there is no money paid to you or paid to us um we can we keep all those on record on file and when the time of need comes we we take those out and we 'll follow through those wishes with your family afternoon is is pre-paying so pre-paying is you again you decide your funeral service in advance of your of your of your of the day and uh we again note down and itemize out each the the the parts of the funeral service you would like so where you 're going to to have your service down to your flowers your dvd the coffin choice where your burial plot whether you 're cremated or buried that will all be noted and also retained from information but what you do do is you pay for that service in advance you paid in full in advance that way everything that you do pay for has already been paid for at today 's prices so there is uh from from our components that we that we are able to control uh we 'll we will honor those at today 's prices your other parts that you that you may choose as options to your funeral service they 're a contribution towards your uh towards your funeral service so if there 's a newspaper notice and you 've contributed 110 dollars and it turns only minimal amount for the family to pay thereafter the the other other option is is to choose a what they call a bond so a bond is a nominated value of money eight thousand dollars ten thousand whatever you nominate uh that nominated value uh is is is a a contribution i guess to your to your funeral service uh again you can note down what you would like but the service will be uh undertaken at the time of need uh once that 's that happened all the the account is settled with the with the funds from those monies from the bond we make the claim and any residual money does get returned to the family as a as a lump sum uh to be in return either to the estate or to it to the individual that 's been making the arrangements for the funeral service um so they 're the three primary uh forms of pre-arrangement pre-paid type situations that may occur prior to you uh prior to your your your passing away so you can have your control your input you can decide what not leading up to somebody else to to to to make those decisions for you you have input into those and uh a lot of people have that um like that option and choice to be able to to say this is what i want to have rather than living up to other family members to make their decisions and choices so thanks again for listening this afternoon thank you i 'm chris from becca family funerals in tahrir and for 20 years now we 've been celebrating people 's lives and conducting their funeral services in this magnificent manning valley our basic role within the community as we see it is simply just that to celebrate life our funeral experience allows us to guide you through the decision-making process and to perform all the necessary and legal requirements to lose someone you love is an extremely confronting time especially when a person passes suddenly without recording their end of life funeral wishes today i would like to talk with you about planning ahead in life we plan for all occasions whether they be financial or emotional journeys we celebrate and so many other important occasions with all this said why shouldn 't we plan our own end of life celebration our funeral in fact many people do as funeral directors we see the benefits of such planning ahead planning ahead offers a real sense of relief families are not left wondering about the most basic choices of whether a person 's wishes were for burial or for creation whether they wanted a religious or not quite so religious service where would they have liked their service to be held in a chapel a church or an outdoor service so how do we plan ahead it 's really quite simple find a funeral director that you feel comfortable with give them a call to make an appointment the funeral director will begin by recording all the information required for registration purposes with birth steps and marriages such as your full name as recorded on your birth certificate your date of birth and place of birth all your marriage details your children 's names and their dates of birth and also your parents full names once this information has been recorded choices for example what type of service would you prefer a religious service or a service conducted by a celebrant are your wishes for cremation or burial where would you like your service to be held do you require funeral announcements and notices to be created have you considered donations in lieu of flowers to a charitable institution would you like the funeral director to organise after funeral catering are you an ex-service person would you like an ex-service tribute included in your funeral the funeral director will record the music of your choice or the hymns of your choice and offer you the option of creating a visual tribute the funeral director would then show you the types of coffins and floral tributes available the biggest benefits of planning ahead are you are getting the exact funeral of your choice and just as importantly you have relieved your family from guessing what you may have wanted some people go one step further in their planning ahead they decide to pre-pay for their funeral service in advance to pre-pay your funeral the investment must be held with a separate body keeps up with the inflation rate of the funeral so in simple terms while you adhere to the itemized funeral contract you pay at today 's prices and never pay anymore to pre-plan your funeral gives true peace of mind and to pre-pay for your funeral makes real economic sense thank you for listening make an appointment today with your local funeral director pre-planning for yourself relieves the burden from the ones you love most thank you so [Music] you _"

filming here because this is all this is actually the first time for midcoast library or midcoast council that we 've actually run an online gardening workshop so it 's all new territory obviously at the moment we 're going through a global pandemic the coronavirus some people are joining us from melbourne and they 're in lockdown um but others in the country i mean we 're all experiencing it all over the world um this year and last year we 've experienced fires and floods in our area and often when it happens there 's a downturn in people 's incomes so this kind of makes people look inwards and basically it 's when permaculture has a massive peak in interest which is what 's happening right around the world at the moment so permaculture is all about it 's a holistic ecological design system for creating sustainable balcony a suburban block or in my case it 's on acreage but once upon a time i had a tiny little suburban uh a little uh balcony garden where i grew heaps of tomatoes and cucumbers and so much produce i was actually giving it away to my friends and family so don 't think if you 've got a tiny little space that you can 't uh grow some of your own produce it 's really possible so we 're going to get into this um little um demo this is the first little demo here so just let me know hopefully you can see what i 'm doing here so first of all i 'm just going to give you a bit of a okay so we 're just we 've um this is actually a composting bay so you 've got a um it 's actually a rammed earth sort of area but basically you can build a composting bay out of anything old timber pallets or whatever and we 've actually collected a um a little bathtub you can see here we just got that can do raised garden beds you can use so many different things for raised garden beds it could even be an old refrigerator that 's tipped on its side and you know you can use it as a wicking bed uh but as i said in this case today we 're using an old bathtub which we 've been using for quite a few years to grow a few veggies on in so um i 'll just set up the camera just let me know hopefully it 's on the right angle they 're in a bit of a shady spot but anyway that 's fine okay so basically your garden probably looks a bit like mine at this time of the year we 're coming to the end of um sort of autumn winter crops so you know basically you start off by just you know clearing out the weeds a lot of weeds in permaculture for example this one here is called chickweed it 's actually full of nitrogen and for us in a permaculture system we aren 't afraid of weeds although obviously they can be annoying the chickens or the worms um so yeah they can also have a lot of uses uh in a permaculture system so but for the time being once we 've sort of ripped them out we 'll feed them over to the chickens so basically i 'm just sort of clearing out all this old old stuff and you 'll see um that what we 're left with is some very dry crumbly sort of soil um obviously when you 've you know planted your new crop um sorry when you 're pulling out your old crops they 've actually depleted the soil of so all of the nutrients so so what we need to do and and uh that you know the thing that we need to do the most when we 're growing veggies is to actually replenish those nutrients in the soil so the other thing obviously you need to grow your veggies is full sun or at least four to five hours of sun a day so if you don 't have either of those things the good soil the moisture and so forth then you veggie garden so what i like to do is actually so obviously there 's a lot of roots and things sort of big clumps of roots left over in the soil and i 'm not too worried about them they can stay so what i want to do is actually i 'm going to jump into this hopefully you can see my self and i 'm just actually jumping in and i 'm going to rock rock that back and forward just to actually add add a bit of air to the soil and to break up any of those bigger sort of clumps also you know roots and things like that they can all um sort of be disturbed the roots of the old crops but even though this soil is quite dry um it 's still you know we 've been adding compost to this year after year after each crop so there is you know it 's still not too bad but definitely needs some extra nutrients in the soil so there 's a few different ways of adding nutrients into your soil um so depending on have a worm farm or a compost heap and i 'll talk about those two things in a moment but what we 've actually got today and if you live in the local area around the great lakes um i actually went to a nursery at wingham yesterday and bought a bag of wing wingham gold but the main thing that you got to be concerned about when you 're purchasing soil is that you do an actual moisture test so sometimes what happens is it 's been sitting around you know the soil in the nursery gets quite dry but you actually just moisten it with a water bottle or whatever and if it forms a nice clump then you know that it 's going to actually be good in the garden but if it doesn 't form a nice firm sort of a ball um then it 's just not going to be it 's what we call hydrophobic and hydrophobic is where the soil it just won 't um take in any moisture no matter how much moisture you put on it it it just repels the sorry megan there 's just a question there what is um wingham gold oh yeah okay sure um well i 'm going to show you in a minute but wingham gold is actually a um it 's actually a it 's a local product as i said in the great lakes um but it 's actually a soil made of compost uh it 's got probably manures cow manure and um mushroom compost and also it 's it 's actually they add in some living bacteria so that could be in the form of worm castings and it 's actually you know it 's very rare to go to a nursery where they 'd actually sell a soil that 's been conditions conditioned with worm castings but it 's actually if if you buy soil and you find that it is hydrophobic so as i said no matter how much moisture you 're adding to it it 's still repelling the water then you can actually sort of change that up by making it into a living soil so the soils that do repel water are generally dead soils with you the wingham gold in a minute but i 'm just gonna so the other mistake that a lot of new gardeners make is actually planting into dry soils so you 've got your um you 've got your little i 've got these seedlings today that we 're going to be planting so this one here here 's a tomato i just went to bunnings yesterday actually and got some seedlings but this one is uh an heirloom variety a diggers club selection of um tomato tomato which is a just a bit bigger than a cherry tomato okay so just lift that back the other one we 're going to put in so we 're going to do a bit of companion planting and the other one we 're going to put in is a marigold orange boy and that 's a really good one for attracting beneficial insects and repelling unwanted insects into the garden and this one here is basil so this is my favorite combination for planting out your spring garden or one of my favorites anyway um but we 'll get on to that just adding you know lots of water okay get yourself a really good nozzle something that you can sort of switch on and off and i 'm just really letting that soak in and as you can see it 's actually creating pools of water on the soil because it 's been a bit dry we 've sort of neglected this garden area for a while but you can see that it 's actually after a minute of say having a pool of water like over here it 's actually soaking right into the soil which is what you want so you want it to be nice and free draining so that the plants aren 't going to sort of you know drown or get too dry so so you can test out your own soil just by doing that quick little test and i 'll just wet up the rest of the garden there so i 'd say probably maybe even do this the night before but you could give it a good um sort of 10 to 15 minutes of watering just to make sure it 's completely is just basically get your garden fork and then just just check what 's going actually on down in the soil so i can see you know right down below that it 's actually now moist it 's not crumbling anymore okay so now we 're actually ready to add the wing and gold to that or as i said if you had your homemade compost you 'd add that okay so as i said this one just came from our local nursery manning valley landscapes um but this is the wingham gold here and when i get that out of the bag as i said it 's a little bit dry at the moment but you can do that sort of i 'll just wet it a little bit so generally once that 's wet through you do the ball test and if it stays together then it 's really good soil if it falls apart it 's no good so i 'm just going to add probably most of this bag now you can see how dark and rich that is um which is always a good indication know if you 're not near wingham you can just go to your local nursery um and and do the uh the test of the soil um so once you 've actually put that in it 's again we don 't want to create any dry layers in the soil so i 'm just adding moisture to that to make sure that it 's fully wet all the way through okay and i 'll just give that a little bit of a mix up with the garden fork just to make sure that there 's no sort of dry patches within the soil okay so even though the top layer is quite moist um you can just sort of see underneath it 's still very dry so just keep checking you know adding adding more moisture as needed okay all right so we 're ready to to plant it out um so i 'm just going to obviously these tomatoes i mean all of the different tomatoes will grow different heights but they they generally like a fair bit of room so i 'm just actually going to plant that so i 've already moistened it it 's nice and moist and nice and fluffy just digging a hole um just so that the tomato ends up at the same level as the soil level okay pop your label in and then um you can break up the basil and plant that around around your tomato so basil itself uh well where we live uh when it 's fully grown it actually probably gets to in some cases almost a meter so but you know we just keep harvesting that um so i 'm just going to pop that around sort of towards the back of this um bathtub okay and then just breaking up um the different plants that are in there and so with this um the marigold that i 'm planting at the moment that 's um uh it 's called mary marigold orange boy and that 's a little dwarf marigold it doesn 't get much higher than say 30 centimeters um there there are sort of larger marigolds but these ones are definitely the best for the veggie plot okay so i 'm just gonna just two or three will be enough and um and as i said the marigolds actually help to repel some of the unwanted pests that might attack the tomatoes so we just pop them in as a companion plant and just pop in one more around here okay so my hands are nice and grubby um yeah but one of the things that i do i mean this is just a bowl here but i always actually like to soak the seedlings in a bowl of water say about you know 15-20 minutes before planting just again to make sure that they 're nice and moist and to finish off we 're just going to put a bit of mulch on top so i 'll just grab some mulch so there 's all different types of mulch that you can use this one 's actually just a bale of straw that i got from the local nursery they 're usually about eight or ten dollars a bale depending on the season and how how the straw is going but um there 's all different types of mulch you can get but this one i just find is is quite a good one to use i find that with the chopped up sugar cane mulch it 's actually when it gets really dry here in summer when you 've got tiny little pieces of mulch on your garden it almost creates like a impervious surface and the water can 't get through so if it 's larger pieces of mulch the water can penetrate that the soil underneath a lot better so i tend to favor the bales of straw rather than the sugar cane mulch during the summer time and as we 're planting now at the end of winter coming into spring yeah it 's a good time to use that if you find that your mulch is coming with a few seed heads um i didn 't really just pick them out and give them to the chickens but otherwise just pick them out and maybe pop them in the bin so that they don 't spread into your garden because sometimes when you 're bringing um organic products you know into your garden that 's a source so when i 'm mulching i just sort of randomly sort of mulching but generally it 's probably about one inch thickness and just mulching around the base of the seedlings um you know just to give it a nice good cover and then to finish off again i would just give that a bit of uh water and well you know the benefits of mulching is obviously going to keep the soil nice and um at a good even temperature for growing um as well as uh keeping the weeds at bay okay so obviously you want to spend more time in your garden picking produce and you do weeding so i 'll just put your set off give it a little so you can see really i know 15 20 minutes of your time um can you know give you sort of quite a lot of produce kilos of tomatoes lots of basils for making bruschetta or pesto and the marigolds obviously keeping the insects at bay some of the other lovely things that we grow in our garden which i 'm not going to plant today but them down at bunnings but um i 'll just show you this is um actually you 're probably looking right into the sun here so this is a just a down-to-earth variety these are tiny little um violas and once again they 're great for just throwing in a salad um and decorating your you know food with um also um a salad salad mix that 's a really good one just to pop in and the trick with growing your salad greens is um maybe plant a punnet and then at the same time you might just scatter a few seeds of lettuce or whatever it is you 're planting silver beet and then that way you 're not going to have you know so much lettuce um at the one time but you 'll have a continual harvest which is what we 're looking for so the other one i love and i grow a lot of is the rainbow silver beet um which again you know you can just pick up at your local nursery so there 's some just some little ideas and suggestions for what so we 're going to take a little bit of a walk and we 're going to have a look at the compost area as well as the chooks and the worm farm so we 're going to go on a little bit of a moving tour so to begin with um i 've just got the little compost bucket here which i usually keep on the kitchen bench okay so most of our scraps um they go to the chickens but whatever we can 't_''_1228.32 you know go into the chickens goes into the compost tape so um basically we 've got our sort of rubbish down to probably about two tiny little bags per week on on most good weeks and that 's just generally because whatever we can keep out a landfill we do so just collecting things like old paper towels all of that sort of stuff even hair out of your hairbrush i know it sounds a bit weird but you know toilet rolls all that sort of stuff that can all go into the compost um bucket and then um yeah we basically we so if you 've got shooks or any type of animals um here we 've got some just some chuck manure mixed in with the straw and we scrape that out of the chicken pen every now and then and then we you can see we use that which is a carbon material um and we mix it with any grains so that could be food scraps could be banana leaves comfrey leaves um anything that 's you know green basically all your weeds as i said before things like um the chickweed is perfect for adding those nutrients into your compost and i 'm not going to actually demonstrate today but i 'm just going to talk you through it the best way to actually make a compost a hot compost pile is actually just to gather all your materials so your nitrogen and your carbon materials the other one is that we use for the carbon materials is what we just used for the mulching so we just buy a bale of straw and we use that as one of our carbon materials but pretty much what you pile you want to build have a layer of sticks to add air into the compost and then you 'd basically have your carbon and nitrogen materials so it 's pretty much like building a um a pile of organic lasagna i love to call it so just add the layers carbon nitrogen carbon nitrogen so that could be you know your weeds and then a bit of your straw the next one could be coffee grinds which is considered carbon um so on that handout that i gave you about composting it gives you a list of all the carbon materials all the nitrogen materials and then those that are intermediate materials so basically if you just can get any of them lawn clippings that 's really high in nitrogen and build that in layers until you get to the top layer um you 're aiming to build the compost pile just one one meter by one metre square okay you don 't need any fancy compost bins all you need is just a patch of soil and everyone has that somewhere in their backyard or wherever and once um so obviously you don 't want to attract fruit fly and things like that to your compost but you finish off by adding your carbon layer which is obviously in this case the straw and then you might even just cover the whole compost with a tarp um and and then basically turn it every four to six days if you really really want a quick compost and you 'll have compost ready within eight to twelve weeks that 's how quick it is so um you know obviously when you buy buying soil at the shops it 's about seventy five dollars per cubic meter so i always like to think of me making my compost is that i 'm paying myself to get fit instead of going to the gym so i call it my permaculture gym all righty so we 're going to just wander down and have a little look at um that 's the rest of the garden i 'm going to show you some of the other sort of um areas of the garden where we have lots of native things obviously you 're growing veggies you also really want to attract the bees and insects into your garden and there 's some awesome plants for doing that i always say some for them some for us in nature and in a permaculture garden so grow more than what you can actually eat yourself and then if you have problems with wildlife which obviously we do we just try and live in harmony i mean we get kangaroos we get possums fruit bats um all sorts of things but we just try and grow an abundance of you know whatever it is that we 're growing and then there 's some for us and some for them but i will show you when we get down to the wicking bed i 'm going to show you uh just one strategy for actually blocking off your veggie garden from predators okay so i 'll just show you a couple of little things over here snails and slugs was also raised as well oh snails and slugs yep there 's there are some organic methods you can do to try and deter them so uh local hardware store you can buy um like the snail pallets that aren 't poisonous they 're actually i think they they 're in a yellow box and they 're more sort of made out of iron or something like that um so obviously not poisonous for you know little people or or dogs and you know animals so check out those ones um yeah that 's and also there 's there 's lots of other organic controls for snails for example if you 're mulching around your plants that the snails don 't like going over a rough surface so you can use um any type of mulch or even um you can put out little traps for them things like um put a little bit of beer in a um in a saucer and then they must get drunk or something but i think it kills them unless they die happy anyway just a couple of things that we 're growing in the mid north coast um this one 's oh actually it 's fully been bagged but these are some bananas um which obviously all you can find some other ones um so these you know if you 're in our region um it 's a great idea to just find somebody you know who 's growing really good and healthy bananas and then just get a couple of little seedlings pop them in um and then within 12 months or 18 months you 'll have hectic bunches of bananas which is awesome so um that we we don 't generally we don 't buy many bananas anymore because we 've got so many growing so as many i i just always tell people to plant what you love eating there 's no point in growing i don 't know something that you don 't like eating like for me it 's rocket um so sometimes that just pops up but i 'm not a big fan um so yeah just put in whatever it is you love eating so here 's some little um these are little baby ground cover gravillias um so these are really good for planting in the periphery um obviously not in your veggie patch here 's some sort of larger grevillea really pretty flower it 's got a white flower grey foliage i love before i was a permaculturalist i did a lot of garden design so i love sort of mixing colors in the garden the grey foliage with the red of the background plants so i always think you know make your garden look beautiful as well as being functional so this is another really hardy plant it 's a kangaroo pour i 'm sure you might have seen these around okay um but the other thing we do is we mix a lot of our veggies in with our in with our um our shrubs so don 't be afraid to mix it up there 's no rules when in a permaculture garden when it comes to things like that um we get the tops off our pineapples and we pop them in and so we always get a pineapple usually about a year and a half after we 've popped it in okay i 'm going to wand it down actually while we 're here i 'm going to just pick a little bit of kale because you um how to make kale chips which is garden to table obviously one of the things i harvested this morning so this is the kale plant it 's actually called red russian kale and you can see why it gets that name it 's got the red in the vein of the leaf so i 've picked a bunch um but i 'm gonna we 'll head down to the um with a wicking bed feel free to ask any questions meredith if there 's anyone who has given me some questions uh the last frost killed somebody 's bananas um oh the last frost yep well i mean you 've got to grow plants that suit your climate so if you 're in a frosty area it 's still probably i 've heard of people growing um bananas in tasmania so you just need to create a little micro climate and you can do that by planting them under sort of larger trees and shrubs things like that using protective things it could be like a mango tree or something with a canopy that might be existing um so somebody asked before how do i keep the um well this is particularly for the insects but also for other things like possums out of the garden okay so i 'm just going to show you this is a wicking bed it 's a raised garden bed which is made out of some upcycled materials like the corrugated tin you can see on the edge here and the timber for the posts um but we actually bought this um this is a veggie netting and it 's just basically very very fine netting which keeps the insects out of the garden particularly when you 're growing things like kale or any of your brassicas like cauliflower and broccoli it 's really good to you know get things like the white cabbage butterflies keep them at bay so this is a really good system out of all the systems we 've done on our property in the last 15 years having garden beds on the ground we 've come up with this awesome solution so one of the uh permaculture principles is to creatively use and respond to change and gum trees are just like say 10 metres away from this garden bed we used to have all our gardens on the ground but they 're now raised and in wicking beds this one so that 's some of the things that we grow the snow peas and as i said i was going to show you the worm farm so this is a little worm farm that i created out of an old ice cream container and you can do it at home so if you go to the garden to table instagram page there 's a little video on how to create a wicking bed uh sorry how to create a worm farm out of an ice cream container that basically what you do is you grab an old this is a 10 litre ice cream container and you drill little holes in the sides and then you can feed you know this is a lot of kitchen paper towel but you can see all the worms just loving it um eating up all the scraps and and we also you know add in all the leaves and then pop the worms and the soil over that and then basically what that 's doing in the wicking bed is adding all the nutrients into the wicking beds so that 's a way of um fertilizing your garden for free instead of having to go to bunnings and buy a bag of fertilizer so there 's a question there how are you is your netting secured down someone 's having ah how 's the netting secured yep that 's a good this is good so have a look um let me just show you so we basically there 's basically if you can see that yeah okay so on the edge of the timber you can see that there 's a bit of uh rio which is reinforcing uh that 's what it 's for concrete but basically i know you can get that at the tip and then on top of that we 've just put the poly pipe so we 've made one two three four five poly pipe hoops so as i said just putting that um little wire piece into the timber drilling it in top okay so yeah so basically um the the wire the wire 's inserted into the timber and then the poly pipe is put on like an archway from either side of the timber post and then um then what we did as i said we did this was all homemade because we wanted to try and make our own um we got a pvc pipe on the edge um which as you can see it has sort of come away but we we sewed that on with uh fishing wire onto the edge of the the netting um and then we basically looped that on so it gave it yeah it needs a bit of redoing right now but it 's still still quite good and then we just got an ockee strap for the edge um just to sort of tie up the edge there and it 's worked quite well it 's probably about two years old now um and you can see on this side that 's the idea so basically you 've got your pvc pipe all the length of the um the netting and of the pvc pipe and then on the edge you 've just got these little um flexible sort of metal clips um which hold that pvc pipe in place okay we 're just gonna have a little quick look into the chickens i 'll show you the girls and then we 're gonna go inside and finish off by making some kale chips so if you 've got any more questions just write them in the chat box and meredith will let me know okay so this is this just one there where did you get the veggie netting uh the veggie netting i 'm well you can buy it online actually and i think locally or you can get it from green harvest so if you go to green harvest they 've got an online shop and they 're up in tari um i 'm just trying to think if i 'm saying the right name green harvest uh yes i think it 's green harvest where they sell seeds in tarray but we can actually email that to you after the workshop as well so this is an a a chicken pen and apparently it 's green patch sorry to interrupt oh sorry green patch yeah you 're right sorry and um what about the bees um keeping the bees out because they 're supposed to be beneficial is that right oh yeah yeah so with with the bees um i mean say for example if we were netting off a whole fruit tree um we would only do that at the point where the fruit tree for example a peach had finished flowering um and then we 'd net it after that because you obviously made the bees to pollinate the flowers and to create the fruit and then then you net them after that yeah okay so we 're just in the little chicken pen here so i mean if you 've got space for chooks um in your garden obviously it doesn 't have to be a setup such as this one but when even in a little garden bed um there 's ways to either do a homemade chicken pan this was a movable chicken pen it 's a little bit old now and your own you don 't have to go out and buy them just again using upcycled materials or um yeah there 's a lot of ones that you can purchase these days but yeah if you can use you know materials that are from the tip to make something for a weekend project then you 'll save yourself money as well as um getting creative all right we 're gonna hop out pop back into the house were there any other questions meredith at all um just that green patch on the way to old bar yes yes that 's right if you turn off the highway at the roundabout and turn towards old bar there on the left hand side that 's right yep okay so we 'll just head inside ah here we go this is an old bath house that we made out of rocks are off our property and the timber from trees that we cut down um just going down to get my notes if there 's any more questions let me know we 've got about 10 minutes left and i 'm just gonna to make some yummy uh kale chips um you can actually plant kale at this time of the year so um the kale that as i said i like to get is the red russian kale um you can get it from mr father gills which is a seed company and it 's really nice um this is a kitchen here where um i 'll just show you a couple of things that i harvested this morning so the snow peas here they came out of the garden we 'd been away for a week came back and honestly this was one punnet of snow peas seedlings from the nursery and this is just one week 's supply of how much we 've harvested which honestly if i weighed them it 'd probably be like a kilo or something so from you know something that costs three or four dollars at the nursery and you just pop in as i showed you this morning with hardly any you know watering or maintenance um you can save yourself so much money which is awesome what i 've done um so i 's what i picked out of the garden this morning and basically uh as i said it 's a red russian kale so i 'm just going to get a couple of them out and um try and show you oh yeah there we go okay so i 'm just going to get a sharp knife and cut the um just cut the tail away from that hard stem okay so you 're pretty much you know discarding that the hard stem there and then you 're left with the bits of kale so um basically all you need to do is just chop them up into sections like that so with the kale chips you 're really just chopping them into sections that are only about that sort of size but they 're pretty random the pieces so it doesn 't matter if they 're all different sizes maybe a little bit do you wash them um well because it 's an organic garden i don 't wash this particular produce because there 's no insects or anything on them but if there were some insects you 'd just sure they 're very dry the next day because if there 's too much moisture in the leaf it won 't work they just become quite soggy yep so we 're just chopping them into some sections okay and then i just pre-prepared um you pop them into a bowl so just into a metal bowl okay add a little bit of olive oil um obviously i 'd be doing a bigger batch but this is just for demos so we 're just going to add a little bit of olive oil because i 'm italian and i love oil and then just mix that up with your hands um just to kind of coat that olive oil onto the um the kale okay and then we just add a little bit of salt so i 'll just going to add a little bit of salt just a little sprinkling okay so you 've got the oily kale leaves with the salt in that bowl and now um we we just place them onto a tray with baking powder um baking paper okay so that 's just the the kale on 175 degrees a preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes but basically until the edges of the kale become brown and then something i prepared earlier um so these are the finished product okay so really nice dried out um kale chips okay i 'd love to be able to share them with you but i 'm just going to eat one i 'd say that pretty much um you know make your kale chips and then eat them straight away because they 're not going to last too long in any household but um i don 't think it 's something that because there 's a fair bit of oil in them i don 't think there 's it 's something that can um last for too long so i 'll just um we 'll go to some questions in a moment but i 've just got a couple of things that um i thought might be of interest so um where to from here on your permaculture or starting your own edible garden journey there 's a really good waste that you can sorry an app that share waste app and um we can uh yeah if you just look up share waste it 's um basically so that instead of putting in your scraps to landfill even if you don 't have a um a compost or chicken system or whatever your neighbors might be loving the scraps like me so it 's a really good way to make people in the community and you you can just you know collect your scraps in a container and then give them to your neighbors and have a cup of tea while you 're there the other thing that i wanted to share with you is um just some little things that you can do on your start of your permaculture journey to living a more sustainable life is um everyone needs a bit of toilet paper so this one here it 's called um who gives a crap and who gives a crap donates 50 of their profits to build toilets in third world countries so it 's a hundred percent made of bamboo um and you can just go to who gives a crap.org and you other little resources and then i 'll finish up so each year if you 're wanting to learn more about permaculture there 's the permaculture calendar okay and you can purchase i don 't make money off any of these things i 'm promoting by the way but um just things i love you can get it off permacultureprinciples.com so i 'll show you that hopefully you can see that but that 's a really good calendar gives you monthly tips on you know what to do in the garden and it talks about all the permaculture principles another really good magazine is called pip magazine and pith magazine is the australian permaculture magazine so really good info in there getting into permaculture or growing your own food and that the last one is the organic gardener magazine that 's abc organic gardener and that 's just another great one i you can actually subscribe to that and i just get it in the mail each month and it 's awesome because you know the more you can learn about growing up your own food and living a sustainable life for it there 's just a couple of other things so um things that you can do is um join your local community gardens so there 's one at wingham tarry plenty around victoria and other states you can get onto the community garden website there 's australian city farms and community garden website which tells you where all your local community gardens are you can join your local seed savers group and again you 'll just learn so much information about growing food support your local growers i mean i know i still shop at um woolworths to get you know my organic stuff occasionally which we all do as busy people however i also like to support local farmers markets so there 's one in taree but yeah just find your local farmers market and um and go and buy your veggies there every week and meet your farmers who are growing the food in the um great lakes area there 's also a great um business called farm to fridge and they um thank you so much for it we 're gonna take some questions time but can visit my website which is garden2tablepermaculture.com.edu where you can follow me on instagram and facebook but um we 'll just go to some questions now thank you so much for attending as well um any tips to grow sweet potatoes do i need to harvest them all at once when they 're leaves okay and sweet potatoes uh basically you can grow them uh let me just get one out of the pantry um so you can see um with the potato um you can grow them just from cutting up sections of a normal sweet potato and then they form these little eyes that pop out um which will eventually um oh you can see they 're growing roots already so they 'll grow roots and then you just plant that under the soil in the garden and then within 12 months or so um if you don 't have a rogue pig like i did um because he used to like to dig up the sweet potatoes um but yeah you you just basically bury them under the soil and then you dig them up you remember months later it 's always tricky to know when they 're sort of ready to um harvest but normally yeah the leaves kind of die off but there 's you know at this time of the year actually you can it 's it 's a good time to harvest them as well and and do they have to dig them all up at once or no you can just dig them up whenever you feel the need like whenever you want to use them they 'll stay under the ground quite happily i mean obviously you don 't want them to get too large um sort of you know sort of maybe a bit larger than that but you know probably not not extremely large otherwise they won 't um taste too good yeah um another one there megan um can you please explain the layers of the wicking bed from the late from the bottom up sure and um somebody just said reminded me which you can actually use the leaves of your sweet potato in a salad um so that 's another use for the you know using but the layers of a wicking bed um i can give you a a one minute version of that and then we might have to do another workshop another time um it 's a really um yeah great thing to do but basically on the bottom you 've got gravel um there 's a poly pipe an agricultural pipe that goes down the bottom of the the garden bed and then on top you 've got geotech fabric uh then you 've got sand and then on top of that is compost okay wow um and someone 's asked with the worm farm do you add the worms or do they just come oh no you definitely add the worms so there 's two different types of worms one is a just a normal garden you know worm which do eat organic matter but they don 't process organic matter very quickly so you 're best off once again you know you can go to your local worm supplier but you know you can also buy them from bunnings you buy a box of worms i know about 2 000 into your worm farm and they 'll just eat through the scraps like they can eat half their own body weight a day in food and just by the way too we we have those magazines in the library if you want to taste before you subscribe or something um great idea yeah and there 's so many gardening books in your local library so yeah before you go out and um you know buy them all just try them at your local library because there 's um all sorts of permaculture books i know at great lakes library and organic gardening books so just you know yeah anything we haven 't got we 'll give us a suggestion and we 'll get that in for you um also there 's a great someone saying there 's a great movie um about wicking beds on gardening australia thanks jeffrey 's actually if you go if you google um wicking beds gardening australia in sophie 's patch she 's in one of the gardening australia tv presenters she 's in south australia and um she 's amazing she made these awesome they 're the containers they 're called ibcs i think they 're containers that they um use for transporting liquids in and if you can get any of them international bulk container you can get them and then you can turn them into really amazing wicking beds so you know you don 't have to go out and spend a whole lot of money uh to make a garden bed you can just you know go to your local tip shop and get really creative um with you know using upcycled materials for wicking beds or you know old bathtubs anything like that even an old barbecue you can turn into a raised garden bed well thank you everyone for coming along to the workshop today and um i hope that you did get some inspiration for your garden um yeah as i said you can follow me on the garden to table networks either the website or instagram or facebook um but i hope you feel inspired to go out and plant some food [Music] you _"

    "text": "I 'm Matt bell i 'm council senior ecologist Miniver is located east of na 'vi Achatz on the on the western shore line of the lower Lamba river the minima area is is special in that it contains a range of vegetation and habitat types from dry scaly refill forests and woodlands like we 're standing within to shrub lands heathlands wetlands mangroves along the along the river rhine areas it 's incredibly diverse from a vegetation point of view and and contains some really special and unique plants and animal species the council has got an interest in the minim bar area because principally because we we sauce domestic water supply from the the aquifer that occurs under this this landscape so it 's really important in the provision of that domestic water supply as a as a supplementary and additional source to the mening river water supply so that 's councilors primary interest the the the secondary interest is that it 's an area of amazing biodiversity and it and it provides ecosystem services provisions in the protection of the larval amber river and and wallace lake water to the to the river rhine and lake system which is of immense value to our area in terms of oyster and fish production and tourism the complementary management of biodiversity on top of the land the plants and animals and the vegetation community types preserves the ability of that aqua aquifer to provide clean water and which is then utilized as a domestic water supply so that 's a neat synergy that the area is a provider of an essential element the drinking water but that drinking water can be secured by our our best practice conservation management of of the land surface and the plants and animals that occur here the member area was affected by fire in the 2019 bush fires significantly there was a very intense fire that burnt for a long period of time thousands of hectares were affected by the fire event it did burn at a range of intensities but a lot of the fire was high intensity fire and because of the nature of the men about landscape the wetland systems and the lack of access trails it was a very in some areas so we do see that a lot of areas were burnt intensively and scorched which consumed a lot of the vegetation from the from the tree canopies but also consumed a lot of the the ground vegetation and even the humic material in the soil the reason why we 're most concerned and and that were interested in the men about landscape is that we believe that the area is over bone and that means it 's been burned at intervals that are damaging we know that the area was burnt extensively in the 2019 fires but prior to that it was affected by high intensity wildfire back in September of 2017 and then only a few short years before that so there 's these recurrent high intensity wildfires that are affecting this landscape and while a lot of the vegetation types within minam Barra adapted to bushfire we 're concerned that repeated short interval high-intensity fires are having a significant negative effect so we 're looking into that and trying to understand well what are the impacts of those high intensity bush fires it 's early we 've established a series of motion-activated cameras with different lure types to try and understand where and what has happened with the wildlife of the area we 've also been through the use of an expert botanist been looking into certain threatened species on the landscape a number of she expects that occur in here to try and understand the effects of fire on those species we 're quite concerned about that the the fire and its effects on on those those plant types hello my name 's Steve Griffith I 'm an environmental officer with Mid Coast Council specializing in botany and plant ecology allocator in assemblance is one of 62 Shia X pcs found only in Australia four of these she iooks pcs occur in the navi-x sampling and three are listed as threatened under state or Commonwealth legislation allocator una semblance has the common name Navi a Katarina Navi AK is where the species was first collected and described it has a very restricted distribution and is known only for coastal sands in the vicinity of Wallace lake and mile lake a considerable proportion of the cage arena has wiry foliage consisting a branch that 's rather than typical leaves its leaves are nothing more than ribs on the branchlets and these projected the nodes are small teeth navigate cage arena often produces very little seed and is heavily dependent upon respirating from the base of the stem following disturbance such as fire widespread fires in late 2019 coincided with drought conditions and low levels of soil moisture placing Navi at cage arena under considerable stress some plants have managed to recover by sprouting new shoots from the base of burnt stems unfortunately other plants are not yet showing signs of life and have succumbed to the extreme combination of fire and drought Midcoast Council in collaboration with New South Wales and Commonwealth conservation agencies has a program in place to manage Navi 8kg Rina and its habitat so that it survives in the wild this management includes the design and implementation of appropriate fire regimes today that 's been about monitoring will be we 've undertaken some pest Animal Control work the really positive thing about the monitoring work that we 've done to date we 're standing within it 's been fire affected quite intensively in patches but the the level of regeneration is very good and and we do know that potteries have survived the fires in this location we 'll talk to experts will do more monitoring and we 'll try and understand how best we can assist this landscape to recover and be resilient to to threats moving forward my name is Bob MacDonald I 'm one of the Midcoast councils environmental project officers land that I look after is all the wetland area the council has purchased over the years part of it bringing these cattle wetlands where we are today there 's a been hundreds and hundreds of trees come down this site is about a thousand acres in the owl scale 400 hectares most of it was burnt just like an ordinary bushfire the trees left standing but in this area around the wetland itself where the base of the trees but literally hundreds of trees have come down there 's a lot of mova tracks we spent some time cutting trees off tracks and getting access again quite obvious how many dead trees are about obviously to come down in the future the fire 's came through much of the land but the most damage seems to have been done here we 're killing off a lot of the higher vegetation has allowed the Sun to get in and create a big problem with annual weeds Morning Glory is the one that 's most dangerous and many it has really taken off since the fire in places it 's been like a mat like a carpet but it is far more prevalent than it ever was freida fire I 'm trying to prevent a getting up trees and flattening flour I think if if the Morning Glory that 's burnt about at the moment sets flour and seeds we 're in big trouble so I 'm just doing going round and round trying to stop it getting to that stage we were lucky with the fire and the fact that none of our buildings were damaged at all fire didn 't get quite close to them but the fire did get in and burn up a couple safe but unfortunately the were so dry and the creeping fire did eventually burn it some completely and some just severely damaged it means that we 've got the site closed at the moment for public because the access isn 't quite what it should be because the lagoon behind us was bone-dry we lost all the birds or water birds entirely the Jacana has completely disappeared hopefully we 'll return as for without the creators know the Bandicoot is still about we don 't seem to have lost them I 'm Anthony marchment from Mid Coast Council on the environmental officer for natural assets so I coordinate contractors and assist Landcare groups on council reserves mainly bushland and Beach reserves here at cata wetlands it was devastated with the fires in late November December you can see behind you here it 's pretty much devastated a lot of the peat because we 're in drought at the time a lot of the peat beneath the trees there 's actually burned out and then it 's burnt the main trunks underneath and they 're falling down so that 's what the trees falling over so my job in this situation is to assign contractors to come in and do weeding control works here and then if any enrichment vegetation to close down their gaps is required is to coordinate that sort of works we 've got lots and lots of annual weeds here filling in the gaps in regards to the light filtration that 's coming in down now that all the branches and that stuff of the trees have been burnt and fallen down so it 's sort of triage in regards to which ones we treat though the more invasive the more persistent ones we 'd probably treat on a category basis we 'll probably monitor the regeneration on the site and see whether it needs any enrichment or enhancing so if there 's any canopy gaps or areas like here where lots of trees have fallen down you 've got lots of light coming in so we 'll probably plant species that didn 't really regenerate here initially because this was originally a old cattle country that 's just regenerated on its own with a little bits have been here originally and with that it 'll probably bring more habitat for species that we require out here or use local endemic koala food species like there are there have been records and is records of koalas out here so we 'll be filling in making more lineal corridors and stepping stones from the koalas for here in to crowd Evo National Park the result of the fire is that we 've opened up lots of areas here so we 're fine lots of we 've got lots of kangaroos feeding in the open areas we 've got deer feeding in the open air so there 's a lot more open country for them whereas before there was sort of tucked in hiding in what 's his names are there they 're feeding nearly through most of the country now so we 're working with hunter lol s in regards to and our neighbour national parks in regards to doing federal animal control in regards to dogs and foxes there 's already a program for deer control here

    "text": "Matt Bell mom counselor senior ecologists we know that bushfire wildfire especially high-intensity fire has a has a very significant negative effect on koalas they 're slow-moving they they live in forested environment and so there was lots of immediate koala loss we think as well as the ongoing effects of the fire on the availability of surviving koalas to find food and having to move through the landscape and then being at risk from vehicle strike dog another predator attack that sort of thing we 're standing in the Tononi area the 290 locality in the Kai Warwick area of the Midcoast region and we know that there 's a highly significant koala population that occurs between teri south through 290 the areas of mandra through to Beryl Creek and and in the bite we commissioned a consultant report which examined the the population of koalas and it 's of a really important quail population of state significance in terms of the density of animals that appear to be present within this locality there 's evidence of good breeding when there 's evidence of a high density population so a relatively small area so we knew that we commissioned that study before the wildfires of late 2019 so we haven 't come back in to do a systematic analysis of the koalas and and what the fires have done in this area we know that it 's important habitat and we know that there are compile is remaining in this landscape and so it 's really important for us to re-examine the population and and and implement measures which safeguard that population going forward we 're standing at this particular site this is council owned and managed land in the tannot knee area we came back in here within about a month of the fires and we had a koala detection dog that was managed by Ryan Tate and we found evidence of koalas at this location this this particular location was only relatively lightly burnt in comparison to a lot of the high-intensity fire which occurred around this area the detection dog detected koala scat sand and we found a lot of evidence of koalas cats through this little pocket and a little gully refuge of relatively lightly within the landscape now we 've come back here today a few months down the track and we 've had a quick look for koalas cats and we haven 't found any evidence of them that is of concern but there 's a lot of uncertainty have the koalas use this as a refuge and have as the as the landscape has recovered have they dispersed back into the more burnt landscapes from here was there a whole host of impacts of the of the fires which led to further further injury and death to the koalas that occurred here we were uncertain and that 's where we need to do more monitoring and research to understand the effects of the fire and and as I say what measures we can take with the community and with other agencies to safeguard their survival recover the population in these important landscapes the conservation of the koala in the landscape setting means that we can 't just conserve a patch here and a patch there and expect the koala to survive the koala as a species has highly complex social dynamics it survival of populations they use the landscape to to access food resources in in ways that we 're where we we don 't completely understand but they the short of it is that koalas need a large landscape approach the protection of important habitats the the reinstatement and protection of critical linkages in a landscape context and that that is the only way that will ensure their long-term survival well there is a flagship species it 's it 's an umbrella species so and and to explain that is the the conservation the effective conservation of koalas will have significant benefit for a whole host of other species if if we with the community and with the other agencies can conserve koalas in this landscape there would be flow on benefits to a range of threatened species in general biodiversity and that includes species like the brush-tailed fescue girl and a Marcel and a host of other species so so both focusing conservation on one species they act as an umbrella for the conservation of a range of biodiversity hi my name is Kim Golan and I 'm a contractor nurseries and look after the volunteers give them skills and projects to do as well as collect seed and get plants back out into the environment now this could include koala corridors coastal revegetation riparian restoration some landscaping some street tree planting which is always needed we have embraced giving plants out to private properties in the case where they 're being burnt or severely affected by drought when we lost so much habitat on private land and people knew that the council nursery was here it became apparent that they were desperate to put back plants back into areas that were starting to erode or to provide future habitat so we have been able to assist landowners with getting plants back into those areas the nurseries has to start collecting a lot more seed of plants in areas that have been really damaged and we need to get that habitat back up and going again so we 're doing a lot of seed collection especially for koala habitat since the fires in November 2000 and nineteen we 've actually given out over 5,000 plants have gone out to public president and co-founder of koalas in care my wife Christine and I set up koalas in cave 15 years ago and we 've basically have 27 plus years of koala handling and experience behind us at this stage fires have been a part of our ecology and occurrence in the in the area for a long time but to have fires of the intensity and so widespread was really unusual and uncontrollable for so long it 's just had a devastating effect on the ecology of the area the hill Ville fire where the base of our population exists was particularly very badly affected and many of the areas were actually burnt three times during the course of about a ten day period so had a very severe impact on our core area within six weeks we had something like 50-plus koalas admitted and they were coming for a day very badly burnt we were basically sitting in smoke for weeks and weeks on end and we 're now in a situation where we 're seeing koalas that are developed respiratory issues because they 're just not not made to extended period we 're seeing koalas that have come through the fires there burns of heal but they 're now succumbing to respiratory issues like koala that 's on the ground is more than likely not will and should the person that comes across it should immediately contact us on our 24-hour rescue line we 've put in place the program of approaching landowners or sometimes landowners approach us say they 've got a small area at the back of their property or somewhere that 's not necessarily worthwhile using for grazing or farm activities and the several landowners have actually come on board fenced off those areas and allowing us to revegetate them with the endemic species that were naturally in the area there and that program is working really well we always looking for more landowners and we 're focusing on the Tanami area that 's 1080 Hill Ville Buda warm and rock that 's the areas where we need to look at improving the habitat christine MacLeod I 'm a co-founder of koala zinc-air and I 'm the Koala facility manager here nothing in our wildest dreams all that we 're 52 koalas were rescued unfortunately 26 of those passed away due to their injuries 24 have been released and to remain in care koalas were all highly distressed you were basically looking at burnt paws they had burnt bottoms they had burnt under their arms where they 're sitting in the tree inside their ears their noses their faces their lips so there are in a pretty horrendous state if they came in alived I mean we got many stories of bodies out there so we lost a lot of koalas and we 'll never know the true impact about that every day we were seeing burnt bodies burnt little pores they were crying in pain and we saw many pass away during that stage of the whole horrendous process but you do that day in and day out and we did it for six to eight weeks sometimes bringing in three or four maybe five or six koalas a day and it does impact on you down the line without the kin the community 's involvement during the fires we wouldn 't have got as of it came from people phoning us up I mean our phones just ran hot for weeks and weeks and it was through people on properties and community members that contacted us to telling us there was a koala that needed our help they either brought it in or we had to go and rescue the animal out of a tree or something and without that involvement I think that we would have lost way more koalas the community played a big part and the community can play a ongoing part in planting koala food trees in the area to help with a restoration of the habitat that we have lost because some areas have been very hard hit with the fire one of the Joey 's in the in pre-release now is Hays and she was a little Joey that was rescued off the fire ground at were all flat and her mum wasn 't alive she was lucky enough to be found she did suffer burns to her face I 'd say that she 's probably had a little nose out of Mom 's pouch and she was hopeful that she was going to survive because she was just limp so we immediately tried to rehydrate her and we started to nebulize her we got her on antibiotics and she actually picked up quite well over the next few days and went on tween keep on improving and she is now wound and in pre-release so she 'll be ready to go back out to the wild come spring out of the seven Joey 's we have in their pre-release area six of those are females and there 's one male so there 's six to kick-start the next generation [Music] _"

    "text": "get into it uh so social media one on one this presentation it was actually quite hard to pull together in that the tourism team do this a fair bit but for our tourism partners but we identify where they 're lacking um so and then we target specific groups of them being such a broad um audience i suppose i know there 's only a few of you on here at the moment um but going out to a broad audience was quite hard to to whittle it down um for everything social media so try to reflect back on what we do and how we use it and how you guys can use it as well um i just wanted to end with some tips as well um and then some local examples so just the agenda for the presentation so we 'll have social media history and usage why to use it um some of the lingo and dispelling the myths with um some of the some of the lingo that 's out there and how important it is which platform do i use our tips some questions i 'll open it up to questions then at the end we only had one question pre-submitted which was which platform do i use so we 'll address that a bit later all right so getting into it so a basic definition of social media right so we 're starting from you know what what is social media to you know we could go as far as um targeted advertising on it websites and applications that enable us users to create and share content or to participate in social networking so the important parts of that create and sharing content and engaging in social networking so the social networking part is is a bit that businesses um often forget about um it 's social media is all about that interaction with people so you need to remember that um it 's a it 's half of the beast is is reaching out is talking to people is replying to customers um as well as sharing content um so if you can focus on both of those things um you 'll do well um i pulled this one from a our tourism partners on facebook for beginners a bit of a comparison to um traditional marketing so like a one-way sos radio traditional marketing meant broadcasting your message to as many people as you could afford to reach over blanket networks like radio and television then came the sitting waiting and hoping hoping that the search party on the other side the consumer picked up what you had been broadcasting hoping that it had influenced them enough to buy what you were selling so i suppose from that quote some of the key points there um that it was a one-way communication those traditional forms of marketing whereas social media and some of the platforms definitely are not that it 's one of their key benefits so reaching as many people as you could afford to that 's no longer the case with social media it 's it is a free service and if you do pay to play it is inexpensive compared to some other traditional forms of marketing um the blanket networks as well so were your target audience on those networks um do they read that newspaper a circulation of 200 000 mean for my small three-inch ad um they 're things that you need to consider um and hoping that it influenced so right down at the end they 're saying that hoping that it influenced them enough to buy what you were selling so that 's one of the benefits of social media is that you can see straight away if it 's having an impact through engagements yeah through live through comments and you can see what 's not working as well and then you can even go as far as installing things like facebook pixels to track people from facebook to your website all the way through to purchasing um so you have that full customer journey there so i just thought it was a nice quote i liked when mikayla put it up last time and got me thinking i thought it 's an important one to to go back to just in a comparison to traditional marketing when we 're looking at social media um just a brief history of social media i don 't know um who have you had know i back at uni i refused to do a myspace page i was like nah this is stupid it won 't go anywhere um a year later i started a facebook page so that was well done um but yeah you can see here from when they are established to sort of where where we 're at today or it ends of 2017. i just added a couple more in there um so in 2009 whatsapp was launched as well it 's one of the big players now it 's a chat service um and then a couple of other things so in 2012 facebook which is the biggest social media platform it reached uh one billion um global active users and has gone on to just remain the dominant force in social media um 2016 was interesting um recently acquired um by facebook was instagram um and then they started taking on the other platforms so uh instagram went with direct uh competition with snapchat by releasing different features like stories um and really tried to wrestle away snapchats rise which was pretty um pretty quick at that um which was interesting very interesting for marketing people like me um vine in 2012 i don 't know if any of you are familiar with this but it was a video um platform so short videos um it actually was um was stopped in 2016. it just wasn 't getting the traction anymore um come 2017 and tick tock gets on the scene same sort of thing short videos some really unique features to it um it 's now knocking down the door of one of our top 10 social media platforms in australia yeah so there you go i said by 2020 tick tock had 1.5 billion downloads in the app store so it 's um it 's the fastest growing social media platform right now i 'm just australian usage so you can see there as i mentioned facebook is still the dominant force um 16 million monthly active australian users um 40 of the population have an account um and and are active on it so it 's um it makes sense to be on there um youtube which wasn 't on the previous slide it they started introducing your own profile where you can upload your own videos get followers um all the things that you can do on social media so it 's a pretty big player now and instagram again uh number three there facebook and instagram are going to be the ones we focus on a bit in this because it 's our core platforms and probably the ones that you guys are most familiar with i know you all already have facebook accounts um we get time to check instagram so um so sorry about that um but yeah it 's just interesting to see the um the different usage in australia and just yeah 40 of the population having a facebook account it sort of makes sense to be on there all right so why use it so i wanted to um we thought it 's pretty important to show the difference between personal use of social media and use for business um so we 'll start with like personal use for the moment so why why do we use it personally so everyone else does we we are um 'll jump on board and do it ourselves um to keep in touch with friends and family to share pictures and videos or thought-provoking news articles to show off people are on social media to show off so their latest holiday or their latest purchase whatever it may be to tag friends and funny memes because you 're addicted to it so more and more studies are coming out that people are addicted to social media on average we 're picking up our phones and mobile phones every 12 minutes we 're most likely to go into a social media app when we pick it up now looking at business so like i said australians are using social media more and more they spend on average an hour and 39 minutes on a social media platform every day um so the old adage of going fishing where the fish are so it 's where the eyeballs are um it 's free or inexpensive marketing tool you can spend all the money you want on it or you can be organic and create content yourself if you do pay to play likely to see a 40 um further reach for your for your posts if you do um if you do advertise um but it 's not saying that you have to um you can reach new and highly targeted potential customers um this is uh even more so when you do um do advertise through social media you can really target your core audience or who you want to attract um and facebook and considering that they own whatsapp and instagram um their their reach and their data to be able to target people is um is pretty powerful um you can engage with potential customers and create a real human connection to your business so that two-way conversation can really break down some barriers to people maybe wanting to purchase your product or engage your services so if you can humanize your business a bit more it really helps forge that connection with a potential customer and social media allows you to do that it increases uh traffic to your own website so a lot of you have spent probably a lot of time or paid a lot of it 's about driving traffic to that website like how do you get it um social media is a great way to to drive traffic to your owned marketing platforms like your website um and finally your marketing efforts are measurable so the analytics that um that these platforms provide a great way to see if what your what you 're sending out to the masses is actually working particularly in engagements and then like i said going further down the track of facebook pixels and really tracking uh anyone that may go through to purchase and you can then build a picture of your your customer from them seeing a post on social media right through to purchasing so i just wanted to reiterate that just the importance you need to keep if you 're going to be if your business is going to be on social media you need to keep the personal um and your business profile separate uh you see a lot of businesses posting material that is more relevant to a personal page there 's definitely scope to to have a tone of voice and 's you need to be mindful that a potential customer might not like to celebrate your child 's birthday for instance or um but keeping it humanized definitely and you know a core showing your core values is is important through the platforms but just keep in mind that you should keep the personal stuff personal probably a way um to define that like we were talking about with like traditional marketing and just a comparison is you have a brick and mortar business you have a brick and mortar house and they 're two separate things in your life so the same as social media you can have a personal profile and you can have a business profile but you do two different things in those two different platforms pages all right i 'm just going to move on to a bit of the lingo that i may use moving forward and then i 'll probably already use that you might not be familiar with um and i also wanted to just dispel some myths about what is important and what 's not um i put my own scale we 're looking at our analytics and i think it may be different to what some of you may think are the important factors so likes so a user can express that they like a piece of content so you this most people would be familiar with this it 's the um the go-to reaction on on say facebook and um and instagram um the imports i put that six out of ten um it 's important in the fact that um likes on especially on facebook really help promote uh your your content in the facebook algorithm if you 're if a friend of yours say or a follower to your facebook business page likes a piece of your content there 's 20 percent chance that their friends will then see that same post um and so on and so on so it is important um to get the reach up and potential for engagements that it 's not the be-all and end-all likes and follow so another likes so on facebook we 've got um you can like content and you can also like a page you can a page so it can get confusing um so on facebook a follower is a user who identifies strongly with your offering and has opted to follow all content shared by your page so they will see your content posted when it is posted a page locker may not necessarily see what you post it 's all up to facebook to to dictate what they will see often the numbers are about the same we 're about a thousand off um page likes first page followers um but again this is another metric that that a lot of people get caught up in that you need this huge following to have any sort of influence on on your audience it 's um and this was prevalent a few years ago when when companies were selling followers or selling page likes um but it was found out pretty quickly that that doesn 't doesn 't really help anyone because these bots or fake followers aren 't engaged with what you 're doing so it 's better off to say have 100 page likes with 50 of them engaged as opposed to 's um it 's pretty important to bring that back that sure you need an audience to speak to um but it 's not the be all and end all so reach the number of unique users that were shown content from your platform this is an easy one for for um users to get their head around on on facebook and instagram it 's one of the first things you see um in both their analytics and it sort of combines um your engagements and your shares it shows you what has happened um after that so like i said someone likes your post 20 chance that their friends will see that post and then like it um it 's funny how it works sometimes the algorithm we were only chatting this morning um michaela had a had an example of one that that has one of our pieces of content that has tremendous reach but not many likes on it um but it has more shares and more comments um so it 's funny how it how they do it how it works out to reach but it it 's resonating with an audience um and it 's an easy one to see straight up so pretty important um yeah that one is really good because it actually tells you exactly how many times it was shown on a news feed of a person so to be comparative with our traditional marketing um you can put an ad in a newspaper but you don 't know how many people saw that ad so this literally tells you as an example how many people open that newspaper and physically read your ad this is telling you the exact number of how many people are physically seeing your ad or just simply your post on facebook michaela can i just jump in there though is that like um it 's in there but if i 'm scrolling through this don 't mean they necessarily read it yeah so that 's right so it appears in their feed that 's right we don 't know yeah okay yeah so whereas whereas a like would show that they 've actually actively engaged with it yeah yeah that 's correct so um there unique users so how many people saw it and then there 's impressions so often you 'll see the same piece of content two or three times and that 's what impressions is so we more look at reach like unique users that have seen it and like you said maybe they might not have engaged with it but it 's good to see it 's a reflection of how well the content is doing because it combines your engagements um together and and is working with facebook algorithm to get it further so engagements what we were just talking about then so this is the number of reactions including likes comments shares saves post clips and other link clicks so this one 's pretty important so this is when you truly know that your content is um is resonating with your audience is if they 're liking it as if they 're commenting um sure you might get a negative comment but that also works in your favor in the sense of um of reach and engagement rate so engagements are pretty important and they work towards the next put the most importance on so that 's a metric that measures a level of engagement that a piece of created content is receiving from an audience and represented as a percentage so i 've got the how we come up with it down there um i 'll remember i 'm sending this through so you don 't need to jot it down or anything um but this is the one that we place pretty high importance on um so it really shows how much a percentage of our audience are engaging with the content we 're producing and we 've audited our all of our content to and we know now what works we can pull that out when we when we need a big hitter and if you can start doing that for yourselves knowing what works and potentially what doesn 't um but once you get to that stage it 's it 's really liberating on on social media to know what 's going to work and what 's not and and you find it easier to pull content together that does involve a lot of testing test things out i 've i know when i first started with tourism i would i would find a really nice image or a really nice video and go this is going to do great and you put it up and it just flops and you 're like how did how does that work and you realize that you 're dealing with like an audience that is very different to you or um might not think the same thing looks cool or or whatever it may be but you start to get an understanding if when you do it long enough and you post enough content you start to get a feel for what works and um and like i said once you realize that it 's quite liberating then because you can really work the system a bit i suppose so they 're just a few of the terms that we um that i may touch on here um but again there 's you could go down the rabbit hole there with some of the terms um that we that we go to but they 're the most important it out now are there any questions that you guys might have from where we 're at now all good great so which platform um i thought i would start with showing you our core platforms which i mentioned of facebook and instagram um we started our facebook page back in 2011. this was the under the great lakes tourism um we amassed the following of about 40 000 um over the next six years um then became amalgamation and we um we negotiated with facebook to merge our previous pages together so barrington tops tourism which which thomas looked after had a massive following as well really highly engaged audience and facebook allowed us to merge the pages together to barrington coast um and i suppose this is a bit for us to show off what we do as well this slide so last year our content was shown 9.8 million times so that 's impressions again so that 's how many times the piece of content is shown and our content generated 600 000 reactions so you can say that about 30 to 40 percent of those were 's a lot of comments to reply to and the team do well to to get back to everyone and on average in 2019 our content was shown to 15 000 people per day on facebook so we post every day um and every day on average 15 000 people we 're seeing it so you can see the sort of impact it has to be consistent can i ask ben is it is it difficult to just stick to one post today when you have so much content like is that do you post more often than once a day or yeah it can be i think we 're getting to the stage now where we could probably post more um depending on the platform facebook yes um and when we 've got some more tools at our disposal like our destination website um i think we will post more um but but yeah look it 's it 's a tricky one we 've always gone on the on the thing of one per day but when when there 's more information that needs to be shared or if get it up as soon as we can no matter if we 've posted half an hour before um because we know it 'll do well um so yeah it 's not there 's no set rule on how often you should post i 've um i 've done a bit of a backflip on what i used to think in these sessions before i would say to businesses you are running your own business you 've got more important things to do if you can get one post the other week great um whereas now i 've changed a bit and i i think it 's more important to be consistently posting um and if you it 's my feeling that if you can 't promote your business some form of your business on social media enough to do one post a day then really do you have something that you re you can really sell i i think people that are invested in their business can find something to post content to post daily um even if that 's reusing old content that 's that 's my feeling a backflip on that i used to say just post when you can and post um engaging content whereas now i 'm like probably post more if you can consistency is key yeah consistency above all else so um facebook loves you using its platform that 's its business is it wants you to get on there and use it so the more you use it the further your content will go as well the more people will see it um so yeah consistency is key so if you post twice a week every tuesday and thursday then stick to that if you post once a day stick to that if we suddenly dropped off and started posting every third day and our reach would not go as far um if we started doing three times a day it would take a while for facebook to realize that that 's our new consistency as well so if we 're going to change that plan then we need to be prepared for that and you know know it 's going to take some time for facebook to go i like this um so yeah there 's no there 's no rule on it but i would say post more post as much as you can to be honest um so again our platform 's our instagram platform again some pretty big numbers for us um we started this page in 2014. uh it 's taken a bit more uh learning from us on what works and what doesn 't on instagram but now we 've got a good feel for it um and and yeah we 're getting um our engagement rate uh which i 've touched on before 3.6 puts us into the influencer type um field so you know you might have heard the term social media influencer and those that get paid to go out and literally take photos or videos and upload them to social media in sponsored posts if you 're looking to engage a social media influencer you would want above three percent engagement rate um so considering the audience we have of 21 000 that 3.6 engagement rate over the year is very solid um and and the most on compared when you compare followed and engaged with regional tourism instagram account in new south wales so that 's enough gloating um basically what we use each of the platforms for so i just thought it was um interesting again to break it down and you can apply this to your own business as well you don 't necessarily have to but um facebook we use longer form copy um so that 's basically posts are more wordy we um the both platforms have the ability to see more copy before you need to click that c-more button there will be up to four or five lines of facebook um copy there on instagram it 's one and a half lines so you can really engage people um with your copy on facebook a lot more in screen you need to do it with the picture and then hopefully they click see more so that 's what we use facebook for a bit more of our longer form copy um to drive traffic to our destination website or third-party sites facebook is so much better for that it 's link friendly um we use separate uh on our facebook account because it 's got a great event um feature on there as well um where you can shed your events and um even add other promoters events um and video sharing so while we share videos on instagram as well uh videos on facebook just have a tremendous reach and normally get a lot more engagements than they do on instagram so we tend to share a lot more videos on facebook on instagram it 's all about sharing highly inspiring visual content it 's a photo sharing platform that 's what it is at its core so you need to keep that in mind that it needs to be highly inspiring visual content if you 're going to share on instagram especially for us um we use it for its engagement encouraging features in stories so there 's things that um really encourage your audience to uh to take another action so whether it be a poll a question if they want to ask a question about um the region uh even quizzes um or to to send you a direct message as there 's and there 's new ones being added all the time um we can engage with visitors via hashtag searches and geotag searches as well um it 's sometimes turned like facebook 's or instagram stalking but basically you can search via a hashtag so say via foster and you can see all the content that is um uploaded with that hashtag and we can then like photos comment on the photo we can even ask to potentially share that photo and find user generated content and same goes for the geo tags it 's a little bit harder to do that on facebook unless an individual tags unit and finally just we advertise on all the platforms in some form we don 't spend much but um we 're finding that advertising via the stories platform on instagram has the biggest bang for buck at the moment um it 's stories has such a high viewership um and it 's just increasing that more brands are jumping on and advertising through through that um feature um and we tested it out uh end of last year and we to our website so it 's something we 're going to continue doing with that i guess probably touching on um some people get scared off by the whole advertising or i have to pay money um sort of aspect of social media we only boost posts that are already doing well we don 't waste our money trying to push something that isn 't already engaging our followers because if it 's not already doing it organically putting money behind it isn 't jazzing it up it 's just pushing it further to people that aren 't going to engage with it so uh don 't feel like you need to go out and put money behind every single post um because some people do and they freak out and think that that 's that 's going to get them the most engagement if you 've got a cracker post that 's done really well already put some money behind it and see how far it goes but that 's the only time we boost posts is when it 's already doing well because it 's proven yeah it before when once you 've posted and tested a bit you know what will work so you can then start um [Music] boosting posts at earlier stages so because you know it will work um but yeah it 's a really good point to just push what is working with your audience because it 'll no doubt work with um with an extended audience then um yeah things that flop will flop even if you put money behind it so look just for your businesses and and um you can take some of the points out of what we use them for but i thought this was important to put in so for facebook some of the pros the potential for reach so for your content to to reach further is more than say on instagram um that 's based on the algorithm um the the engagement sending your your content further um the familiarity with the site itself like i said 40 of australians have a facebook account they 're familiar with it they 're used to seeing businesses either promote or post on there um so that 's link friendly so you can i said this before but you can drive users off facebook and to your own marketing channels like your website um you can post links in comments you can put them in your your post itself you can even have a picture that is a link as well so it 's um it 's one of the benefits of facebook that you can drive people off the platform um it 's good for short and long form content as i mentioned especially copy and the ability for content to be shared there 's a share button on facebook which just makes it a whole lot easier there 's no such thing on instagram or there is to stories but um not with the ease there is of on facebook so and it 's a really um important tool to get your your message or your content further and increase engagements and reach and some of the cons just the algorithm change it happened a couple of years ago so facebook tried to um limit businesses impact on the platform um by stopping the reach of back to what it was first created for which was a social media platform for people to interact not businesses to promote um it won 't have too much of an effect on on local businesses it 's just something to be mindful of that the numbers so our our master audience and our engagements back in 2016 was was massive compared to what it is now but if you can still create um engaging content it 's not going to have an effect on you so it 's a good thing to keep in mind and just the trust with the platform so that was brought up last year or the year before just with some of the data leaks um a lot of people switched off their facebook account um or turned off a lot of the settings on their account um it 's not gonna have too much of an issue for a business if you know who you 're targeting um and stuff and a lot of those people that did switch off have since come back um but it just is something to consider um visually inspiring content we 're lucky that we 've got that type of content to showcase um as a destination um but it 's not to say that your business can 't find the same content i 'll show some examples later of some that are doing it well um so the usage is increasing on instagram especially with its new features like i said stories um so it 's on the way up it 's about to plateau but instagram is still on the way up um brand engagement so people are more likely to engage with a brand on instagram than they are on facebook um facebook you feel like you 're getting it shoved down your throat a bit um with businesses and advertised posts people on instagram see a nice image and they follow a brand and because they want to see more of those images um so yeah and then they 're more likely as well i wrote down a stat earlier where is it so 90 of followers on instagram follow at least one brand or business that 's just one brand and 83 people do their research on there and also purchase um through instagram uh the engagement tools i mentioned before through stories uh are very handy so you can encourage people to to take a further action um and geotags and hashtags as i mentioned before being able to search these um both these tags you can also follow hashtags as well so you can see if your products being used yeah that 's another very important part of this screen what 's the difference between a geo tag and a hashtag ben yeah so a geo tag is when a user uploads a um say an image to instagram and they tag it says where was this taken or at your location i think it says so you click on there and you say it was foster or foster maine beach or you can get pretty specific on where it was you can then search that in the search field on instagram under places and you can see all the content that was uploaded from that location um hashtags on the other and there a single word with no um pound sign or the hashtag sign in front of it these are also index so you can search them and you can actually follow hashtags as well so geotags from a tourist perspective is probably a really powerful tag sort of to use as well like if you 're stand up paddleboard or you 're you know uh hiking or something like that that you can say this is this is a fun time we 're having out here doing these things yeah totally okay i 've not heard of them before yeah it 's something that we we monitor the geotags so we 've got a there 's about 60 that we monitor whereas hashtag we monitor about six um but the geo tags are ones that we constantly monitor for user generated content and it 's a great way to find because we 're not always tagged in these images so we have to find them somehow and this is a great way for us to find images right across the region so you can type in shroud you can type in more land you can type it the latest images that have been uploaded there so it 's a pretty important tool and it 's a great way for small local businesses to get out there as well and get to their audience if you 're a business and stroud tell people you 're there show them how amazing you are show your neighbors by tagging yourself in that location and if you know your neighbors are looking at that location or searching um it also helps for the seo so it can help in the background further along when people are googling your business if you 're constantly uploading content that you 've placed a location on people are looking for businesses in stroud you can come up and google from doing that consistently yeah well great yeah it 's a thanks for bringing that up to michaela i um i forgot to mention it but yeah posts with geo tags and hashtags um go further as well on both platforms so if you can tag your location in every shot even if your business doesn 't change where it is if you 've got an it just means it goes that little bit further so cons instagram isn 't very link friendly so you can have a link in your profile which is great still drives traffic to your website but in your posts themselves you can include a link but it 's not clickable same goes for in comments as well so if you 're trying to drive people off the site it can be a bit trickier which is why you see a lot of posts saying um link in profile so you have to do another step to go back and find the link so the lack of reach and shareability um look i just put this in in comparison to facebook really um we 've still got tremendous reach on um on instagram but it doesn 't have the same um algorithm in that if if megan you like one of my posts and then one of your friends sees it um for you to like one of my posts on instagram you need to follow me um if you like it it 's not going to show your friends that will um so you can still have tremendous reach on the platform um it 's just a little bit harder to do so you can be found in the explore page um and if your content is shared by someone else but as i said their shareability is a bit of a um a bit harder to do on instagram too it takes a couple of steps to to share content um so yeah but it 's not to say it doesn 't happen yeah and it 's almost like a hidden pro because it 's more targeted so facebook is sort of sharing it to then your group of friends which usually you have the same interests as your friends but it 's more of a blanket when it 's getting shared so for instagram they 're keeping it targeted they 're gonna show you the content if you are interested and you 've already proven that so that 's almost um a hidden pro thanks michaela um i 'm just going to go into some of our tips that we 've come up with um and this this thinking about using social media um and they 're things to to keep in mind if you if you 're going to start up a platform i know you 've all got a facebook page at the moment but it 's something to consider um so our key tips um consistency is key as mikayla mentioned before you have to be consistent on there the next point sort of aligns with that as well not going dark so if you 're posting consistently if a user jumps onto your page and sees it you post it yesterday they know that you 're open or that you 're still trading or that or that you 're you 're using the platform and they 're more likely to engage with you on the flip side if you 've set up a page and then never um added anything to it since 2014 um people are going to assume you 're closed they won 't go they won 't do the next thing and and google your website or call you or or anything they 'll just go to the next best offer going to set up a page be sure to be consistent with it with your posting um and on the flip side if you have set up a page and you 're not consistently posting then you can switch it off as well there 's no harm in switching it off it 's probably better for you to deactivate the page or hide the page from public viewing than to have one sitting there dorman keep personal personal so i mentioned this before if you can keep your personal stuff off your business page um that 's great um i would recommend that content is king but it does not need to be polished so obviously you don 't want to upload blurry photos or shaky videos or something like that but don 't don 't look at other people 's feeds and think that it 's highly curated and that it 's that it 's done by a professional a lot of it is done on mobile phones we 've all got great cameras in our phones um and even our content a lot of people were like oh stuff and it 's like well we don 't it 's 90 of our content is user generated the other five percent might be photographers the other five percent we 've taken um on our phones so um please remember that it doesn 't have to be the schmikes looking video or um or the best shot um if there 's content up there that 's going to resonate with your audience they 're not going to mind if it 's a tiny bit shaky or if your voice is in the background or of a video or something like that that 's good to know because i 'm always second guessing oh i don 't know if i should put that on and i i don 't know i don 't know yeah yeah it 's something like even we do as well and we we do it every day we overthink it a bit like as if content is gonna work yeah yeah so you you really overthink it but um i think you start to it 's a it 's a great way to test remember that that the content is there for only a short amount of time in the people 's um sort of awareness of it so it will be gone so it if people flick past it or if they like it and they move on or they may engage with your brand so a piece of dud um content isn 't isn 't the death knell to your facebook page or anything like that you can just you can learn from that and then put up something that 's a bit bit sharper or anything but yeah just try not to overthink it too much um i think that brings up just on that point sorry just to point about personal personal content if if part of that content is part of your story so if if jade your customers are going to be seeing your red kelp be as part as part of their transaction with you well then that red cop becomes part of your business story and you feel fine to have photographs of your puppy growing up and wandering through your business and engaging with your customers because your business page it 's kind of personal but kind of business okay that 's good and i actually i 'll do a post about that and it 's relatability so it 's keeping your business human and you know approachable as well if you 're too refined and too out of reach for your average customer then it it you know it they 're not going to just pick up on the phone and go oh they 're really friendly so um yeah that brings the relatability to it and the human human side to it as well um and uh i had another point and i can 't remember oh thanks guys that 's good next post um so yeah uh respond you need to respond to everything it 's it 's in your best interest to respond to negative comments to positive to to even just emojis respond with another emoji it it indexes your content and sends it further if it can see if facebook can see that you 're active on it some of those algorithm changes that they made in the past it will you 're engaging and generating um conversation with your audience um it really helps you so um can i say you guys do that amazingly well i really enjoy reading your responses back to comments on the barrington coast page and instantly so it 's a really lovely dynamic that happens so yeah really good job with that oh thank you we um we do spend a lot of time responding to comments there 's some posts that we get you know over a thousand comments um on them um so it does take some time to do but it is very important to do as well you can really forge a connection with people and the longer you wait between them reaching out to you and you responding the harder you 're going to find to forge that connection with them so if you can be timely with it as well it 's um it just works so well in your favor and really um humanizes your business too you don 't have to be so um so formal in your responses to them you would have seen on well it 's about being social and stuff and humanizing the brand a bit yeah and that 's the big difference with social media is that two-way connection um people are gonna ask you questions about your business on a comment on a post um uh they 're gonna inbox you so people see it just as important as leaving a voice message on your phone or sending you an email people view it just as importantly so um it 's really crucial to reply to that timely um i put in here about being efficient with if you are going to go down the um path of social media to to try and make it as efficient for yourself as possible so there are tools say on facebook where you can schedule your posts so you could set yourself one hour during the week to to shed you all your posts for the week and there 's also third party tools where you can do it on instagram as well alternatively you can you can draft posts and keep them in your drafts and simply log on and hit to be efficient is um is to use instagram as your your main source because it 's connected it can be connected to your facebook page you can save a lot of time by posting to instagram and opting to repost the content on your facebook page um some of the links so if you act someone might be different when it comes to facebook but you can simply edit those if you want um on the facebook platform but it just saves a whole heap of time instead of posting on two um platforms and that taking up more time just post on one platform and share it to both use hashtags and geotags where you can there 's a little plug i think you guys have all signed up for next week 's workshop which is um solely on hashtags so we 'll cover that a bit more then but like i said before content with hashtags and geotags have further reach so it 's always um recommended that you include those be social so social media follow other business pages follow people chat with people chat with to get in a conversation with you so like we we often do that with posts on ours we will go back and have a look and say oh did you end up visiting this weekend or um did you how 'd you go did you find it like this location to try and generate that conversation so be social like we keep saying it humanizes your business a bit shows a genuine interest you can monitor you should be monitoring your analytics um so again what works what doesn 't um so you can avoid making the mistakes of um any posts that do flop um and re reusing those um or reusing the ones that do work we get caught up in not showing the same thing but you need to sometimes remember that you won 't_``_3031.28 your content won 't be shown to all of your followers all of the time so reposting content at work before um is is an important thing to do because you can um you can reach a completely new audience some people might might see it again but that 's great are key tips um for if you 're going down the the social media um route which we which we recommend you do um i just wanted to show you um sorry were there any questions on on that before we move on to some local examples all good okay so some local examples these are just ones that i um i 've seen and i think they do a really good job for for different um reasons um and they 're sort of buried in in their offer as well so drifter camping and four-wheel drive they 're based out at gloucester um what i like about these guys first of all they 're consistent in their posting they post one to two times a day um on both platforms um the language and the tone of voice speaks directly to their core consumer so i follow these guys anyway and and i often they upload a lot of videos as well and luke 's the founder um he voices and is the main talent in most of the videos um when you read the um the post caption it humanizes it a bit his tone of voice comes across in his his content copy um so even the the spelling mistakes and the you know you can see that one there doesn 't have a um capital letter to start off with like trim the trailer up a bit like you can actually hear him saying it um and it just humanizes his brand even more and it speaks directly to his core consumer which is which is really cool um their responsiveness they get a lot of engagement on their page and he re like us he responds to every single one of them sometimes very with heaps of information on what they can do he 's adaptable as well so during this coronavirus um lockdown they 're obviously in camping and four-wheel driving that was a no-go so they quickly realized that people were camping in their backyards so they started camping in their backyard showing off their products in their own backyard um so they 're they 're quick to adapt um and again he 's efficient use of facebook owned platforms so he posts he updates some of the links on facebook so he 's not double handling he is in a sense but not as much as you would if you were doing them individually so i just think it 's a great example of a business doing well gloucester laundromat um this is a bit to do with mikaela having a one-on-one with him i reckon but um look they 're consistent again um now you might think why would a why would a laundromat have a um instagram page what are they going to show like what visually inspiring content can they show but they 're funny they 're they 're informative about what they can offer um they really play on the let us do it don 't don 't burden yourself with this stuff and a lot of their content is amusing as well it 's it 's adaptive as well so during the water crisis they were all about hey we need to save water let us help save the town water like so come and wash with us we use this this and this and i thought in gloucester as well as a thomas i don 't know if there 's another laundromat or not if they 're the only ones that i think they 're the only one on social media um yeah they 're the only one and they 're the only one who does social media well in the main street pretty much yeah and yeah they 're just very consistent in what they do and um and yeah i think they do a really good job of it considering they 're a laundromat on a photo sharing platform i think they um punch well above their weight i 'd recommend everyone give them a follow because they really put up some funny stuff and it 's really relatable too it 's a bold move isn 't it um yeah i mean that 's the thing about writing content that is engaging i mean the headline you see here is how to wash a horse blanket i mean that would get me in i don 't have a horse but i want to read that and the same with the one beforehand with drifter a bit there 's like i just wants me one read more and that 's really important you only see four lines one and a half lines on the platform yep i 've just followed both already great i 've put links in the chat box as well to all of these examples so jump on and give them a follow or have a look at more of that post nice one um lj hooker harrington again consistent in their posting um they 've got a good mix of content in um video and imagery as well as that they 're really selling the dream of living in harrington not just selling houses but why people move there in the first place um people people are looking at the town first as opposed to houses like they 're not going to just search houses full stop and then find the best house for them they want the location but they 're selling the location really well by using really um inspiring imagery from pilot hill and we 've shared some of their content too because they get out and take they get a fair bit of um engagement as well you can see there they 've got 848 followers which is a fair bit for a real estate agent like um and they 're efficient use of facebook platforms so they post to instagram and it directly posts to their facebook page as well this is another really good example of telling a story i mean these guys are telling the story of harrington um rather than lj hooker so that 's that 's the key thing for these guys and they 're doing really well spice monkey so again consistency a great mix of content um video and images um their content as well before coronavirus so it was all the telling um inspiring sort of content that you know in in the summer months there would be a beer on the table overlooking the lake with um condensation on the outside and it made you want to drink that beer you know and go and sit in that table um same goes for their food um and then they were very adaptive come coronavirus time when they had takeaway they then went to straight away to using user generated content so photos that people uploaded of their takeaway at home that 's the photo i 'm showing there um and it was a great great way to show that they were still open for business and that you could still have this quality meal from them and wine as well um it was just great great way to show how they adapted during that time not only for their for their business but also their social media marketing i thought it was really good um and they have great use of user-generated content even when they 're open as well because people love taking photos of their food and and they do some pretty good looking stuff as well i 'm going to have to

andrew locke behind me andrew locke is the most accomplished high-altitude mountaineer in australian history he is the only australian the first person in the entire british commonwealth and just the 18th man in the world to climb all fourteen of the world 's eight thousand meter mountains in incredible feet he has been to the mountain his achievements encompass eighteen summits including completing mount everest twice additionally andrew was the first australian to ever accomplish the ascent at six of those mountains this is a record that can never ever be broken andrew is in a select group there 's no doubt about it in 2010 andrew was awarded the middle of order of australia for services to mountaineering in 2015 he was awarded a commendation for bravery for rescuing three collapsed mountaineers at mount everest in 2004 andrew locke utilizes his strong leadership risk management and motivational skills developed through expeditions to inspire not only mountaineers but support internationally andrew is the ambassador for scouts australia ambassador for the sir david mountain foundation and ambassador for the australian himalayan foundation supporting the people of the himalaya area it is my great pleasure now to invite andrew locke to deliver his australia day address thank you andrew [Applause] well good morning everyone and happy what 's going to be a sweltering australia day i think may also say welcome to everyone here from our original australians through to our most recent australians and all the rest of us in between i 'm really thrilled to be the australia today ambassador to the midwestern region because as a youngster i frequently visited this area on route to my great uncle 's property at hannah 's bridge just south of cooler we generally passed through maggie and stop for lunch on the way through so it 's fabulous to come back in fact just in late 2019 before the the big bushfire season i came up here uh searching uh both for hannah 's bridge and then for that old old property to see see the old homestead because it 's passed through my g on my way up as ken mentioned i 'm a bit of a climber and in a few months time covered willing i 'll be back in the himalayas climbing another big mountain needless to say it 'll be very cold and somewhat intimidating quite the opposite of today i 'm often asked what i miss most when i 'm overseas for months at a time and the truth of it is it 's good aussie food and i confess to having snuck out before this this event this morning to get myself a good bacon egg sandwich and i 'll probably go and get another one before the end of the day typically on those expeditions i lose between 10 and 15 kilograms of body weight because the diet on the mountains is very very lean over quite a long period so i do love the australia day excuse to go and get one of those sandwiches to give you a little insight into my my background the 8 000 meter mountains that that ken mentioned are the highest mountains in the world uh all zone because you cannot survive at that altitude for more than a few hours without bottled oxygen and even with bottles oxygen your time is extremely limited everest is best known of course but there are 14 and they 're all in the greater himalaya region of south asia every expedition takes two to three months to complete and to succeed in climbing all 14 of those peaks took me 23 expeditions over 16 years i actually lived on the sides of those mountains in total for about four years i climbed in small teams of two to three people generally or occasionally in larger teams and mostly i climbed with with climbers from other countries because i simply couldn 't find enough australian climbers who are willing to climb on those peaks in the lightweight style and as regularly as i like to climb of course it was fearsomely tough very cold and quite dangerous and i lost more more than 20 of my friends to those mountains over the years brings me to question i 'm often asked about high altitude climbing and and that is how does earth when we have such a hot flat and dry country but you know i don 't think it 's surprising australians love a challenge when i was young man i saw a slideshow about mount everest and right at that time i was trying to find direction in my life and that slideshow was like an epiphany for me and i decided then and there that i would climb mount everest uh the only problem was that i never climbed anything higher than frog rock in those days you couldn 't be guided up mount everest you had to be a climber and in any case i 'm not the type who would want to be guided i wanted to undertake the challenge on my own terms so like any big project i broke that massive goal down into achievable stages first i learned to rock climb in australia then i learned to alpine climb in new zealand and then over successive years i climbed higher and higher peaks around the world until i thought i was ready to tackle mod everest i wasn 't successful in fact on cost us the summit but it didn 't occur to me to give up just because the goal was so tough in fact for me that made it more worthwhile so i went off to climb other large mountains for a few more years until i had the experience to come back and lead my own expedition to mount everest i climbed with citizens from just about every country on earth and along the way i learned lots about culture and the strength of the diversity brings to a team i learned about leadership teamwork and risk management but most importantly resilience because to achieve the greatest goals in our lives we have to be resilient success does not always come on on the first attempt but if the goal is truly worthwhile then it 's worth fighting for so i kept trying until 15 years after having that first dream to climb mount everest i finally stood on top of the world but i wasn 't finished with the mountains because for me the achievement of one great challenge is actually just the starting point the base camp for new and bigger challenge and so then i decided to climb all 14 of those 8 000 meter peaks and that journey took me another nine years only six of the world 's most elite climbers had done it to that point and i certainly wasn 't in their league but that 's just exactly what made it a worthwhile challenge not every expedition was a success and there were numerous unforeseen obstacles along the way so i had to stay focused and committed to that very long term project in fact the final mountain took me six expeditions that 's a total of 12 months just to stand on one tiny summit and after all that effort i stayed on the top for about 10 minutes and then i was caught in a blizzard on the way down and i had to bivouac which is to camp out uh without a tent without a sleeping bag sitting on a tiny icy ledge and just hanging on trying not to succumb to a cold to the frostbite or to the altitude and just and just stopped breathing it was without 30 degrees celsius as i say no sleeping bag no tent just sitting on an ice ledge minutes seemed like hours and the hours were interminable never-ending i struck with cold for so long that sometimes it seemed almost hopeless but each time when i felt completely overwhelmed by the situation my climbing partner neil would lean over and ask me how i was doing and that little bit of support and camaraderie meant the world to me and bucked me up just to endure a little bit longer and i did the same for him when he was at his lowest and we reminded each other that even though the night seemed never-ending that it would end it would get light and eventually it would get warmer we just had to endure so we endured and eventually the night did end and life was good again and i 'm so grateful to have been born in this country because i think australians have the capacity to endure when many others might give up that 's partly because we 're blessed to live in a society that allows us to but most importantly there is exceptional community support to pursue those goals no matter how crazy they might seem or how long their time they take to strive for better lives no matter our origins or our backgrounds and no matter how tough the road may become and it 's because when the path is at its most difficult with obstacle after obstacle i think that is australia where australia stands out as a country like no other that is when australians really close ranks and give of themselves more than ever to help each other that community spirit is what australia day really means to me and i can see the midwestern shire midwestern region is no exception the range of youth and community programs here is extensive from the community centres and community transport book groups the mobile library service bookworms born to read the cultural services the arana arts program and environmental support through land care and is it the puerto bukka wetlands the list just goes on and that 's to say nothing of lions and rotary and other clubs of that sort and of course not to acknowledge the extraordinary role that the royal fire service has played in the last couple of years with the terrible fire seasons we 've had right across the country supported of course by the other emergency services and all those essential community groups that operate behind the scenes i know that like much of this great country the midwestern region has suffered more than its share of hardships through drought the fires smoke damage and of course more recently covered 19. and it 's at times that must seem overwhelming and never ending but i think the midwestern community is a great example of what it means to be australian not just having community programs in the good times but helping each other out in the hard times and enduring in the face of adversity your resilience and community spirit are very strong and their great turnout here today is evidence of that despite the craziness of the last couple of years so i urge you to keep looking out for each other because as hard and interminable as life has been in the last few years the beverage on side of a mountain and as a community we will endure and we are all strengthened by the diversity of backgrounds that make up this great australian community so i need to sneak off and have another bacon egg roll before the shops close so i 'm looking forward to the rest of the day 's activities and i hope to meet as many of you as i can i 'd like to wish you all a wonderful australia day and success in 2021 whatever your mountain may be thank you again for having me here today _"

John Anderson chair of the federal government 's implementation group for inland rail was in toowoomba this week the former Deputy Prime Minister address representatives from Toowoomba Regional Council goondiwindi Regional Council to Umbaran Surat Basin enterprise and members of the transport and logistics industry they discuss the government 's commitment to the Brisbane to Melbourne line this is the first port of call I 've actually made up and down the entire seventeen hundred kilometres of the proposed link because it 's one of the most significant if not the most significant spots as we start to analyze where to go to from here mr. Anderson said he hoped to see work on the project begin within the first term of the Abbott government will be letting people know what the Secretary it is and where it is and how they can make contact with it and access information after the first formal meeting of the implementation group which is in early March up until now the reality is that i don 't think it would have paid i think we 're now at the point where we generate real returns not just a great deal of convenience and opportunity for its users got all of the state governments and the Commonwealth Government agreeing on this as a priority we 've already got that far that 's a good start we 're plainly got local government support while the enthusiastic local government support which is terrific so the issue now becomes identifying the corridor narrowing it right down most of its been done of course and much of the rail already exists but there are some very big bits to be done particularly at this end in terms of port access toowoomba range itself I think then becomes a question of making certain that we can put the money together because it will be a mixture of taxpayers money and private sector money and it will have to be innovative and we 'll have to make certain that both the taxpayer and business get a good return mr. Anderson is open to hearing from our community on how the impact of the rail line can be maximized there are people who can see great opportunity here and as support _"

    "text": "what do Waverly and Maury counsels have in common what does the counsel in the eastern suburbs of Sydney have in common with the council in the far northwest of New South Wales in fact what do all New South Wales councils have in common the answer of course is that they 're all required to implement the integrated planning and reporting process which we 'll call the IPR this DVD will introduce you to the IPR framework and some of its key components in particular the long term financial plan and the community strategic plan we want to highlight the critical role of councillors and senior management in all of this IBNR can become a very practical tool for figuring out how to get from where you are now do we want to be in ten years time it 's also a very practical tool for figuring out the way to get there with the cheapest long running cost it gets rid of the catchcry that rate pegging is killing us because if you do the integrated planning framework properly then you certainly are able to demonstrate to the generate the expectations that the community have in terms of service delivery and the improvements they want to see in their area initially when the process was introduced to us I was very cynical about it actually it seemed to be such a complicated process to go through that I thought how on earth are we going to deal with this but having been through the process it really takes council beyond being roads rates and rubbish what is the IPR framework its cornerstone is the community strategic plan this is integrated with the four-year delivery program which matches a counsels term of office this in turn is integrated with the yearly operational plan so you 're going to fill your strategic to your short-term medium-term in the four year plan until your actual on the ground next year 's budget and the operating plan for that from a practical point of view in developing the delivery program they 've got to sit down and think what can we achieve over the next four years that we 'll be working towards the community strategic plan and part of integrated planning their four year council term and the Rhodes forum pretty good I think it 's a good opportunity for us to put our case across so each council has to make sure that they take on their fair share of burden and they 're not passing it to the next generation critical to this process is extensive community engagement and ongoing monitoring and review when we used to have just three management plans and one-year budgets you just report on what you did at the end of the year and frankly not many people would take notice with ipn our it 's a new game counselors actually have to report at the end of their elected term on whether life got better in the period of their term whether it was because it 's something that they did or not they 've actually got a double level of accountability there that they never had under the old system the IPR framework also includes councils resourcing strategy this encompasses the workforce plan the long term financial plan and the asset management plan you need funds you need labor and you also goals and aspirations the most important part of the IPR framework is the community strategic plan this spends at least 10 years and is a new concept for most councils the integrated planning framework requires the strategic plan to be a community plan if you look at our consultation report the weightiness of that will tell you that we tried every exhausting Avenue to really engage with our community we had a statistically valid survey of how important our services are and what 's the satisfaction gap between the importance of the service and how well we 're delivering it the second thing was a study group the study group comprised 30 people from different demography genders interest groups and the last part of that communication strategy was to community engagement days where it was open day people could come in and with a blank slate say pretty much anything they liked we actually went out to rural communities and had early morning breakfast barbecues so farmers can come to the meeting and carry on with their day 's work we had church group aboriginal groups sporting groups different towns of is important it comes from these surveys we really try to to go that one step further it wasn 't just a matter of putting out in the paper saying we 're having a town meeting and leaving at that the fundamental difference between IP and I and anything we 've got in the past about planning is that the community does Drive the planning if you haven 't got rigorous community consultation then you 're not developing a strategic plan that the community wants you 're developing a strategic plan that counselors and council staff might think once you 've got that plan and you 've got a clear vision and a set of targets and a way of measuring whether you 're going to get to that vision or not you can then go and figure out the cost to get there resourcing it then was the next phase if you bring money into the vision right at the beginning then we wouldn 't look after the disadvantage we wouldn 't have an arts and culture program we wouldn 't have been any environmental sustainability so I and where in fact what the community really wants then look at the cost and then penny once you become the board of directors are the counselors are the board of directors of counsel they then need to take on a role that is ownership of the community needs which may not necessarily agree with the particular Council 's point of view this is my area around Bondi Beach and I 'm here every day the residents look out for you so that they can check to you one on one the councillors are a pretty good barometer of what the community is out there thinking and it 's quite aspirational we have a lot of things going on for the community right way through from youth up to the senior center a councilor has to be aware of all those activities and understand how they run how they financed we have to understand sustainability we have to understand the environment we have to understand finances we have to understand how capital works projects like reading a single balance sheet might be a skill necessary for an accountant but it leader needs to be able to do is understand the threats and the risks to lifestyle and financial sustainability and then be able to explain those to the community or just listen to the community about those to feed that back into their decision-making you IPR framework focuses councils of building sustainable communities one of our main aims in the way together to strategic plan is to achieve species protection for the marine environment we are very ecological sustainable Council this is the second annual Bondi well festival today we celebrating all our beautiful whales as yesterday was next the Whale day there 's a community strategic plan the key themes are then one a sense of place that 's our social theme theme to a vibrant economy cm3 and environmental role model then for coordinated and committed leadership so there you 've got your quadruple bottom line the best way to use IP and our to help meet that QBO and remain financially sustainable as a council at the same time is to bring the whole resourcing strategy to bear to bring your workforce plan closely linked in with by your long-term financial plan is absolutely critical to hitting the QBL what is the long-term connection thing the long-term financial plan basically sets the dollars behind the activities that are identified in the strategic plan the long-term financial plan is the point where long-term community aspirations and goals are tested against financial realities the way we had set up our document into basic services so it 's the continue as is layer and then the enhanced layers sitting on top of that and those enhanced layers have each been itemized and broken down into what 's in there which parks are we thinking of improving throughout this period of the long term financial plan where will the resources go in terms of parks plans of Management at all sports fields it 's all there welcome to the daily briefing leaders will discuss the long term financial plan one of things long-term financial plan and I 'll just give it to skim some attend you plan about furniture councils are able to see that this year we 're putting in these so the curb and gathering among and I or you 'll be able to see I can we have to wait longer year they gather community insight it gets in the plan it will be done the whole long term financial plan means that we can state each year what we think we can do then we can go back to the community and say since we 're we 've got to we 've delivered on this system this we haven 't managed this it makes that whole process transparent we have to be responsible about how we 're going to maintain what we 've currently got and then try to work on the aspirations of a community and deliver what they want in a way that they can afford not only to pay for today but also to maintain in the future now let 's look briefly at asset management plan sadly local government hasn 't had a program for maintaining his assets the Town Hall the jeff 'd of paints they didn 't have a budget for that painting you 're between years when you acquire assets you 've got a lifecycle cost component you 've got a renewal councils be for a fairly exhaustive process over a number of years now we had to evaluate all our assets and come up with a condition rating for those this is a roadway in the cemetery that is a condition for Road it has a number of cracks in it those cracks would be letting water in and as soon as the water gets into the road it starts to deteriorate very quickly the assets it was based on valuation depreciation and a level of service that you believe that the community wanted there was no consultation about that level of service rather than using traditional methods of asset valuation and depreciation we just went back and looked at the original condition of the asset tried to describe what would be a reasonable level of investment to keep assets in a reasonable service level and then we used IP NR to go and ask the community if they wanted to pay for more than that the communities felt that we did some improvement in our footpaths but the rest of the assets should be maintained at the levels that it would cost 93 million dollars to bring our five main categories of assets to a satisfactory standard an eight point seven million a year to keep them there last year we reported 15 million dollars to bring those same categories of assets to a satisfactory standard and only 5.7 million a year to keep them there and we did that by looking at the condition of them assessing the minimum that was necessary from our own technical and engineering expertise and then going to ask the community if they wanted to pay for more we 're in the more airplane Shire Council and we 're on the gingham road part of it is bitumen sealed then it turns into a gravel unsealed road which you can see further behind me there the pressure is on the council we 're looking at a ten million shortfall in their road maintenance budget you know for population 14 a half thousand people that 's a big shortfall we had to do something particularly when you 've got to agricultural economy and turning out of anywhere between six hundred million a year in the gin is we remove the cotton lint from the seed and we also clean out the trash obviously the transport networks critical now we really rely on that to bring the cotton into the gin for processing and then we rely on those same transport links to get the products out during a harvest many thousands of tonnes in a year would be moved along we 're supporting that with the 3,000 clones of road infrastructure we have children who by the time they reach grade thick they 've missed equivalent to again schooling because of the road condition the consuming the roads faster than what we can rebuild it so we facing a massive problem the integrated planning reporting in structure we actually gave us opportunities to address that in a very structured way we could have stayed where we were at the current rating level and the level of service they provided would be a reduction in the length of sealed Rock like the road network what a significant reduction the community felt that was not acceptable the council made the decision I think this is the short form in the Richmond Road maintenance and we could address that with the rate increase and by doing that we 're actually making sure that they are most valuable Road asset which is the bitumen Road network actually had the funds to sustain it once the council had then adopted the community strategic plan that reflected the community 's vision we then had this little problem Oh a funding shortfall we needed to increase our rate level and will and surely over the pegging limit we then felt we need to go back to the community again which we did saying do you understand that if you want this it 's going to cost you XYZ we asked them to confirm the vision we got 90 percent support our community supported in the majority a 120 percent increase in race over seven years the really staggering thing was that not only did they support that their view of council improved as a result when we talk to them about enhancing let 's now look at Maury Plains Council and some of the key issues they face in seeking and achieve is sustaining our population economically we 're a very powerful area it 's the richest agricultural shower in Australia but we 're doing with less than most people wish I had gone from eighteen and a half thousand people to about fourteen and a half thousand people in the last ten years primarily larger machinery more efficient agricultural techniques and mean we don 't need as many people who actually create the wealth so the council in terms of looking at the long-term sustainability of the area started to say oh okay we need to look at the tourism because already we have in the artesian spa bars here amore an industry that brings two hundred thousand people to ten a year we 're only going a couple of major projects at the moment including the six million dollar refurbishment of a swimming pool complex we 're actually building a luxury spa treatment area which actually Custis to grow into a whole new market of actually visitors coming into an allegory for the pampering market there 's a huge market out there for wellness and pampering should we a three-year rape device instead of the seven-year rise they requested the council now has to address the financial shortfall they face in their ten-year plan we applied for a hundred and eighty six million and we only got one hundred and ten so we 're short seventy six million dollars we need to reassess the whole package through the community consultation we know that there are a number of services that have got less support in the community than others we probably need to focus on those ones first so there 's a significant shortfall in terms of a long term financial plan into the latter years of the program the biggest challenge for long-term financial sustainability for local government has to be raising its own revenue we now have a framework to actually say well this is the demands that are being placed on it I think that 's the beauty of what we 're doing and I think that 's the next phase and work with the state government and federal government in terms of actually how we actually find that funding mechanism that allows us to our community ten years is a long time and of course things will change radically throughout that period that 's why there is opportunity to review the long term financial plan throughout each cycle of a council period and we also need to check with the community that the vision is articulated in the current community strategic plan continues to be the vision to the future and if there are changes there they will have to be adjust _"

    "text": "good afternoon very very nice to see you all here um i 'd like to give a warm welcome to all of you from mossman for coming and a warm welcome to several councillors who have arrived so we have councillor sherlock it 's great to see you here and councillor menzies very good to see you here too so this is our third and final community workshop where we are looking at futures futures scenarios so you are going to do most of the work i 'm just going to do a sort of a fairly short precis about some of the things that we need to be thinking about and then it will be up to you and this will create feedback that comes to us and becomes part of the things that we 're thinking about when we 're writing our plan and thinking about what things the council needs to be doing over the next four or five years for climate action and i think it 's very very important for us to um acknowledge that we are on the lands of the borough and kamarago quite a lot to do with how we think about climate change and the kind of climate that we are living in in the contemporary world so we 'll probably refer to that a little bit as we go on and here is what we 're going to do today so what i want us to do is two things we 're only going to look at two scenarios one is business as usual which is what we 've been doing for the last 200 years and we need to do that in order to think about what it is that 's causing the problems with climate change in the first place so it 's just us it probably won 't take a huge amount of time but we need to analyze critically analyze things that are going on with business as usual after we 've done that instead what i 'd like to do is think about what does life look like 20 years out what does life look like 50 years out what does life look like 100 years out if wishes were horses and we could live sort of creating a utopian idea in a way and from there what we 'll do is what 's called back casting which is we 'll take this this very clear vision that we have about where we want to get to and then we 'll bring it back into the present and think about what we need to do now in order to make that vision possible right so this is business as usual um and if i know a couple of you have been at the other two workshops so i 've already gone over this graph previously but it is a very very important graph so what you can see here this is ice core samples from the vostok from the antarctic from the vostok ice cores and you can see that the the bottom graph there is the ice cores and it 's the antarctic temperature over the last eight hundred thousand years and the top one is the amount of carbon dioxide that is trapped in the air that is caught in the ice so as the ice gets laid down it you know snow in the ice cores and so you can see how much carbon dioxide is in trapped in that particular year and so they can go down 800 000 years and very accurately look at how much carbon dioxide has been present during that period of time and you can see that it tracks very closely um the temperature of the antarctic and we can think wider to the whole globe and the temp and the amount of carbon dioxide that 's in the atmosphere so right at the very end there you can see obviously this is in hundreds of thousands of years so the um amount of carbon dioxide that humans have generated has only been happening in the last 200 odd years and particularly since the 1950s and we are now at 416 parts per million volume of carbon dioxide equivalence in the atmosphere and you can see that the average in the last 800 000 years and in fact we can go further back than that has been about 280 parts per million volume and science tells us that if we get to 350 that 's when is where we 're in right now this is business as usual and again this is another example of the science that shows us the carbon dioxide that 's in the atmosphere so this is from hawaii it 's the maoanaloa research lab and what they do is they send balloons into the upper stratosphere and they again measure the amounts of carbon dioxide that 's in the upper stratosphere and so this shows us since about 1958 precisely how much carbon dioxide is circulating around in the upper atmosphere and you can see that year on year year on year year on year it is getting greater and greater this is business as usual okay so business as usual i didn 't make that up that 's um one of the key frames if you like from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and what they do is they create these scenarios and business as usual is one of the scenarios so we are going to invent our own scenario presently but for to begin with we 'll just have a quick run through to think about what we are the contributors to things like um climate change so i 've cove i 've sort of listed a lot of these um things and i 'm going to go into some of them in quite a lot of detail so population growth peak and decline now there 's a an illusion that population just carries has been you know is going to carry on going up and up and up but in actual fact it is starting to slow down and it is going to peak around about 2100 and then it 's probably going to drop and i would argue it 's going to drop as quickly as it went up so that 's going to be interesting we in business as usual we have a very short-term political cycle and some people argue that this is actually a really big problem so if you have a three to five year political cycle then people you know politicians don 't have to be considering a 20-year horizon they don 't have to be considering a 50-year horizon and we can actually you know very easily look at china literally have a hundred year horizon for everything they do all the resources that they 're doing all the capital projects that they 're doing they are always thinking 100 years out and we are not so i mean in some ways that gives you an interesting perspective too because china is also producing a lot of emissions and is right involved with business as usual so is this a problem or not it 's a bit of a gray area economic growth definitely has a large contributing factor towards emissions so there 's been quite a few mechanisms to try and break that relationship that causal relationship between economic growth and emissions something called the knowledge economy for example but it 's never been successful so this is something that we need to consider how can we have a really fantastic life and possibly a high-tech life and yet not be constantly creating more and more and more consumer goods that have a direct correlation with emissions production so consumerism is the next part of that there are other contributing factors so as we as modern people have been 7.8 billion at the moment and going to carry on up to maybe 10 billion people we 've been doing huge amounts of deforestation so that 's business as usual and then when we have the land we tend to have monoculture on it business as usual and the soil is very quickly depleted business as usual so these are things that we need to think about our finance system so people in mossman probably have a better idea of this than most other populations around the place but you know the way that we do finance the way that we do pension funds for example futures trading all of those things contribute in some way or other and these are things that we need to think about in terms of how do we want to arrange um finance is the finance system is banking the cis the banking system contributing in some way or other and there 's a lot of people now saying that things like pension funds which are putting huge amounts of money into oil is a problem so how do we change that these are start thinking more about urban planning and that includes building codes so the codex the re the new south wales building codes urban design infrastructure these are all things that the that mossman needs to consider but not just mossman but sydney as a city also needs to be thinking about things like public transport better infrastructure um water is going to be increasingly problematic and we know of course we 're in australia that water has already been very marginal some years and as the temperature continues to climb water and having access to fresh water is going to be more and more difficult so we need to be thinking about that australia is amazing in its beautiful parks really wonderful beaches and really great green spaces so as we 're thinking towards the future i mean business as usual in australia has actually been very good about looking after these green spaces and and that might be one of the things that we want to make sure we continue to protect and protect even better as we 're thinking about our ideal future which brings me to the and of course the fire last summer 1.25 billion animals died in that fire so this is something that is directly attributable to climate change this graph here is from the united nations and it 's showing us that population is likely to go up as you can see there on the green the green graph there is the actual numbers of people and you can see that it 's peaking at 2100 and the purple line is the birth rate so you can see that the birth rate is rapidly dropping in most well-developed nations and has done for quite some time now and even in places like west africa where the population rate is still very very high it is reducing very quickly which from a ecological point of view is really good and we would want to support that uh in a in a nation within each particular nation it can be a little bit problematic because population growth underpins economic growth it 's not something that economists [Music] fess up to very often but it is actually fundamental to economic growth so if we need if then we need to consider what the relationship is with economic growth and this is not a straightforward relationship so i thought i 'd talk about that a little bit so here this graph here is really interesting because although you 're looking at 7.8 billion people you can see that it 's the rich the very rich and all of us are in that very high percentage at the top there are much more responsible for emissions than the poor so it 's not evenly distributed at all but you can see that it 's about half the work half the planet that is rich enough and in other words is part of the modern system that is producing a lot of emissions so this is one of the things again that we need to be considering and here this is a bit of a scary graph for australians because you can see that australia has actually got one of the highest per capita rates of emissions in the world it has had for a very long time and as far as i 'm concerned that 's good news things that we can do to reduce emissions if you have a look at germany for example germany is a very very highly developed country amazing infrastructure really great lifestyle lots of high-tech and it has about half the emissions per capita so we can aspire to that easily okay this comes from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and it 's what they do with their scenario planning now i 'm i don 't want to go into great detail about their various different scenarios partly because they 're actually very problematic and i think we can do a better job but you can see there that business as usual is the high estimate and in fact um all of the modeling that the intergovernmental panel on climate change has done over the last 30 years the reality is worse than the worst models they have come up with which means that things like the amount of ice that 's coming off greenland is much is melting much much faster than the worst models that have been produced by the ipcc so this is a conservative estimate but what other scenarios just about every other scenario actually reduces emissions so we can 't do worse than we are now the only way to go is to get better so that 's what we are planning on doing and this one is about bringing it home a little bit more so what you can see here is that this is the impact of business as usual on australia um sea level goes up and fires the fire season gets longer and harder you know fire is now entering forests that have never had to deal with fire before cyclones become far more frequent one in a hundred year cyclones happen every couple of years every four or five years even more frequently than that and as the global mean temperature gets hotter these things will be exacerbated worse and worse so right now we are 1.1 degree above pre-industrial levels that 's the mean global temperature 1.1 degree above mean industrial levels and it looks as though all the emissions that we 've already poured into the atmosphere is almost certain to bring us to 1.5 degrees already that 's then that accumulates even further and we will quickly get to two degrees above pre-industrial levels and if we consider the fire that we had last year at 1.1 degree above pre-industrial levels then i think most of us can understand that this is you know really untenable this is the impact on biodiversity it 's quite a nice graph gives you a few good uh good um bits of information there biodiversity and so here we this is an interesting one because what this shows us is business as usual as the green line and the yellow line where it drops down is actually what the government has promised to the paris agreement so that 's what we 're aiming for that 's again a fairly conservative [Music] goal because the government hasn 't been particularly demanding but nevertheless you can see that there 's quite a big drop in emissions that we need to come up with and when i say we i mean all of us the whole community needs to come up with this industry needs to come up with it business needs to come up need to come up with it so it really is about making sure that we all are taking responsibility to a lower our greenhouse gas emissions i just wanted to so i had a good look at the ipcc scenarios you saw they had a b c d and these were the this is the list of things that they were considering with their scenario planning but i thought again that we can do it probably a little bit better so these are some of the things that i came up with but you guys are going to come up with your own so what i wanted you to think about this time is what happens if business as usual continues and what are some of the most serious contributing factors in your view and perhaps start also i guess in the in your mind 's eye thinking what do we do what can we do to actually jolly these around in a better way but right now i just want to really for everyone to really deeply grasp what it is what business as usual is at the moment us it 's where do we want to go next right instead of this business as usual which we 've all just ascertained is quite problematic what would we like to see in the next say 80 years if we use 2100 as a sort of a a point of um horizon that 's about two generations including yourselves yeah so it 's going to be your your kids and your grandchildren are going to be alive in 2100 it 's really not very long if you think about it most um indigenous cultures i 'm celtic we would always be thinking seven generations out and so i 'm not asking you to think seven generations i 'm only asking you to think about three but nevertheless what will life what would we like life to be like in 2100 and this is a kind of a if wishes were horses exercise okay so don 't think about the obstacles at this point think about what you 'd really like to see happen what you 'd really like life to be like in mosman and perhaps in sydney or even the obstacles in a in a bit in a little bit okay so this is just an idealized what would you really what sort of lifestyle would you really like your kids and grandchildren to be enjoying by 2100 so how do we back casting is when you take this ideal that you 've created this vision of a kind of society that you 'd like to see in the future and you think about what it is we need to do now in order to make that happen and this time you will need to think about the obstacles to those things right so the previous time it was very idealistic you know we can just come up with magically with electric cars that somehow don 't have any carbon embedded in their you know metal frames or their batteries or anything like that we didn 't have to think about that but this time we do have to think about it so how do we take these ideals and think about what needs to happen today and what 's going to get in the way of what 's those obstacles so steve and i were just talking before i 'll give you my favorite example about technology and technological change and mine is about sailing which is about the america 's cup being a kiwi obviously have to be proud of the america 's cup um and one of the things that happened about 15 odd years ago was that the america 's cup rules changed dramatically it used to be that you had single hulled yachts that look pretty much like all the ones down in the mossman basin and now of course they are multi-holed and they had to go through this you know massive rule change to get that to happen and the reason that the kiwis wanted that to happen is because they 've been sussing out a micronesian canoe and the micronesian canoe went faster than hull speed and no european boat goes faster than hull speed so how did this micronesian canoe go faster than hull speed because it used airplane technology basically this the the hull is offset and it 's like a sail it sucks it draws through the water that yes sometimes we have to throw you know throw money huge amount huge huge amounts of money have gone into the america 's cup and now from that from that micronesian canoe technology they 've got these micro holes that come up that come the multi-hole sorry that come up on um fins you know and they just through the water so fast all that took millions and millions and millions of dollars it took creativity and imagination it took ancient technologies and then translated into contemporary technologies and where are we now well why don 't we use boats like that for shipping yeah if we are going to still live in a globalized world then we don 't want to be having huge amounts of emissions from shipping and we could quite easily have these computer-driven wonderful you know multi-holed boats with lots of cargo containers between one hull and the next zooming around the world with no emissions just saying so what i guess what i 'm trying to do here is is go yes let 's take these fantastic ideals right about the future let are some obstacles but let 's also dream about how we can put in place some of the stuff right now and what sort of things would we need to put in place in order to make these you know this idealized world that we want this vision of how we would like the world to be how do we move towards it what do we need to do now to move towards it last week we at the sustainability team watched a really interesting discussion no laura forgotten her name what was rebecca huntley yeah she 's just written a book quite an interesting book about how to communicate with people that still to this day don 't really believe that climate change is a thing so i thought well actually steve thought this is definitely one of the obstacles that we in mossman are facing is that quite a few people in mosman despite the fact that we have this climate emergency declaration and a lot of very active people very very onto it and very interested and highly intelligent very well educated progressive people live in mossman very resistant to the idea and um the book that we looked at last week uh she 's done some really interesting data collection you can see up here where you 've got um people like i think i must admit that i 'm in the alarmed category then there 's a lot of people who are in the concerned category there 's a lot of people that are cautiously concerned you know they believe in things like the precautionary principle and then there 's this much smaller percentage and the you know i mean i 've been talking about climate change and engaged in climate change for well over 25 years so i can tell you that that is radically reduced percentage so we are making enormous gains which is fantastic but there is still 27 percent of people who are either disengaged doubtful or dismissive and those three groups actually respond very differently from one another so it 's quite useful when you are talking to someone who is having problems really understanding what 's going on to distinguish whether they are disengaged that 's the kind of hard i just want to watch telly person the doubtful which is they 're a bit skeptical they they are probably paying quite a lot of attention and they 're probably looking at quite a lot of science but they 're also um on facebook far too much and they 're getting uh you know ai feeds that are all about skeptical um the the one scientist in a thousand that is prepared to stand up and say oh there 's no such thing so they 're getting quite a lot of high exposure to that sort of stuff and then there 's the dismissive and they 're pretty well solidly decided and there 's probably not a lot of point in actually engaging with them at all because they 're so completely committed and i was surprised to see that she said that was 10 because i don 't think it 's that high i think it 's much smaller percentage than that but that that 's the data that she got back in her book she has australian data which she probably didn 't pass over to us hand up and say i 've only been in australia six months i 've been living in the uk and in fiji and in new zealand all three of those places have quite a different approach and a different feel in the community and fiji you wouldn 't find one person that wasn 't adamant about at this at this end of the scale like there would be nobody at that end at all in fiji even conservative people like politically conservative people would still be deeply concerned about climate change because they 're having to move their villages that are awash with water so i mean everybody understands what 's going on and coral bleaching is right there it 's not a thousand miles north i mean i 'm i 'm kind of surprised that australia has taken as long as it has because the coral bleaching is so pronounced and the fires are so pronounced but i do think my my impression is that the fires last summer where 1.25 billion animals died um really changed people really deeply changed people so and i think that that is the things we can do is not necessarily talk about climate change per se but instead frame things as you know how to be efficient or how to be resourceful or how to use local you know support the local economy by buying local instead of distance or a lot of people you know they have pets they have animals they want to look after the animals so it 's there are lots of ways that we can normalize a more ecological uh the relationship between the community the social community and the social ecology in other words what you what you were talking about before that we are actually all connected that everything is connected we can normalize that without talking in quite um terms that some people find very challenging i mean it 's a it 's a bit of a nuisance to do that but in but in the short term it 's quite a nice way to get past an obstacle so i think it 's about normalizing things we 're in the process right now of writing a plan a climate action plan um once we 're also at the same time collecting a whole lot of information through vehicles such as this one and we 're creating a very very very long list of actions that we need to take place over the next four or five years and we will start to prioritize those actions in the next month or so so there is quite a particular process that any planning and policy making at the council goes through so once we 've finished writing the plan it then goes first of all actually it 'll go to this climate committee that we 're setting up and they will respond to it and help us to edit it and come up with new ideas and so on they 'll also help with the list of mitigation ideas that we have this big list uh and then once all of that 's fairly finalized it goes to the council council laws they get to comment on it comes back to us we then address any issues that might be might arise in that process then it goes out to public public dissemination which is then so you get about a month to comment on it and then after that it goes back to council and then becomes policy so that 's the huge task that we 're working on at the moment where the other things that we 're doing is costing up things like we 've looked at 45 buildings in the mossman council to decide which ones are worth putting solar on which ones use enough energy because if the energy isn 't being used within that building then it 's not really worth putting solar panels on um and what 's the state of so the thing that we 're actually working on right now is what is the state of the building for example this building would quite like to put solar panels on this building um but we need to have some work done on the roof before we put the panels on so that 's the state of play have i forgotten anything i mean there 's loads and loads of things that are going on as well but those are the big picture ones we have a 's a webinar because of covert 19 it 's taken us quite a long time to organize this and we weren 't sure whether covert would have sort of spread from melbourne and arrived in sydney and you know so it is actually going to be a webinar it 's going to be very interesting because we have politicians from the spectrum we have zali stegel talking matt keane felicity wilson myself and the director of sydney university 's environmental institute david schlossberg so there 'll be some really good speakers you need to get online and go to mossman events and you 'll get a link to eventbrite and that gives you the ticket which gives you the link to the webinar so that 's on the 8th of september i think it 's 6 p.m we also have a new community consultative committee that is being formed at the moment so i 'd like to encourage you all to think about whether you 'd like to be on that consultative committee the expression of interest has been published and you would need to put your cv in and and in fact there is another environmental thing that 's come up with for an expression of interest which is a fund i think so you may might want to be interested in that as well climate cleaver is a really wonderful little carbon calculator app it 's very um it 's it 's very what 's the word it 's by the time you put everything in to it it 's very responsive and it really shows you clearly uh where your emissions are coming from and what sort of it comes up with constructive suggestions about what you can do about it the council has bought a massive subscription to that so anyone who 's in the mossman area if you come through the council website to climate cleaver you 'll get a half price annual subscription so it 's only 15 very cheap and it gives you this very interactive carbon calculator which is really quite interesting and we 've also bought it for the school so if you know anyone if you have grandchildren or children who are in the schools and you want school to subscription the school only has to pay half and the kids really like it so we 'd like the schools to pick up on it so please encourage them to do so bike october is looming so that 's all going to be quite exciting it 's about encouraging people to go biking in active transport around mossman including things like electric bikes so that 's coming up and you can follow us on facebook if you would like there are other things too which we will advertise as time goes on so thank you very much for coming thank you for your contributions _"

    "text": "hi everyone it 's sarah from mosman library and this year science week theme is food different by design and this year we 're being encouraged to examine food-based science i don 't know about you but if you take flour water and salt the best thing you can make is bread so let 's look at some of the science behind sourdough essentially sourdough is an experiment in fermentation when you mix water with flour the yeast and bacteria begin to feed on the sugars in the flour and this creates those bubbles that carbon dioxide which accumulates as a waste product of fermentation carbon dioxide then becomes trapped in the gluten-structured pockets in the bread and that makes it rise there are literally hundreds of recipes available to you on sourdough and just because you can 't come into the library don 't wait to get your baking started you can use your library card to borrow ebooks and magazines from apps like libby like this one here [Music] so head to the website grab your library card and the app and you can download some of these contains more microbes and enzymes needed to drive the fermentation so i decided that i would try and make my starter using rye flour and some pineapple juice there 's lots of different things you can use i heard some people suggest using grapes or even dried sultanas soaked in water of course you could just use water as well but here i 'm using 15 grams of rye flour and 15 grams of pineapple juice and giving it a good old mix and i 'm going to feed my starter at the same time every day this same proportion 15 grams of pineapple juice and 15 grams of rye flour after the first three days i will start feeding it 50 grams of rye flour and 50 grams of water [Music] and if we 've got some fermentation going those bubbles should make it rise [Music] this is a time lapse that happened over about four hours and as you can see with the rubber band [Music] placed at the top i can see how much it 's rising but just in case i didn 't get any fermentation the staff there were really helpful and they sold me about 100 grams for under five dollars and so if you don 't want to make your own starter but you want to make some sourdough you can just purchase some starter [Music] and it 's ready to bake with straight away [Music] one of the other ways you know that your starter is ready to bake with is the float test if it floats you 're ready to bake so when we 're ready to bake we take our starter our water and our bread flour which is higher in protein than normal bread flour [Music] so i 've got my pineapple starter here i think there 's about 80 grams somewhere between 80 and 100 grams into that i 'm adding 320 grams of water and you 've got to play around with the percentages yourself most people suggest about 70 water to flower ratio so for me i 've got 500 grams of flour here and 10 grams of salt [Music] using my hand like a fork i 'm just going to mix it up until it [Music] i 'm going to let it sit [Music] i 'm not going to need it in the traditional sense i read that stretching and folding is a good idea but you know as there are many different recipes there are many different methods um it 's a bit sticky at the moment but yes stretching and folding and over the next three hours i 'll come back every hour and do a bit of a stretch and fold [Music] before it 's ready to be shaped i 'm new to baking so you know this is an experiment [Music] i 'm trying to stretch it out here it 's not an easy thing to do [Music] [Music] i 'm going to fold it over to create my final [Music] and i think that what we 're supposed to do at this stage is try and add some tension to the outside so that it holds its shape [Music] it into my basket lined with a clean cloth and i 'm going to sprinkle some rice flour in it rice flour is does not have any gluten in it so to put it in the fridge overnight so that it continues to ferment slowly [Music] [Music] the next day when you 're ready to bake just take it out of its basket put it on some paper and if you have a dutch oven you can bake it in that i 've even read that if you sprinkle a little bit of water on it it creates steam which stops the crust forming so quickly so i actually did that as well put a little bit of water in the bottom when i was baking it score it with a knife [Music] and this is actually my third loaf i think the starter took a while to really get going i think i got some pretty good bubbles in there i was pretty happy with that and of course the best bit about science week food themes is tasting your experiments so i hope you enjoyed watching that and that you go and have a lot of fun baking some sourdough bread yourself you _"

    "text": "good evening and welcome uh from mossman council and from me i 'm dr ruth erwin i 'd like to give a special welcome to the two councillors that we have here council bendel and councillor menzies very nice to see you here as i said i 'm dr ruth irwin um i 'm a kiwi and i haven 't been in australia very long only about six months so this is a you know a big learning curve for me um and i want to acknowledge the country of the um baroque regal and kumaragil people that we are standing on today and i wanted to go into that in a little bit more detail partly from my own perspective coming from a country where maori are the indigenous indigenous people and that 's been a very important element to my own cultural upbringing so i 'll go i 'll think about that a little bit more in a few minutes the context of this workshop that we 're having today is to talk about resilience in the context of writing an action plan a climate action plan for emergency declaration in november last year so we 're going to be getting you to jot down a whole lot of notes and discussions and we will be collating that and using it for our plan moving forward we are living in very strange times you might say this is a shot from the fires last summer and those fires or at least that temperature that level of temperature that we had last summer is likely to get more frequent as time goes by because of climate change so one of the things that happens there is that the perspiration or the evaporation cycle of water is getting much faster as the global temperature on average heats up so at the moment we 're about 1.1 degree above pre-industrial levels in terms of the mean temperature and what that means is that the soils have dried out a lot the trees have dried out a lot and that makes for conditions where fire is very likely and again i wanted to come back to the borrego and the kamaraigo people and think about the fact that for 60 to 100 and take care of it and have a kin relationship with the land and the water and the other flora and fauna that we no longer have in modern times so i wanted to talk a little bit about that at the beginning of the industrial era or even slightly before that when descartes was um around in sort of the 1640s there was a big shift in european thinking that divorced people from the from nature so there was a sort of a philosophical shift that made it very clear that human subjects view nature but we 're not part of nature anymore and that 's a very significant shift from an indigenous way of thinking about things to a modern way of thinking about things so when i 'm thinking about indigeneity it 's certainly true that we won 't be going back to stone age ads or even you know canoes on the waterfront or anything like that but we can be taking a lot of ideas from indigenous peoples and thinking about how you can have an integrated relationship between the environment the ecology and the you like this slide here this is from the stockholm resilience center which is a very important center of research that 's been going for a good 30 odd years and they so a lot of the understanding of resilience comes from the stockholm resilience centre and this is the definition of resilience so what they 're interested in is that resilience starts from the belief that humans and nature are strongly linked which is coming back to what i was saying before and they also suggest that rapid human development which is a particular kind of human development is forcing planet it 's forcing us into what they call planetary limits and those limits are about things like fresh water the climate nitrous and phosphates in the soil and and various other things that we 'll go into in a bit more detail soon so they suggest then that technology needs and the way that we do things needs to become ecologically literate and this is a quite a significant shift from previous earlier ways of doing things over the last 200 years and if we do that it in any major way but we are starting to think that everything we do needs to take ecology into account absolutely everything we do our decision making our governance our technology our economics all social relationships have to be involved with ecology instead of separating them out like we have in the last 200 years so it 's very simple it 's very subtle and it 's also very effective and i think that it can create a massive sea change that will help us to cope and have resilience over the next 30 or 40 years i was thinking about what is a resilient system and a resilient system is exactly that it 's a kind of a systems theory and it 's about having a sense of identity if you like a sense of cohesion sometimes it 's called the balance the balance of nature for example and you can see where we can see that if you like the balance of nature has really shifted in the industrial period so this slide here which i went into in quite a lot of detail in the mitigation workshop but what you see there is the natural cycles of the earth over the last eight hundred thousand years this is using ice core samples from the vostok ice core and what they do is they look for carbon dioxide the amount of carbon dioxide that are in the ice cores going back 800 000 years to make a very clear understanding of how much carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere and the graph that i showed last week showed you that the planetary temperature keeps track it correlates very closely with the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so we are at the moment actually at 416 parts per million volume and the last time that the planet was at 416 parts per million volume was when the dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the pleistocene period so we are at a very very important watershed where the internal integrity or the balance of nature has been thrown out of whack really quite seriously so resilience is about understanding what that internal cohesion is all about and where the limits are to though to that internal cohesion way and and find that these limits that we 're facing at the moment are actually really important for forging our relationship with ecology in the future so the idea of resilience is that it 's a self-organizing system and there 's a couple of ways that you can understand a self-organizing system so you as a human being as a person you are yourself a resilient self-organizing system your heart beats your body temperature is 39 degrees if it goes to 41 degrees you 're probably going to die if it goes to 35 degrees you 're also going to die you you actually can only function within quite a narrow range of internal systems and if you get out of kilter if your body comes to the edge of any of those systems then it helps to teach you what to do and what not to do so it 's not necessarily altogether a bad thing you know if you go out into the um well we 're in australia i was going to say the freezing snow because i 've just come from scotland six months ago desert so if you went out into the you know really hot area um and you got overheated and that is very likely to happen more and more and more as we saw from the fires that i had up at the beginning um then obviously you 're staying within 39 degrees body temperature is going to be much more difficult so you 're going to respond to that in some way so there 's a sort of a internal integrity to any system that actually wants to maintain itself it wants to maintain its balance its internal balance and what 's happening with the earth what happens when you shift from one integral system to the next you can go go through something like a metamorphosis and if you do go through something like that metamorphosis then you 're going to enter a completely new state so you could think about water for example water is a liquid and it it 's actually really quite difficult to make water into a gas so what happens with water is you get what 's called brownian motion so you you heat you that water will turn into a gas steam at 100 degrees but it doesn 't actually what happens is you heat it up to 100 degrees and you overheat it and it 's ready it 's ready it 's ready to become a steam and it doesn 't actually transform into a steam until a point of difference and nobody ever has any idea what that point will be what that threshold point might be suddenly triggers the water into a into steam so what happens is a speck of dust or something a lights on the surface of the fluid breaks the surface tension breaks the internal consistency the internal integrity of that system and allows it to transform into something different something new and the thing about entropy is you don 't necessarily get to go backwards once you 've done that breaking and you 've transformed and metamorphosed into the next whatever it is you can 't necessarily go backwards and so where we are at the moment in relation to this graph here is we 're at that overheated stage now we haven 't actually 've had many multiple moments of difference but it hasn 't actually triggered them the final metamorphosis yet so we are still in a state of integrity but we 're at the very outer limits and we are what you might call in terms of brownian motion overheated so we need to come back to a to a stasis and that stasis is about 280 and at the outside 350 parts per million volume of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so 416 is well well too high and the thing about climate change is it 's cumulative every year is accumulating higher and higher amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so last week with the mitigation workshop we were thinking about how to reduce carbon dioxide into the atmosphere today we are going to look at how we can maintain that integrity maintain our resilience by understanding where the thresholds are and by considering what we need to do as a social ecological system to stay in some kind of balance to look after each other and to look after the ecology that we live in here i 've needing to think about when we think about resilience one of them is obviously global population which i won 't go into in great detail probably talk about that a little bit more when we talk about futures but part of uh the massive increase in the global population so we 've gone from about 1 billion people across the planet at pre-industrial levels to 7.8 billion at the moment and it 's going to go up to 10 and a half billion by 2100. so there are some complicated factors there to deal with and then especially in the next 40 to 50 years um obviously global warming uh i 've that 's the sort of the increase in temperature and increase of the perspiration cycle the water cycle there 's polar and ice melts particularly ice melt on land because then if i don 't know if you 've done that experiment when you were a kid at school but if you have a glass of water and you melt you put ice cubes in it and it melts the glass of water the water actually stays at 's ice or whether it 's fluid it 's it always stays at the same level but when you put new ice in there in other words landlocked ice the water rises so that 's the danger is that all the glaciers across the world and especially green land are melting at a very rapid rate in the last four or five years they 've been melting at something like thousands of times faster than in the past and all of that land locked ice is coming into the sea so we are almost certainly looking at about a 50 centimeter sea rise in the mossman area and that 's a very conservative estimate so i 've already talked about the increase in water cycle sea level rise the thermohaline current i think i might have taken that slide out but the thermohaline current yes i did uh that actually takes it 's like the thermostat of the planet and it takes water all the way around the planet and a big sort of figure eight loop goes around the poles around the um equator and then back up to circulates not only temperature so it keeps the equator area reasonably cool and it keeps the polar areas reasonably warm keeps everything fairly even it also distributes nutrients so if the thermohaline current were to come to an abrupt halt uh the fishing industry fishing would be very very compromised because the fish would have nothing to feed on the nutrients from the from the thermohaline current wouldn 't be circulating and that is slowing down it 's never ever been known to slow down before but it is looking very juddery at the moment forest fires obviously desertification obviously extinction levels are the highest that they have been since the end of the pleistocene at the moment so we are look we are right in the midst of the fourth great extinction event on the planet soil erosion and soil quality is a major issue monoculture is a major issue for diversity and resilience think about how the limit conditions that you 've just been talking about refract back on what we might do to bounce forward in other words to build resilience to build resilience thinking about the a normative continuity in the past but over the last 200 years we know that some of those norms that we had are toxic they 're creating the problems that we are now facing so how do we bounce forward how do we take these limit conditions that we 've just talked about and start thinking about new ways of doing a new norm a safer norm that brings us back into integrity brings us back to say 350 parts per million volume for example so i 'm asking now what are our strategies what are our strategies for resilience what sorts of things do we need to change within our communities to make them safer to make a more cohesive community to make a cohesive community that 's cohesive not just with our neighbours that 's really important and also our neighbours the flora and fauna our neighbours the water our neighbours the land thinking back to our acknowledgement of country so what sort of things can we do that create strategies for resilience looking forward what can we do that is a very healthy strategy moving forward into in a completely different way you could argue that we have diabetes now we have metabolic syndrome we 've been eating a bit badly for quite you know most of our lives and we now have an ongoing chronic metabolic problem now you can actually get over diabetes if you stop eating sugar if you just stop eating all sugar now that includes bread it includes cake it includes you know a whole lot of gluten full flowers and you instead you have to completely change your diet and live in a very clean way and if you do that and fairly short you know in about six months you most people will actually get rid of the diabetes they won 't have it anymore so if we think about our system now our you know modern system we 've been using huge amounts of fossil fuels which is like sugar it 's a it 's a very energy rich energy dense um food and it 's made life incredibly tasty and easy and it 's made us flabby this is flabby economics so how can we tone down you how can we have a better metabolism within our society within our system so this is the sydney uh city context report where i where i took those earlier slides and i think that one 's really interesting and you can see that not all of it 's climate change you know a lot of it is um pandemics it 's uh the it 's the financial system things like digital problems or digital change which can do impact things like uh democracy so there 's a whole lot of ways in which shocks and vulnerabilities are coming in into the system and climate is one of them amongst many and these are some of the things that that report is talking about in terms of infrastructure that we need to be thinking about so you 've got their um a sort of an honest appraisal of what the vulnerabilities are that 's the first place to start so i know that we talk what you know some of the discussion that 's come up today has been how do you deal with people that can 't actually face up that 's one of the things that we probably need to have strategies for because in itself it is one of the issues to deal with and then on the this side here um it 's talking about the infrastructure that makes our society possible so again if you 're looking at the limits and the vulnerabilities and the shocks it helps us to reflect back on what are the infrastructures that we need to have so that we can bounce forward safely railways i was going to take the train from melbourne up to sydney and the train fell off the tracks because the infrastructure is so poor right so this is one of the things that we need to be thinking about this one 's interesting because it shows um so instead of focusing in on the vulnerabilities themselves it shows us that it 's actually the governance practices that are really going to help resilience take place and that 's having meetings like this it 's helping formulate policy at local government at state government and at federal levels and not only in the public sector but that big corporations have resilience plans bp has a resilience plan and these are really important parts of our society and i think this one 's quite interesting because part of resilience is actually flexibility it 's about being able to be you know it 's awareness awareness of what some of the issues are and having the flexibility to not stay set in concrete so even though what we 've had in the past is consistent and it 's in the the sort of integrity that i was talking about at the beginning this notion of identity and integrity the thing about identity is it 's always changing and if you have a resilient personality for example then you have a personality that 's able to cope with shocks and vulnerabilities and doesn 't get sort of stuck in a reactive phase but is able to be flexible and flow with whatever the issues are so this is what i was talking about before with bouncing forward it 's having the flexibility in our systems in our policy in our economic values and in things like our financial institutions upon us and that will become more increasingly upon us and so lastly what you 've done and what we 're going to take away from today is this lovely list that you 've created about um what you think some of the vulnerabilities are and what perhaps some of the strategies might be to address them this is a this is actually from mossman this original picture here very very ancient artwork in mossman and i kind of wanted to bring us back to that to talk again about how we need to be thinking about the social and the ecological together as one ecological system the community and our ecology at the same time so at the moment we are doing two or three levels of work almost concurrently so we 're looking at a sort of a high level climate action strategy in other words we 're going from the paris agreement um and then looking at all the different regulations and laws that we need to be that that kind of create the context for thinking about climate action in mossman and writing about um how so that 's taking place and the other thing we 're doing is collating these kinds of lists which will create a five-year action list of projects so partly it 's about we 're really looking at the quadruple bottom line right which is the costs the benefits the emissions profile and the governance the governance structure so those are all the policies and how it all fits into the council so and partly what we 're doing we 've we 've created so through the council the council actually approved targets recently in july um so the council operations itself are aiming at net zero by 2030 emissions and what we 're hoping is the aspirational goal for the community is for net zero by 2040 so it gives us 20 years for people to you know retrofit their houses put solar panels up um the grid is changing so whether it 's a sort of a centralized coal powered national grid or a more distributed solar grid these things are changing and we want to be flexible and able to accommodate those kinds of changes we 're setting some ways that list is already underway so for example we 've already put new solar panels on the marie bashir sports centre which is already reducing emissions and we 've already done a audit of all of the council buildings 45 buildings to see which ones are worth putting solar on and at the moment we 're starting to look at the structural integrity of those buildings because some of them are very old so you wouldn 't want to put so you know a new solar array that 's going to last 20 years on a roof that is probably only going to last another four or five years so we 've still got quite a lot of that work to do and we 're certainly not waiting to do that work so we 're already aim you know we 're already in process with these big projects that need to be done to reduce emissions for the council so i for me the process needs to be that this high level um policy work that sets the priorities needs to take place first and then shortly but lists and as soon as that big policy document is out the list will get prioritized in conjunction with that policy so we 've just approved or the council has just approved creating a climate action consultative committee and that climate action consultative committee will help with both the policy document and the prioritising of this list of yeah so thank you and we 'll see you at the next one you _"

    "text": "hello everyone this is grace here from mossman library service and today i will be demonstrating how to make your very own cardboard loom at home and also a very basic weave like this one here to begin you will need cardboard you just need a simple piece like this it doesn 't have to be fancy in either a square or a rectangular shape and it can be whatever size you like you 'll need scissors and a pencil and yarn so the wool that you use can be any different color any type of colors that you like i 've chosen some very simple colors here very neutral but you can choose bright colors if you like but you 'll need at least two or three different colors so the first step is to mark out some lines on the cardboard you want them to be about one centimeter apart you can use a ruler if you want to be exact but the key is to have them lining up at the top as they do at the bottom and then you want to cut make small incisions to be just thick enough to uh wrap your weave around so your warp okay so the second step is you want to warp your loom so you take whichever colored yarn you would like to be the warp okay take two so you want to take your whopping thread or yarn and you want to flip over the cardboard and mine looks quite rough here but that 's okay it 's only the back of the loom um and you want to take the first notch thread some warp thread some yarn through a wool through and just tie a double knot here and flip it back over take the thread all the way down to the first notch and then just go behind like that so you will end up with all of the straight lines on this side and just little notches like that on the back [Music] so now you actually have your loom your cardboard loom it 's warped and ready to go and i 'm going to show you a basic weave called um the tabby weave or the tabby stitch and the first pencil and just place it behind your warp just push it right to the top there like that and the reason you want to do that is just because it will give you a bit of space to work with so it will make weaving a lot easier so the next step is to take your yarn in the color that you 'd like to go on first and just measure it out it doesn 't have to be exact but i like to just go like this a few times i only want about three or four uh white lines to begin with so that will be enough yarn for me just cut it off there so you want to take your first thread and tie it around the first warp thread at the bottom here i also like to leave a little bit of space so you can measure that out exactly if you want to but it 's no big deal because you can just kind of adjust the weave as you go as you 'll see later but just give yourself a little bit of space the first water thread and then to begin with the tabby weave it 's very simple you just go over and under and over and under and then back again so we 're starting here is over pick up the thread you want to go under over under over under so on and then just pull it through like so if that 's in the right position then you don 't need to push anything down or adjust it but you can if you want to and then you just take the thread and we go back to to the other side so we 're going the opposite way this time if it was over before make sure it 's under this time so under then over [Music] so now you know how to do a simple tabby weave and you can actually just continue on in your weave with the tabby with the tabby pattern in different colors if you like or you can do all the same color that 's up to you also keep in mind you don 't actually have to use wool or yarn you or even if you 've found a plastic bag i 've seen a nice weave where someone cut up a plastic bag and recycled it and and made a beautiful weave out of it you could also use plants leaves grass that you find in the garden or on a long walk so keep that in mind it doesn 't have to be wool and with the tubby stitch it 's very simple it 's very easy to to make anything look really beautiful but before we carry on with the tabby pattern i 'm going to show you how to do a very simple a very simple tassel so just adding tassels on the end it 's actually called raya knots so i 'm going to show you how to do that with my black yarn so the first thing you want to think about with your tassels is the length that you would like and also how many you need to make so the number will depend on how many warp threads you 've got so i have 15. you might need more or less depending on the and then you want to take the yarn in whichever color you would like your tassels and estimate about how long you would like them to be you can always trim them later to make them even but initially you want to measure roughly how long you want that how long you 'd like them to be i 'd like mine to be about that length so you take that length and you double it to make a loop like this okay so that 's fine and i will trim that and then i can now use this piece to measure all of the others so i 'm going to cut 15 of those so now that you 've cut all of your tassel threads you want to take two of them so two pieces of yarn fold them over in your hand like that to make a loop so that it 's even line it up with the first two whop threads like that and all you have to do is take we call this the loop and we call each of these the feet so line up the want to take one pair of feet and you weave it around the outside and thread it through in the middle like that and then you do the same on the other side so that it looks like that and then you just pull it through pull it down so it looks like that and then you 've made a ray a knot it 's very simple that 's your first tassel [Music] okay so now that you 've done your tassels we can begin again with the tubby weave so continuing on with that same stitch as before with the white but in a different color or you can go back to the white if you like that 's up to you i 'm using cream which is the same color as my warp [Music] so for the rest of the weave i 'm just going to continue on alternating my yarn colors continuing with this tabby weave there are many different styles of weaves that you can do i 've just taught you a very simple one today you can look them up and we have lots of and limb patterns and you can also find lots of lots of styles online to follow [Music] when you 're happy with your pattern and the way that your wall hanging looks you will want to remove it from the loom so how to do that is going to get the tassels out of the way so just place them there and then you want to cut these warp threads carefully i do the first two first and tie a double knot and then do the rest of them in pairs and tie them up [Music] once you have cut and tied all of those in a double knot you can trim them just be really careful not to undo the knots so once the bottom part is finished you just want to remove the top part of the weave sorry of the wok from your loom and to do that you can just pull it off from the back carefully until you have loops just for the purpose of demonstration i 'm going to use the pencil but i 'd recommend that you go for a nice long walk through these loops and then you 've got yourself a nice wall hanging that you made on your very own cardboard loom thank you so much for following along _"

    "text": "good evening and welcome ladies and gentlemen to mossman council 's climate action forum uh it 's with great pleasure that we invite you uh to participate in this forum um and it i apologize i apologize for the delays that have occurred to date um but i am pleased to announce we 've got a stellar list of uh speakers tonight um who will be presenting from their own perspectives climate change actions and policies and it will also be an opportunity for you yourself to contribute hopefully in opening up this application and viewing this webinar you have seen a panel which includes q a questions you can ask if you 'd like to write those in our moderators we 'll look at those and publish them and there will be opportunities for us to put those questions to the speakers tonight before i hand over to the mayor to formally welcome you all to this online webinar i 'll just go through the list of speakers uh that we have and also give you an idea of the time frames um that we will be taking so corrigan to formally welcome you all and then that will be closely followed by zali stigels our federal member for moringa we then have a a short uh pre-recorded message from matt king our state minister for environment for the environment and energy unfortunately he was unable to be in this webinar in person live due to work commitments we then have a professor david schwarzberg who 's a professor of environmental politics at the university of sydney and director of the sydney environmental institute and then again we have another recorded message from our state member here on the north shore for the city wilson who will be in conversation with matt keane and be getting some questions from some students at mossman public we ran out tonight with a presentation from our own climate change specialist dr ruth dewan and she will be telling us about some of the activities and actions we 're already doing here at mossman council and some things you yourselves at home might wish to do or attempt to do to avoid climate change in your own backyards at the end of this mentioned but i would like uh hopefully wrap up proceedings uh in approximately an hour and a quarter at about 7 15. so with no further ado to get things underway i will now hand over to our mayor thank you dominic and a warm remote welcome to everyone attending tonight 's mossman council inaugural climate forum i would like to begin this evening as always by recognising the traditional inhabitants of the land on which we are meeting tonight including the borough gagel and the camarega people acknowledge aboriginal elders past and present and pay respect to them and to their heritage as dominic said we have a stellar lineup of speakers tonight representatives from every level of government plus internationally renowned academics who are speaking tonight to you largely as one voice and on one issue and that is taking action to mitigate man-made climate change to comprehensively address climate change every level of government in australia needs to act urgently and act with strong and decisive leadership in november last year mossman council took the decisive step of declaring a climate emergency immediately the hunt was on and sustainability team and to start work on a comprehensive climate action plan this was followed in july when council unanimously adopted the following resolution to achieve a net zero emission target for all council operations by 2030 and to set an aspirational net zero emission target for our community by 2040 the climate action plan will complement council 's current environmental management plan and will incorporate existing environmental functions and climate action mitigation actions already undertaken by council the plan will spell out an emissions reduction pathway that will be costed and will be in line with our overarching strategic plan the moss plan the plan will also provide leadership guidance and education to assist our community with its emissions reduction pathway council is really excited to tap into the wealth knowledge and passion in our community when it adopts its climate action community consultation committee anyone interested in nominating has until september the 16th and please check out our website for any further details our collective journey has begun and with tonight 's excellent roll up i have total confidence that mossman can meet its targets and that crisis thank you dominic thank you very much madam mayor uh and well said um i will now hand over to the federal member for roringa a face that will be familiar to many of you and a name that will also ring some bills um zali has obviously campaigned on the issue of climate change and so we 're very interested to hear from her about how that 's faring and about what other matters she may be addressing both remotely and while she 's in canberra over to years island thank you so much thank you um mia corrigan and mossman council for inviting me really is an important topic to be addressing um firstly i would also like to pay my respects to the first people of waringa the gay to their elders past and present maybe work together for a sustainable prosperous future for all future generations now i think we can 't start the conversation about climate without maybe acknowledging our environment and we had a pretty big week last week in parliament when it comes to the environment we had the environmental protection biodiversity house of the parliament i was fairly upset with that it was not good legislation we have a mandated 10-year review of our conservation laws uh the review we have an interim report to date the samuels review uh the inter interim report recommended that were identified that we really are not doing enough we are falling behind and our current uh laws are not protective enough unfortunately the government 's reaction was not to wait for the final review or put stronger laws in place it was actually to dilute our protective laws so passed in the lower house legislation that failed to address a number of the recommendations that the samuel review had required um essentially divesting the decision making making to state governments now state governments i would argue are conflicted because they have self-interest of revenue that comes from large projects and so it 's very difficult for them to then apply a protective aspect to the approval process so i had moved some amendments around water triggers so that the decisions as to water use should not be left to state especially where it relates standards unfortunately the debate got gagged by the government and so the bill is now before the uh will be before the senate when the parliament resumes in october and uh it will be up to the cross bench in the senate to oppose it uh so anyone very vocal on this issue should write to senators in particular the cross bench senators and ensure that they block this legislation but on climate we 've got a lot of other things to talk about and i 'm happy to take some questions about those events um it 's clear that 2020 has been a really tough year and we 've all uh it 's been a real challenge from a health point of view uh and especially an economic point of view but what we do have is uh the prime minister has been listening to the science on the virus and the premiers have been and we absolutely must do the same on climate we need to stand up and listen to the science and what we have is amidst the sort of the devas economic devastation of the from this recession and legislation around climate change can actually facilitate this so this is not a question of uh the economy or the environment it 's actually a question of the economy and the environment so 2020 bushfires drought covered 19 i mean it really has been uh a shock and it really has you know not just to the australian economy but to the global economy um the disruption has been across all sectors uh and it has been that brutal reminder that we are not isolated from world events that we can 't uh we can 't just carry on without uh feeling the impacts of what 's going to happen around the world so um and it is that comparison where it comes to the arguments when it comes to climate change which have often been that we 're only a small player and so what can we really do so what it really shows is we well the facts are we are a big player but also um that no one is immune and these that we are in a global society and we have of what coming out of the pandemic if we address some of the the opportunities um that we can we really can transition to where we need to be to address climate change so um that opportunity is something that i 'm urging the government to embrace but at the moment they are falling short of really doing that because if properly embraced we really can unlock immense productivity and environmental benefits um what is missing in australia is that we don 't have policy framework and that way is where the climate change bill comes in but first i think we all need to be realistic about where we 're at the australian bureau of statistics estimates that we 've had lost about 520 000 jobs so far during the pandemic uh in june a survey of 22 economists was published um and the uh the economist agreed that the unemployment would remain higher than seven percent for the next several years um so it really is going to take a long-term concerted plan to get us back on track and of course we know that it is overwhelmingly it 's right that we need to be fiscally prudent but we are going to have to inject money into the economy um and what we really need to see is that public funds are spent for good long-term economic opportunity and job opportunity and so to the only answer there is to that is that it needs to be a climate smart stimulus because we know it is such a challenge ahead it will boost employment and it will reduce employ emissions at the same time now we know climate impacts are accelerating professor thomas compass at the university of melbourne he that they have really important work on the question of the costs of climate change they 've estimated that the temperature goals if we don 't meet the uh if we fail to meet the temperature goals of the paris agreement the australian economy will suffer something like 2.7 trillion dollars in cumulative damages over the next three three decades and i think we can fairly say we all got a glimpse of that this summer with the cost of that with cost going into billions when bushfires our tourism impacted by smoke our cities cloaked by smoke so it really is a summer that we may want to forget but we should never forget it because actually it 's a lesson we really need to have imprinted in our mind of the kind of future we have unless we take proper action so the combination of the virus and climate um is a fiscal burden on younger generations that we simply have to address and it 's never been seen before um at the moment youth unemployment is actually astronomically high at 16.3 percent and they are the generation that will bear the burden of climate impacts so the government has an absolute responsibility to step in and deliver that long-term policy that will provide generational equity oxford university has recently shown that we can really it 's a win-win situation that if you uh invest into clean technologies there will be an economic athlete uplift so uh this uh you get about double the amount of jobs for the same investment in clean technologies as you do in fossil fuel technologies so in a situation a priority uh we 've seen of course many countries are going that way the international monetary fund uh our focus are calling on governments to focus on a green recovery we 've seen the european union focus um they 've just passed a seven year budget of half a trillion uh to go to climate smart initiatives so many many countries are focusing on that um and it 's about looking at all the ways in which we can build it into the recovery package whether it is around solar electric vehicles charging infrastructure energy efficiency we need to talk about retrofitting homes for efficiency batteries and of course green hydrogen many countries have already uh recognized the benefit of all this but australia is still very much lagging behind um but a lot of work 's been done beyond zero emissions have done a calculation of around 355 000 people per year in work around a million the jobs plan to get to net zero uh same with uh the clean um energy council so i released earlier this year the climate change bill which is a framework australian government of net zero by 2050 now this is not a controversial goal this is a goal that all states and territories are committed to all our large corporations are committed to um and many many european nations are committed to so really the only person sitting not at the table at the moment is the federal government this bill is uh drafted to mirror the provisions of the uk bill into that was implemented in 2008 and has been really efficient in driving economy and driving their progress around the sustainability and a lot of sectors so we can really learn from they 've got 10 years where we can learn for how it 's worked i mean we recently had uh the new south wales premiere gladys barijiki and actually in a conference with former uk prime minister theresa may pointing out that it would be the stuff of dreams if we could only have that kind of legislation well that legislation i will be tabling it in parliament in november and i 've been meeting with a number of coalition backbenchers and many people within the locks into legislation and net zero target by 2050. now that is the minimum we need to reach to have a hope of staying under two degrees and it 's close to 1.5 i know many people would like to see it sooner but i think we need to at least draw that line in the sand for all governments of australia to say we cannot pass that point then we have five year emission reduction budgets built into the bills so that we have accountability we have an independent climate change commission which of course will ensure that we have accountability to the public and then we can assess how we are traveling along that journey and clearly after the summer we 've had we need proper national risk assessment when it comes to climate change impacts and we need adaptation planning we can 't have a situation where reports are made and drawn and warnings are given to government about risks across whether it be environmental risk whether it be health risks or whether it be employment across communities and that these warnings are ignored is a major prescriptive in saying how you have to fix it but it is saying you have to fix it and you 'll have to account to the australian public at a regular basis i think it 's a really important starting point trying to end the climate wars and put australia on track for a sensible future so uh we put the legislation on hold while um obviously the pandemic hit initially but it is really important that he come back to the four of the discussion the government will be presenting a a budget in october that must address a clean recovery uh and i should say the few amendments have been made to the bill mainly to incorporate the government 's technology roadmap because a key part of delivering net zero by 2050 is regular technology readiness assessment and that is something the roadmap can deliver but it is not the complete picture which is why it 's really important that we still have the climate change bill so thank you for having me on i 'm really excited about the work that mossman council is doing um i sorry um but i 'm really keen to take some questions later uh thank you very much azalea and i do encourage all of you listening um to put in some questions we 've got a list already and and we 'll certainly come back to you zali with some questions which have been put to you and specifically around how we can influence uh your fellow politicians down in canberra to uh cross the fence or or make that leap of faith to um to actually address the signs and do something about it um at this juncture i 'd like us to uh to hear a message from uh minister king who as i mentioned is the minister for both the environment and energy um within the new south wales context minister king i guess has been quite outspoken in the space of climate change and if you are concerned about climate change he should be applauded for doing just that and has spoken um quite publicly on many occasions about an appetite to not only deal with climate change but also the connection between climate change and were just experienced so with that i might just uh play for you a recorded message from matt keane thank you for the invitation to speak at this mossman council climate strategy and action plan community forum today i 'm speaking to you from the traditional lands of the gadigal people of the eora nation and i extend my respects to elders past present and emerging as i recall this message more than 1.2 million hectares of california have been ravaged by wildfires it 's an area almost as large as the grand canyon we 've seen news reports of fires burning hotter than ever before and dangerous fire conditions lingering longer than ever before it all sounds dreadfully familiar to us here on the other side of the world as we recover from our own black summer these are exactly the kinds of extreme weather events that climate scientists have been warning us about for decades the climate challenge we face is monumental but it 's not insurmountable the state of new south wales has a net zero plan which is fully funded with a 2 billion investment from road map to cut emissions by 35 on the way to net zero emissions by 2050 and as we respond to the economic hit from the covert 19 pandemic we 've hit the accelerator on investment in climate-friendly infrastructure that boosts growth and creates new jobs it 's a whole of economy plan targeting electricity and energy efficiency electric vehicles hydrogen primary industries coal innovation organic waste and carbon financing the state government is leading by example we 're accelerating solar on the rooftop of new south wales government buildings and we 're working towards a target of 30 percent of new government passenger fleet car purchases to be hybrid or electric by 2023 with 10 of purchases alone being electric and we 're seeking proposals to shift sydney 's entire 8 000 strong bus fleet to an electric vehicle fleet our net zero plan makes good environmental sense but it also makes good economic sense today everyone is competing for job creating investment not just states but countries because the economic downturn is global and deep international investors have made it clear that environmental sustainability is a key threshold government 's approach from investors in response to our call for registrations of interest in the central western renewable energy zone it 's australia 's first coordinated renewable energy zone the modern day equivalent of a traditional power station bringing together low-cost solar with wind with transmission and storage to help meet our future enemy needs we 've got a whopping 27 000 megawatts of proposals worth potentially 38 billion dollars in new private capital that 's nine times the amount needed to make the renewable energy zone a reality the government is also bringing forward investment in a renewable energy zone in new england which aims to attract 8 000 megawatts of transmission capacity this is the biggest commitment to cheap clean energy in the state 's history we 've made a great start but there is much more to do we can 't_''_1387.36 do it all alone the state government is absolutely committed to working with local councils to achieve real carbon abatement vegans because it all adds up i 'm looking forward to working with council and all residents as we build a cleaner and greener future the minister uh specifically about that strong commitment to climate change and climate change action i 'd like to infer there was the offering of a grant to mossman council but i think that might be a bridge too far um we continue to get some great questions um and i unfortunately obviously minister keane won 't be able to answer them himself um but i 'm sure we can record these and i 'll just note that there will be a recording of this webinar available in the next couple of days on our website um so we 've heard from the minister it 's now time to turn to some of the science and perhaps also the politics around climate change so i 'm now going to hand over to professor david schlossberg who as i mentioned earlier is a professor of environmental politics at the university of sydney but also where 's the second hat of being the director of the sydney environment institute over to you dave thanks very much and um thanks to mayor corrigan and dr irwin thanks to sonny sigal for all of do want to acknowledge that i am on unseated gadagaland so i 'm yeah i 'm the director of the sydney environment institute and an environmental social scientist my research teams have done applied work with the city of sydney on their community engagement in their adaptation policy development done work with resilient sydney doing research on actual community experiences of shock climate events i 'm also part of a university of sydney based research hub on the human health and social impacts of climate change funded by deepai and new south wales health and my work includes a team examining the mental health impacts of climate change in rural communities so that 's all to say that my own academic interests and focus on policy responses to climate change are not primarily around issues of mitigation or fossil fuel use my work is much more about the experience of climate change and of the planning necessary to adapt and live just lives in the midst of ongoing stresses and shocks of a climate challenged world yes clearly we absolutely need to end the mining and use of fossil fuels other systems to 100 renewables but the reality is as we saw here last summer and as we 're seeing across the world now no matter what we do in the next few years to shut down fossil fuels and build a renewables powered future some level of temperature rise and climatic change are literally baked into our future we can absolutely limit these impacts by acting on medication now but the science tells us what we can expect even if we could just flick a switch and shut it all down tomorrow more fires more storms and floods more heat waves more sea level rise and more people communities species and environments made more vulnerable so no matter the state of local national global mitigation efforts planning for adaptation and resilience will be one of the most widespread public policy needs of the coming century and unfortunately there 's actually less adaptation planning happening now in australia than there was just a decade ago so my concern is not only about doing more of that planning but also whether those processes and policies around adaptation and resilience are done points to make in this 10 minutes from my perspective we need to talk more about our existing vulnerabilities and the inequity of climate exposures we need to talk about the public 's interest in just climate solutions including just adaptation and we need to talk more about funding inclusive adaptive and transformative processes so on the first point let 's just be clear that climate change is not only a threat multiplier but a vulnerability multiplier an inequity multiplier and this isn 't some future thing or some new thing vulnerable communities have long felt the very real impacts of climate change we just had the 15th anniversary of hurricane katrina which hit new orleans in august 2005. katrina killed over 1800 people as it impacted and those killed killed were mainly poor african-american residents many of whom simply could not afford to evacuate no cars nowhere to go no support and katrina importantly exposed the relationship between existing institutionalized racism institutionalized inequality institutionalized exclusion discrimination and the impacts of climate change and in the last 15 years katrina has been followed by many storms with the same kind property more poor people left to fend for themselves so right now weeks after laura hit the louisiana coast people are without homes without power during a heat wave without water and just this year we 've seen absolutely massive flooding in pakistan at one point a third of bangladesh underwater india suffering both floods and related landslides and the decimation of the rice crop in nigeria and parts of china and that 's just storms and flooding right in addition who estimates over 166 000 deaths in the last 20 years due to heat waves which are australia 's deadliest climate hazard heat waves are the single biggest indicator of climate and justice because the difference in vulnerability is so stark who dies in heat waves poor people mainly poor people who live alone if you have an air conditioner in the means to run it you simply do not die in a heat wave so california right now is experiencing the hottest temperatures on record and we can be sure it 'll be the poor the homeless the elderly living alone the already socially and medically vulnerable that there will be as many heat wave deaths in mossman as compared to parts of western sydney poor rural areas of the state areas of both poverty and already stressed healthcare and housing infrastructure and i suspect we 'd see the same demographic breakdown if we looked at those impacted by bushfire smoke here and in california those already vulnerable more likely to suffer respiratory distress so that 's my first point um to make it just in in talking about justice and adaptation so i start from the premise that the impacts of climate change are not distributed equally we live under the reality of not only climate change but climate injustice the second thing i want to talk about is how all of this overlaps and engages and informs thinking about climate adaptation what does a critical and thorough just adaptation look like and on adaptation is on so many things there 's often a deep disconnect between the framings used by policy makers and those used by community members and environmental groups simply put most governments focus on risk management risk assessment and liability while residents tend care of the most vulnerable and we saw this directly when running the resident engagement for the city of sydney as they developed their adaptation plan a few years back my team led a two and a half day deliberative democratic process for a random group of local residents who were tasked with reflecting all the risks and the policy proposals identified by external consultants and what we saw from residents was an immediate shift away from just this risk framework and to a move uh that questioned vulnerability and justice and environment so for example on day one a rep from the city showed the residents a heat map of the sydney lga taken late on a hot summer night and it showed some areas of the city clearly hotter than others in order to illustrate the risk that he posed in the city but residents immediately pointed out that the heat wouldn 't be a problem in the richer areas of the city those folks all have air conditioning they pointed to the public housing at redfern and waterloo where people wouldn 't have ac so the residents most vulnerable populations and not just with heat waves but with the inequality and the impacts of flooding on issues of food insecurity and mental health and stress now in addition the resident panel was quite interested in bringing the impacts on the vulnerability of non-human nature the flora and fauna of the city from parks to bats from the trees in their gardens to the pets they walked around their neighborhoods the point here is that a panel of randomly selected residents when tasked with prioritizing adaptation policies focused on those most vulnerable human and non-human alike and you might say that 's just sydney but we 've seen the same thing replicated in many other areas and that leads to the third point that i want to close on and that 's about the current need for more substantive and community-based adaptation research planning and policy so during the bush fires last summer the pm insisted that we need to pivot from mitigation to resilience and adaptation of course it 's not about pivoting it 's about doing all of the above but the reality is that adaptation closed the csiro climate adaptation flagship 2014 they 've ignored the national climate resilience adaptation strategy in 2015 and defunded the national climate change adaptation research facility which was a global model for adaptation research and they did that in 2017 so put bluntly there are two kinds of willful ignorance illustrated by the federal government when it comes to the reality of climate change and our need to mitigate adapt transition and transform so we obviously continue to have the willful ignorance of climate science at the highest levels of the federal government but we also have the willful ignorance and the intentional exclusion of the knowledge experience and preferences of local communities that are now actually suffering from the reality of climate change think of that amazing image of the pm visiting kabargo in the midst of the bushfires and literally turning his back and walking away from community members telling him what they needed the point is if we 're going to address resilience and adaptation such work needs to be substantive inclusive and just and for me adaptation really has to engage with the preferences with communities resilience practitioners here in sydney and in melbourne have done incredible work to illustrate the crucial nature of community engagement and not just stakeholder engagement but broad community engagement that 's part of the long-term planning and that goes hand-in-hand with emergency management and disaster recovery as we 've seen over the last few months so hopefully the newly established brazilians new south wales will engage in such adaptation planning in addition to emergency response and we need the same from local councils and i 'm really happy to be participating with you tonight so i hope that before more heat waves more fires more regional flooding more sea level rise more climate anxiety that we see more funding and planning for real engaged community adaptation planning residents can imagine different futures more sustainable and just futures we just need to ask them about it and get on with the change thanks well thank you very much professor schlossberg and that was um elegantly put and i can see again more questions coming through uh i guess we 're getting three types of questions some of them are very science real what can we do um are there sort of any questions about the science we 're getting some that are very much pitched at an international federal level about how we influence our current politicians it sounds like some uh are going to be quite resistant to that and are there new ways to attempt and then finally we 're getting some questions around quite locally what can we do um that 's a nice segue um which ultimately will find its way to our own climate change specialist dr erwin but before we get to ruth let 's have a pre-recorded message from our state member felicity wilson where she 's having a conversation with and a few questions from some local children who some viewers and i think we 've got about 170 having signed on i 'm not sure how many we currently have but it 's quite a number um who uh they may actually know these children be either parents or even the children hopefully are in this world themselves so with that um thank you osman the opportunity to talk about climate the effect of energy into putting together a strategy and action plan to address climate change it 's one of the key issues constantly raised with me by our community and we have some really proactive individuals we 'll get to in a minute but i wanted to join with our minister for the environment matt keane here in new south wales many of you would know him he 's a strong advocate for our environment and you would see him always out there making sure that we 're investing in what we need to create a safe and healthy new south wales australia and the globe into the future and one of the things that was really profound to me in talking to you guys tonight about climate change and the opportunities that we have is thinking about not just the our own futures but the facts matter i both have young children one of the reasons i 'm not there is i 'm about to have another one and um because we 've got these young children i do think it it adds an extra layer of the to think about the future for everybody 's children and our own which i think is really profound it 's can be scary but it 's a really good opportunity and so one of the things that i thought would be a great way of working uh with matt on this conversation tonight is reaching out to some of our school students and getting their questions for the minister we 've got a couple of those we 'll go to in a minute but i just want to make sure you knew who our minister for the environment was that he is working really closely with me and with our colleagues on making sure that we can get the best outcomes for our state in that community and he knows how important this is for mossman locally so i 'm really glad the council 's working on it um minister you 're joining us here tonight yeah felicity thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you mossman council for your leadership in this space on personal note can i just say thank you so much to you you no one more important supporting me in the government than you felicity in making sure that we leave our planet to our kids better than we found it so thank you for your outstanding leadership we 've got a big battle ahead of us we 've got to make sure that you know we 're expanding and protecting our beautiful natural environment that 's why we 're aggressively trying to expand our national park footprint we 've got to protect our marina state we need to deal with the challenge of waste we want to see us reducing reusing and doing more recycling these are some big policy challenge challenges but the biggest challenge that we have to deal with is the issue of climate change reducing our emissions to ensure that we leave our planet in a better place than we found it so we 've got a lot to do for the city and again thank you so much for your help in moving the dial when it comes to hitting that net zero target ensuring you get there by 2050. thank you mister and those all resound joined me out at the national park at middle head we 're investing quite a bit in the national park there we 're also surrounded by the harbour we care a lot about our marine environment so we want to make sure that we 're benefiting locally but we really have a social confidence about the rest of the globe and our responsibilities and that 's that 's particularly obvious in the questions we 've got from our students so maybe we should go to surya from moscow public school awesome hello minister keane i 'm sarah christian head from austin public school it 's clear to me even as a ten-year-old that we are facing a climate crisis we are already seeing billions of people from our planet suffering from extreme weather events i felt the impact of climate change personally over the new year my family was on the south coast visiting my grandparents and i saw firsthand the impact of the devastating bushfires it was very scary i 've learned about the paris agreement and that australia has agreed to keep the global temperature rise this century to achieve this we need to phase out fossil fuel burning and moves to more renewable energy sources minister keen thank you for the opportunity to ask you a question could you please let us know what the new south wales government is doing to move to more renewable energy sources thank you thank you so much soraya i really appreciate your question and especially everything you and the muslim public school community are doing and we 've been really excited to get some support for you for the solar panels going on at the school and i i love your sustainability club and all the work that you 're doing on the grassroots level locally even going down to clean up balmoral beach because i think these are these are small initiatives that individuals can achieve to make a real difference for our globe so thank you for everything you 're doing but the bigger question obviously minister is what are we doing as a state for renewable energy well can i just say soraya thank you so much for that great question and more importantly thank you for environment our future because ensuring that we protect our planet is going to be key to making sure we not only have a great environment but also a strong economy and that 's what this is all about so the new south wales government has recently released its net zero strategy so that 's about hitting zero net emissions by 2050. we 've set a 35 emissions reduction target for and we 're well on the way to achieving that but our strategy to do that is as you said to get more renewable energy into the system the biggest contributor to carbon emissions in new south wales is our electricity system right now eighty percent of our electricity comes from five coal fire power stations and by 2035 four of them will come to the end of their lives they need to be replaced and the while that the way they 'll be replaced has been set out in the electricity strategy which i recently released which says that we 'll be focusing on ensuring that we have reliable affordable energy now the cheapest form of reliable energy today not nuclear it 's wind and solar backed up by pumped hydro so this is not just good for our environment it 's good for families and businesses who get lower electricity bills as we see more wind more solar more batteries more pumped hydro coming into the system a wonderful byproduct of that is it 's also a great win for our planet so our focus is on transitioning away from our existing older technology to newer technology that will be cheaper it will be reliable but it will also be far cleaner and better for our planet uh thank you for that um so look we do have a little bit more to hear from the minister which we will attempt to uh play for you if time allows but i am conscious of time um i think we 've got two more questions there that are put to both the minister and our state member um but in the interim i would actually like us to uh now turn our attention to uh dr ruth erwin dr ruth joined council at the beginning of this year and that there is a range of climate change activities being considered and implemented and as the mayor said earlier some of those have been in play for some time but she 's also in the process of developing some documents that are going to assist us going forward but also reaching out to you in the community through a variety of matters which she will now explain and put to you over to you dr ruiz thanks dominic um first of all i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of this land which is the borough gagel and the kamarigo people and their kin relationship to country it 's a real pleasure to be here and my task is probably bringing these big ideas that we 've been hearing uh tonight from all these wonderful speakers into the much more narrow realm of mossman so some of it will be a little bit dry and a little bit sort of data driven um i you would just have to bear with me while we do all of that but i think essentially the climate emergency that the community asked enormous difference to the way that the council now operates and i think the community at large really recognises that business as usual really hasn 't been helping us to function to have a functional relationship with the environment for a long time so for 200 years we 've had business as usual that is taking us in a trajectory that 's really not amenable to continue life really so what 's going on here is a transition it 's a subtle transition in many ways towards a green community green economics green law green policy and a green way of life so this image that i 've put up here is actually the fires from last summer and i think that that 's had a very very profound impact on the way that australians really view climate change so although up until fairly recently australia has been relatively resistant to the idea that climate change is real there really is no um no way to hide any longer so what we can see is that last summer 1.25 billion animals died in the fires and that 's incredibly significant as david was saying a little bit earlier on the vulnerabilities of people coping with the fires as they carry on because i 'm afraid that that 's not going to be the last one tends to hit the vulnerable more than it does people with access to things like air conditioning or or in the council 's case that we can keep the library open and make sure that people have access to air conditioning that way so um that fire was at the stage of 1.1 degree above pre-industrial levels of temperature across the globe and it 's looking very much that we have already committed so much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere that we 're almost certain to reach 1.5 degrees of temperature across the globe and that involves wildfires such as happening in california right now ice melt and 100 year storms happening nearly every year so business as usual is the pink zone that you can see at the top there of that slide and obviously it takes us into a temperature of you know four or five even six degrees which is completely untenable animals if we got to four or five degrees then we would be deeply in one of the largest extinction events that the climate that the earth has ever had since the dinosaurs went extinct so we 're all aiming for 1.5 degrees hopefully and 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels at the outside one of the things that 's happened under business as usual is that we externalize economic pollution we externalized pollution from having to be analyzed by the cost-benefit analysis and that meant that we could divorce our relationship to the environment so we had this very anthropocentric very human orientated view of the world and that enabled us to be very exploitative in our relationship to the environment i think with this green turn that 's going on at the moment this transition towards green community green economics green law and policy and way of life we no longer can afford to have that very stark divorce between humanity and nature and instead we need to be starting to think about how these two things are inextricably linked together so one of the things about a green about the way that the community environment and the environment and humans are working together we already know if we take a very realistic look at what 's going on that our planet is dangerously close to its limits to its boundaries and finally that our economic and technical solutions have to become more ecologically literate so everything we do needs to put ecology at its centre rebecca salmon says something i think is a very very important way of thinking about things so some people are looking at technology as though it 's a solution that 's going to solve all of our problems and we don 't need to really change business as usual much at all except to add some technological solutions to the mix that 's probably not going to fly for a start we just don 't have enough technological solutions to make that happen so we really do have to start thinking about our lifestyle but secondly there 's another group sort of at the opposite extreme of that which is to say that you know all technology is bad and we should just into the stone age that sort of idea but for 7.8 billion people that we have on the planet now um we simply cannot do that there isn 't enough land mass to do that sort of return to land so we have to create a kind of a middle way that puts ecological literacy in the midst of all our decision making and all of our technological know-how and rebecca solnit has this lovely saying i think which is to say that instead of falling into a despair trap because of the impacts of climate change that action without hope is very difficult and hope without action starves itself so i 'm getting to the nitty-gritty of what 's going on in mossman here so this is our real progress um over the last six months so one of the things that happened after mossman council declined declared a climate emergency in november 2019 was that they hired myself and nola so where we make one and a half people who are totally committed to climate change which is a really big commitment for the council to make out in general we have been working really really hard on developing new policy that will hopefully start to guide the council and making ecological decisions at the center of everything the council does so we 're working on climate action policy we 're also working on quite a few mitigation projects as we do the policy development so we 've already for example put solar panels on the sports center and we 're now in the process of looking at solar panels to put on top of the depot and we 're also putting an ev charger somewhere in the center of mossman probably just behind the council buildings so we 're starting with um mitigation program projects and we 're also looking at policy adaptation and resilience thanks nishan so these are the three things that we 're doing mitigation adaptation and resilience we 'll move it along a little bit quicker than i was anticipating this is mossman 's emissions profile so you can see that electricity is the biggest emissions that the community at large has so most of the community engagement that we 've been doing households can reduce their electricity so we 've done a couple of things including a carbon calculator so the carbon calculator which is called climate cleaver is available online you can download that and have a look at how you can make your household more efficient and the other thing we 're doing is putting on little films on with the website which helps you to put solar panels on your roof and know what questions to ask and what sort of pricing and so on um you can see there too that the that the mossman uh region mossman lga has produced 132 000 megawatts last year of electricity um and in the last four years has gone from about 600 megawatts to nearly a thousand megawatts in solar production from people 's houses so that 's actually really good and in this year it 's going up even more quickly than that and i think a lot of that is to do with community groups that are really supporting solar in the area not just in mossman but in northern sydney so um a big sing out to council itself has got 1500 megawatts worth of electricity which has come down from about 2 000 so already there 's been a lot of things that have been taking place over the last 10 years but obviously there is some pretty easy wins for us to come down even further nishant come with the next slide right so i wanted to think about resilience and i think the thing with resilience is it 's a it 's about a thinking about our entire system as a socio socio-ecological system is adaptive flexible diverse and self-regulating so we need to be consider everything we do needs to be considering how it has an impact on the ecology as well as our communities so that 's thinking about the vulnerable as well as the um the not so vulnerable and i think one of the ways of doing that is to be stubbornly optimistic and not to fall into despair that 's a really important thing to bear in mind so this is our action for the next few months most of our work is going to be focused on policy up and in front of the council very very quickly so that 's going to be in front of the council next in november and then it will go out for community consultation in december or december january so look forward to that and you can see there 's a list of a whole lot of plans mitigation projects community building etc etc so if you have any questions you can ask for further details thank you thanks dominick 's back to you thanks very much very much terrific work i know i i did uh seek to hurry you up a little bit there because uh i was conscious time has been getting away from us um so look now we 're at that point where i 'm sure a number of the audience has been patiently waiting for and that 's to throw some questions at the panel as i mentioned there 's quite a variety and some of them are just statements which you can read for yourself but i might start with a really good question from cameron um early on in the piece where he emergency during 2019 given it was a decision of council and a result of a notice of motion i 'm going to throw that one at you madam mayor if that 's okay thank you thank you for that question i think that uh council like many people in the community had been really hoping that uh leadership was going to come from our national leaders from our national government from our federal government i think that essentially very much an overarching plan as zali said is not in place and needs to be in place and i think basically the council um actually got sick of waiting and decided that we needed to take the issue in hand ourselves there are a lot of other local government areas declaring a climate emergency and i think there was a sense that that 's what we 're going to do as our small community and that if every community does the same thing and declares an emergency that that might uh be a stimulus to uh get more action on the federal level but i think as i said everyone needs and uh that was just the we decided that was the year to bite the bullet and put our case totally into the public uh arena and bring in our community uh to join us thank you madam mayor um i think you 've answered two questions in one so there 's a question there from bob about what constitutes a climate emergency and i think what you 're describing is a sense of urgency and i guess what we 're hearing from other speakers as well tonight is that there is clearly enough data to suggest something must be done and that 's going to be done sooner rather than later so i might move to sherry hardy who has asked us a really good question about what it is that council might do in regards to integrating climate actions into our everyday decision making so i 'm going to throw that one to you ruth that 's a very very good question it 's um it 's not an easy thing to do actually because we have to go sort of through a policy making process to begin process and then from there we 'll probably have to look at the moss plan which is the plan that makes austin function for 10 years and then there 's big there 'll be a whole lot of other ways in which decision making needs to uh become greener and it 's not actually all about within council policy so some things for example the building code um is more federal and that definitely needs to be a lot greener it 's it really has very little um very little say about retrofitting or insulation or passive building or infrastructure or any of those things so the codex the building codex really needs some advocacy which we hope to do and we also hope to make sure that the community has access to a whole lot of really good information really good quality information about things like passive building and retrofitting for that and look i might just add to that um obviously by a climate change emergency being declared by the council you can be assured that it 's now front of mind for all of us including all over time as ruth says so the next question um is from cameron uh regarding i guess looking at other countries like the uk how do we achieve that that same bilateral appetite for action and this one 's uh fazali um obviously you 've knocked on a lot of doors and talked to a lot of people down in canberra but is there anything more we can do and is there anything more you can do to try and change people 's minds and maybe open their hearts to the idea of climate change action uh thank you well look cameron that is a real problem but i think just like the community in warringa decided that actually uh environmental environment and climate was an important issue i think other communities need to do it so what was interesting um with uh professor schlossberg 's talk was that in fact it 's going to hit some of our most vulnerable communities and yet that they tend to be some of those vulnerable communities don 't even acknowledge or recognize the risk they are in so it is i think it is moving too slowly for us to really affect the change we need so we have some communities that are very aware of the impact and very educated on the impact and the risks and are starting to demand more action i would argue that it is about holding all of your elected representatives to account so whether it be local government so i certainly applaud all three electorates in warringa have passed a climate emergency but that is uh acknowledging a state of affairs that requires action so it requires uh good waste management aspects it requires you know whether it 's more composting facilities uh leds lighting energy use making sure public buildings have solar panels making sure we have an electrification of transport there are so many actions that need to be taken now a lot of politicians will say the right words at election time they will make the promises they will say yes we 're concerned but they don 't follow it through with actions and that 's the part where i think we need to say enough so at federal level um unfortunately a number of people within the coalition that will say the right things but ultimately they are as useless in the fight against climate change as a desire so unfortunately a very moderate voice is as bad as a voice like craig kelly or matt canavan because their vote is the same unless they are prepared to cross the floor and represent the views of their community they do not move the the case forward so i have been talking with them but it 's also raising awareness within the communities to understand that we actually can do it the uk it is a conservative legislation that i 'm putting forward it 's it was passed by the tory government in the uk um this is absolutely something that everyone should be able to get behind but it 's up to every everyone listening it 's actually up to people in the community to demand change and demand action thank you for that um i 've got a somewhat tricky question which i 'm going to throw to you david so be prepared and i 'm throwing it to you anonymous one and i 'm going to it 's a statement maybe it 's a question it says california is shutting down its nuclear power and now now cannot power its grid reliably is there a message here we 're ignoring yeah look i really uh one of the things i really don 't understand even you know with a couple of decades in environmental politics behind me is all of this love for nuclear um nuclear i mean the economics just don 't add up the only places california included um uh you know where things have gone poorly uh you know who pays for this who pays for the building who pays for the planning who plays pays for the waste it 's the rate payers and the taxpayers so i mean the economics just don 't stand up especially compared um to the cost of renewables right now so i i really just don 't understand this uh sort of new love for nuclear that 's out there um but in terms of stability of the grid look um you know california has the same kind of expert you know in the technology of this but it 's an aging infrastructure and this is one and this goes to what 's all he 's talking about and others there needs to be some serious investment in electricity infrastructure in this country right and that 's something to get behind more than you know nuclear which not only doesn 't does it work economically but also affect vulnerable populations i mean this is you know where you get the uranium from that you get it from indigenous uh areas of this country and the u.s so all kinds of reasons uh why nuclear doesn 't stack up and all kinds of reasons why we need investment uh in new technology that actually works at cost thanks david well said and i guess to add to that is the notion that um as the situation gets more dire people are going to look wider and in more diverse ways for answers and so i guess some of the decision making may be out of desperation um i 've got a number of questions from someone called bob um he considered and again we 're still at the at the global level and i 'm going to throw this one to zali um how do we stop china building hundreds of coal-fired power stations well bob thank you but there 's a lot of misinformation in that question so the reality is a lot of uh energy production is turning towards renewables so in australia uh against action it 's always pointed to the example of china and india and because they are so large what can we possibly do now what we need to be truthful is about the facts about where australia ranks when it comes to our emissions on a per capita basis so on a per capita basis we are the 14th largest emitter in the world so it 's really important that we understand that we are a big contributor now where china is going china being a communist state-run government is the only one of the very few countries in the world that basically doesn 't have to look at the economics but can look at from an employment point of view but even not fast tracking or increasing when it comes to coal-fired power same with india in april during the pandemic we had one of the largest ever tenders for renewable power in india they are fast tracking their development of renewable capacity and they are very much not building new coal and even their nuclear program is on hold now a lot of people always turn to nuclear as something but reality is other than countries where it is state funded it simply is not being built there is only one other being built in in the uk and it is actually the worst um it 's an exam it 's a cautionary tale it was committed two years and years ago um and it was going to require massive subsidy by government so this idea that the rest of the world is not transitioning is simply false information there is a huge amount of data that shows that in fact many countries are transitioning away from high emission technologies now but let 's look at the positives we have the opportunity to be a clean energy superpower we have we in the world why are we fighting this this is our opportunity to be an energy superpower solar power will be the best source of energy to make green hydrogen and that is will be an exportable commodity so i 'm always really blown away by people who are focused on free market and competition and economic opportunity and yet they don 't want the economy that is staring us in the face so rather than worrying about the fallacy of where china is going it is really important to focus on what we need to do terrific answer um it 's like you 're prepared uh we might now uh hand over to you ruth we 've got a number of questions which are about mossman and our own plans as council but also what the community can do let 's start with uh will mossman council focus on biodiversity conservation in the face of the extinction crisis and i guess it 's well known that we are leaders as a country in um making our uh you know native flora and fauna extinct so um what 's is that space doctor yeah i think um mosquito council has actually done a really good job with the planting of trees and looking after the biodiversity in this lga for quite a long time so we 're very lucky it 's very leafy district and it 's got a national park it 's got the navy base and it 's got a whole lot of parks that the council itself actually looks after um the council 's got quite a commitment to planting new trees more trees in the streets to lower things like heat and we do a lot to make sure that the native floor and fauna are well cared for that 's why you see bush turkeys everywhere the the dilemma of course with things like fires is much bigger than this small mossman lga and so while mossman does try and use fire to keep the bush safe from fire we really don 't have a big we 're not a big player when it comes to the the bush fires that are happening in the new south wales region so we can only do our council i saw there is a question from adrian uh and echoed in a few other similar questions uh it 's important to fund these new climate projects how is council sourcing these funds many councils around us are using a special green levy um look i 've got to be honest i 'm not sure that i 've seen any levies in all the councils i 've worked in or or understand that there is a one specifically around climate change but i guess the the question and the heart of the question is how do we how do we pay for all of these projects and and this transition exercise uh okay that 's a really really important question and it 's one that we are only just starting to grapple with properly i think so we have a very small budget at the moment particularly because of covert 19 the council lost a whole lot of income so we 're really working on a very very small budget right now so we 're looking at alternative ways of funding some of these things for example making public in the led lighting for example and the council might rent it back so you know there are some ways around some of these issues but funding definitely is an issue i 'm personally unsurprising to most of you including dominic would be quite keen on levy i don 't think it needs to be called a climate change libya i think it could be easily a sustainability levy and there 's certainly a lot of other councils that are doing that and one of the things that we 're hoping to achieve when we put together the mitigation list and do some costings about that for the five years is to make a case that we could go for a levy to start funding some of these capital projects for mitigation and we really we 're very aware that um we want to reduce emissions as fast as possible because it makes a cumulative impact on what we don 't put into the atmosphere and we are very proud of the fact that mossman council has committed to reducing to net zero by 2030 so that 's a very it happens thanks for that obviously we will be incorporating uh the climate action plan into our mos plan as well so that should get some funding in terms of capital investment um so i 've got a question here from leslie for you david um and it is around the notion that mossman is a better off area than many others in in australia and the question is what is most important for our mainly wealthy municipality in relation to planning inclusively and equitably for adaption i 'm going to read it again i 've got it i saw that in front of me well i mean one of the things you did is vote for zolly so that helped um but i i think look even wealthy communities uh uh have vulnerable people and you don 't really learn about vulnerability until you talk to the community um one of the things that happened here a couple of years ago during heatwave and i i lived in the inner west which is also you know quite well off um and uh a neighbor of a friend had an a heat wave and nobody found her for weeks uh and you know in a wealthy area in one of the wealthiest cities in the world we have that so um it 's just a matter of talking to people and learning about where vulnerable people are who the vulnerable people are but it 's also this idea of inclusion isn 't just about vulnerability it 's about knowledge and one of the things that we learned when we did the community engagement for the city of sydney was just how much knowledge is embedded uh in community uh and the the consultants who drew up i mean there were two or three hundred risks that the consultants had come up with and they left out uh just an incredible number of things they didn 't think about wind and you know within a couple of months after this uh wind whipped through the downtown knocked windows out and you know and they fell to the street and the consultants hadn 't thought about that they hadn 't thought about parks they hadn 't thought about pets they hadn 't local uh environment and people brought that up and they brought their own expertise as well um i remember one person um who mentioned that the um the tree planting was fantastic but they were planting trees that were losing their leaves in rainstorms and those were blocking drains and so now people had flooding on streets where they never had it before and just that kind of feedback that kind of knowledge you would think would be crucial for councils to get as they do this kind of engagement so the inclusivity is important for knowledge the equity is important just for the sake of justice and you don 't get either of those things unless you really engage with the public thank you david um i 'm just going to wrap up the last couple of questions i 'm conscious it 's part seven um it 's a long time for anybody to watch i think we 've still got quite a lot of uh viewers um but unfortunately we 've got about 60 or more questions and i can 't to get all of them but but then we might cut to the remainder of the questions put to our state member and matt keane to wrap up and people can watch that at their leisure so uh i 've got a question from kate echols many of you will know her um have been involved in mosman parks and bushlands and it 's it 's about the notion that there is a dependency at the federal level uh on the fossil fuel industry and the donations that they may make to various parties or campaigns um sally is that something that you know is of of huge concern and um has that colored our approach to date or do you think that ultimately uh you know the notion of donations is is a side issue and it 's really more about jobs and and our history that 's dictated where we are now um no look i think there 's definitely an issue when it comes to donations to the major parties there are quite opaque uh rules when it comes to how sort of much disclosure there needs to be we have actually stronger laws example from developers or certain industry groups we don 't have any such restrictions at federal levels so there 's clearly a concern about that influence what we also have in australia is media law issues we have a concentration of media um and unfortunately we 've had a concentration of media in a sector that has been denying the science and denying the the urgency of the problem of climate change so it 's sort of become this you know it has caused an absolute paralysis in australia and that and it 's really um in a way that other countries just haven 't had it so in the uk it was actually they they took action in a bipartisan way both sides of all sides of politics came together to acknowledge that this was a common risk and a common threat that they all had a duty to address unfortunately instead in australia back well we actually at the end of his prime ministership john howard was acknowledging it but belatedly but was acknowledging that we needed to do something on climate change and was prepared to to then of course we saw labor introduce it unfortunately this got weaponized in australia for short-term political gain uh there was a fear and smear campaign in relation to what the effect of those policies were and so they were repealed and we 've had 10 years of complete paralysis in terms of taking proper action um in relation to climate in relation to policy and what that 's done is that that has increased our power prices that has increased the impact on our society and in particular as the professor says on the more vulnerable in society so um i think it 's really important uh that everyone be a little bit more um i i i think we need to demand expect more of our politicians it 's why i got into politics i felt like enough was enough and we needed to put some common sense back into this debate um will actually stop it being a debate um but but i think look we also need to acknowledge we we all have to change our habits we all have to do our bits so just a difference look to yourself look to your own actions look to your footprint we can all change our habits whether it 's transport whether it 's the energy use of our home how many i would be curious how many people that are listening tonight offset their emissions for example through tree planting programs so even if you 're not in position to put solar panels on your roof do you buy 100 renewable power even when you don 't have an electric vehicle do you offset your emissions by having by going through a program there are many out there if you take a holiday do you offset so i think we all need to take a level of responsibility for the actions that are within our power and then demand more of our elector elected officials thank you for that now i 've got time for one more question and and i 'd just like to note that um comments about trees and offsetting probably um make uh will tuck and all the people who agree with his comments about trees being one of the vital planks 'll take that to heart and agree with you so the final question for tonight was put to us by joku in at just before seven and it 's in the area of meat production um so uh the question is uh what is the environmental impact of meat production should council be encouraging a plant-based diet now that 's a that 's a curly one um and can be a personal preference i 'm going to ask each of our speakers tonight just to say in one sentence or so what their response is on eating plant-based diets instead of meat i 'll start with you madam mayor yes a wonderful idea and i need to do more of it myself sally look i give you an example my son at mossman prep in year five i believe it was had to do a project of if every family in his year decided to have meat-free monday so one day without me he then calculated how many emissions he reduced it and it was huge so um there are solutions they 're looking at seaweed to um as as the methane production that comes from cattle but i think we also need to think quality versus quantity david well i 'll just say what um we just passed at the university of sydney because we have a new university sustainability plan actually the first the university of sydney has passed and there we had the same sort of questions and uh what the conclusion was was just to um require all outlets to have more vegetarian and vegan options just to put them out there more rather than banning meat just giving people more choice and that seems to be going over very well finally dr ruth uh well i haven 't sold a slightly unusual view of this which i think that it 's monoculture itself that 's the problem including things like soil runoff and deforestation and so you can have uh you know you can have massive crops of say corn that is not particularly good for the environment or palm oil which was really bad for the environment so i don 't think that just switching to a vegetarian diet is the answer i think makes for healthy soil it makes for healthy rainfall and it makes for a healthy ecology and that may include some meat but not a monoculture of meat wonderful look just before i hand over to the mayor to formally close tonight 's webinar i 'd just like to make a couple of quick points um first of all rob asked us just recently um you know about our street lights and whether we 're transferring those to led yes that 's definitely on the table isn 't it ruth we hope to do that by the end of next year um using odds as a partner with that they 're offering to do it for us um jillian 's asked could we publish the full reported interview from the minister absolutely jillian in fact after the mayor 's uh wrapped things up we 're going to play it for those who want to stay on a listen and it will form part of our published uh webinar which will be available on our website um so with all of that i first want to thank the bidding and i wonderful questions we 'll try and answer as many of those on our website as well um but a number of them i know are more points of view rather than just questions so uh with all of that i 'll hand over to you madame to wrap up proceedings thank you very much uh dominic and i do want to thank our general manager dominic for chairing tonight 's forum and to all mossman council staff who 've been working in the background making tonight a really successful forum i think we will definitely be having more in the future wonderful roll up of over 170 people and just a couple of points that i took from all the speakers such diverse range of speakers giving us such a a full body of information to take away and absorb and think about tonight but zali i think a great message about taking more personal responsibility and also i would have to say on behalf of everyone here tonight good luck with representing your climate action bill in november um david thank you too for really focusing that idea about of vulnerability i thought that that was some really good points that you made and for us in mossman possibly things we don 't think about but i do want you to know that this is a community that definitely talks a lot and i think that from that 's a very positive thing i think for us we feel really confident that our community will talk to us and i think that that 's a very very important point you made thank you i think we haven 't got matt and felicity i think they did a double great act uh talking to the kids i thought that was a terrific initiative i think also on behalf of the whole community i will i 'm sure everyone is with me when i say uh i hope felicity has a very safe uh very safe birth of a baby that looks very imminent to me um and i think thank you ruth thank you ruth toot for you to be telling the community that you and noela are completely committed to working on council 's climate action uh strategy and a big council and that 's i think a true commitment to the cause and i don 't think i 've left anyone out thank you everyone thank you to the wonderful wonderful questions i think that they really showed that the community as you said dominic i think there 's many more questions still out there thank you sorry we couldn 't get to answer everyone but the conversation will continue and just good evening everyone uh and thank you for attending thanks everybody now we will just end uh with i guess the the future that 's to come and that is the uh the children dialoguing with our state member and our minister for environment so please feel free to continue watching that and at the conclusion of that the webinar will end thanks again everybody thank you because education is important through my education i 've learned about global warming and how it affects our world and so it makes me sad to see the state government only spending a small amount of about 1.5 billion on environmental protection compared to other things also you spend environment on economic affairs and most people might not even know what that means so our question is why do you spend so little in the environment compared to other things yet it is such a big part of our lives and our future i would like to thank the research team nadine and annika for helping me find out all this new information thank you so much polly and to dean and annika for the work you put into that question and it 's a really good question and obviously we have a lot of challenges in making decisions about how to spend money but i before i entered the minister i would like to say i 'm really glad that you 're getting bang for your buck at beauty point public school what a wonderful school so i 'm glad we 're able to invest in your education and help you find your voice and the information that you need to ask us these questions so thanks very much holly minister talk to us about funding well holly great question and i tell you what if our 80 then it 's definitely money well spent look we do spend a lot of money to protect our environment and could we spend more absolutely but it 's not just about money it 's also about making sure we have the right protections the right laws in place to safeguard our important environmental and ecological assets so that 's what we 're working on the moment but it 's not just about having the right laws it 's about making sure that they 're enforced that 's why we have a strong environmental cop here in new south wales called the environmental protection authority that 's the job of the epa is to ensure that we 're enforcing our environmental protections to ensure that those assets will be there for our kids and their kids recently the commonwealth government has been looking to consider whether they should have an environmental watchdog as well my very strong view is that they should and we should have a national environmental cop on the beach out there looking out for our environment enforcing the laws and holding industry to account so i 'll to be someone that supports strong environmental protections in place and i 'll be someone that always continues to fight to ensure that they are enforced hi i 'm zayle mills from middle harbour public school renewable energy is one of the most effective tools we have to fight against climate change 2019 has shown the highest levels of carbon emission ever on our planet the solar panels and the electric cars are great but there isn 't enough the united nations have given us 10 years to stop permanent damage from climate change what is the new south wales government doing to use the resources that we have in abundance the sun is there any process to transfer sun energy into battery storage or is covered and a more recession-made renewable energy an impossible dream and climate change the next disaster to hit new south wales sale that 's such a good question and you may remember from our conversations in the past that i 'm deputy chair of the environment planning committee and the new south wales parliament 's actually been doing a lot of work at the opportunities and it 's really interesting you looked at the kobe perspective too because we 've seen that as a particular challenge but also a really great opportunity and the new south wales government is working on some really exciting opportunities in renewable energy in particular across the whole state so minister can you tell us about what we 're doing in the renewable energy space well zail thank you for your question and felicity we might try and get sale and come and do some work in my office because that is outstanding research look um we 've got some big challenges as you said i hope that climate change is not the next disaster to hit new south wales and i don 't think that cover 19 is going to be a roadblock to transitioning our electricity system and moving towards more renewable sources of energy in fact i think it can be a great opportunity we need to be stimulating our economy we know we need to replace a number of these existing electricity assets like our coal-fired power generators so what a better way to do be done to now and create jobs see investment particularly in the regions and help set our economy up for a long and prosperous future so now is the time to do this but with regards specifically to getting more renewables into the system we 've recently announced we 'll be uh investing in three renewable energy zones in new south wales so this is basically replacing fossil fuel lead generators with renewable sources so we 'll do solar wind pump hydro and yes batteries on a utility scale so we 've announced the central west renewable energy zone out near dubbo that 'll provide around 2 500 megawatts of clean cheap electricity into the system we 've announced this the north west renewable energy zone up near armadale that 'll be around 4000 megawatts of cheap clean electricity so this is not only going to replace our existing sources of generation but it 's basically going to be built where the resource is plentiful where there 's lots of wind where there 's lots of solar and that means jobs in the bush jobs in the region investment in resources are and the benefit is that everyone across new south wales will get a benefit from this because it 'll make cheaper electricity and that 's not just great for families and businesses it 's great because it 'll catalyze new industries and new opportunities that are energy intensive they 'll look to move here to new south wales because of their access to cheap reliable electricity so so we 've got a big job to do we 've announced our plan to get it done and now my job is to make sure that we get it over the line and we get that cheap renewable energy into our system that will catalyze an economic burden for new south wales and indeed the country particularly as we move to a net zero global economy well minister i think you can see we 've got some incredibly bright minds and a great sense of social conscience in our community is this what you 're hearing from across the state are you hearing particularly from young people or is it all generations that want to see this investment in addressing ensure that our country which is known for its beautiful environment is able to protect that and take advantage of the opportunities that that brings i mean it 's a huge tourist driver you know people choose to live here because of the beautiful natural environment that we enjoy and we need to protect that at all costs but it 's not just about that it 's also about the type of economy we want to have the type of jobs we want to have and you know the opportunities we want to give our kids and their kids so we shouldn 't just be transitioning our electricity system for the sake of it we shouldn 't just be lowering our carbon emissions for the sake of it we should be doing it because it 's about looking after our environment ensuring that we have a great you know economic opportunity and a prosperous future for our kids and their kids and their kids so that 's what this is all about and i want to thank you for your help in driving this outcome we 've got a long people 's politics this is about good people coming together to do good things and i don 't think it 's more important thing that we should be doing than setting up our future by tackling climate change and ensuring that we 're able to take advantage of these enormous opportunities that are coming our way so thank you for everything you 're doing thank you for the efforts that you put in to constantly fight to achieve outcomes for our environment we do have a long way to go but i think our future is in good hands with you so thank you very much minister thanks for listening thanks for your support _"

    "text": "hello everyone this is grace here from mossman library service bringing to you a free poetry workshop that you can do from the comfort of your own home so august is national poetry month and to celebrate i will be conducting a mini free poetry workshop for absolute beginners so no prior knowledge of poetry is necessary for this workshop all you need to do is bring a way of taking notes and an open mind and watch the video okay so i will be covering what is free verse poetry how to recognize poetic devices we 'll be doing a little bit of basic poetry analysis and then finishing up with three exercises to inspire poetry and encourage mindfulness so that 's something that we all need in these uncertain times so what is free verse poetry free verse poetry is a style of poetry which is often attributed to walt whitman but it actually originated in france in the 1880s it became popular in the early 20th century and it remains probably the most popular style of poetry today this is because it 's the most creative form specific pattern or rhyme scheme and it doesn 't follow any set lengths of line or stanza there 's no structure so essentially no rules however it 's important to remember that free verse poetry is still poetry it 's not a random set of words it can have structure if the poet decides that they want it to have structure it can have parts that rhyme if that 's what they what the poet wants it should have carefully considered word choice and it should incorporate one or more poetic device we 'll talk more about poetic devices soon most importantly what makes free best poetry what makes it free verse poetry is that it allows for creativity so it 's up to you how you structure your poem but what separates words on a page from an actual poem is carefully considered word choice and the use of poetic devices so what are poetic devices i 've selected a few here to discuss today so the first example is hyperbole hyperbole is exaggeration but not meant to be taken literally often this is used for emphasis or for be a way to incorporate humor or irony into your poem personification is giving human qualities to non-human things so it 's quite simple but it 's really effective as we 'll see later in one of our poems today similes are comparisons of different things using the words like or as and metaphor are also comparisons but without the without the use of black or as imagery uses descriptions of senses such as smell or feel to evoke imagination and memory so that the reader can relate to or better understand the poet 's feeling and finally alliteration is using specific words that start with the same sound which adds a musicality to the poem so for example the slithering snake or weak and weary so to see the poetic vices in use we 're going to do some very simple poetry analysis we 're going to look at three poems the first two are quite short and then a slightly longer but very famous poem by sylvia plath so the first poem is called fog by carl sandberg i 'm going to read this now fog the fog and city on silent haunches and then moves on so this is a great example of metaphor and also visual imagery we immediately have this image in our mind that is simultaneously a fog and a cat we can imagine the shape of the fog actually morphing into the cat by doing this the poet introduces us to the idea that the fog is alive it 's almost personification but he 's giving the fog cat-like qualities rather than human ones the second poem is called risk by ananias nine risk and then the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom so anais neen is also using metaphor here but in a very different way to sandbag it 's still very clear that the bud and the blooming flower is a metaphor but a metaphor for what or who it 's a bit more a bit more ambiguous i like that this poem begins with the word and it indicates that there 's a whole story prior to this statement but there 's no way to read this poem and apply it to a time in their life in which they chose to grow or develop or change direction or make a big life decision because the risk of doing so was less painful than the risk of not trying at all we get a great visual here of a tight bud and a flower in bloom this poem is effective and it 's relatable and moving so our third poem today is called mirror by sylvia plath this one 's a little bit longer i 'll just show you it goes over two slides one two so bear with me while i read this one mira i am silver and exact i have no preconceptions whatever i see i swallow immediately just as it is unmisted by love or dislike i am not cruel only truthful the eye of a little god four cornered most of the time i meditate on the opposite wall it is pink with speckles i have looked at it so long i think it is part of my heart but it flickers faces and darkness separate us over and over searching my reaches for what she really is then she turns to those liars the candles or the moon i see her back and reflect it faithfully she rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands i am important to her she comes and goes each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness in me she has drowned a young girl and in me an old woman rises toward her day after day like a terrible fish okay so the clearest poetic device used in this poem is personification sylvia path is giving human qualities to a mirror that 's very clear we 're viewing this from the perspective of the mirror deeper than that the entire poem seems to be a metaphor for time passing and aging at first the poem seems a little bit shallow the women the the woman rather likes to flatter herself with the lies of the candlelight or the moon the moonlight but the mirror remains reminds her sorry of the awful reality of aging and the loss of beauty to delve a little bit deeper again it isn 't just the mirror immediately have to qualify itself as silver and exact again it repeats that with truthful i have no preconceptions it even calls itself a little god but a mirror is always exact they 're not maybe the mirror is trying to convince us that it only tells the truth is the mirror then a metaphor for society and the pressures that the pressures put upon a woman to look a certain way in the second stanza suddenly changes the scene from a hanging mirror on the wall to a lake suddenly the reflection is alike maybe this is a reference to the myth of narcissus i 've got a picture of narcissism and background there which draws our attention to the parallels between his story and this one he falls in love with his reflection whereas the woman in this poem has the opposite feeling this poem gives us a lot to think about it also gives us a really great visual in that last line of the fish staring back at you in a lake instead of your reflection which you were expecting it 's a weird suggested that the terrible fish symbolizes the woman 's own self-loathing and her own perception of being unworthy of love as an old fish this gives us an insight to the poet 's mind which we all know was quite troubled okay so now that you have some idea about poetry analysis we 're going to try three simple but effective exercises to inspire you on your own poetry writing journey so the three exercises will help to inspire creativity they will give you material and ideas for your poetry but also you can use these activities you can use these exercises for inspiration for creative writing or writing lyrics whatever you like they will also help to ground you especially the second exercise which is called grounding exercise and they will help to encourage mindfulness okay so exercise one interview yourself now a good place to start with writing is to look inward and ask yourself questions which evoke memory emotion and feeling you don 't have to follow these exact questions but i think these ones are a good place to start think about where were you born have any special talents or interesting skills do you have any nicknames where did they come from what do you like to do for fun and what did you used to like to do for fun now you can think about that in terms of something quite recent say for example we 're in lockdown what do you do for fun in lockdown at home what did you do before lockdown or you can compare it to being an adult compared to when you were a child and how has your life changed what do you miss what 's different okay i recommend that you pause this video and write down the answers to one or more of these questions you can be as detailed as you like just remember that you 're trying to evoke memory emotion and feeling so when you 're ready once you 've done that we can move on to the next exercise exercise two grounding exercise now this is is an exercise that 's actually taken from psychology um it 's used as a technique to reduce anxiety but i think it 's also is to help you to situate yourself in a way that is mindful but separate to productivity it allows you to be your own time keeper based on what you notice around you rather than a clock or a deadline or anything causing you stress or anxiety so the exercise is you need to look around yourself and name five things that you see four things that you feel three things that you hear two things that you smell and one thing that you taste so for example the things that you see could be something that 's on your desk or outside your window bird flying or the lamp on the table the things that you can touch could be the floor beneath your feet your hair things like that uh something that you can hear could be a bird outside the washing machine on your stomach growling maybe you 're hungry two things you can smell that could be the coffee in front of you or your perfume one thing that you taste could be the last thing that you ate or maybe you have clean fresh minty you may have listed some ideas for your subject for the poem or to use as metaphor in the poem so when you 're ready we can move on to exercise three exercise three metaphor maps so this activity is essentially mind mapping you may have come across this before it 's helpful for writer 's block and especially in this case for coming up with metaphors for an example i 've used the word lamp right there in the center so this is something that i observed in my grounding exercise it 's something i could see in front of me but rather than using the word lamp in a poem i want to brainstorm some other words so when i think of a lamp i think of the light and the heat that 's emitted from it and maybe a nicer way of putting light and heat is to say a warm glow and when i think of a warm glow i think of the feeling of love so now that i have warm glow it can be used in a in my poem as a metaphor for video and using notes from the previous two exercises spend some time brainstorming new words with this metaphor mapping exercise take your time and when you 're ready we can move on to the next slide okay so reflect and write i find it helpful to free write personally so first of all aim to not aiming to write a poem right away but just to gather all these thoughts that may have come up from these exercises so memories thoughts feelings emotions whatever 's on your mind just write aim to keep your pen on paper for about five minutes straight so pause this video set a timer if you like and just free write once you 've done that you can actually attempt to write a free verse poem so the subject could be yourself or it could be an object or time itself you can incorporate one or more of the senses described in the grounding exercise you can attempt to use metaphor like the first two poems or personification like the third poem or imagery or another poetic device that we 've discussed be creative once slide once you have a draft written down revise it and read it out loud consider the following does the poem have a musical quality if not consider your word choice does it evoke memory or emotion in the reader if not consider using more imagery describe the scent describe the place describe the feeling of the wind or the sun is there anything you could substitute in the poem for a metaphor if so try the metaphor mapping activity again would it help to add hyperbole or irony or humor i find this can really help if the poem is not very interesting when you 're ready we can move on if you are not inspired this time repeat the same exercises in a new environment isolated walks are a really great way to develop ideas we 're all in lockdown now but we are allowed to go for our little walks when you go for your lockdown walk wear your mask social distance but enjoy the solitude it 's actually a great opportunity for self-reflection think about these exercises we 've done today think about your life your in bloom what can you see smell hear feel notice the warmth of the sun on your skin or the cool sea breeze or the smell of the pavement after the rain can you feel grass or gravel at your feet how does it feel i know when i step outside at the moment fresh jasmine is in bloom and i can smell it every time i leave the house when you start to notice things like that it makes the day a lot more special all of these things can be helpful for coming up with ideas for your poetry and if nothing else you will come out of the exercises feeling more aware of your surroundings more grounded hopefully you will notice and appreciate the beauty around you a little bit more okay so one last tip that i have is to read as much as you can if you want to write poetry you have to read it write down these resources or take a screenshot to remember these resources thank you so much for attending today i hope that you now have an understanding of what how to use them some idea of how to analyze poems some writing exercises for inspiration and mindfulness and a deeper appreciation for your surroundings the last slide is just some references references where i sourced the poetry that you read today and the images that i used thank you _"

    "text": "our mossman council recognises three traditional inhabitants of this land on which we are meeting on a meeting at mossman including the borah giggle and camera eagle people and pays respects to their elders past and present and to their heritage good evening everyone and welcome to this national science week author evening we 're really pleased to have professor mark cullivan professor of philosophy at university of sydney to talk about his topic living in a fine-tuned universe a user 's guide please enjoy and i 'll hand over to mark thank you thanks very much terese and thanks to all of you for tuning in this evening i normally say for a talk like this jump in if i say something that 's confusing or you 'd like me to elaborate but it 's a little bit difficult to do that via zoom so i 'll just push forward and i 'm not sure of the background of everyone so i 'll assume that most people at least don 't know much of the relevant physics and probability theory and the like so it 's not a there 'll you know forgive me if i 'm sound like i 'm going a little bit too slowly for some of you okay so let 's start with design arguments in general and the earliest of these are biological designer arguments so suppose you found a watch in a field you wouldn 't conclude that the forces of nature produced the watch rather you would note that this is an intricate object uh with a very specific purpose and it 's therefore must have been designed or left by someone so even if you didn 't know what this was suppose you 're you 're you 're you know living in some uh remote primitive tribe you 've never seen a watch before you find this thing you 're still inclined to think this whatever it is for it must have a specific purpose i know not what that is but it must have been made by someone whatever this is it couldn 't have been built by natural forces but so this argument goes i 'm just presenting this argument without endorsement for the moment but much of the apparently designed for very specific purposes the classic example one would find in the literature here is the human eye very much like a camera found a camera lying in the field you think it must have been designed and a human eye is very much like a camera so summarizing this line of thought the so-called natural world is intricate and seems geared towards specific purposes therefore it 's implausible that this is the result of natural processes and so it 's thus proposed that there must be a designer a cosmic designer if you will for the uh various features of the biological world many problems with this style of argument these are called design arguments um i i guess they 've been around a long time but mo was failing famously associated with william paley who put these forward as a argument for the existence of god so for a start the designer hypothesis is supposed to make the observations of intricate natural structures less surprising but how does it do this for instance the watchmaker hypothesis in the watch example that paley is straight from paley surprising because we know that there are watchmakers we already know that such things exist and we know that they have the required skills to make watches and moreover we know that they have good reason to make watches they can sell them make money out of it but we know none of this about the proposed cosmic designer so if we find intricate structures like that in nature the analogy breaks down it 's not like the watch at all because we don 't know whether they were eye makers we don 't know that anyone 's got the required skills to make eyes and moreover why on earth would they do that right we don 't know any of that all the things that we do know about watchmakers we don 't know about the cosmic designer moreover the probability of such a designer is low the designer hypothesis only makes things more mysterious so for instance suppose i told you that the watch was made by some utterly implausible line of thought magic fairies made the watch that doesn 't make it less mysterious that you found the magical fairies come from right and so unless you already have established the existence of a designer so for instance you already believe in a a creator of some form or other then this doesn 't help at all so rather than being an argument for the existence but creator it 's more work for the creator to do if you already believe in one so such biological design arguments were criticized long ago by uh perhaps most famously by david hume the great philosopher but once charles darwin and alfred wallace russell and the theory of evolution came along those design arguments were just indefensible the theory of evolution showed how biological systems could evolve to be well adapted to their broader environment and this can look to the uninitiated as if they were designed for such purposes so we now have a story from straight from evolution about why various uh parts of the biological world are so well suited to their environment right because in a nutshell the failures are discarded due to natural selection the most fit are selected the less fit are not selected are the successes and that 's the explanation i take it uncontroversial that 's the explanation for the biological adaptions we see in uh in nature but design arguments curiously didn 't go away after david hume had point out philosophical problems with it and then darwin and russell uh gave an alternative explanation for the the biological complexity we see design arguments still lived on and it turns out in the modern guys the design argument revolves around physics rather than biology so i 'm just going to give you just a hint at some of the the the so-called fine-tuning argument as it 's come to be known it turns out that certain physical constants such as the proton electron mass ratio and the fine structure constant doesn 't really matter what these are but the proton electron mass ratio is just protons are much heavier than electrons and had the electron been a little bit heavier than it is or a little bit lighter than it is that mass ratio would be different but so it turns out that the proton electron mass ratio fine structure constant they just turns out they couldn 't have been very different from their actual values and had they been different from their actual values the universe would not be able to contain carbon-based life it looks like these constants the values of these constants have been fine-tuned for carbon-based life lot lots of reasons for this but one that that crops up is in order to get carbon in the universe very to have carbon-based life you need carbon obviously and for there to be carbon you need second generation stars that is stars that are built out of the stardust of first generation stars to build from hydrogen to helium and helium up to carbon and if you only had first generation stars you wouldn 't have any carbon and so in order to get the universe in such a state that you can have second generation stars you require these many of these constants to be fine-tuned to their particular values since and this is this is kind of curious in its own right a lot of physicists have comment on this it really does look odd that rather but when you investigate and see whether the constants could have been too different from where they are you find that the universe that is produced is radically different and wouldn 't have carbon-based life in it so here 's how the argument 's going to go then since there is carbon-based life universe as we find it is extremely unlikely and in need of explanation what could be the explanation for finding ourselves in such a fine-tuned universe well back to the culprits or candidates if you like for the the biological design argument an intelligent designer that 's one answer this answer however has most of the same problems raised for earlier by david hume it doesn 't suffer the biological problems that are raised by the theory of evolution but it still has these general philosophical concerns for instance this is only an explanation it only helps if we believe that there 's a pretty good chance that there is such a designer and that such a designer would be the kind of character that would like to build carbon-based life but we have no reason such views for instance in um christian theology you might think well if i 'm a christian i already believe in such a designer and i believe that such a designer thinks that humans are special so really does like carbon-based life so i already believe all of that stuff but this is supposed to be an argument to get a non-believer to believe in some grand designer and it doesn 't work unless you 've already got some prior commitment to there being such a designer so think of it this way just to get a an idea of the what this fine tuning means think of hitting the bullseye on a dartboard with a randomly thrown dart not some expert dart player but you just randomly throw a dart and it happens to land in the bullseye you 're entitled to ask how did that happen it 's very improbable that the dart we would land right in the middle if it were randomly thrown one explanation would be that it wasn 't randomly thrown it was thrown by someone who is very skilled at darts and they of designer hypothesis but it 's not straightforward to get from fine-tuning to improbability here so the claim is that the universe is fine-tuned and i take it but that 's a fact about the relevant physics i i take that as hard to deny that there is this kind of fine tuning but what we require in order to get this argument going is that the current universe is improbable it 's fine-tuned therefore improbable but it 's not straightforward to get from the fine-tuning to the improbability as i said evidence for fine tuning is hard to deny but next step in the argument is that because life-committing intervals are so small our universe is improbable so think of just one of these constants the electron proton mass ratio that constant could take any value any positive value and yet it has to be in a very very small interval in order for there to be carbon-based life but the problem is compared to the whole positive real line any interval is small so the intuition that these little interval the life-committing universe interval is really small it moves you can make in mathematics i won 't go through the details here but it turns out to be extraordinarily difficult to move from the claim that there 's fine-tuning to improbability there are various technical problems uh in the probability theory that seem to block that move um so it 's like hitting a bullseye on a dart board from the required 2.37 meters with a randomly directed dart but with this interval compared to this whole dartboard like that 's that 's what you 're thinking with the dartboard analogy the bullseye is very small compared to the whole dartboard but the problem is compared to infinitely many real numbers that this into this this uh fine particular fine tune constant could take any interval is small and so you don 't get this the analogy to work with the in the way that you would like it turns out very difficult to say that the probability of hitting this particular interval is small therefore we need an explanation for that okay so the next step in the argument is to ask for an explanation of improbability 've just alluded to i i think they 're deeply problematic myself and i can maybe talk more about that in question time but the details do get a little technical there so just just skip fast past that for the moment so the next step is to ask for some explanation of this improbable universe that we live in so if my dart hits the bullseye you 'd like to know why that happened and as i said one explanation would be that it wasn 't randomly thrown in the first place it was set up that way it was expert dart player aimed for the bullseye that would be one good explanation for why that you find this dart in the bull 's-eye_''_900.399 but let 's just pause for a moment think do we really even need an explanation here not all improbable events require explanations okay just because something 's improbable doesn 't mean that there 's an explanation required so i don 't know how many words there are in this talk but there 's some number which is the exact number of the words i an explanation for that i don 't think mark covent uttered exactly whatever the number of words is in the zoom talk i need an explanation for that i don 't need an explanation of all at all why because we don 't think it 's significant or that there 's no explanation to be found it 's just that 's just the way it is the sum number of words i was going to do was going to say this evening and it happened to be whatever it is that 's the end so improbable things happen and sometimes that 's just the way things are compare this to the dart case again in the dark case you don 't think that you you kind of kind of think that if i threw a dart at the dartboard and i can tell you right up front i 'm no dart player so if i had thrown that dart and it hit the bullseye it would be surprising and you would you would like to have some explanation and the following doesn 't seem like a good explanation here to to land there the end right why isn 't that a good explanation here well in part because we know a little bit about the games that are played with the dart board and there 's something very special about the bull 's-eye_._1008.959 it 's deliberately designed to be a high score in the game of darts it 's deliberately designed to be hard to achieve and so achieving that it already has some purpose attached to it right you already think wow that started the dart has hit the bull 's eye there 's something special about that whereas whatever the number of words in my talk this evening whatever that number is there 'll be nothing special about it so that seems like okay the dartboard does seem like a case where you would require an explanation for something improbable the number of words in my talk does not seem like a case where you 'd want an explanation even though it 's improbable whichever number it is it 's kind of improbable because it could have been any number or at least a whole bunch of different fine tuning argument is it more like the dart chord case which requires an explanation or is it more like the number of words in this talk that doesn 't require an explanation so granting the life-supporting universe is improbable um why think it 's in need of explanation well because life is salient to us just like the bull 's-eye is salient to anyone who plays darts or anyone 's ever heard of darth 's right you don 't even have to be a dart player to know that the bullseye is something special in darts and life is something salient to us so in versions of this argument that conclude that there must be an intelligent designer or a fine tuner there are some implausible assumptions about the designer having preference for living things enters in at this stage you have to import that assumption just having a designer doesn 't explain why there 's life in the universe right because if you had a designer who hated carbon-based life gonna design this beautiful universe and the last thing they want is carbon-based life in this universe screwing you want for your universe you want to be pristine and beautiful and keep the damn carbon based life out of it right under that assumption now it 's even more mysterious why we 've got carbon-based life in this universe right so the only way that you reduce mystery by introducing a designer is if you also introduce assumptions about the designer the designer likes carbon-based life but what reason have you got to believe that but again what 's so special about carbon-based live is the existence of carbon-based life especially significant from a scientific from a point of view i mean it 's important to us because we 're carbon-based life but is it particularly important significant from a scientific point of view is it really screaming out for explanation put the point slightly differently the universe is also fine-tuned for other things for indeed it 's even more fine-tuned for things like the emergence of heavy metal music right to get heavy metal music you 've got to have carbon-based life and carbon-based life that learns how to play distorted guitars and so on and so has heavy metal music in it so if you think that what you should be doing is explaining really improbable things uh that 's something that we could ask for explanation but no one thinks that no one thinks that the designer is a heavy metal head right but that 's there 's a there 's an argument sitting there waiting does the emergence of heavy metal music also require an explanation what would such an explanation look like as i said a a heavy metal god an alternative to the design hypothesis which is popular amongst physicists is that life in the universe is not so special if we had lots of shots at it all right so think about the dartboard again even a a poor dark player like me if i had lots and lots of shots at getting the bulls guy surely i 'm going to get lucky every now and again even if i 'm just throwing no better than random at the board it 's got to land in the bullseye somewhat some some stage if i have enough shots at it so if 're going to get lucky and get the carbon based life sometimes and we just happen to be in one of the lucky ones that 's the thought it 's called the multiverse hypothesis and it 's a hypothesis taken very seriously by many physicists that they 're in some sense or other which are difficult to spell out but in some sense or other they 've been many many shots at the universe each with different physical constants so reset the physical constants run the thing carbon based life yes or no run it again run on it again run it again and the point is that you 'll eventually get carbon-based life at some stage or other just like i would get a bullseye if i played darts long enough it 's like infinitely many darts thrown without witnesses and only bringing a witness to when you get a bull 's-eye that 's the idea right i can just keep throwing the dart but the dart of the dartboard and only tell you about it when i get the bullseye that 's crucial right so now you see did he get a bullseye well either i 'm a much better dart player than i 'm alluding to or i 've had lots and lots of goes at it there 's a selection effect here so in the universe case if you run the universe over and over again and when you get carbon based life then you 've got observers but in the other ones there are no observers so let 's suppose for a moment the carbon-based life is the only form of life you can have i i don 't think that 's right but let 's suppose that for a moment then whenever you 've got life in the universe then uh they 're going to be observers to sit around like we are and wonder how is it that we are here but in the empty universes with no life there 's no one to wonder so that 's kind of like throwing your data at the dartboard missing the bullseye but no one saw it good no one saw it i 'll go again no one saw it go again then when i 's the idea here there 's a selection effect you only see the successes if the success in question is the existence of carbon-based life sometimes this is called a weak anthropic principle and note the similarity with observations of organisms suited to their habitats in the in light of evolutionary theory right again evolution doesn 't say that organisms become adapted to their environments what you get with evolutionary theory is random mutations most of which are going to be bad for the organisms in question but then they get selected against so what you see at the end of the day are the success stories not the failures same thing with the weak anthropic principle and the selection effect for universes if there are multiple universes as i said it would be like me imposing some a selection effect with the dart board by only letting you see it when i succeed so now you might ask question about this multiverse type multiverse hypothesis and i think we 've overstepped the bounds of science here and now we 're straying into speculative metaphysics and that that 's a the multiverse hypothesis and we certainly can 't_''_1511.52 observe any universes other than this one in fact we can 't observe all of this one we can only observe a certain portion of the the backwards light cone of this one so you might think okay well that we 're trying to explain something about this universe the fine tuning that 's in you this universe and what we do is we hypothesize many other universes of which this is one and in fact the number of other universes needs to be really quite large for this to do any explanatory work for us and you might think a naive thought here is well science is about the observable if you can 't observe it then it ain 't science this is some sort of specular metaphysics or whatever but that 's just not right a great deal of science goes beyond observation indeed that 's a large part of the job of science so i see no special problem here um as a hypothesis that there is a multiverse in my book the boundary between philosophy and science is say the multiverse is a particularly good scientific hypothesis hypothesis um oh it 's a particularly good philosophical one it doesn 't much matter to me which of those if you think it 's philosophy uh it 's philosophy where that 's well informed by the science or it 's science i i don 't know how one is supposed to draw a clutch sharp boundary between the two in any case so this is why at least i 'm not endorsing this argument i 'm just trying to outline this argument and why what you might think of as a simple refutation of it doesn 't work and why scientists many physicists take this line of argument very seriously okay so let me wrap up here given the fine tuning what are we going to say about this let me just lay out your options and i 'll leave it for you to decide your own preferences here first you can deny the fine-tuning evidence as i said earlier i i don 't think that 's uh a terribly fruitful way for the there are incred incredible sort of and exactly how fine-tuned they are there 's a lot of modeling going on behind this and by physicists it really does look like the universe is fine-tuned so that 's one option just deny the evidence but i i find the evidence to myself rather overwhelming accept the evidence but deny that universe that our universe is improbable and in need of further explanation um as i hinted at i think there 's there 's uh some promise in that line of thought because i think the argument from it from fine-tuning to improbability is has never been spelled out to my satisfaction at least third option accept the improbability claim but not speak further explanation you might think well that 's just the way things are the universe had to be some way or other the constants have to have some value or rather they just happen to have these values and lo and behold those values are the values that give carbon-based life end of story nothing more to be said or you can accept the improbability claim and seek further explanation you might think that this like so it 's like the dart board rather than like the number of words in my talk and if you take that line then it looks like the two main hypotheses there there are others i think one could invent here but the two main lines of thought i think if you 've if you 've followed us followed the argument thus far and accept improbability claim and seek further explanation then the intelligent designer with a curious desire for carbon-based life you 've got to specify that not any old designer as i said earlier we 'll get you over the line here it 's got to be a particularly curious designer that that you know has this thing about carbon-based life and maybe heavy metal music as well like who knows there there 's a multiverse either temporally or spatially separated i didn 't say much about this so let me just say a little bit about what it would be to have multiple shots at the universe right so you 've got the big bang and you set the physical constants in such a way that big bang a big crunch immediately hardly any time for the universe to expand other ones it keeps expanding and never comes back others it 's right on the brink and the everything in between so you could have lots of shots at the universe in that so i 've got spatially and temporally in scare quotes there because it 's not really temporary nor is it spatially because space-time is tied up with a particular universe but it 's kind of temporal like you have one big bang one big crunch and then another big bang another big crunch and then another one another one so it 's intuitively you can think of it as one after the other time-wise but you can 't really say that because time is bound to each of the universes or it could be spatially where they 're parallel universes separated by some space-like thing but not really space because space is tied up with each of the individual universes but that 's how you the two possibilities for the multiverse but it doesn 't much matter how you do that as long large number of shots at the universe with a resetting of the physical constants each time and at some stage or other you will get very high likelihood that you 'll get lucky and get carbon based life and only in those carbon-based life universes will there be observers so it 's again it 's just like the dartboard case where i only call you into the room when i 've had a successful throw and i keep the failures to myself those are the options as far as i can tell and there are all the options so choose wisely when you decide what you fit inclined to think about fine tuning and um thank you for your attention and there 's a few uh pieces that you may wish to follow up anyone 's keen on this there 's some examples like barrow and tipler the anthropic cosmological principle is a just a really interesting book full of the various physical consonants that needed to be fine-tuned and as along with references to humes criticism of the biological design arguments and so forth thank you you _"

    "text": "good evening and welcome to the 2020 mossman art prize my name is john cheeseman i 'm the director of mossman art gallery and it 's a pleasure to have you all here tonight both those that

the mossman art prize attracted 580 entries and i was saying talking to katrina cashman she said the period for putting the artworks in was very squashed because of covert it was a very concentrated short period so i think to still get 580 entries is absolutely amazing tonight there are 79 exceptional artworks selected as finalists and surrounded we are surrounded by them i hope you 've all had a chance to to browse and have a look at them it 's an exceptionally interesting um 2020 mossman art show this year quite different to all the other years and no doubt alexa you 've had a big hand in that the exhibit the exhibited artworks and the award winners have been chosen as i said by alexi glass uh cantor who will speak to us later the executive director of art space and the curator of the next australian pavilion at the venice biennale i 'm not sure when that 's going to be do you know alexa i do know okay is that a top secret secret april 2022 april 2022 i looking around the room i

they 're very very um regular and and special sponsors who who keep supporting us and we thank them for that to our judge alexei glass cantor who has made time in your busy schedule to adjudicate on this year 's prize thank you very much our wonderful staff at the mossman art gallery and with special thanks to jane gillespie up the back who has jane also thank everyone viewing tonight on facebook and i really thank everyone for your past present and hopefully future contributions to the artistic life of the mossman community thank you and enjoy this evening show uh thank you very much madam mayor um to the next the person i 'd like to call to the podium next is alexi glass cantor the judge of the 2020 mosman art prize as the mayor said she wears many hats she is the executive director of art space over at willamalu she is the upcoming curator of the australian pavilion at the venice biennale amongst many things involved with art basel hong kong all sorts of things and but a very important person in australian art and we 're so pleased to have her here tonight please welcome alexi glass cantor [Applause] thank you lord mayor thank you john and thank you everybody and i too would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we stand and i really want to thank every one of the more than 580 artists who reminded us at this important moment that is more important than ever can we just give them a big round of applause for everybody on facebook knows that we have a safe socially distanced event but we still have to live and breathe and celebrate the dynamism vervacity passion and ideas of australian painting you know 73 years ago as it 's been said this prize was established at a time of profound social cultural and political change the end of the second world war a cultural revolution a profound change in politics uprisings in feminism thinking about civil rights there was a whole range of movements that were yet to change and catalyze the way in which we thought about who we are and what we are to become we are now living through one of the most profound cultural changes we will ever ever experience with covert 19. this is going to change everything that we think about and we 've seen some incredible things things we could never have imagined with the inability at this time to move very far from home we 've actually been able to see the world in a different it out because standing in front of all of you and standing here with this work i just really thought that what we have to do is acknowledge that each one of the artists who managed to deliver their work here has created an invitation to see the world as they feel it an invitation to imagine the world not just as it is but how it might become and to think of ways to create connectivity beauty speculation provocation poetry and challenge the conventions of representation that is exciting we live in a time where new ideas are going to be able to change the world ways in which we think feel and relate not just to the world but to one another the interpersonal the vulnerable the human these things are more essential than ever our capacity to have empathy and compassion and to understand that we have a responsibility to take care are all things that we get reminded of through the absolute power of living artistic practice and you know what i saw when i walked into the room a week ago downstairs encountering 580 paintings i will always if it had been 581 i still would have done it um but you know i walked in and i took a breath and i just want to tell you quickly how i decided what you see around you tonight i came into the room and i sat down with john with katrina with jenny and with jane and i said you know who have been the recipients what 's the mood of each award i spoke to the in-store crew and i said let 's look for works that have cultural linguistic diversity let 's look at works that speak to the boldness and the diverse nature of australian art practice let 's think about painting in the expanded field let 's think about gender parity let 's think about artists aged in their late teens and their early 20s through to artists in their 90s let 's think about the fact that ideas emerge at all stages of an artist 's practice and let 's really try to create a generous exhibition that looks at such a convergence and confluence of works that can hardly i had such a joy doing it apparently i was the most athletic of all the judges that have ever done the award i decided to look at the back of every painting because as a curator and an art historian you get all the secrets from the back of the work not the front and so i found photographs i found messages i found notes i found locations dates of birth i gathered together information by looking at the work itself and by looking at its complete object hood and then i was able to take some risks i was able to include works by artists i was unaware of previously but i 'm now so grateful to be introduced to their work and i was able to see great examples of works by artists i already respect and hugely esteem so that 's a gift we got down to the more than 60 finalists and we came upstairs and you know at this time to be invited to judge the 2020 mosman art prize was a real privilege because i think we have to support and invest in critical ideas and who shape and pioneer a way of thinking about an inclusive society so i accepted the invitation and with choosing the winners we really i really thought about a mix of four artists who would represent intergenerational approaches cultural diversity and leadership in the expanded field of painting and what it might become let 's give the artist one more round of applause [Applause] congratulate the team here i hope at 73 i look as good as the mosman art prize as dynamic and alive and as vivacious and robust and as contradictory and um and a celebratory of the way in which we can imagine australian culture now thank you [Applause] covert choreography that 's that 's all right now thank you alexi and it 's been such a pleasure to work with you the team have enjoyed uh have drawn so much out of that and to look around the room and see such an optimistic and forward-looking exhibition it 's a real credit to you so thank you so much thank you yeah so now we come to the business end of the evening categories and the first category tonight is the guy warren uh emerging artist award this is an award for artists that are 35 or under and i 'd like to oh and guy warren himself was a two-time winner of the muscle knight prize he 's 99 years old now so what better person to have as an emerging artist than that but the grand old man of the australian art himself so i 'd like to call on the lexi if you want to step back here thank you to announce the winner thank you so much the winner of the emerging artist award is an artist who in the first 15 years of his professional practice is making an indelible impact on australian art there 's a verve of vivacity and a raw spirit and power to his work that reminds us of the full force of what it is to be alive and to be accountable and i want to announce the winner of the guy wore an emerging artist award is ramesh mario nithiandran okay that 's you my choreographer yeah that 's right okay the alan gamble award and alan gamble was the founder of the muslim art prize he was a councillor of mossman council he was also an artist and architect and this award is named in his honor uh it 's great it 's graciously sponsored by christine fraser on in memory of uh her husband the late hugh frazer who was the architect that actually designed the mossment gallery that we 're standing in tonight so thank you so much christine thank you so much your choreography is better than mine this was such an interesting award to judge because there were so many terrific examples of thinking about the built environment and ways that it could be approached and i decided to take a lateral approach and an approach that sort of speaks to a necessity to think about how we transform and change and respond to the altered nature of the vernacular of architecture in the built environment and how we imagine the past and the future in different ways and so instead of speaking to a formal representation i wanted to take a playful and satirical one and phil james with landscape composition number one [Applause] congratulations [Applause] so now we come to the margaret olley award the margaret olde award is for uh a work highly commended by the judge and it 's named after margaret olley herself who was the winner of the 1946 mossman art prize the very first winner so um yes so again alexi if you 'd like to announce the match the recipient of the margaret olley commendation award is an artist who told me a story a few years ago about walking the streets of his neighborhood in saint kilda and encountering marks of graffiti the detritus and scraps of people 's daily lives the rubbish the trash the marks and bringing it together with baroque rococo renaissance and the history and representation of art through time and how it merges with the contemporary markings that allow us to make new maps and forms of how we think about the place we occupy at the moment with melbourne currently in stage four lockdown the parameters and circles of people 's lives are not ever widening but they are widening through imagination in melbourne his name is stig person and he wins with a work called lido upstairs a remarkable tribute to the way in which we create personal maps that create conic connectivity through time to place and memory let 's congratulate steve unfortunately steven can 't_''_1079.2 be here tonight he 's uh based in melbourne so he 's uh a little bit preoccupied i forgot to mention that this award is uh sponsored by julian jones and the jones family and we really thank you in memory of the late brian jones and we really appreciate your support and and thank you so much for that [Applause] and uh on another amir copper i forgot to mention the fourth village provider which was the sponsor of the guy warren award so again my apologies for not announcing that at the time so but we come to the major prize this evening which is the 2020 bossman art prize and without further ado i 'll ask you to thank you so much it was really tough it was a really great gift to be able to provide artists with support at this year is fiji an australian-born artist whose work draws from an incredible tradition of matrilineal history community culture she thinks about representation sovereignty agency and the power of cultural diversity through history and time and she leads through installation moving image and painting in the expanded field and her painting is really an invitation to think about what painting is going to look like in the 21st century in australia and she is an artist who will make a huge impact and already has and i 'm so delighted that this year 's recipient is salate tuale an artist who really [Applause] [Laughter] yes please looking this way okay yeah sure um thank you what a surprise and uh it 's okay here more choreography um it 's just really awesome especially at a time like this when artists are doing it hard i 'd like to thank my partner sydney mcmahon also in this prize just thought i 'd do a mention and yeah it 's just um thank you so much alexi thank you so much mossman thank you for all the people who can contribute to but as it 's we 're covered safe anyway which is the the main thing so i 'd like to thank all the entrants this year and congratulate all the finalists you 've done an amazing job we really are very privileged to have uh your participation in the prize year after year again i 'd like to thank the sponsors the staff here at mosman art gallery uh for everything that you you 've done and the councillors and every mosman council who support the major prize and and make sure that this happens every year and we invite you to come and see the prize we 're open from tomorrow we 're in covert times we 're back to seven days a week we 'll be open 10 until 4 and we look forward to seeing you at mossman art gallery for the mossman art prize in the next few weeks we close on the 4th of october so but please don 't leave it come in and we 're sober a covert place covered safe place so we welcome to see you here in a very safe night _"

    "text": "good morning and welcome to monday matters my name is jane roughly in 2013 mossman library service launched doing our bits which is an online resource dedicated to the local men and women who enlisted in world war one the site provides a forum for descendants to share information images and stories from the start dara has made significant contributions to doing our bit through his investigative research skills and descriptive writing he has also put together exhibitions to illustrate this research dara 's work has included little-known stories about local heroes including the impact of influenza on returning anzacs and romance at george 's heights hospital his favorite topic the aviators of world war one is the subject of his presentation this morning dara presented part one of pioneers of australian aviation in april he had a lot more information and stories to tell hence part two of his presentation today i 'm very pleased to introduce dara christie thanks very much jane um for those wonderful words yes um as you you may know me on or not my name 's dara and i 'm going to be last time we had a few technical issues and this is all new doing doing this format but we 'll what we 'll do is um it 's basically a slideshow with me talking and so you might want to switch to your your slideshow mode for that because it 's it 's basically that 's where where 's the presentation is okay so um what i 'm going to do is run quickly through what we we went through last time because i said like we had those those technical issues and then we 'll jump straight into the war service of the three pioneers pg taylor um smithy and charles all at the end we 'll probably have questions um feel free to jump in but i 've probably got a quite a bit of work to get through so i might just start now all right so so it all starts off at the very beginning of course on the left of the photograph i took in the louvre of the sort of half man half winged syrian creatures on the right is kind of the theme close to the sun so it 's all about human imagination and you know sort of the reality behind pioneering men trying to fly so basically we break off flight into two areas lighter are heavier than air so balloons and airplanes a blue netic is defined as a person who is blue mad so we 'll do a quick history of that so on the left you see a picture of it looks like versailles so ballooning really took off in say europe or france in the 17th century and so here you have a balloon at versailles the other end of the social scale you have people attacking a balloon because of the newness of this technology here 's a picture of various whirly gigs that were experimental some flew some were just thoughts of the mind first time balloons were used in warfare was when the austrians attacked vienna and they flew very basic balloons which were um totally unsuccessful despite the very dramatic picture here and um in fact most inflated over venice and i read somewhere that they actually some of them dropped on their one the balloons of um and zeppelins had morphed into zeppelins and become objects of terror in the imagination so it became a nightmare rather than a dream it 's almost like they came from outer space sort of thing and by the time we get to world of one we see the evolution of a juice in warfare which is basically spotting the other side um so you can get at them this is a nepali on a battle with a balloon out in front and probably directing cannon fire and doing the same thing here in world war ii with the australian troops looking on in the background [Music] just a quick aside hms sydney is a master 's now at um bradley 's head it was involved in both these types of aerial combat first was the first engagement between a zeppelin and hms sydney a ship it was an inconclusive affair and later on sydney flew um airplanes and that it was one of the first um ship to or airplane to to um airplane battles after the sydney was attacked from the air by one that it 's still very basic the only way to land was in the water and that could have mixed results so the rise of airplanes all the way back to leonardo da vinci and this chap here i think he 's a german um using a sort of a glided flight trying to imitate birds and bats when i was in paris again i found this interesting machine avion number three um as you can see it 's powered by steam engine um the owner said it got off the ground but in fact it probably hadn 't it may have been a gust to win that that blew it over but as you can see imitating the the wings of a bat and you 've always got moth like um propellers out in the front and yeah you probably in a way they 're probably glad he didn 't get off the ground because it might not have gone far um eventually airplanes did get off the ground this is a picture of harry houdini um it 's harry doing his thing with um getting thrown off bridges is him actually taking a solo flight in melbourne right so now we come to our three aviators um what i 'm going to do is switch now from bill taylor over to charles horm and smithy so we might just go over to that slide now okay let 's grab a cup of tea flags yeah okay yep right here we go so charles okay so charles um is a local he 's um he 's born in 1898 as most around that time most of these flies for the first world war were around 1896 88 um 84. he 's the son of parisian born artist um and emma all so he 's found only moved from victoria to 27 kestrel avenue mossman and he worked as a stock broking clerk at a company at the outbreak of break of the war um his background of course was french his parents and so he was encouraged to join up but he actually um joined up a little bit early as we will soon see so he 's one of the first um troops at anzac on april 25th razel tin hospital which is um in alexandria so that 's a picture of um the form their studio portrait and there 's another one classic one in front of the sphinx um tourist photograph um so he was as i mentioned um when he enlisted he was actually underage and um he he sort of registered under a non-deployment or a fake name as charles jackson and here we see the um his um his um enlistment papers so basically you 've got charles jackson uh he 's correct address and um his height is i think it 's five foot seven and he says he 's 19 years old i believe now um he was i think 15 at the time but he was a very tall english lad and they didn 't they weren 't fussy about who they were taking it um and they weren 't going to check his um bona fides usually they need to be permission from the parents written permission to sign up so anyway um this is a letter on the right from his mother to the authorities um you 'll and sort of reveals that you know in fact his name is charles horn and could his um his payments or effects be forwarded under that name um and then a bit more about his background that was once he land back in sydney now the reason for him landing back in sydney um was just trying to go back there something that was a little bit awkward so basically he was turned on the ballarat and the the reason is venereal so when you know there 's a lot of um social stigma with this of course especially at the time and even now um but anyway just put in context one of 60 he was just one of 60 000 cases and which was about 15 of the aif um the treatments were very painful you can see some of the the instruments down here and um unfortunately penicillin and and in fact the cure for viruses for the flu um wasn 't discovered until later anyway that 's the hospital he stayed at that 's his um that 's his um sort of report there and he later to be known as charles all um this was a a picture of a an egyptian lady which was found as a postcard i i couldn 't find any images anywhere of the sort of thing because you know their story doesn 't get told but uh there 's there was postcards donated to the library and this was one of the postcards which i 've been able to use as part of my research so yes that 's things do turn up and and that 's it 's a good resource to have all right so moving forward um charles um signed up again with his parents approval just signed up as um charles and he was with the 45th battalion um so yep they they were positive about him doing that his grandfather fought the germans in the 1870 wars so they were the right behind that um here 's a picture of um men from the 45th in the trenches he being charles um was wounded as we can see from this um document from the archives he was wounded in a place called corby canal see is shot or wounded in the knee and then you have other injuries as well so sent back to england with that um and here we can see the report here of the the wounds on his body um probably something that he would have um struggled with most of his life as both some did and came back to mossman and did rehabilitation at the george 's height hospital here we see a picture from the time georgia 's height and then i took a picture uh then and now sort of one uh i think last january so now i 've turned into artists huts that sort of thing there 's a little room um and i found i opened the book at the page and so it 's just confirmation that was so patient here at this hospital um it 's a lovely spot if you want to go there and walk around it 's um very pleasant it 's little cafes and that sort of thing so okay so why these three well they 're all from the same area or have connections with the war at one stage the other so after the war charms charles flew with pj taylor is a picture of we 're not going to go into this today this is for for another time but um this is a picture of them at jerengong beach i think about to fly off to new zealand and here 's a picture of them stuck um caught in the tide in ireland so beaches were actually used as runways in different places because they were stable platforms unless of course the tide came in yeah ended up like that so um the other person all flew with of course was smithy and um he had famous flights record-breaking flights including the one in the uh across the pacific here 's a picture of allman smithy 's starting up of national airways in um in australia and here 's a picture of them landing in sydney um with all the crowds they were sort of pop stars of the day that i mean people um were divided by the distance of the oceans and all the rest of it and and it 's um description by um michael malkinton who did a talk here of the difficulties of of flying in those days over vast stretches and they were the first ones to do it from america to australia when allm came back and once again this is for another time um all of localities and suburbs host them and big one was uh here at mossman there was a big prey down military road celebrations there 's also a monetary thing involved with this so you basically you know there 's the fame and the adulation but there 's also checks coming in in order to support the next venture um and this is a a lovely presentation book given to charles hall from the municipality and and soldiers and to commemorate that day so um the old connection has been recently memorialized um and the mossman historical society can tell you more about that but there 's a plaque now on the the council chambers which was put up during covert and um i believe or sometime recently last july um and in the words of um john alms um sorry because of his dad we now jump on and off planes like buses and that 's kind of true in a way because they did really try and start up the first air airways in australia and and where pioneers but we 'll talk about that at another stage okay so take a breath and next person is charles kingston smith um this was a picture where i found of a basically describes his life in a few frames um his flying life so you 've got his first world war experience his um and his specific flights in in different types of aircraft um this is from the arrow historians and this is his rap sheet of his flying career very extensive and his awards on the right you have pictures of charles that 's charles of the baby charles is a choir boy charles is a new recruit and charles wounded interesting enough for just quick aside was a lot of the information i got about him was from a fellow called norman nelson who was also a local um and who knew kingswood smith um so his best ones that i 've read on him i could be corrected if someone else has read something else but um ellison was connected with the area as i said and he he was at the landing of smithy 's flights and involved in reporting on that as a journalist and he also suggested that the mask the mast um be put down at bradley 's head he suggested that to the um to the the mayor at the time um so and that 's been documented so charles even though we saw a picture of him as a um as an innocent um choir boy he had a um more sort of thumb sort of side so this is from elson and charles risk taking behaviour started early in life catherine his mother called him chiller so that was his family nickname and there 's a reason behind that which i won 't go into now so he delighted in living dangerously riding his bicycle at frantico 's frantic speed on the suburban footpaths careering down steep hills hands off the handlebars his late teens to satisfy his passion which his recklessness soon earned him the nickname the terror of mossman and numerous police warnings for speeding neighbours predicted that he would break his neck but as the bike he wrecked smashing it one day through a wall of a dairy and ending up in a heap of bottles and confectionery so he got up to other nefarious activities including having mates over smoking parties when his parents were out and dropping bunga 's new lovers canoodling as well as a whole lot of other things that upset the sleepy um area in the in the local residence so he put his motorbike skills to good use um he wanted to enlist before his 18 but he finally got the chance on his 18th birthday um so he was shipped off to gallipoli via egypt and in a letter home he wrote about the risks of um running messages obviously they didn 't have motorbikes or gallipoli but they had to run between the trenches um and hand-delivered messengers he said snipers are pretty bad at the foot of the gully and get our chapters fairly often one has him um after surviving gallipoli chiller action in france he is now dispatch rider with the fourth division signal company with the rank of sergeant once again he had a few close calls including surviving near misses with german shells um charles has let his home were upbeat but after seeing the front line first tannic fest some of the sights out there are really sickening so you find in his letters homie he 's quite sort of cheaper and he doesn 't really want to um get his parents worried so what 's sort of a flippant ness to his sort of his character and sort of a you know devil may care and he 's always having these near misses smithy was supposed to 23 squadron um this so he was in the in the um in the infantry and like many um men he found that the best way to get out of that um and still do his bit was to try and join the royal flying corps um there 's also an australian flying corps uh of its own right but um initially i think you know attrition rates and all the rest of it they were accepting people from the infantry to come into the air force that being said it was mainly um people from uh the upper upper classes or educated or who had connections probably both so which smithy did he went to um you know good schools and you know he knew how to get through the interview and he was um yeah he made it through the training courses to the royal flying court and ended up in a place called la lu la lu for la luvie aerodrome in the pa in france so i found this map um online and it turned out to be quite useful because this is a french coast here um you 've got the front line drawn here and then you 've got all the squadrons listed flying squadrons um british squadrons listed here so the louvy is located about here and um we 're going to come to gordon taylor 's um bill taylor 's um career next and he 's 66 quantum was related with some was here further south was here and there 's a big push going on for apes and the germans were patrolling their side of the lines which is these purple um rough purple areas so basically all the the air battles were were located in this area there was another pilot which i was looking at which i haven 't done a story at all who was actually shot down in this area at langeymark and then taken as a prisoner um um yeah so that 's the situation it looks a bit complicated so when he was basic squadron he flew um what 's known as the um the spad it was a french design plane but i think built by both british and french this was again another postcard which was found in our collection it 's um it 's in the um uh yeah come back to me it 's in paris indian village um where they have the tomb of napoleon and so it 's very much about french pride and this guy is a french fighter ace this is what um this is what um smitty 's plane would british markings so he said about the um the spads they said he said they 're great machines they fly at 140 miles an hour and there 's some going up so 140 miles an hour was pretty fast in those days um now it 's sort of a top speed for a car or whatever despite only having a single machine gun it was maneuverable dived and climbed well up to 20 000 feet and they could also take a bit of punishment as he was later to find out so as you can see it 's quite a compact airplane and this one here is the span 7 which he flew which had one machine gun and this is the um one was two okay doubled up there so after getting to the squadron um he noticed that there was a lot of empty chairs and the attrition rate was pretty high um it wasn 't long before he was he 's in the action and i can read out some of his words on that so just a short note it 's time to let you know morning i just attacked about 20 huns and had the dickens of a fight one dived across in front of me so i got my sight on and let him have it at about 50 rounds before he could get out of the way i had the satisfaction of seeing him chuck up his arms and fall back the machine glided on for a while and then those nose dives straight to the ground i had bad luck after bagging my first bird that my gun jammed and i had to leave the scrap and toodle off home yesterday we had another scrap and i had a rather narrow squid my gun jammed early in the fight and put my nose home to get it fixed when three spare hunts sat on my tail and kept there all the way they were firing all the way down i landed with holes all over my machine and a burst of a dozen alongside my ear he was i was rather badly scared so this is his experience with it with the he reckons he shot down one and noticed his guns up putting two on this aircraft because you know you get jam up the gun the other task he was given was to shoot down balloons or balloon busting so um balloon sound it sounds like an easy job but actually um balloons were quite well defended up from the ground and it could be and so they were considered to be a kill the same scenario plane um so once again in his own words he was um he was ending a patrol and he looked down the ground far below he saw a field grey line snaking through the obliterated landscape german troops on route to the front resting in one massive humanity he broke formation swooped onto this into a screaming dive over my sights i could see men moving down the road but there were too many of them to move quickly i pre pressed the trigger tracer bullet zipped along the road and i saw men falling and hundreds of them scrambling to get out of the way i was filled with an unearthly joy smithy shouted over the rosa engine noise as he lined in a barrel he couldn 't miss i kept my finger pressed hard on the trigger and i turned and roared back with my machine gun spitting death i saw dozens of men bowled over after his ammunition was spent on the infantry below smithy put his spad into a climb cracks of rifle shots fired the aircraft he landed back at the aerodrome cut the ignition and climbed out of the cockpit and this is in his words again after the noise the engine and the gun everything almost sudden everything all of a sudden was quiet i could hear the birds whistling and the men laughing and talking contact with these realities suddenly made men realize the horror of the thing that i 'd done i leaned against the fuselage and vomited i was 20 years old i just killed men and i had a faintest idea why but those few minutes i had gone completely insane now i felt utterly miserable and hated my weakness for doing what i did so this is a theme um uh of a very general theme of you know joining up then some and you know becoming disillusioned and carrying on so then it was his turn so heading from a regular patrol on 14th of august smithy noticed something an airplane from his flight broke formation thinking the other pilot had spotted an enemy aircraft he followed smithy flew back into black bursts of a fire and then losing his wing may turn back shortly the trap was from on the 29th he recalled what happened next i spotted two hun two seaters away below me i proceeded to turn the old bus on a nose and dived i sort of recollect a fearful clutter in my ear and a horrid bash on my foot which made me think the whole leg had gone then i fainted i turned out the bullet had busted numbers of nerves and the shock sent me off when i came to 30 or 40 seconds later or whichever whenever it was i was spinning nose first down to highland these the little holes and chips of wood etc were suddenly appearing all around me where the hun bullets were chewing things up i tried was paralyzed and i could only fly ahead as fast and as steadily as i could to our lines and pray that he wasn 't a very good shot the german fighter stalking the clouds above had pounced while is diving on the two-seater the jester scouts swooped into smithy 's blind spot perfect timing susie spad was sprayed with a burst from two span down machine guns at point blank range smithy 's anniversa adversary um oba lieutenant willem reinhardt followed the stricken spat down to issue the coup de grace which thank goodness in in um his third words he couldn 't achieve so basically what happened was that they 'd use a decoy um like a two-seater plane and then if the opposite uh opposition fighter attacked the plane someone else higher up in the clouds would be would be waiting for that to happen and this guy was a bit of a crack shot and and hit um smithy from the side and then chased him chased him down the deadly chase presuming last all the way to british lines but smithy just made it back boot past the knee more by instinct than anything else i made a moderate good landing and then crashed out of the bus and finally collapsed they rushed the ambulance up and took me away to to the css where they operated by his own ambitious own admission it was a marvelous escape considering there were 180 bullet holes in the machine and dozens around my head within inches fortunately any that hit the engine didn 't do any damage and it never conked out so once again a very near miss he was shot in the foot this is the bloke that shut him down i think so he would have been flying one of these albatross planes this is him later with a with a focker tri-plane he 's crashed this one and it 's hard to tell whether he 's thankful or proud or you know just um a bit embarrassed by the whole thing and that 's him more nonchalantly photographed there but he was a he was a um an ace of swords um i 'll try and move through this quickly without reading um said that he had a kind of a cloven hoof foot because it was um cut down the middle um his parents would have been relieved that he wasn 't nothing worse that 's happening this is a picture of him here sort of standing on one foot this poor black looks like he 's standing on one foot or lost a leg um [Music] but shortly after he was awarded an mc um so for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty so that 's the the medal there and um it was mainly shooting down balloons he he was i think someone claimed he shot down fire planes but i think it was only two and two probables or something um there 's a lot of difference between claims and and actual tallies and in those days they didn 't really consider the ice status that was something that came after the war so he gets his award and um he 's quite sort of flippant about it in later life he wrote his biography um he does describe how he went to see the king and um and um and his um you know injury he took a step back as was the protocol and ended up spilling up all over the floor so he said he got it from various acts of foolishness after this he comes home back and here 's a newspaper clipping um from the time um he came back to um recuperate so it says he said sydney airman comes home the huns are well lit so he identifies him as lieutenant kingston smith age 20 of mossman and how he 's been awarded the um the military cross so when he came back his family said he was quite shy but he was always um you know one for the ladies and one of them said that unless she was going out looking the best that she wanted him in uniform so after that he used to wear his uniform um and fortunately um there was an occasion where he was catching the ferry from mossman and he got sort of ribbed by a few burns on the thing about his uniform and apparently this was reported in the paper how he is a picture of him it 's a very bad photo um it 's a picture of him with his family and relatives on leave back in australia in sydney his only duty in sydney was to um he was asked to go up to the entrance area in tuggerah lakes too there was reports of strange sightings in the site in the sky um there 's a bit of an insider looked it up and apparently they 've seen strange lights and all the rest of it there was a bit of paranoia about german ships and um and the float plane that that was um wolfson i think it was called it was around the coast at the time was interesting when i googled it um 1994 there was a whole lot of sightings of strange lights and ufo type things um so anyway there 's a whole society apparently out there that 's based around this and gets funding right so he finishes the war this is a picture of him with the training instructors so he 's not no longer in the front lines he 's cap on and he 's looking a bit sort of nonplussed or you know um he was known as king dick um so this is because as you 're saying he was a he was a fast worker and he 'd sort of have girls on the go and um and yeah that was his sort of his reputation i think these men once they 'd seen what they 'd seen and he already had a uh you know a point shot for for risk taking and being out there it 's um it was fairly common so after the war what do these pilots do they 've got um you know they 've got these skills but they 're they 're basically out of work so he starts these joy flight companies um and there 's a bit of controversy there because they keep crashing the airplanes they 're buying from army surplus at very cheap prices and getting insurance on them for more than their value so this could have just been a bit of bad luck or a bit of opportunism but eventually um here 's them mates that they set the company up with eventually this did get around the higher circles and he was supposed to fly this plane here which is the blackburn kangaroo to australia in the 1919 air race and he was kind of like um it 's sort of like not knowing the time but he was he 's basically you know he was because of his reputation he was told that he couldn 't make this flight and um i think one of his his mates here too as well um he was really disappointed about that because there was a lot of prize money or offered it was won by two other smith 's um keith and ross smith in the view me but as you see this sarah plane crashed in crete so he wouldn 't have probably made it anyway but um yeah some interesting people on board i 'll move on so after that he went from england to the us to california to work as a stunt pilot to try it in about there um i won 't read all the writing but basically this hanging off the bottle of bottom of an airplane he decided it was just too too crazy people were just you know wanting too much for what what what he was getting back from that so he ended up being his broke and he ended up coming back to australia after leaving california and then all of this gave me the impetus to you know to to do big and better things um and and dream of you know crossing the pacific or or going from england to australia um okay just finishing up with smithy so basically um there is another connection with the mossman area this lady nelly stewart she was an opera singer and performer and when he was in camp his sister invited her to him to come along and um and he wanted to get an autographed card off her because he was she was his idol and she he got invited into the city at what from camp and um he came to meet her and there 'd been some sort of hazing exercise going on or something because he had his eyebrows shaved was mortified to introduce him to this star of the stage but he ended up getting a card offer which he kept through all of his flights um even after the war and it was a sort of lucky charm um and she came to his um ceremony in 1934 and she lived in the mossbeen area i think until her death so yeah she 's buried down in melbourne um so he was um a man of many talents so on the top left hand corner you 've seen him playing ukulele he was a very he had um he went to the musical school in the city he had um you know he used to entertain him the officers mess usually write all sort of songs and that sort of thing but he was very good pianist and um and um well yeah ukulele player um on the right has an unusual photograph i found um he 's in dressed up in a bit of um you know for a bit of pantomime and it 's interesting that i found so many pictures of um you know from it was quite common for men to do this sort of thing and obviously in an all-male society you need people to play the girls and they 're of happy to do that but i don 't know what um but it 's interesting sort of angle um you don 't normally see for the first rule this picture i included because um the clarity of the photograph is amazing so i don 't know if this is a sister or a lady friend or you know whoever but just it 's just a nice photo really um so that 's why i put that in there so that 's um we 're done with smithy so now we 'll go back to um pg taylor so just go to okay so the detail is our last one please you taylor flew with both smithy and more okay so here of course is his um his flight career this victory in 1917 young man um ready to um with his wings and uniform just giving a bit of help okay great um [Music] sorry we 're just sorry just flicking right here we go so um so that there is his um career so 1890s mossman um we 've got um mossman in 1890s um advertising um land in mossman we 've got the ferry service there 's no no harbour bridge then also have trams there 's a picture of a tram going up a hill a lot of them went down to the um the ferries on steep gradients and this is um by um i think his name was hopkins and he was um saying how slow the trains were it 's got a tortoise pulling up the hill this is the um sort of pleasure gardens in um in clifton gardens and if you 've got um this big um swimming pool and diving area um change rooms hotels you 've got it 's very hard to see but you 've got people here in their sort of finery looking over the bay you 've got a um a ferry bringing pleasure seekers to the to the area so it was sort of a bit of a weekend retreat sort of place very very sleepy just fellow pat taylor became the mayor he was a um entrepreneur of sorts uh the first council meeting um they decided um hopkins drew this this coat of arms for them um the whale to do with the previous whaling um so not not so cute but you know um that was a previous industry but it 's a nice mascot um this is taylor 's um election manifesto and it 's actually like it 's all about improving the suburb improving the roads um you know it 's all good civic stuff this was happened on uh um new year 's day it was it just shows the early development of flight and um in the local area so when um trying to to get a very early experimental plane off the ground not succeeding okay so taylor came from a house called new stream and it was in raglan street so there 's quite um nice houses like this one in reagan street i don 't think it was quite that flash but still would have been substantial um they own properties in pit water and mossman and land subdivisions and it 's probably up here towards the the top of the street okay so this is bill as a young schoolboy um last time we talked about how he um even though he 's an outdoors kid he loves the outdoors he always dreamed of it he he found a um he went to moss and prep and then to the um skeggs that 's a picture of muslim prep at the time and a sort of a mr chips type fellow in this building um but he found the bullying and fagging that sort of thing in the in the in the system a bit um that 's the word for you know like you know anyway but um for older boys pulling younger boys um he did he he really didn 't understand it and he kind of was a bit of a loner in a way um the time for war came so he eventually he kind of got moved away from his gigs because he he couldn 't really you know he just didn 't want to be there and then he went he you know he just didn 't want to be there either but then he finally knuckled down and he succeeded quite well and he 's in his sort of last years and then he went off to join up and enlist as from the cadets to to the army so he would have been a um second lieutenant or something like that um in control of a bunch of men at the liverpool camp so these were the blacks there they 're pretty um there 's no soft types amongst them this is what they eventually became as a soldiers at the front um so it 's it 's interesting you know he he had a sort of a humane kind of um sort of side to him and and and he he got on with with the men and he he described they just sort of described him as a boy mascot company commander um there was one occasion he does mention where there was um a huge riot at the camp and there was a massive protest that went into the city there was thousands of men shops and and all the rest of it because they were forced to work more hours or not but drill more else and they thought was um they could do and also they weren 't allowed to access any grog there 's a couple of them having a studio portrait with grog um this is a bullet hole at central station there was one one trooper cured um eventually was by the riot police so he he just wants to get out of this camp everyone wants to get out of the camp but he 's sort of stuck there because he has to train them for going overseas he wants to he wants something different and that 's when he comes back from us one day and he 's he 's in the train he 's reading a magazine and it 's got a picture of in a story about an attack on on a zeppelin base in europe what by these machines and he 's just totally he has a an epiphany and he says oh this is what i 've got to do so he 's prepared does use his dad 's connections he has to convince his father it 's not a complete act of magnus getting up in these flying contraptions um but eventually once once his father says yes then he helps pave the way through his connections and he says he wasn 't trying to get out of things he was he was just trying to get to where the action was so just quick aside what happened to the camp after the liverpool riots um it was turned into a what was called the german concentration camp which is an ironic use of the term but so basically it was just a prison war camp and for what they called enemy aliens so that was um you know germans and austrian people were unfortunately all thrown in there um including survivors of the empty sydney battle and this is them and they 've built these little model ships which it was gave them something to do in the time there they also like to do a bit of um pantomime as well or a few you know plays and um yeah so sporting events and all the rest of it so he gets to england with his dad 's papers and told who to to see and who to connect with he gets finalists interview and the interviewing guy the only thing he 's interested is who his father was what he does um where he went to school and most importantly can you ride a horse so basically that 's it if you if you similar to the english alpha classes and you ride a horse and go fox hunting you can you can fly an airplane um these are the type of airplanes they learn to fly on it sort of looks like a bathtub with wings so um his basic training was um his instructor said you taylor he said yes sir any ins any instruction yet he said no sir i haven 't this his first time up in the airplane he said all right i 'll give you some landings so they go up in the sky and it 's a terrible experience for taylor because the bloke just sort of gives him control of the plane whatever it turned out the instructor was a lot of um pilots were sent back after having nervous breakdowns and he was one of those tail didn 't know but still it wasn 't a good good thing so he asked to have another instructor which happened unfortunately his friend which is i think the one in the middle whose name was he was a rhodes scholar called um whiteman he a couple of weeks later he found out that he tried to fly the plane himself after one or two lessons and crashed and was killed so a lot of them were killed just in training okay so um this is a picture from taylor 's book and it basically shows um his early days in england are flying and a lot of times they got lost and they just sort of landed in a field somewhere and tried to get directions and then all these people sort of came around and had a look because it was such a novel thing this aeroplane it 's a very strange looking thing he actually i think it 's the type to push up through the clouds and push the limits of his own endurance you know that um and actually made it back it was near on thing um you lose some oxygen at certain levels and they had no no sealed sort of cockpits or anything as you can see so this guy is another fly from mossman and just quicker side his name was um jack meaning alford and when he saw one time tail len and he said um they are he was interviewed years uh later in his older age you said well why is it you you um ended up joining the the flying car and he said well we really got the idea in salisbury plains because an australian was a be at the top of airplane have to land near the artillery unit we were greatly interested in this plane and it turned out to be bill taylor that 's the late sir gordon taylor so these two probably grew up within streets of each other and were over in england and this bloke was inspired to to fly aeroplanes because of taylor his aeroplane and flies to france um he 's posted with 66 squadron and they fly the um southwest pup so he gets there these are the chaps outside their um their billet 66 squadron inside they um would decorate them and furnish it as quite well as they could he describes going to local french town city um and trying to get something to make it as homely as possible that included one of these kirsten girls and i looked them up and they were sort of like the pinup girls at the time so they would have decorated their walls with that he was led by fellow captain andrews that 's him there that 's i 'm having a coffee or a gin or something at the local at the squadron base um andrews was a very good leader he was um he 'd also flown against the the richtofen when he was first starting out and shot down a famous ace called hawker in one of these um i think they 're called dh2 aeroplanes anyway this is taylor at the um at the base pilot is the guy looked after the engine and the guy that did all the wiring and all the rest of it so the planes of course were made out of canvas that was doped and um and these metal wires would get the whole thing together and the wood so it was it required a lot of craftsmen to put these together so anyway there 's this taylor and there 's these two two offsiders you can see this is a uniform from the um australian war moral you can see it 's pretty much that that uniform and he 's got his dfc so you can probably place it in time from that so let 's stop with papa this is a someone done this as a render online um this is taylor 's exact plane with the number and his markings it had one machine gun and it was probably outdated by the time they got it they were waiting for other newer aeroplanes but he said it was a very nice aeroplane to fly quite maneuverable this is a bit of a scary picture of taylor he mentions of frostbite and also i had to make some adjusting adjustments because of the wind blowing in and and basically passing your face they also had to pay for everything that 's why you also had to have a bit of money behind you because you had to pay for your gloves and you and all the rest of it all right so i might have to wind it up soon this is a picture from taylor 's book he was originally um stationed here at vert gallon and then he moved to estee branch so here is the front line he had to deal with anti-aircraft fire it 's an interesting picture and there 's all different sorts of anti-aircraft guns here he was able to fly a captured albatross fighter he said they were very heavy but that was sort of like a real um really good plane at the early stages of 1917. um he thought he first went into the skies during bloody april in 1917 and he had contact with the enemy in the sky then and so that include different squadrons um black planes and a few others another pilot um richardson here on friday the third x in bloody april he was shot down by a fellow named clyde um he was flying one of these b um a uh fe to d i think it was the aeroplanes as you see there 's two pilots here here was the gunner at the front and sorry there 's a gunner and a server and pilot um unfortunately he was brought down he was being awarded um for his um for his victory he was an ace um and unfortunately he was shot down on that day okay um so bill taylor had a brother and he joined the artillery so this is you might be able to see this picture of some dragging artillery i think it 's from his his um 184th royal galveston garrison artillery um ken had heard from uh sorry bill had heard from another a colleague pilot that he 'd run into his brother in a certain sector because he didn 't know where he was exactly and when he found out where he was he intended he unfortunately the next news that bill got was that um that kenneth being killed he was trying to get a message out and they were recording a counter-attack um so bill flew across to his brother 's grave which um and it was kind of a sad lonely experience for him and um and he caught up with his mother in england shortly after i think but they were quite sort of reserved about the grief and all the rest of it so this is patrick 's um sorry patrick gordon taylor bill taylor 's um award he got the same one as a smithy bill taylor 's moment of disillusionment came when he was chasing one of these um there was two of them but the one he was chasing after was what he called a rumpler which is a high-flying german reconnaissance plane they flew high he attacked it and as you see that it would have been defended by the observer and flown by a pilot in front um he describes he basically came up from underneath it he could see the the black crosses and the down and then the consequences of that this was no triumph the horrible wavy thing in the air had a home parents okay so we 'll go back he from my wild trying for this successful end to long chase a dull sense of horror came over me there was something awful about this doomed aeroplane so he 's hit it and it 's streaming black smoke and going down then a black object detached itself from the blazing rumpler a grow testing was loose and waving ends the rear gunner had jumped from death by fire to which my action had condemned it he appeared to fall quite slowly passing my machine as though he were almost floating in space and then he was gone and visible against the dark earth the drama above me continued the rumplun now just a stream of stinking black smoke slowly put his nose down as pieces came off in flame and smoke then the fire seemed to go out but it burst again but it burst against flames it finally hit the ground with a great explosion leaving a cloud of smoke horrible wavy thing in the air had a home parents someone who loved him now he was dead lying trump will be in the earth killed by me for the first time i was horror stricken by the results of war in the air somehow before it all remained impersonal not an airplane with a man in it but a dangerous creature of the air to be destroyed for some reason the rumpler was different or perhaps i had been in france too long so this next picture is is what happened to the plane everyone was sort of gawking and quite excited about the whole thing but he just he just went along with it but he felt quite gutted and he mentions how they say you do want to look at this thing the pilot and he 's just like a mangled mess and so he had no more taste for war i began to think of my way over the world to my home in australia to line island with my boat worn on the beach the tent by the banksy trees the red gums sprawling over the little penguins coming in from the sea at night so he just wants to be home this is his favorite place um lion island from his childhood his penguins go there manly penguins and you know sound in nature he just he just wants to be out of it so anyway after this he goes back to the uk becomes an instructor he goes back later on in life um with his third wife joy they go in and visit ken 's grave and this is sort of like a you know um well the americans say a bit of closure he finds the grave of his friend who had been buried by the germans he writes his his pens his memoirs in the last years bill penned his last memoir with only his logbook he was surprised to find in the writing they wore memories came back to me vividly beyond my highest expectations to immerse myself completely in distant events and bring them to life again i wrote in the very early mornings before the life the present day could impose itself on me and there are pharma with the sound of guns i saw a chapstick and squadron high air over carbon and do i i stalked again the shark like albatross flying my agile little fighter software scout 709 so he 's writing um probably the last few years of his life he 's written a whole lot of books about his flying so he 's he 's having memories but luckily he 's um triggered by his um his logbooks at the time otherwise trying to remember back that far it 's you know going to be a bit hazy okay so at the um art gallery some of the um the mementos that were donated from him this is the black cat which he kept in his plane as a as a lucky charm they all had lucky charms or not all of them but they were superstitious and had this was bill taylor 's he stuck on his um news windspring um also a scarf and what they called a maternity jacket because it was because it was sort of below in billowed out that 's part of his uniform when i unfortunately it didn 't go past this area but i did find on google maps so his first aerodrome i was able to locate near this farmstead and then google maps you can see and if you read his writings he mentions you know farm houses and all the rest of it so when he went back he started having all these memories and imagining planes flying off and all the rest of it so basically it would have been in one of these two fields that his squadron 19 spads and sc56 were located okay so into the future this will be the next talk the golden age of aviation i was also preparing some um an exhibition which includes some scale models and various videos and all the rest of it so that kept me um whoops kept me busy in in lockdown in the first one with a new challenge and a learning curve with that sort of thing but anyway if you 're interested in um the stories i 've done this is the um website link here there 's a facebook site as well or we 're pretty close to time in fact just just over so we can open up to any questions if if you 're interested um hopefully still awake i can 't hear you james i think you 're abusive oh yeah okay can you hear me now yeah we 're unmuted now yeah oh look a fantastic talk thank you so much you got enough material for about 10 talks there yeah yeah um can i mention a couple of things i saw on your old record yeah um the abbreviation sw means shrapnel wound shrapnel is bright yeah yeah so gunshot wound is abbreviated gsw right okay yeah so he probably has shrapnel in the knee but i mean still obviously very bad but possibly not as bad as being hit by a bullet in the knee which would be very bad news indeed i 'd say yes definitely yeah i thought another thing was that you know you mentioned the man uh seven mile beach uh south of jericho and um i heard a radio interview with the guys in albion park who are rebuilding the replica southern to land on seven mile beach too dangerous yeah no um yes i i i don 't think they 'd want to go to that um extreme length of um representation well i think your picture of the flooded uh uh beach it was new zealand wasn 't it but that that uh that shows you the problem you know yeah yeah definitely i think there could have been one in new zealand i still want to look into it i think that one was in um in ireland actually when they were flying um from there to they intended to fly from there to america oh cool okay yeah you gotta tell us why it was called chiller why was kingswood smith called chiller i 've got the book here give me a minute and i 'll look it up oh okay all right there 's so much stuff in there there was i remember thinking about that and then i didn 't so but i 'll i 'll find out for you james no no that 's that 's no problem but it was a family nickname i um or i could be confusing or something else but because i came originally from america um and he had a bit of a mohawk they sort of called him after an indian name or something and that morphed into his family name or something like that though yeah cool but i 'll find out i 'll find out yeah but they the family actually called him chiller they didn 't call him um yeah well well uh that 's what people call prince charles did they they said yeah oh well there it 's a bit of new knowledge for you there yeah now um on your slide that was scratched with the hun uh you know about the cobra lang photographs don 't you no no okay there was a a famous collection of of world war one photographs which are like you know you 've got many planes all in close proximity to each other and there 's one of a man falling out of a burning albatross and that 's right yeah right now now those those photographs um uh were have been reproduced many many 're actually a collection of fakes yes yeah yeah yeah yeah and yeah but they were made by an rfc chap who worked in hollywood so he had all the skills to make a realistic uh depiction and they 're much better than the official photographs of the time yeah um i think also your pictures of the the balloon the zeppelin being shot and the strafing they were also out of movies weren 't they yes they were yeah well spotted um so i 'll just i 'll try and find those so people know that was to create atmosphere that 's probably what the original folks would we 're doing so oh well i think that they probably captured the atmosphere much better than any realistic photograph could have done at the time yeah well i don 't think there 's any there 's any enough it would have been in fact impossible to try and take a photograph like that yeah or almost one other very short thing about the fe2 go the two-seater push-up plane yeah uh where you were mentioned the champion got shot down red baron down yeah that 's true he was hit in the back of a head with a machine gun bullet yeah and um it produced a head wound which you can see in photographs that you know he had his head wrapped up not too long before he was shot down in the end yeah but the funny thing was how do you how do you shoot somebody in the head with a machine gun bullet not kill them and apparently the fe2 was going if you like to the left and von richthofen was going to the right and and the fe2 gunner was pointing backwards right so he shot he shot by richtofen as they passed each other right though he shot richtofen from behind but the relative velocity to the two aeroplanes would have greatly reduced the velocity of the machine gun bullet right so when it hit by richtofen 's uh leather helmet it didn 't penetrate enough to kill him right the fe-2 had a gunner in the front cockpit out in the nose of the aircraft and he could shoot in all directions if i 'm ripped off and going this way and the mp2 is going that way and the gun they shot back into the back of richthofen 's head yeah yeah so it was like that was a very close call for richtofen velocities would have subtracted from the bullet velocity right right so say the bullet was doing say 400 miles an hour right and the two planes are doing say 300 miles an hour in combination yeah yeah so the bull is doing 100 miles now therefore not enough velocity to actually the physics yeah and um yeah the randomness of it all as well so oh yeah well yes von richthofen was very lucky because after he was hit um he also passed out like like um you mentioned in your story as well um that was smithy wasn 't it who passed out for 30 seconds yeah von richthofen passed out and again only recovered you know crash landed with great difficulty yeah yeah yeah alfred accounts were that 's quite that that happened i guess that you you might black out when you 're doing out and then recovering just before they hit the ground and that sort of thing so yeah well smithy had a boot full of blood then he 's lost enough blood to basically pass out anyway so and he sounds like he tended to exaggerate things but it sounds i couldn 't i couldn 't verify because but you sound like the the you know the armor or whatever counted 180 bullet poles and it sounds about right you know so um yeah so now also the mystery lady in your uh photograph with smithy in 1933 at the mascot yeah i think is his second wife lady mary oh okay right okay yeah she looks like a nice lady apparently uh he was a bit of a ladies man you know as i say one bit in particular well he got into trouble like in england because he was doing joy flights and he was basically taking ladies off into secluded areas and um you know into love tristan and all the rest of it well you know you have to somehow it 's provider and rumor but it scams to get you some reputation damaged enough but you know oh there were dramatic days so yeah yeah they were they were living life on the edge yeah and that 's how he was he just he lived his life on the edge um so i mean he wasn 't without i remember it somewhere that he had a fear of water he was known to have a like when he 's flying over water have panic attacks and that sort of thing so you know um the the images you know the image we haven 't is always it 's always different from the real person yeah so um yeah no i have to sorry there 's a lot of material to cover there so hopefully yeah well i think it 's great i really enjoyed it thank you very much yeah yeah dara it 's that she in here um hello hello um i i found your extracts from uh um taylor 's uh book and uh his recollections were fascinating and very much in context uh and uh the um uh yes i i just wanted oh thanks thank you appreciate it yeah it 's a it 's a whole new format um it wasn 't that rehearsed so we got through it i surprised it i thought am i going on too much and then we were um it was only four minutes past the hour so there 's probably enough to take him anyway so yeah i 'm glad you enjoyed it so oh thank you i 'm in the library at the moment uh we 're in this what 's called the creation space so it 's sort of like the library yeah right look the um with the audio there were some dropouts due to the the microphone is going you know how it has a threshold level okay yeah right not serious but just occasionally and uh so uh you might want to get them to look at a a better microphone for doing these sort of talks on there you 're not sure okay thanks that 's good feedback yeah yeah i wasn 't aware of that oh not a big deal but just uh you know a few percent or something the computer 's trying to say oh cut out the background noise and it actually cuts out your speech a little bit all right okay all right can i just ask quickly um uh was there an earlier talk that you gave um uh on on this subject and how can we access that yeah okay so the early talk was um it was on facebook live and that 's on the um on the facebook part of the site which i can i 'll continue the details of that um it 's basically those first slides i showed you but in more detail so there 's probably nothing new but um i was um we just had a few technical difficulties at the time and you couldn 't really see the side proper that 's why i was going to cuddle that out um and that would have given more time to other things but i thought i 'd discuss very quickly because i like slides sort of more interesting like that yeah thank you yeah oh yeah well that 's great well i have i 'm catch up and i 'll be able to add a bit more information with taylor that he they claim that he shot down five but i 've been looking to he only claims um one or maybe two so it 'd be interesting to cross records um there are claims for the squadron but it 's claimed some actual work are two different stuff dara can i just ask with pj taylor yeah um look i might have missed it i i actually uh my wife came in with buttered toast so that was a but did you mention his plane down in canberra he 's got a plain camera oh the um which one the dh9 okay um sorry actually is it the same pg taylor who was in the um england australia air race no he i don 't think he was there was another tale there was probably another taylor i 'll get okay i 've got the wrong guy sorry yeah yeah now this one um yeah no i don 't think he i don 't think he did much flying straight after the wall but of up a pit water and they got a gypsy moth and put floats on it and i think he was doing that you know just that sort of thing and then eventually it was fine catalina you know i imagine your next talk is on a lot of pg taylor 's um cross pacific flights and things like that i 've got a few of these books that um talk about that yeah yeah is that what your next talk is going to be about that 's what it 's leading to so this is about their war service um yeah how that leads into into all the um the specific flights or whatever so but you might have to wait on that yeah but i i can see a future talk on expanding on taylor for instance uh as well it would be quite interesting yeah he sounds like an interesting character that 's um not all that well known yeah that 's right and reading his writing it 's it 's really good because you get the human being behind it and um see there 's not but never got never something i don 't know if something happened to that there 's a bit on smithy but it 's a little bit sort of bit you know um yeah it 's not not quite as good as the tail stuff no i was going to say there 's a there 's a whole talk on taylor just on his own really i could just do it on him yeah just in the war yes i 'd like to do that [Music] okay thank you dara that was a fabulous presentation thank you for putting in all the obviously hours and hours of work that you did on that it 's so well researched and so interesting so thank you very much and we look forward to having you back for next installment thank you and i believe this talk will be uploaded to the library 's youtube channel so you can watch it again and tell all your friends about it thanks dara okay thank you thanks for coming everyone okay bye for now bye bye thank you bye see you guys _"

    "text": "hello are you wonderful at explorers for those of you who don 't know me my name is Emily and I run the art explorers program for three to five year olds at the Mosman art gallery now we haven 't been able to run our program like we normally do but we 're determined to make sure that you guys can still be creative and have fun and explore and be amazing in the comfort of your own home we have two really big important things that we try to focus on what is the process we want you to have fun while you 're making your art not just have this end product we want the whole journey to be wonderful and the other thing I really wanted to focus on was making sure that you at home had all the resources you needed to participate in these wonderful activities the first thing I wanted to do was to get you guys to paint but I thought what do people don 't have paint I loved this problem coming up with the solution it was so much fun garden and in my own home that I could use as paint and I had a lot of fun doing this I went and I got some sandstone I got some grass I got some tumeric a delicious onion and I also found a coffee that I hadn 't finished I then just added water i boiled some of it and I just had a really good time playing and exploring and seeing what colors I could find so I 'm going to show you what I discovered but at the end of this video I hope you will shut the screen walk away and go and see what wonderful colors you can find in your own house I would love you to post me pictures and examples of some of the colors you can come up with because that way you 'll be teaching me and I can use your wonderful ideas so the first one we 've got here and this is just a piece of sandstone that I found to the garden and it 's an orangey sandstone it 's very grainy so a lot of these looks very purpley in the bowl but on the paper its paler but it 's still kind of cool the third one was my biggest disappointment but then also my funnest mistake so this was grass and I really wanted a bright vibrant color and this was what I got I boiled it because I thought that would be the best thing to do and what I 've got was basically a weird watery color and I thought to myself no way I have been in the garden and I have gotten grass stains that have been impossible to get out of clothes so what if I got my grass and I used it sort of like a paintbrush with built-in paint look at that and it was so much fun I really enjoyed that mistake the next one I used was to marry and turmeric is a really bright vibrant color you can find it in your in your hubs and the spices wrap and the yellow from the turmeric is really it 's one of the brighter colors that I found and I enjoyed playing with that one bowl they 're a really rich purpley red when I put them on the paper it 's still a really fun color but that 's just a little bit watery my last one was the coffee make sure I don 't drink this a little bit later and let 's see what amazing color I can find comes up with this beautiful brown what I loved about this activity most of all was when I was doing an experiment before I filmed this look what happens when my colors dried compared to my wet colors look what happens to my onion it goes this kind of delicious greeny grey I love the science behind that this is like art meets science which is such a fun exploration all right my art explorers it 's time for you guys to go and explore and I can 't wait to see what you guys come up with we 'll see you next time bye [Music] _"

    "text": "hello welcome hi everyone welcome to the creation space lovely to see you here my name 's grace and i 'm sarah and today we will be showing you how to make um balls with air dry clay and stencils or alternatively leaves or found objects so the makers the creation space is a makerspace um we have a lot of equipment in here we have 3d printers that you can see behind us we have a laser cutter we have vinyl cutters um a 3d scanner as well and a soldering iron um so we have lots of amazing tools that we hope to welcome you back next year um so that you can actually participate in person and play with our fun new equipment um but until then we 're offering some online workshops so today i guess we 'll start with you sarah you can demonstrate um a pinchbot technique yep so this workshop was originally designed to be in the creation space but we 've had to adapt it to zoom so what we did online was give you a recipe for some air dry clay at making some air dry clay themselves um you can just put your hand up if you have or if you bought your own clay uh that 's okay too you can just um have a look today and and see uh how to do it and then you 'll be able to have some ideas about how to go about doing it at home but if we were going to make some air dry clay ourselves um the recipe that we had has just some basic kitchen ingredients for us so it was one cup of corn flour one cup of some you know pva type glue a tablespoon of white vinegar or any kind of vinegar really and a tablespoon of oil and what you do is you mix them all up and you put them in the microwave and it heats heats it all up a little bit and you take it out and you roll it so i 'll just i 'll grab some i 've done i did this yesterday in the microwave and when it comes out it actually uh looks a little bit and show you it looks a little bit like this and then what you can do is use that to create some objects like this one this is a little ring holder i 've made um and i 've just um put a little bit of uh poster paint in it while i was mixing it and i got that lovely marbled effect uh so it 's quite hard i 'll just kind of knock it like that takes about two or three days to really harden and dry and that one there i just put a little bit of purple paint in while i was mixing it up and i made some lovely little gift tags and i just put some stamps in them so lovely little gift tags there so what we 'll start with today is a couple of techniques we want to show you that are really great hand building basic techniques the first one is called pinching and with that we 'll make a pinch pot so we 've got our clay and the first thing we want to do is we want to roll of a small say a mandarin or an an orange no bigger than an orange really because it gets a bit hard to work with so really you want to you want to push it together so that you make sure that it 's nicely compressed i 'll take my ring off because it 's making a bit of a mark there so once you 've got your ball then what we do when everyone 's ready is you take your thumb and you put your thumb into the center of the ball create a little a little hole like that now with a pinch pot the only thing we 're interested in is the inside shape we don 't want to worry too much about the outside shape i can see there that some of us are still getting our clay ready that 's okay we can all just go at whatever pace and by the way if anyone has any questions you can just raise your hand and speak turn your mic on or you can chat in the chat box feel free to ask us questions at great way to start if you 've got an interest in pottery or clay because it 's it 's cheap you don 't need to fire it and then you can decorate it which is um great too uh we 'll be showing some ways to decorate so once you 've got your your your round ball and you 've put your your hole in it then what you want to do is kind of um support it in your hand and rotate it and gently kind of push push your fingers up so your thumb is in inside the hole and then you 're gently pushing and pinching the outside up if you pinch and pull out you 're going to make a larger hole so think about the inside hole always this is going to be the shape of your vessel your bowl or your cup i think i 'm going to make mine quite large so i 'm going to really kind of pull it out as i go around the good thing about clay is if you don 't like what you 've made you just is a great technique the good thing about a pinch pot is that it has no joins so it 's going to dry really well it 's not going to crack because it 's just one literally one piece i can see my bowl is quite getting quite large now sorry can i just um ask a question i just have some leftover air drying clay at home so i wasn 't prepared to make more than one piece yeah how much um would we need for the plate um probably it 'll be about the size of a little saucer okay or yeah it really could be even smaller it could just you you might decide to make a little ring um a ring bowl or a ring holder or something like that okay then so do you reckon about okay so i 'll just decide to make the plate then yeah if you just want to make the plate that 's fine too so we 're just showing you a few techniques here today so the the first main techniques you learn when you do any kind of may already be potters um the first techniques you learn anyway are pinch pinching and slab work and then coil work we 're not going to show you coil work today but we 're going to show you pinching and slab work so there 's my little bowl and what i do to give it a flat base is i just kind of drop it a little bit on on my work surface now because we don 't have we 're not inside the creation space and we can 't use um stencils from 3d printing we 're just using found objects today so i 've got a little rock that i picked up when i was down at the beach and i 'm just going to decorate the outside just by imprinting on the side but you could use anything you could use the back of a spoon um i 'm just going to go around it you could do a toothbrush you could use a toothbrush you could even um use a shell like i 've got a little sorry grace i 've got some little shells here i press in i 'm going to get some lovely little shapes like that we 're really um only limited by our ideas yes well it 's true and the other thing uh if you you might have some just um stamps lying around the house you can even use those i 've got some letters so i 'll finish my pinch pot off with that but it 's a lovely activity to do on a rainy day isn 't it getting some good um good decoration with that shell i 'm really happy with that those of you who are creating at home how are you going how are your putts coming along you can just show them if you like wow that one looks great very nice very good i like the shell technique there we go so just really really easy obviously i 've got a little bit of work to do on the inside smoothing it but just you can buy tools but you your fingers are great tools a back of a little teaspoon is a great smoothing tool and an old sponge is great this one off with a little i don 't know a little word on the inside of my pot so then we 'll just leave them the air dry clay yeah takes depending on what the weather 's like takes about they say 24 hours for it to dry probably 48 is a good good amount of time as well before you start decorating it okay so there 's my first um there 's our first little pot we 'll give you a few minutes um and we 'll get set up for the next technique that we wanted to show you which is uh slab building lovely i can see that we 've got some beautiful pots being created there that 's really good well done um so the next technique that we wanted to show you is the the slab building you can create great little sculptures and mini tiles using the slab welding method and the key is to make sure you get the thickness of your slab right because if it 's too thick it will take a long time to dry but if it 's little bit of a battering it will um crack so so if you 've got a bowl of clay then i would just suggest flattening it first so making a little kind of circle pressing it down and then you can just take a rolling pin if you have one at home or any kind of round surface like that um or you can use your fingers but it saves a lot of time if you have a rolling pin and you just want to roll it out quite large [Music] but it depends it depends on how much clay you have of course um and what size dish you 'd like to make so you can make as sarah was showing you before something very small if you like i 've made this one into an interesting kind of floral flower shape or a like slightly larger bowl or a different kind of different size different shape whatever you like but today i 'm going to do quite a large plate because i 'd like to show you um stencils that we actually made in the 3d printer that is great because you get a nice even surface of your slab and you 'll also be able to compress the clay as you go which will mean that it will it will just be stronger as it dries you can see any little air bubbles if they appear you can just get a little toothpick and just um get rid of those air bubbles and as you go sometimes turning the slab over is good to choose to roll both sides so that 's something that can help compress the clay as well it 's kind of like pastry really yeah we 've got is that a question from winnie yeah i 've got a question i 'm finding that my clay is kind of thick on one side and then thin on the other is there a way that i can try and get it more even um if you had if you had two little rulers perhaps or um [Music] you could you could roll the rolling pin out on top of them and that way the clay would spread to the width of the spacing between it 's not it 's yeah it 's not easy though sometimes you do it does naturally um thin out on the edges um okay yeah but just eyeballing it is you know that 's all we need to do that 's kind of the beauty of uh handmade pottery isn 't it it 's a little bit wonky but yeah it can can be a little bit difficult to get the slab even does anyone come up with any other ideas about making their slab even no can i just ask i 've just used the clay direct from the packet without kneading it or anything is that fine yeah with the air dry clay it doesn 't really need a lot of kneading i suppose if you 've worked it into something else and now you want to you know you didn 't like what you were making and you wanted to you know remake it into something else um slapping it back into you know doing a bit of wedging uh kneading is what they call it might be good okay but then certainly if you 're the actor rolling it and pressing down on it is actually going to compress the clay quite well so it should be okay great so outside 's looking pretty good grace well done all right um so what we want to do is first we want to compress the clay a little bit that 's it so i 'm just using a little wooden tool here but you could just use your hands um or just a flat surface if you have whatever you can find just to smooth it out and that can kind of smooth out those edges without any bumps and if that happens i 'm using her fingers are helpful you can spend a bit of time on that if you wish and i 'm just going to show you as well um if you have a leaf or um or any kind of found objects that sarah was using demonstrating with the shell things like that you can use these to create the patterns i will be using this leaf um later so because i 'm going to make a leaf-shaped dish so if you 's an option but first of all i 'm going to demonstrate using our stencils that we made in the 3d printer so these we made in our makerbot replicator 3d printer and as i said we 'll be able to invite you back in to the maker space next year hopefully we can do a similar workshop and we can create our own style create our own stencils which then you can take home and use for future creations so we have this one here and a smaller version and also if you can see that i 'm not sure if you can see but this was what was it sarah was a piece of fabric in it originally yeah so that 's 3d printed from a basket weave uh pattern you can see the basket weave texture in there that looks beautiful and and you 've actually used that grace in one of your so i used this with my air dry clay creation so i made a little bowl and just pressed the stencil into the pattern into the clay to make this pattern and then i this edge to make it look like kind of fabric-y and i did the same with this little one here so i don 't know if you can see that it 's got that texture to it which is really really effective so we 're going to show you the 3d printed stencils obviously you won 't have those but you could use an old piece of lace if you 've got it or you really anything to imprint across this whole piece of slab that you 've created um and you 'll have the same effect so i think i 'm going to use the large stencil today so if you have a stencil or as i said a leaf or any for a piece of lace like sarah said anything like that just decide how you would like it to look this one is quite big so it 's just going to go straight in the middle um but say i was working with the patterned stencil then i might just haphazardly put it all over the place and just have a more interesting fun design but i stencil and i 'm just going to go over that again with the rolling pin just very gently so that it really secures that imprint now i can see that the clay is coming up through the stencil you would find the same if you were using lace or material you can kind of just get a sense when it 's ready and then sell it cutley whoops we want to remove the stencil this is the tricky part there we go and again the good thing about clay is we can smooth over the edges just with our fingers to fix it up that 's looking pretty good now with my stencil it has these edges here from the square and i don 't want that so i 'm just going to rub that out with my fingers or maybe use my little tool your fingers are great i love you get a lot of um control when you use your fingers the pads with your fingers and again it adds to that hand crafted beautiful kind of feel of the work doesn 't it the other thing you wouldn 't even need you know you don 't have to make it into a bowl you could just let it um dry flat and you could cut around it and then you could dec when you decorate it you could make a little um coaster you like this one you can see oh yes like this this one we made before and it really feels like a tile i could even hang it on the wall you can use the same technique to make gift tags like ornaments anything like that wind chimes has anyone got any specific ideas in mind that they 're trying to bring into creation with their air dry claim you 've been dreaming about making something yeah i am actually saw um grapevine leaves and i thought oh gee that 'd make a nice plate and then um this workshop came up so um i 've got a grapevine leaf oh amazing i can 't wait to see that have you got your grape vine leaf there ready to go yeah i just pressed it overnight yep so that it 's nice and flat i 'm pressing a leaf okay so you 'll be able to see it 's a similar technique it 's very similar to this one actually all right that 's looking great grace beautiful so i 'm just going to blurt out those edges i 'm just focusing on the pattern in the middle and then just going to take a bowl here and you want a bowl that 's slightly smaller than your clay so that you can place it inside you can just use the back of your hand to shape that into the bowl so that you want your clay touching the bottom of the bowl like that and you can just kind of play around until it feels about centered and then we 're just going to trim the edges so i 'll just adjust that a little bit more you can do the same with the leaf or any other kind of any other design any other kind of stencil rather i 'm just going to yeah so the bowl is acting as a mold and will support the clay until it dries and so things about slab building is that if you have a favorite dish or something that you really love you can then use the air dry clay to create another one but personalize it that looks great done really well so i 'm just folding my clay over the edges you can see and i 'm just going to use this little tool um to cut around but you could just use a butter knife or again just your fingers so that might take a little bit longer just to cut off the edges and make it even it 's kind of like making a pie it definitely feels like that i love i love pottery because it 's very slow and meditative and calming hobby makes you feel just really relaxed for a rainy day yeah perfect for a rainy day beautiful how 's everyone else going with their their plates so far have you have you got any questions does anyone have any questions at this stage no that 's okay when you cut off the edges you want to save that so i could make something else out so just put it back into a little bowl and make sure that you cover it up um with some plastic glad wrap or in an airproof container just so that you can use it again i 'm going to need to smooth these edges as well and if you have again just like a kitchen sponge at home you can use that to smooth the edges if you find that you 've scratched it with your nail or anything else and you just want to make it look a little bit more polished you can kind of go around the edges and do that before we set it aside to dry so with air dry clay you want to give it about 24 to 48 hours to dry and once it 's dry you can actually add some paint which we 're going to demonstrate later as well i 'm actually really impressed with how well that 's worked out [Music] that was it 's really worth taking the time at this stage to to smooth the edges because once it 's dry um you really lost that opportunity 'll be happy just to lift it out of your mold um it 's really worth doing that especially on the outside where you you 've cut away the excess clay getting those edges nice and smooth because once it 's dry your bowl is basically finished all you 'll be doing then is decorating it with some paint if you want to and then putting the water-based sealer on it because remember that air-dry clay even when it 's dry it 's not waterproof so we wouldn 't be making anything today with air dry clay that we would be putting water in um if we want to do that we would need to we need to use you know normal clay and fire it in a kiln but there 's lots of applications for air dry clay where you don 't need any uh you don 't need it to be waterproof but the spray will make it water resistant has anyone done pottery themselves at school or just as uh dabbled in it as a hobby so far one person put their hand up yeah humans are um used to do some pottery classes when i was living in japan which was like i don 't know um must be nine years ago now so i haven 't done anything since did you learn any particular techniques um i think most of it was uh wheel throwing oh wonderful um so yeah but it takes a lot of dedication yes uh centering the clay on the wheel is it takes a lot of um skill doesn 't it does gone through lots of uh tries to try and master that myself but i i haven 't yet really got there so i prefer hand building i think yeah the good thing about hand building is you can very easily um as sarah was saying earlier just roll it up into a ball and start again if it hasn 't worked out the way that you planned [Music] yeah there are lots of classes that you can do but um you can learn a lot online as well can 't you there 's so many videos that you can watch this one like this one yes and books actually using a lot of the information that we found i 'll just show just some grace just really good from this book make it with air dry clay fade your winter so this is a book you can borrow at the mosman library and we 've got actually quite a lot of books on uh ceramics hand building yes and yeah some of the ideas that we 're actually showing you today were actually from this book so we should acknowledge that yeah thank you faye thanks faye i might stop fiddling with this one for now i would just set that aside i 'll set that aside for 24 hours to dry and now i 'm going to do a very similar technique but using the leaf so i 've found this large leaf and i 'm actually going to make a dish shaped like the leaf so i 'm starting out the same way by rolling kneading the clay rolling it out flattening it pressing in a stencil design or rather the leaf as my stencil and then and then i 'm actually just going to cut so you can do the same or you could actually just leave the leaf in as an imprint just as a pattern and you could have it as a round shape so whatever you like this one is not clay that i 've made this is a porch place so to make it large enough to be the size of this leaf i 'm going to need it obviously to be a bit bigger than the leaf so i need probably a fair amount of clay i think that 's very good okay you could even use cookie cutters you had some old cookie cutters you no longer used to make biscuits out of you know love hearts you could make um you could use those with your air dry clay put a little hole in them and then they could be an ornament or a tag we love found found objects they 're beautiful because they 're natural who doesn 't want a leaf bowl in there and because we 're using a dry clay just remember that um it can 't get wet so you will just use use my little leaf dish just maybe for jewelry or objects that are not damp chocolates yeah maybe wrapped up coke is safe yes that 's looking good so after a bit of kneading just want to flatten it as much as possible and then again we will use the rolling pin we 've got a piece of canvas that we are rolling our air dry clay on and canvas is a great thing to use under your clay because it absorbs some of the moisture but the clay won 't stick to it but if you don 't have a piece of canvas or anything like that um when i first started out i would just use some some glad wrap really if my bench was getting a bit sticky and uh i just roll my clay between the glass wrap that that seemed to work if you 're finding that your clay is too wet and it 's getting a bit sticky and you can 't peel it off the bench is anyone having any difficulties with the air dry clay sticking to the bench or you 're i was just going to mask as well if the the bowl that we did will it stick to the mold like or will it just pop out when it 's dry it should just pop out when it 's dry because it 's going to separate from the bowl a practice that some people do is to put a piece of glad wrap under or you know plastic recycled you know an old bag or something like that under the clay before you put it into the bowl mold but i 've done both and if you wait long enough the clay will dry and it will just um you might need to release the edges a little bit with a pin tool or like a little knife just kind of separate the edges but if you do wait long enough it will just pop out of the bowl okay great but when i 've been impatient and tried to pull it out too quickly then it 's cracked yeah and that 's the thing about uh pottery is you 've got to get used to things failing uh of thing but um the better the technique um when we 're making it when it 's wet um the better result we 'll have the other thing you might want to think about doing um is when you 're when you 've got your bowl drying is just putting a little bit of plastic around the edges of the bowl because the edges do tend to dry faster than the middle and if you if the clay is drying at different rates that 's why sometimes it will crack it 's not so much a problem with air dry clay um but if you 're a bit worried about that uh just put a little just loosely a piece of cling film over the top all right that looks great so this is about the size that i want i 'm just going to press the leaf so i 'm going to press it um face up because i want the imprint of the leaf there so i 'm just going to place that hopefully in the center smooth it down and then i 'll go over it again 's great it looks great nature makes the best stencils absolutely and that 's free and by putting the leaf with the veins spacing down directly on the clay you 're going to get a better [Music] imprint yeah so you want to be firm but gentle don 't want to tear the leaf but we do want to press hard enough to make a good imprint now if you just wanted to make a round dish then you could remove the leaf at this point and just have that pattern on there and then you could use a bowl like this and press it over to create that round shape if you want to but i 'm going to cut around the leaf and have a leaf-shaped dish so i 'm going to leave the leaf on there and cut around it for now it 's looking pretty good all right i am just going to use this tool what did you say this was called uh i i call it a pen tool but it 's kind of like toothpick really isn 't it yeah you could use just fine i 'm just going to carve around or you could use a knife yeah you could use a knife if you wanted to yeah i think that you get really good um control when you use a little tool that has that that 's just this little shirt if it is a be fine basically you want to draw an outline of the lead isn 't it that 's what you 're aiming for exactly doing good job right and then just remember to save your clay so i like to pull it up in little pieces like that roll it back up and save it for another creation a second leaf bowl a set of two don 't worry if it 's not perfect at this stage so you can neaten it up after you 've removed the leaf but you do want to get it pretty close to the edge if you want it to maintain that shape is anyone following along and doing the a leaf shape or are you just using a leaf as a stencil or if you 've got your own stencils that looks oh cool wow that looks great oh that 's really pretty did you make that [Music] well done that looks fabulous i 've now realized that a grape vine leaf is actually very detailed isn 't it i 'm cutting around it but it 's very um yeah okay well if your word if your clay is thick enough which it probably is um i 'd say it will retain a certain amount of detail but you can if you like just you know go a bit trace more kind of loosely around the leaf shape if you wanted to you could um skip a couple of the details oh yeah if you want to 45 minutes in so i think we 'll have time to just briefly show the sponge painting technique yes before we finish can i just ask what you 're going to do around the stem i 'm just going to take the stem off so i 'm i mean um so you 're just going to do the leaf i 'm just going to have to leave but you could use them if bit too fragile yeah sure okay great thanks i 'll just talk a little bit about sealing your clay while grace is finishing that so sealing your air dry clay um is essential if you want the piece to last for a while and there are a variety of sealing options available and the choice basically depends on the look that you want and what your piece is going to be used for so you 've got the option to do a brush on or spray-on gloss so that would be an acrylic based gloss and it 's used when your piece is dry and it adds a brilliant shine so all um a lot of um air dry clay is when you see it it is being finished with the brush or spray on glosses the other thing you could do is you could just use a waterproof sealer and that protects it from water and heat damage and the information according to the book that we 're using today says that when you 're looking for a waterproof sealer you want to make sure that the label says waterproof and you want to make sure that your piece is completely dry before you seal it and you apply the sealer in a thin layer and then and then let the piece dry before adding a second coat otherwise you might get air bubbles or the piece may become a little bit cloudy because of the moisture that 's still trying to escape from the clay if you would apply too many coats your piece may start to peel over time so the recommendation is just to apply one thin layer at a time and the other thing you could do is you could just use some pva glue in a thin layer kind of like um a decoupage um result there so there 's a few options for sealing your air dry clay when it 's finished all right that 's wonderful i think i 'm going to attempt to very carefully peel the leaf off from this clay if you find that it 's quite stuck you can use a knife or a tool just to separate the two but of course you want to be careful you can see the definition yeah and that will come up if i add some paint to it later as well i 'm just going to smooth the edges a little bit and then i 'm just going to place it over top of a bowl to let it dry and even just a little bit of the sponge would be good just around the edges a nice soft edge so at this stage using a damp sponge is really helpful for retaining the movability i guess of the clay because of course with air dry clay it dries can dry pretty quickly so sometimes using a bit of water can help initially with um creating the shape that you want but once you set it aside to dry ideally in full sun for 24 hours for 48 hours and don 't let it get wet after that i 'm smoothing the edges but i don 't want to go overboard because i don 't want to lose that definition from the leaf so just take your time with the smoothing because as sarah said once it dries we can what we call him we wanted it like that that 's right it says you say if you want something to look perfect just buy it in a store buy a machine made plate we don 't want that i put some plastic on this one because i think that it will assist with removal so yeah if you do have some plastic i think that uh question before was a good one and yes maybe putting a big piece of plastic in between the clay and mold that you 're using will this will help you when it comes time to take it off so we 've just got a piece of old glad wrap that we 've got we 're placing it on top of the bowl and that will be the the clay will then sit on that and then we 'll be able to peel peel it off when the clay is dry if i had a slightly smaller dish i might have turned it this way to rest the um the clay in but just flipping it over like that will give it the shape more of a curve but it 's up to you if you wanted a completely flat leaf then just let it dry on a plate flat surface it 's a little bit stuffed but i just want to be careful so i don 't lose the shape at all well not really you just gotta you just gotta go for it don 't you thank you and we 're going to do it this way yes yeah i think right next to you however you want to yes so i would like this to be facing upward of course so we want the design to be um clear so i 'm going to flip it over so you won 't see the design anymore but i 'll just place it like that to let it dry you just have to trust me that it will look really good when it 's dry and it 's good now that i can see the back i can see that there 's a couple of little floors and i can i still have time before it dries to just very carefully smooth it well we should actually put the finished product on display in the library so that 's a good idea you know you can come in and see [Music] and you 're all welcome to post comments of your creations as well we 'd love to see what you 've what your finished products look like okay i 'm not going to fuss too much because it 's the back i 'm just going to set that aside to dry as well and now we can quickly i think if we have time we can run you through a very simple painting technique as well okay so just very very quickly what we 're going to do is in the book that we 've been using they talk about uh painting techniques and one of the most basic is just to sponge it on and then to wipe it away so you 'll see a bit of that definition so this is one that we made beforehand so it 's just a little mold with the stencil that we 've used and we 're just going to this is just a all i 'm going to do with this is just put a little bit of paint and you can see it 's picking up those lovely stencil marks and there we go and i 'll let that dry and then i will use my i think i 'm just going to use pva um mod podge kind of sealant on this and then i don 't know i think that 's going to go on the desk inside the library and we 'll put our paper clips in it so when you come into the library you can see that uh you can see what we 've made so that 's just a very basic technique uh and and that 's just really um yeah acrylic poster paint uh with a sponge technique there are other techniques in in the book that we 're using but uh there you go well done everyone oh we hope you had a lovely time um and also uh keep an eye out for the the this workshop to be done again next year we 'll do an occasion we can show you how prepared with your own design or you can come in and use one of our templates okay thanks for coming along and we hope everyone has a great day thank you so much [Music] you _"

you this evening my name is kelly mcdonald and as many of you know i 'm new to the role of assistant gallery director and senior curator here at mossman art gallery and i 'm very much looking forward to meeting you all in person when the health orders allow i would like to also welcome our director john cheeseman who is joining us via zoom this evening we welcome guests from the mossman art gallery donor circle this asia the asian asian art society of australia and the trustees of the gordon darling foundation who have generously supported the beautiful okachara exhibition catalogue there are over 100 of you joining us from afar from as far afield as cact south australia and singapore this evening we are delighted to be joined by dr john uac a distinguished philanthropist pediatrician and cultural leader as well as the exhibition curator dr siobhan campbell of sydney they will be giving us insights into the exhibition ul pachara ceremonial art from the southeast asia from southeast asia which is drawn from the collection of dr yu and the late dr george sousa am this exhibition follows on from 2014 's encounters with bali which featured a spectacular selection of indonesian textiles upachara revised at six textiles now part of the muslim art gallery permanent collection alongside a wider selection of ceremonial and functional objects from across southeast asia which speak to dr yu 's interest in the ancient trade routes and connections of the region though indonesia has been an important place for collecting these objects spill over the boundaries of the modern southeast asian nation states we know today the exhibition features basketry textiles ceramics and objects in bronze wood terracotta and silver this exhibition at once highlights the interconnected nature of art traditions across the region and the unparalleled virtuosity and stylistic variety of functional everyday and ritual objects i 'm delighted to hand over to dr siobhan campbell thank you kelly tonight i 'm very honored to be talking to you about exhibition with the collector dr john yu i do want to say a few words about the background to upachara as this is actually the second exhibition staged at mossman art gallery to be curated from dr u 's private collection of southeast asian art and antiquities as kelly mentioned upachara was conceived as a sister exhibition to follow the highly successful 2014 encounters with bali also staged here at mosman now this focused on indonesia 's rich textile traditions and taking the island of bali as a gateway from where john as a collector was initially fascinated by the beauty of the textiles themselves and then over many years took pleasure in discovering the inventiveness and creativity of the women who wove them besides showcasing the incredible diversity of indonesia 's textiles in that exhibition we really wanted to highlight john 's direct experience of the living nature of the cultures that produced these textiles or in other words that john while having a great appreciation for antiquity and the indi inspired cultures of southeast asia has never privileged antiquity and opulence over his passion for accomplishment and creativity lamak which were a key feature of the earlier exhibition and hopefully you 'll be able to see an example here now with the stylized form of the female figure appliqued onto a base of red cotton cloth and i 'll return a little bit later when we look at the textiles selected for upachara now to our immense excitement the exhibition encounters with bali was then developed for international tour to the museum textile in jakarta in 2018. and it was a great privilege not to mention incredibly daunting to take these textiles back to their country of origin and the incredible reception by the indonesian audiences confirmed your news collection to be one of the great private collections of indonesian textiles outside of indonesia these images i 'm showing you now are from the opening of the exhibition in jakarta and on that note i would like to ask john to say a few words about the previous exhibition and particularly the experience of taking his collection to indonesia uh thanks siobhan uh i think the exciting thing is that the show was mounted at the textile museum and i think for you to appreciate that what we showed there were textiles from indonesia itself but a collection put together by two australian collectors based in mossman and shown at the invitation of the textile museum an exhibition supported by the australian embassy in jakarta i think it highlights the importance of art and culture in learning about our new neighbours and hopefully to understand more how they think and why they do things but to know about the social factors the sort of beliefs the sort of traditions that determine the way they behave and uh i like to think that australia is an even better neighbor when we understand more about the internations i think that in the coming years uh indonesia is going to be more and more important to us and as part of being a good neighbour to them we owe it to them to learn about what they do how they think and how they live but it was great fun taking it there and we were all very very proud and and i think it was great seeing the exhibition hung i know to understand the importance of the curator 's eye in choosing pieces and that 's siobhan and her expertise in the area and her ability with language made an enormous difference at the success of that exhibition so thank you svaughn thanks john so in the previous encounters exhibition we focused on the textiles now in upachara we 're presenting a much broader range of works from across southeast asia including basketry textiles ceramics and objects in bronze terracotta wood and silver from around the 10th century to the present broadly speaking the treasures assembled in this collection have been dictated very much by john 's changing tastes and interests as a collector beginning in the late 1970s annual visits to bali were an opportunity to acquire other objects from across the indonesian archipelago and attesting to the archipelago 's role as a major centre of international trade many of the early pieces that john acquired from sites in indonesia drove his subsequent explorations of the art traditions of the philippines thailand vietnam laos and myanmar now unquestionably john has has the sense of dedication of a true or interest in the subject and frequently an emotional connection with the works he buys john i want to begin by talking about the baskets this was unquestionably an aspect of your collection that we were both very keen to showcase um for the main reason that southeast asia is one of the most prolific areas for the production of basketry but it does seem like the artistry as well as the function and meaning of baskets has not been given a great deal of attention in scholarly accounts or in museum settings this is not to say that the exquisite design and exceptional quality has been overlooked but in addition to looking at basketry and map making as a fine art there are often similarities in the designs of textiles and baskets though not all basket producing areas have strong textile traditions the materials used are often common across the region bamboo rattan pandanus and lonta but are also complemented by locally sourced materials such as particular species of fern used in the village of tanganan in east bali that you can see in this example on the screen use of basketry is virtually endless while for ceremonial use beetle boxes and bags are a common form why are the baskets so special to you and where do they all come from as you said baskets are something that is everywhere but most of us actually don 't see them and the first time i went to bali it 's the first time i saw rice growing in a paddy field and i was lucky enough to the first paddy field i went to to see them harvesting the rice and once i was fascinated by that what i saw were baskets bowl baskets everywhere they were used in in collecting the rice then we use the whole the various tools used in the harvesting they were used to hold the food for the workers they were used as something important in ceremonies such as weddings and i suddenly realized that we often see things that we like but we dismiss them because we think they 're just ordinary utilitarian objects but some utilitarian objects are really very beautiful and if you stop and look at them you can the basket maker and i think this example from bali is a really wonderful example of how beautiful and how well made and expertly made a basket can be but you know this is one of my favorite baskets an ordinary carrying basket from lombok the basketry tradition is pretty widespread throughout ireland and mainland southeast asia and it 's not always easy to ascribe a particular area from which a basket might have come but uh i don 't think that matters as long as you like it and that 's the nice thing about not being a public museum i can buy what i like as long as i can afford it it doesn 't really matter and as long as i know that it 's correct and has a reasonable provenance and it hasn 't been stolen thanks thank you john on that i 'd like to jump uh to the ceramics and begin with your interest in northern thailand and particularly the kyon sites that you have visited um quite frequently over the past decade or so i know this uh covered bowl from the sukhothai as the celadon wears made uh by the so uncle kilns could you say something about these yeah i started collecting ceramics 18th century english then i became interested in chinese but uh as most collectors will tell you chinese ceramics very rapidly got out of most of the budgets of the average collector this one is from thailand sukhothai it 's wonderful in that it 's a metal shape and it 's the short shape you find not only in asia but in the middle east this one from sukhitai has i think a wonderful proportions if you look at the knob the lid the bowl itself it 's exquisitely fashioned and the form is really very satisfying the drawing is with an iron pigment a very stylized form as you often find in southeast asian ceramics but it 's black brown and you don 't find cobalt used in thailand or in any part of southeast asia excepting vietnam and if you see something that 's said to be thai and it 's blue and white cobalt then it 's not tied the if you look at that a clay slim and of course southeast asia did not produce porcelain and that the clay body often wasn 't that smooth beautiful homogeneous material that you get in chinese porcelain often the clay body and you can see at the foot rim what it looks like is really not very attractive and it needs to be hidden with a slip in much the same way as you get in delft where fans and all those other low-fi ceramics where the potter didn 't have access to the wonderful clay and the centuries of techniques of purifying that clay that you get in chinese porcelain these ceramics the man on the left uh swankalock very near sukhothai about the same period but it shows that a lot of the ceramics produced on a large commercial scale actually produced a lot of things on private commission this almost certainly was private commission presumably a monk with his fan the other ceramics next to it the top one is swank lock again once again with the chinese shape this time below it is a flask and a bowl from arguably the most comes from a area where there are a lot of hot springs presumably at some stage volcanic activity so their clay is different and tanong ceramics are probably the finest and the most careful and well potted ceramics of northern china i can 't see the others of course now let 's um let 's move on to the uh cambodian examples yes these are the two forms that are really interesting uh they 're cambodian well let 's say they 're from the anchorian tradition because whether they 're potted in cambodia or nearby thailand and there 's just a river separating them it 's really hard to be sure but the one on the left has this wonderful watery glaze that you tend to find in the ceramics in the hill areas on the western part of cambodia the one on the right is interesting because the tree uh this form is really quite common in cambodia and at first i used to think it was uniquely cambodian until i saw a lot of ceramics being excavated from southern china from mainly guangdong province and there were all once again just be a little bit careful in assuming the things that people tell you based on today 's knowledge because with the extraordinary amount of excavations taking place in china we 're learning more and more and often they 're telling us some of our early ideas weren 't right thanks john i 'm just um giving the audience a sense here of the range of ceramics displayed in the exhibition but another part of your collection that i think really exemplifies your collecting ethos is the terracotta art from the medio evil javanese kingdom of majapahit centered in east java between the uh 13th and 15th centuries now often regarded as inferior to the sculptural art of bronze stone or gold the use of terracotta was a defining feature of this very prosperous dynasty not only was it used to make the bricks for the construction of palace and temple complexes but for ornamental figures including for instance this very charming pot belly bald bald figure on the bottom right hand of your screen possibly an incense holder and the beautiful head figure above it and of the terracotta well my tastes have always been biased towards folk art and just as in my early life i never collected chelsea derby and when it came to figures i always collected staffordshire when it comes to asian figures i really like earthenware and terracottas i like the folkiness of them but i like the way that it 's possible uh to show facial features and forms which are not always easy in high thyroid porcelain or earthenwares they 're also used um say the the line of six heads uh i find fascinating uh i believe they 're from the march part period but look at the chinese faces of the guy on the far left and the guy in the center i guess this illustrates how the chinese are pretty ubiquitous and where there 's money to be made i think you 'll find the chinese but terracotta is something that interests a lot of people and [Music] next week or the week after anne proctor is going to speak about the terracottas and the earthenwares particularly from sumatra anna 's been interested in this area for we can learn i know very little about them i don 't even know where a lot of these came from but presumably their javanese that funny little figure in the center is from sulawesi on his left are figures that are probably from summer but all those islands made their own characteristic ceramics and uh i think even now our attributions they will shown to be wrong when we learn much more about it but it 's something that is fascinating and by and large within the range of most people if you like collecting as you travel thanks john i 'd like to move on to the textiles now and earlier i mentioned the balinese shrine hangings being particularly special we were very fortunate to be able to hang them at full height in the gallery space here alongside several of the temple banners from thailand and lao and part of their charm is the signs of wear and i think the fact that they 've been used by the people who made them as well as the incredible displays of individual creativity in each piece john i um evocative for you and led you to start collecting them could you um talk a little bit about this please yes i i love temple hangings i love banners and as you know siobhan does as well and a lot of lamack were chosen for in the exhibition encounters with bali i was fortunate to go through thailand with a very good friend of mine who is thai and his thai speaking so that as we moved around he was able to talk to people particularly monks and we went to some pretty small towns so we saw these banners not only in temples but also being carried in processions as people i guess uh wanted to share their devotion uh in the way that you 'll see uh in europe particularly in the roman catholic faith but they 're different by and large to bali in that the figures don 't often show i 'm sorry the banners don 't often show figures except in the ones from eastern tainan and lao and these are usually woven but what i find fascinating about them is the figures themselves are very similar to the ones you find on tampan and uh oh having a name block um and down down in the south sumatra and if you follow these figures then you can actually trace the movement of this three vagina traders from south china through lao cambodia right down into indonesia itself and it 's one of the fascinating things that you can get lost by pursuing some other aspect particularly trade routes and traditions but i think it 's always wonderful to see objects that people have made to praise their own god because so often they show and demonstrate a folk belief which is not always easily seen in other more sophisticated forms but yeah i agree the hanes are wonderful and i hope people will have the opportunity of coming to the gallery and i understand we open next week and seeing them for themselves thank you john i think i mean i could continue asking you um more questions about various aspects of your collection and the exhibition um and i will say there 's quite a captivating glow about you that um really know members of the audience will have questions for you and so we 're very happy uh if the participants would like to use the chat function and we can respond to your questions so um while we 're waiting um for any questions from the audience um john i might just take you back to the very first the balinese hanging um with the red background which became the sort of theme for the encounters exhibition and um for you to talk about that because this piece is um has such a range of textile techniques in it we have a very fine socket um panel across the bottom and then the sort of applique along the top what i find most fascinating in this piece is the applique figure because it 's the very naive nature of it that is appealing what was interesting in encounters with bali in indonesia is how interested the indonesians were in the islamic and how little exposure they had had to them i bought this piece from a dealer a general antique dealer in bali in fact the guy that i think but it was just amongst a pile of other textiles and he was actually curious when i bought it because he said oh the workmanship 's not very fine but what he couldn 't see as a dealer is what a collector might find absolutely fascinating uh in the concepts of the creator thanks john um now we 've got a few questions here um and there are some questions about the terra cotta but just while we 're still looking at this banner um marilyn darling is asking whether these banners are still made or whether it 's a lost technique well thank you marilyn and might i say that a lot of barley and some thailand was seen with marilyn and her late husband gordon have been such generous supporters of indonesia thailand and are generally in australia uh yes maryland the when you go to thailand uh particularly in the north of thailand you still see them used very extensively and there is a really large uh now i 've had name block of what they call tung in the exhibition where i actually met the guy older guy but who is much younger than me and he said to me i 'm pleased you 're taking that because it 's the last one i made and it 's the last one i will make because and he showed me his hands he said i 've got arthritis and i can 't do it now. but it is living out and that 's the great thing about so much of southeast asia the traditional ancient art is still living john we 're now jumping to um questions about the terracotta from um michelle uh belgiano hi um firstly what were the small terracotta figures used for um i assume that 's the uh sort of six head figures on the top of the screen now uh i don 't know anne proctor might be able to tell me much more about it but the other ones are i suspect of fertility figures the ones of the six heads along the top of the screen i suspect were probably commissioned as portraits but i don 't really know and uh with an audience such as the one we for the sake of giving an answer you know shivano yeah well all i could add to that is that um they 're very com i mean they 're found in great numbers and they 're um the figures always have um the decapitated heads which then um leads people to speculate that um somehow removing them had the heads was a part of um ritual but um again it 's open to a great deal of speculation but they 're certainly like the range of different figures or character types um found in um sites around troll run or the center of the major pirate kingdom is really um captivating uh thanks michelle uh then that 's interesting shivan because a lot of the figures you find from swunkalok in thailand the heads are knocked off as part of the way of protecting them and to the extent that if you find a figure with the head intact then you really need to look carefully at it because there are very very few old figures with the heads still intact they 're nearly always matched together sometimes mismatched now going across to borneo and liz uh has asked bernard seleto has edited a book um planted arts from the borneo rainforest i know you have that book in your library and she says i notice that quite a few of the baskets are made in borneo yes it 's interesting uh that a lot of baskets particularly some of the really sophisticated ones come from people with a head-hunting tradition um i don 't know why but as you point out the big um matt 's basketry mats are all borneo very exquisite figures you see a pair of in this image from borneo i guess when you have long periods of the year when it 's raining very heavily and you have to stay in your longhouses i know that 's the time when a lot of cotton weaving takes place in the poor 's uh but i suspect it might be the time when a lot of the very fine basketry takes place as well but i don 't know that very heavy book siobhan you might have looked at it better than i have well i and malaysian part of the island are the most famous across the region perhaps you might include the some of the filipino baskets as being of you know similar um you know expertise and range but i mean unquestionably this is um yeah incredible basket-making traditions um michelle belgium has asked as well as whether the skill of basketry john has been kept alive or where the woven baskets have been replaced by plastic carrying bags well luckily basketry is still alive uh and i 've certainly seen very recently uh baskets from borneo from kalimantan which are new very new often using old design but the baskets themselves are clearly you and by and large not as carefully made or as detailed as the old baskets i guess people don 't have as much time today i 'll also point out that i mean this basket on the screen now is a contemporary basket this is not um an old piece is it john you uh it 's about 10 years old yeah so that 's um you know there are but um not all of the baskets and have got contemporary pieces and we have some contemporary buttock as well in the exhibition john another question can you tell us a little about the broken fired plates in the exhibition sorry i didn 't touch it the broken um fired plates or the kiln wasters that we 've included in there oh yes exhibition they killing wasters i think the ones in the exhibition are all uh from super support but i i always like having broken ceramics because it gives people a good idea of what the body looks like but i think it 's fun having a great pile of plates that have all been melted and as fused to each other because kids really like it and i hope younger people will come and look at the exhibition because i think it 's the sort of things they can understand i always buy broken things when i can find them firstly they 're cheaper than things are intact but secondly they kill you a lot more and john we 're going back to another question i can see here um how are the old terracotta wondering whether we 've done dating on them no we haven 't but a lot of one of the reasons that we can date them um or is because of their um having such close association with the majapahit kingdom which was i suppose the last hindu buddhist empire of java a lot of these traditions moved across and maintained on the island of bali but the islamic art which came to java after my japan is often quite different so a lot of this dating is based on stylistic reasons i suppose but john you might like to add something yes except that um those six heads all came from the same dealer uh daeng iskandar in bali dang has been in in the trade for i guess 40 or 50 years and i 've been dealing with him for about 30 years but he 's somebody i trust and he had a big pile and he said to me those are old these are not so old those in you and if i took something from i knew he 'd always hate me you sure you want that and a developed eye and the tactile sense of handling it makes an enormous difference and i almost would believe daeng and his judgment more than i would with carbon dating or whatever other new technique people are using today thank you i can 't see any more questions here i think i hope we 've responded i think i hope we 've responded to everyone adequately on behalf of john and myself i would like to thank you um for listening to our our conversation we 've been very excited to come back into the gallery after a break and to talk about some of the choices we made in the exhibition we 're very much hoping that we 'll be able to meet with some of you in person over the coming weeks and yes sorry sorry i just added i hope uh people will come and look at the exhibition soon because once it 's open you never know what 's going to happen next week or next month whether we 've got a new premiere or not and all i mean is cove it 's unpredictable john and now uh i 'll hand back over to kelly from lostman art gallery great um at this point please feel free to turn your cameras back on if you would like to uh it 's lovely for us to see our community okay that was such a beautiful and insightful conversation john i loved your description of the banners as living art so thank you john and siobhan and for everyone for joining us this evening and thank you john for your support of mossman art gallery it is thanks to donors such as john that we are able to deliver inspiring exhibitions and programming here at mosman art gallery we are excited to be developing a new exhibition program that celebrates our collection and brings the work of incredible artists the people of moscon and sydney i look forward to meeting you all in person in coming months under government guidelines the gallery will be reopening on monday the 11th of october so please do make the time to visit okachara ceremonial art from southeast asia which will be on display until the 12th of december hopefully major exhibition destination sydney the natural world which features works by janet lawrence caroline rothwell and robin stacy it celebrates sydney as a site of art making and its incredible natural environment and we can 't wait to welcome you all so thank you john and siobhan and thank you all for joining us this evening and we can 't wait to see you all soon at mossdemon art gallery _"

    "text": "i 'd like to issue all a warm welcome it 's very very good to see so much enthusiasm for climate change initiatives in the community and a warm welcome to councillor bendel uh and a warm welcome to you all so this is mossman council 's community consultation workshop on mitigation there 's going to be two more workshops to follow this one on adaptation and the other one on futures so it 's lovely to see you here i 'm dr ruth irwin i 've been working for mossman council for about four or five months now doing the lead on climate change since mossman council declared a climate emergency in november 2019. my background is in climate change and social transitions i 'm very interested in both the science and how we start to as a community engage and and reduce our emissions and figure out how we live a life a modern life that doesn 't create climate change so that 's my background i wrote my phd on that about 20 odd years ago and i 've been mostly teaching in university setting ever since is where you know the rubber hits the road so this is actually a really satisfying job for me because it 's where things actually engage in a very meaningful real manner so what i 'm going the way that this workshop is going to work is i will talk to some degree to begin with about climate change and the science and the policy background that 's going to be very interactive so you feel free to you know wave your hand at me and i 'll engage and then we 're going to do some workshopping so you as small groups will be thinking about mitigation projects and the process of i 'll lead you through a process and that 's going to come up with some data and that 's what the council is going to take away and make sure that we include in our strategic planning so that 's the idea of this two-hour workshop okay so to start off with here is a very interesting graph this is using ice core sampling and from the antarctic so basically what they 've done is they ice cores going back 800 000 years to make this graph which has a very accurate rendition of how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere and how warm the planet was so you can see that there are two lines there the the top line the blue one is about what we call parts per million volume of carbon dioxide emissions equivalent in the atmosphere and the bottom line is the temperature of antarctica at the time that there was that much emissions in the atmosphere so you can see that it 's got a very close correlation between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet and if you go right to the very end of the graph you can see where we are right now so right today we are at 416 parts per million volume and the last time we were at 416 or even anywhere above 400 parts per million volume was when the dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the pleistocene period so it 's a very serious situation that we 're in again this is uh this is just balloons into the upper stratosphere and they measure how much carbon dioxide is in the very top stratosphere of the atmosphere and you can see that the little pink line goes up and down up and down when it 's at its peak that 's in the northern hemisphere summer and that 's when industrial relate you know industrial movements in the northern hemisphere is more intense and winter people tend to calm down and do less and so you 'll find that it 's higher in the northern hemisphere summer than it is in the northern hemisphere winter so that 's why it goes up and down to that degree and you can see that despite all efforts the amount of carbon dioxide is accumulating i think that 's a really important thing to know because we talk quite a lot about how my how many emissions we 've put out this year but what people fail to realize is that it 's accumulating year on year on what has gone before and so the earth is capable of absorbing a certain amount of carbon dioxide through through the also the microbes in the soil so those are the three ways in which the planet actually absorbs carbon dioxide back and turns it back into carbon but that 's a very small amount compared to the amount that we are emitting into the atmosphere so it 's accumulative and some of the gases that we put into the atmosphere take well over a thousand years to come back out again i 'm just going to go through this one very briefly but that just gives you an idea of the kinds of gases that are out there and the extent to which they are out there so the bottom one carbon dioxide is basically from fossil fuels that 's coal petrol diesel that sort of thing and the blue line you can see 1990 is the line in the sand that when we all joined the kyoto protocol 1990 was the benchmark year we were all supposed to be 20 below 1990 levels by 2020 and instead we are 43 above 1990 levels at this point in time and actually that graph was made in 2018 so it 's workshop and i just wanted to make it really you know that we were clear about the difference between mitigation and adaptation so we 'll go over adaptation in the next workshop mitigation is just reducing the amount of gas reducing the emissions it 's pretty simple so it 's not adapting to the new norm it 's not adapting to a heating world we 'll deal with that in the next workshop this one is how can we reduce the emissions that we put into the atmosphere and the other part of mitigation is that there are some greenhouse sinks in other words the more trees we plant or the more seagrass that we allow to grow they will help to absorb carbon dioxide so there 's two kind of elements to mitigation one is reduce emissions and the other is plant more trees now this is a very very important graph and i 'm going to leave it up when we have our discussion a bit later on so greenhouse gas there is only a small number of greenhouse gases it 's not all gases and these are you can see so normally when you see a graph about greenhouse gases it will be carbon dioxide equivalence equivalence just to kind of make it easy to understand but you can see that some of those gases there are actually much more potent greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is bad enough but methane for example is at least 28 times worse than carbon dioxide nitrous oxide 265 times worse than carbon dioxide hydrofluorocarbons which are the gases that you have in refrigerating and air conditioning units are twelve and a half thousand times worse than one kilo of carbon dioxide um perfluorocarbons sixteen thousand times worse and nitrogen trifluoride 17 000 times worse so what happens is normally when you see a graph that talks to you about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or greenhouse gases it 's it 'll have a little e at the bottom of it it 'll say co2e the equivalent means that they 've got run through and made a an equation to make it equal to one liter of carbon dioxide i think the the closest table we 've got to mean those other gases are much um smaller that the emissions of those gases is much less yeah but the reactivity is much higher i think one of the reasons that it 's important to know about this table is there are lots and lots of things that we can do to reduce our emissions and sometimes people don 't realize just how significant something quite that seems fairly minor like you know turning your air conditioning unit down or even off makes a massive difference because air conditioning units use hydrofluorocarbons which are 12 and a half thousand times worse than carbon dioxide so you know or refrigeration is the same i keep walking into supermarkets and the mossman area and seeing these open refrigerating units and freaking out about every time i see one because you know i know that that 's what 's going on so we 'll come back to that i 'm going to leave that slide up because i think it could help to inform you know what we might want to be thinking about when we have our discussion so i haven 't but i do want to just touch on a few things so cle you probably mostly have heard of the paris agreement um the paris agreement followed the kyoto agreement so the kyoto agreement came to an end in 2020 and the paris agreement was to set up a new protocol australia has committed to the paris agreement but it has made one of the weakest commitments of any other nation in the world so australia has agreed to 28 reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. most of the rest of the world are aiming at about net zero by 2050 at the outside at the very very outside so not 25 to 28 but zero by just a decade or two later the ipcc um again if you 're in this field then you need to know about the ipcc so that 's the intergovernmental panel on climate change and they are funded by the united nations and the world meteorological society together and what they do is every seven years they bring together all the scientific data that 's happened in the previous seven years across any part and they collate it all together into one enormous report they 're very conservative actually they don 't tend to go for sort of outlier bits of science so you have to bear in mind that when you read the ipcc what you 're reading is a very conservative document but they are the go-to for what 's happening in terms of climate change around the world and the ipcc last year produced a new report where they said that 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels of global temperature which doesn 't sound like a lot but that 's the average across the entire planet 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is extremely dangerous and the politicians have been using two degrees so they 've been using two degrees as a goal up until last year and what the ipcc is saying is that that is beyond the pale dangerous so at 1.5 degrees we 're likely to lose something like 50 percent of species around the world at 1.5 degrees at 2 degrees you 're looking at you know an extinction level that 's almost well we don 't know there that takes place um yeah so right now we are between 1 and 1.1 degrees higher on average than pre-industrial levels and actually just to let me um come back very quickly to this one so this shows you the pre-industrial terrain and what you can see i mean what i would normally say is that parts per million volume so right now we 're at 416 parts per million volume i would usually say on average before the industrial revolution the parts per million volume are 280 and that 's safe that 's perfectly safe that 's just the natural ebb and flow of the planet and there are many ways in which the planet varies climatically normally it 's a you can see that it 's a cycle it 's cyclic and i can go into a lot of detail about that if you want me to but perhaps not in this venue but you can actually see from that that 280 parts per million volume is the top of the range it 's not the average of the range it 's the top of the range so to 416 in 200 years it 's unprecedented and it 's extreme it 's very very extreme right um so i wanted to come you know from the global down to australia so as i said before one of the problems with australia is that the federal government have not been very keen to make binding referenda so they have joined the paris agreement but they haven 't really been particularly keen on really leading the climate policy and climate initiative but you can see here that the various different states in australia um have in some cases anyway created targets that the federal government hasn 't yet themselves really created so you can see that there are three states that are well above well beyond where we are in new south wales in fact five tasmania south australia people have to help me because i 'm not australian so act is what 's a canberra canberra i was getting a bit lost there um and new south wales is kicking off and and is actually kicking off very quickly and there 's no reason why we need to stay actually really make things move very quickly once we 've decided to do it and we have decided to do it so that 's where we are at the moment but we 're not going to stay there long this is again a very technical slide and i don 't want to spend too much time here unless you really want me to but the way that we do the way that we measure greenhouse gases is scope 1 scope 2 and scope three now scope one is very easy to have direct impact on scope one is what you do it 's whether you jump in your car and go for a drive or not it 's whether you book a flight or not so scope 1 is very much about your own actions scope 2 and 3 are the sort of the the background emissions that are embedded in things like your power so you may turn on the switch you know you have control over whether or not to turn the air conditioner unit on or off but once you do turn the air conditioner unit on uses coal or you belong to a power company that uses renewables that 's scope 2 so again you do have some control over that because you can change power company and scope 3 is what you might call the circular economy so that 's the carbon emissions that are embedded in things like if you 're thinking about the car you know the car is made of rolled steel the steel has to be mined from the ground it has to be smelted it has to be rolled and then it gets turned into a car carcass right a body the body of the car all of those things involve emissions so those emissions are embedded in anything you buy whether it be a pound of butter a car clothing anything you buy has got emissions that are embedded in it and there are a whole lot of things in which you might not even think about emissions so for example we turn on our computer immediately we 're using power that 's involving emissions the computer itself has got a whole lot of emissions that are embedded in are all scope three and that 's to do with the circular economy and i would i kind of want to go into the circular economy a little bit because i think it 's going to be increasingly important the circular economy so the circular economy the idea is that you pay attention to the process of any particular article that you might buy on the marketplace from its inception from its design to its to the mining that create that a net you know gets the materials that it 's made from to the process that it goes into to actually make that article to the transportation so for example this is made in china then it has to jump on a on a ship and get here that involves a whole lot of carbon emissions and then there 'll be carbon emissions and distributing it throughout australia and then what do we do so you use it for a number of years what happens when it 's you know dead can you strip it out can you take the various bits of highly valuable metal out of this or not so it all comes down to the design so that so the circular economy is cradle to cradle the idea is there is no grave all right so at the moment what we have is cradle to grave production and it just goes into the landfill well everybody knows that landfill is very very very problematic now particularly because china no longer takes our rubbish so we 're having to fill our own landfill and that landfill creates a lot of emissions in the rotting down of some of the stuff plus there 's a lot of toxic material in something like a laptop and that toxic material is actually very valuable so you can reuse it if you design it properly so that you can access the materials back out of it again so the circular economy is cradle to cradle design and the idea is that increasingly we will be able to monitor and account for all of the emissions at every point along that process that production process so that 's scope three at the moment it 's very difficult to do but there 's to make it much more transparent right so this is australian emissions you can see here that electricity in australia is a huge source of emissions now i 'm from new zealand you wouldn 't have a graph like that in new zealand because most of the electricity in new zealand is made from renewables it 's hydro or it 's [Music] natural heat thermo heat but the reason it 's so high here is because most of the electricity generation is from coal so i think that 's one of the things to bear in mind uh that 's the most obvious one and there 's a lot of things up there that don 't really impact on mossman so we 'll get to mossman oh this is uh this is the projection this is emissions projections based on current policy so the the green line there is what will happen if we just continue with current policy that 's at federal level um and the yellow dotted line is what the ipcc are suggesting is very very important is to come down to net zero by thirty so climate change this is mossman 's emissions and you can see that residential emissions make up by far the bulk almost 70 percent of emissions in this local authority that 's because we don 't have heavy industry in mossman so most of the emissions is coming from various different residential areas and that means is a good thing because we can do a lot about it so the council had a council meeting in july and have agreed to a target of net zero by 2030 for the council and what we will be talking about today is net zero an aspirational target for the community of net zero by 2040. so that 's 20 years to bring down emissions in the residential part of the community and the commercial partner so the mossman council has its own operations it 's like a big organization within this area and because we so the council so for example this building here is a council building and it is has quite a lot of emissions coming from this particular building so the council has said that they will reduce the emissions because the schools don 't belong to the council the schools belong to the schools so the schools will be in that non-residential 30 percent there their emissions are part of that so the council is going to do a whole lot of things to encourage other organizations as well as the residents within mossman to reduce emissions so for example we have a few things that we 've been doing with schools solar my schools putting helping the schools uh put solar panels on the roof and at the moment we 've got a a little enterprise which is called climate cleaver which is an app that the schools can use and they the app helps show them it 's an analysis of where their emissions are and so they can use that analysis and the kids get involved at the whole idea is that it involves the entire school community and they can identify what will bring their emissions down and and schools are actually um really making good use of this app and bringing down their power bills so it helps save the money and it also definitely be taking a leading role in all of that but that 's quite different from the organization of the council which is directly responsible for specific emissions that the organisation creates 55 electricity 38 transport 10 waste and gas i 'm we 're just about to have a look at some of resilient sydney 's data so they 've got a lovely map which we 'll show you in a sec which does make a bit of a comparison between mossman and the other suburbs in sydney and what you 'll see is that mossman 's definitely not the worst there 's other areas of sydney which are got higher per capita emissions so this is um you can see the map there the red is the worst right so the redder it is the work the higher the emissions per capita are per capita means per um household basically or per person per household and mossman 's not too bad so it 's 10.8 tonnes per person per year that 's come down actually so australia used to be 15 tons per person per year which was one third worst in the world so we 're not exactly we don 't have a lot to celebrate yet but on the other hand we have a lot of low-hanging fruit it 's going to be quite easy to reduce yeah and some one part of the reason why some of these other wards are higher is because that 's where the industrial areas are so it 's a little bit duplicitous for us to take you know credit for mossman somehow being much better than other areas given that that 's where the industrial areas are and it 's not in mossman so you really just because three quarters of the emissions and mossman is residential you 're not comparing apples with apples yep yep so although those emissions are coming from some of these other areas these industrial emissions we the mossman people are definitely benefiting from all the emissions that are happening in those other areas so it 's you know i 'm this is the thing that happens whenever you do data with climate change it 's always problematic you always have to look at what looking at co2 equivalence or whether you 're looking at specific gases can make quite a big difference and you know what 's getting counted and what 's being left out so those carbon calculate calculators are really good um but they are quite arduous for people to put everything in you have to take basically get your power bill and feed in everything from your power bill into a carbon calculator but if you want to do that for your household it 's a very useful way of understanding exactly where your emissions are but we 've so the council has just made a partnership with climate cleaver which is the app that i was just talking about in relation to schools and we are making it available to all the households in mosman at half price which is 15 a year 1650 a year and it 's a fantastic app you know it 's it 's really user-friendly so it 's one of these carbon calculators but it 's a very detailed one and it 's quite exciting you know you get to see what your emissions have few really good tips how you can reduce emissions in your household and then you get to see the benefits of that really quickly and immediately so i 'd fully recommend that you jump on the website and we 've made a link and that link will give you this half price access to this app and it 's it 's fun and it 's good it 's a good learning curve too because it helps teach people in your family to switch off and things like that i 'm refraining from putting up slides about all the various different ways in which emissions show up in our daily lives but i think this one is really quite good because it shows you how much emissions are involved in driving a car and so i know that there 's been quite a lot of enthusiasm for electric vehicles in mossman which is good you can see that electric vehicles produce a little bit less emissions than an ordinary car um but they 're probably on a par like if you have a small petrol vehicle as opposed to an electric 't get too swept up with the idea that electric cars reduce an enormous amount yes it does it does absolutely so if you 're getting your altruist yep yeah if you 're getting your electricity from a coal-based electricity power station you 're not really saving very much tool um if you do it getting it if you 're lucky enough to get it from renewables and unfortunately sydney 's not well served by renewables yet um and then i think one of the things to really i really struck me anyway with this graph is that public transport whether it be popular or unpopular public transport is vastly less emissions than any kind of private vehicle so it 's kind of worth remembering that and of course in the days of covert it 's more difficult than ever to use public transport this is basically if all the ice from antarctica and greenland slides off into the ocean we get a seven meter sea level rise and uh sydney 's fairly you know rocky and quite steep so it 's probably not going to be as badly off be completely underwater bangladesh will be completely underwater so when we 're thinking about australia warming you also need to bear in mind that there 's 300 million people living in bangladesh and they will be swimming and they have to swim somewhere so you know there 'll be a lot of climate refugee movement that 's already taking place and it will be getting worse you _"

    "text": "good morning everyone welcome to monday matters from barry o 'keefe library our special guest today is dr claudia anna brandau who has conducted sessions for us here in mossman over many years we are delighted to have her back for her presentation this morning via zoom anna is a fully qualified feng shui consultant and conducts classes and workshops in mindfulness meditation for businesses and private clients today as part of our mental health program i 'm delighted to introduce dr anna brandau and this session will be recorded to view at a later time thanks anna good morning everyone thanks jane so it 's a pleasure to be a virtually at the mosman library again so welcome everyone i will not be able to see many of you so i hope the um the sound is good for you so as jane said my name is anna i 've been teaching meditation for um i think 13 years now and i 've taught meditation in courses uh around sydney for many years and now i 'm sort of slowing down of course with the lockdowns and last year library in canter down which is a lovely spot so um so before that i worked as a scientist um so my background is originally marine science i was an oceanographer for 20 years and so i got a scholarship to come to australia to do a phd at the university of tasmania so i 'm half tasmanian i lived there for 12 years and um it 's a wonderful place and very conducive for meditation of all the fresh air and their great nature there so i started meditation by being pushed into a retreat by a dear friend um in 2004 before that i was you know asked all a sort of meditation but you know i had a little boy by myself and uh so you can 't just take off and try things you have to have someone to look after him for me so it was complicated and then in 2004 my friend paid for me to go to bayern bay to do a 10-day intensive retreat which was a wonderful gift and completely turned my life around and then and then i realized that was complaining about and um within myself so instead of pointing fingers i start looking inwards to realize that you know i was creating most of the problems i had so so meditation and especially having a good teacher it 's very important for us to realize that happiness you know is something that 's a lot simpler than we think so now that we 're mental health week so perhaps we can consider that um mental health often people think about happiness and on a generic sense when people think about happiness it will be something that 's outside ourselves now we want and die to go to the beach really truly uh to tell you the truth after three months i really missed the beach and last week i managed to have a swim which was good on lane called swamipu so although those things are really important for mental health as well especially exercise fresh air and talking to friends a lot of the times the long-term things that we have problems that we have that we feel unhappy need to be look inwards we need to the things that make us happy or makes us unhappy you know and um and half of them or more will be inwards you know the way we look at things the way we tempered the world and one of the biggest shocks i had when i went to my first passionate retreat which was four years after i did my first meditation research where i met my my spiritual teacher was that my mind would not stop you know i spent the first three days of my passion retreat like you have to be meditating 12 hours a day it 's very intense so you have to be with your thoughts a long time so and i had to wait four years to be able to do one my teacher wouldn 't let me because he knew that i have a pretty you know negative mind on a sense that i had a very critic mind so although i was very successful you know as a scientist developing methodology and all those things you need to be very critical inside the self-criticism was just overwhelming so i was my big shake-up for me and luckily um my meditation teacher she 's just wonderful very kind and caring and if i had been someone else i would have left so uh so those things are important that we take time for mental health also to look inwards you know to have that me time and see what 's inside our heads a little bit you know or the self-dialogue so this is a very important for mental health so today um so i teach mindfulness meditation from the buddhist perspective so mindfulness is just one of the qualities that we need for enlightenment you know and the way that we practice mindfulness is through sitting meditation and um and that 's a sort of more the more effective way we can apply like awareness to daily living to brushing our teeth and doing things mindfully but if we don 't have the practice of sitting meditation the really um strong component of mindfulness with the silence and the observing of their body and observing of their thoughts then it 's sort of hard complicated to go into um uh into to see through things so and it requires intensive practice too so although the daily practice is very important for those of you who have done retreats uh the daily practice keeps us in touch with you know all those teachings all those learnings we had on our retreat and that 's and our teachers which are very important because the mind quickly easily go back to oh i want food i want drink i want to party i want you know i want to go out i need to go for a walk we distract ourselves but there is a time there will be a time sometimes because we 're sick sometimes because we 're old sometimes because you know we have mobility problems that we no longer can go chasing after things and distracting ourselves so much so we have to make a point of being friends with our mind you know accepting what 's there and i would not change my mind uh as much as i have and i 'm still very critical but i i 'm very aware of it so i would have not forced myself to sit there for 10 days um looking at it you know and sitting of it and just letting see you know that part of it was because i had a lot of hurt in my life so through meditation lead us to a lot of freedom from things that have been accumulating you know and expecting that someone is going to come and cure us but that someone is just there you know just that 's someone that 's going to come and cure us is the only cure can be come from inwards inwards sometimes we may have a good therapist and and i have met some nice therapists from time to time but the best therapist is ourselves because we have to face that even when we go to therapy we still have to face it have to be brave so meditation is for the brave you know if people have serious mental health issues meditation is not for them they have to do other activities so so one of the persons that i really admire is um dr john kabazin so dr john cabot mainstream and that 's how you know mindfulness everyone talks about mindfulness these days so he started that in 79 he was um you know he was already a meditator and he thought how can i bring that into the hospital you know so he had to spend years trying to convince the director of the hospital to find a place for people to meditate and do some mindfulness meditation there and because he realized that two-thirds of the people come coming in and out of hospital he was dealing with you know outpatients um or not solving their problems they still complaining of chronic pain you know other issues and and um and then he felt that he took a long time and developed this training you know minus mindfulness-based stress reduction he 's still now it 's all over the world but he started you know on the underground of a hospital in 1979 so john kabatin has written many books so he has a good definition a generic definition for mindfulness on you know taking the buddhism out of it if people are worried about buddhism being mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way on purpose in the present moment and non-judgmentally this kind of attention nurtures great awareness clarity and acceptance of present moment reality it wakes us up to the fact that our lives unfold only moments if we 're not fully present for many of these moments we may not only miss what 's most valuable in our lives but also fail to realize the richness and the depth of possibilities for growth and transformation so this is from his book whatever you go there you are it 's a very good first book if you 're looking for it um and also he says the mindfulness includes paying attention of curiosity openness acceptance and openheartedness so we 're going to talk a little bit about more about open happiness in a little while so we 're going to start by bringing ourselves to this present moment doing a very quick relaxation a mindful relaxation and and then we 'll do um mindfulness of breathing so it 's hard to put audio uh music um without causing too much trouble so we haven if you have your music you can put your music on the background and we 'll do a little relaxation so you know our body awareness relaxation bringing ourselves to this moment sitting down perhaps like myself you have been running around trying to get organized to sit here on time and uh and enjoy this moment and enjoy this um these meditations we 're going to do today and then in the end we should have time for questions so let 's start by finding a comfortable position wherever you are if you lying on the floor sitting on a chair i 'm sitting in a comfortable chair i have my feet on the cushions i 'm very comfortable so we 're going to bring our full attention to the top of the head i 'm going to start relaxing the top of the head and the forehead so if each out breath i 'm going to let go of tension in the forehead the eyes the eyes are closed but softly closed the faces relax the mouth is relaxed the lips are gently touching and if you bring lot more [Music] so we can continue to just breathe normally but if without breath see if you can let go a bit more and a bit more of any tensions that you observe in your body we 're going to relax on the throat area some areas will be kind of funny but we can visualize that as we breathing through the nose we breathe out to the throat if that was possible breathing out of that area in our minds relaxing and letting go of any tension there as we breathe out then shoulders breathing in through the nose breathing through the shoulders and letting go and letting go of any tensions in the chest area the top of the back the middle of the back the lower back the upper arms the lower arms and the hands see if you have the hands relaxed on the left without pushing or grasping so the whole body is relaxed if you 're lying down that 's easy if you 're sitting up or just relax your hands on your thighs the arms are soft the hands are soft we out letting go of any tensions there and now relaxing the lower part of the body relaxing the buttocks the growing area relaxing the thighs relaxing the legs and relax in the feet notice your whole body more relaxed on the top of the head all the way down to the tips of the toes continue to let go a bit more and a bit more of each breath relaxing more and more letting go staying of the body staying in the present moment staying present in your body not running away and relaxing and relax so let 's just stay like that join that relaxation in just another minute and as we are relaxing still you can bring the awareness to the abdomen and without changing the breast observing that the abdomen rises as we breathe in and fall as we breathe out a nice rhythm just observing without changing the breath it goes a little bit like waves on the beast now two waves are the same so like the breath no two breaths are the same so stay with this relaxed moment a little bit more and start moving our toes moving our fingers moving our feet as our legs moving our hands and our arms and then we come back to sitting position and when you 're ready you can open your eyes and here we are so relaxation is an important thing first step into us doing some breast meditation so the the most basic not the easiest but the most basic um type of meditation in meditation on the breath so unless you 're having trouble with your breathing have a bad cold or you perhaps have natural trouble with your breathing um it 's not so conducive but when i teach mindfulness of the breasts i teach on a burmese way which is again focusing on the abdomen just like we just did before so focusing on the nose is hard i have to say my nose has been blocked forever because i have to wear masks for work all the time and i think that 's so toxic but so i 'm glad i don 't have to focus on my um the breath on my nose so it 's a good been breathing nose if you 're used to it fine that 's fine but um but if you want to start i think it 's easier to start off the abdomen it 's quite a subtle movement to notice the rising and the falling of the abdomen with breast meditation but we just stay with it even if you cannot touch it you cannot feel it you know so let 's just do a little experiment before we close our eyes and before we start meditation if you put your hands on your um lower abdomen so like your hands can even be rested um on your legs and then you might be able to start notice if you close your eyes it 's easier noticing the rising perhaps you have noticed before the rising as we 're breathing they 're falling as we breathe out it 's quite subtle when we do long hours of this practice becomes more obvious so breast meditation is also called um calm abiding so it 's a meditation that calms the mind and um so we 're just focusing on something that we to the beach we can go everywhere we can sit in the car and uh and do breast meditation the breast is there and if we focus on the absolute i think it 's more relaxing also but the intention of breath meditation is that we erase our awareness of things that we don 't normally notice you know so like i work with elderly people now as a home carer so i 'm always kind of rushing sometimes it 's very stressful you know i work with people with dementia they have good days they have bad days and i 'm very patient person but you still get that stress so it 's good to stop sometimes you know when i sit down and i find a moment to sit down i kind of notice that my shoulders first thing and let the girl show this and come back to my breath so i kind of don 't drain my all my energy you know before my shift is finished to save energy because we do have a minute sometimes to sit down in my job which is good the breathing focusing on the abdomen the rising and falling we 're going to do it um for 10 minutes so when we meditate it 's very good if we can meditate still you know if we can be still so if you if you 're lying down you want to continue with your hands on your abdomen that 's that 's good but meditation is best on sitting up especially if you 're beginning unless you have severe pain sitting up is better sometimes we have a cushion under our feet to be comfortable and then i have a cushion on my back so i 'm upright and comfortable and i keep my hands on my thighs so we keep the sort of upright posture with that awareness and so we 're going to start by taking a deep breath in of the nose and out through the mouth another t pressing through the nose and now through the mouth so we 're going to bring our full attention or full awareness to the breath in the abdomen so as we breathe in the abdomen rises as we breathe 're beginning to use some words so when we notice that the abdomen is rising we repeat words silently to ourselves gently rising rising then falling move rising falling so we have to just be careful with the words so there was not commands the words are just nothing that we repeat it 's just in our mind it 's just a noting we need to so we stay with that movement stay present to that movement we don 't run away with the stories in our minds and what we have to do things that have happened so when we notice that the abdomen is rising we make that noting silently to ourselves rising forward rising following the mind is not used to be in the present moment it 's not used to be paying attention in one object only the mind is going to go and tell the stories remember all we have to do today we let go now it 's time for ourselves it 's time for our meditation come back patiently and kindly bring the attention back to the abdomen to the breath to this acceptance patiently bring the attention back to the breath again and again we are learning each time we sit we want to sit fresh as if we have never done before because every time we see it is going to be different it 's like training a puppy some teachers say if we yell at the puppy kick the puppy you don 't do that you just again and again sit sit eventually the pup sits and gets a biscuit we don 't get a biscuit but we get some peace of mind so patiently again bring the attention back to the abdomen and we do that many times that 's part of the meditation and if time and we continue the mind calms down through that practice the body is used to it and we even find some relief when we sit on our cushion sit on our chair recline on armchair whatever place you normally like to sit or finding some peacefulness that 's our time to meditate we spend the whole day thinking now we 're doing the non-thinking work it 's going to support us throughout understanding more compassion and for those of you have done it before we know that even sometimes we sit and the mind is all over the place we may only have 10 minutes or 15 minutes and we felt that my meditation was not good still when we get up we feel better we continuously patiently kindly every time we notice the mind has gone away planning thinking regretting the past worrying about the future you let that all go come back to the present moment to the rising and falling and our meditation is coming to an end so we start moving our fingers our toes our arms and our legs bringing our attention to any sounds around ourselves outside our body and when you 're ready you can open your eyes so if we remember to do that a few times a day even if we do five minutes sometimes even a three minute meditation can help us you know to reduce anxiety stress apparently people already anxious about being out of lockdown so so we don 't know it 's all the unknown but everything is unknown is an unknown day so being in the present moment is important john lennon is supposed to have said uh he 's famous some of his famous words life is what happens why are you busy making other plans so we want to be present to our lives we want to be there um when things are happening the good the bad and the ugly we want to be there so i 'll read it to you so perhaps some of you have heard of them at children she 's a famous meditation teacher on a tibetan tradition she 's been married twice and she 's published many many books about our crazy minds and she 's american or canadian and now she lives in canada sorry she 's american but she 's she had like she lived a full life and then she has taught all around the world and she 's quite funny you can listen to her on youtube fema children p e m a children is g c h o d r d-r-o-n and um so there are many many talks and books uh from her things fall apart you know and um so that 's sort of a lot of the time people come to meditation because of suffering you know divorce breakdowns a loss of a loved one trauma so she 's written this article for this magazine called open your heart and mind to life the mind is very wild the human experience is full of unpredictability and paradox joys and sorrows successes and failures we can 't escape any of this experience in a vast range of existence it is part of what makes life ground and it is also why our minds take us on a such crazy ride if you can train ourselves through meditation to be more open and more accepting toward the wild arc of our experience if we can lean into the difficulties of life and the right of our minds we can become more settled and relaxed amid whatever life brings there are numerous ways to work with the mind one of the most effective is through the two of sitting meditation sitting meditation open us to each and every moment of our life each moment moment before and the next moment will not be the same as the one we are in now meditation teaches how to relate to life directly so we can truly experience the present moment free from conceptual underlay overlay we do not meditate in order to be comfortable in other words we don 't meditate in order to always all the time feel comfortable or feel good i imagine shock waves are passing through you as you read this because so many people come to meditation to simply feel better however the purpose of meditation is not to feel bad you 're glad to know rather meditation give us the opportunity to have an open compassionate attentiveness to whatever is going on the meditative space is like the big sky spacious vast enough to accommodate anything that arises in meditation our thoughts and emotions can become like clouds and well that dwell and pass away good and comfortable pleasing and difficult and painful all of this comes and goes so the essence of meditation is straining in something that 's quite radical and definitely not a habitual pattern of the what 's happening without putting labels of good and bad right or wrong pure and pew on the top of our experience so simple but not easy and that 's meditation you know for pema children so she 's very good of dealing of the highs and she 's very um very true about her experiences so she 's a wonderful writer and a great teacher and she always brings a little bit of humor to whatever she 's teaching so there is one important thing that i always teach in my classes which is what we called it 's called it has been translated in english as loving-kindness meditation it 's not a great translation so i use the pali word for meta meta so so matter is literally a wish for another person another being to be well and happy so it 's sort of a selfish wish that we can use to those selfless wish you know that we can also for others to be well and happy so this is um meta is like loving kindness is is meant to be a little bit like compassion loving-kindness meets suffering it becomes compassion so loving-kindness is sort of the seed of compassion so if we have to meditate on compassion sometimes it 's very painful so compassion will naturally grow in ourselves as we meditate on loving kindness which is that wish for another person sometimes for another animal to be well and happy like independent of my wishes you know i may sit here and sort of wish for my partner to be nice to me you know so i want i wanted him to be well so so he stopped bothering me either but the intention is of loving kindness is that we wish another person to be well for their own sake you know because if someone is happy you know they are kind so for their own sake so of course we do not start with a difficult person sometimes it 's best not even the start of the first the person closest to us so we 're going to do a little uh meditation we 're not going to take too long and i wanted to um to open the opportunity for us to do um the loving kindness meditation is a heart-based meditation so um so we focus on this well-wish in sort of in the center of our chest we sort of it 's best to think of a dear friend to do this meditation a french that you 're not attracted to um physically but a friend and also a friend that is not your best friend necessarily but someone that 's very easy for you to really wish them to be well you know perhaps someone sometimes we can be like our gp could be of someone that taught us someone that 's very helpless you know or a dear friend but not perhaps your closest friend because you know once you become close to people we see all their sides you know no one is perfect but someone that 's very easy for you to think and really wish this person to be well so these are the wishes well happy and peaceful you know so we may think this person is already very wise but you know we want them to also to be safe so you be well and peaceful so you can change the words a little bit and you continue bringing that attention to your heart and wishing that person to be well so after we developed a little bit we bring that towards ourselves but we start with someone else sometimes it 's easier to develop if you have a good relationship with your father or your mother and they 're not you they 're not they 're they 're healthy and if you 're not worried about them you can also do that towards your parents um but it 's best to do towards a dear friend that is not you that you have no concerns about them because the practices we start with something that 's easy we want that to develop we really feel that heart opening and um but even if we 're not feeling the hard opening you know the words you know they settle and settle and settle it 's a beautiful beautiful practice it 's my favorite meditation i go on retreats of my meditation teacher she 's um she teaches in the burmese tradition do three four weeks of her the whole first week meditating on loving kindness and that helps the concentration also afterwards because the mind is calm the heart is open and the body is supple so loving kindness is also good so you don 't feel the pain in your body that you feel on the first few days of intensive retreat because you 're just meditating on goodness it 's it 's a pleaseful blissful wonderful thing um to have and to carry around and then when we come out of retreat we just feel this sort of compassion we have to actually easing into the world again you know to to the world it 's not so compassionate so i 'll just quickly read you a little story just to warm up and then we 'll do a little meditation so that 's a little ah a lovely little book they have lots of these books still around chicken soup for the soul i still love my paper books because they have all my bookmarks and everything so this book um this one i think was the first gesture and i 'll read this story for you this story is all true stories people write to the authors the letters they publish them i think to this day that 's how it is they just rewrite and make it understandable so a simple gesture mark was walking home from school one day when he noticed the boy ahead of him had tripped and dropped all of the books he was carrying along with two sweaters a baseball bat a glove and a small tape recorder mark nailed down and helped the boy pick up the scattered articles since they are going the same way he helped to carry part of the burden as they walked mark discovered the boy 's name was bill that he loved video games baseball and history and he was having a lot of trouble with his other subjects and that he had just broken up with his girlfriend they arrived at bill 's house bill 's home first and mark was invited in for a coke to watch and to watch some television the afternoon passed pleasantly with a few laughs and some see each other around school had lunch together once or twice then both graduated from junior high school they ended up in the same high school where they had brief contacts over the years finally the long-awaited senior year came and three weeks before graduation bill asked mark if they could talk bill reminded him of the the days years ago when they had first met do you ever wonder why i was carrying so many things home that they asked you you see i cleaned out my locker because i didn 't want to leave that mess for anyone else i had stored away some of my mother 's sleeping pills and i was going home to commit suicide but after we spent so much time together talking and laughing i realized that if i had killed myself i would have missed that time and so many other times they might follow so you see mark when you picked up my books that day you did a lot more you actually saved my life small acts of kindness go a long way so let 's close our eyes and some nice music you can download my meditations they have less music from a website so we 're going to bring our attention to our body bring our attention to our hearts think of our dear friends the one we chose we can choose one quickly now [Music] and imagine that this friend is sitting sort of close to us opposite to us perhaps on a coffee shop now that we can do that we sort of and you wishing our friends to be well and happy for their own sake we don 't need to remember their stories but we just remember that wish for this person to be well and happy so you can see perhaps your friend is called joe simone joe silently yourself my job be well happy and peaceful it shall be well happy and peace may joe be well happy and peaceful or we can just say may joe be safe and well may joe be safe so we do that silently again and again slowly and gently and the words are just to help us to cultivate that feeling in our heart we imagine we 're giving them a heart we cultivating that loving kindness then we gently and kindly make sure just feeling that feeling in your heart the words just guiding you to cultivate that feeling the words are just words we want to cultivate that thing and as we did before with the mind wonders often bring the attention back to the hearts and that cultivation of matter loving kindness may my friend be well and happy my friend be well we bring the attention back to the heart if you find you 're getting distracted you can imagine giving your friend a big hug if your friend is not that close shaking their hands or spending time with him or her may you be safe and well you 'll be safe so it 's a selfless wish whatever they are for their own sake and they be happy and the mind goes and we bring the attention back to the heart space in the center of our chest can visualize our friend sitting close to us you be well and happy and peaceful may you be well meaning on may you have peace of mind and sometimes we can just say may you be happy will you be happy may you be and now meditation is coming to an end we start moving our fingers our toes we enjoy spending time with our friends and when you 're ready you can open your eyes so meta meditation it 's um it 's like you know a swim in a cool mountain river it 's really really nice and for some people it takes longer if people have you know i remember the first time i had to do um meta meditation uh on a retreat for a whole day um the words are just getting to me i just felt like it was a machine you know so we have to find that rhythm where the words are dental and soft we just the words are just a reminder for the meta once we get the matter strong we can just be there in the presence of that other person so it 's really um [Music] something that helps us and then once you feel like you are developing your first meditation so you can sit for your mindfulness meditation before and do five minutes of meta because it sort of helps the body to soften as well bringing all their kindness and and of course meta is not something that we send it 's not that we sending energy to other people the method is actually something we do for ourselves and of course if we cultivate a lot of meth we 're going to be nicer to everyone we come across so it 's a beneficial to us but amazing things happen when i was in i was lucky enough to go to burma early um 2015 for a two week meta retreat so we spent two weeks just doing meta the land of the meditators which was wonderful up in the mountains was nice and cool um in january and beautiful days we didn 't have a cloud in the sky for the whole two week cells there it was a bit like really being in paradise all these people practicing matter it was just heaven on earth and um and was hard to leave like to say like you too open you know you have to sort of slow down but it 's sort of a transformational practice and um and often with lasting results you know when we come home we just people can tell that we 're different you know so it 's really like a purification practice and um and loving kindness meta is a purification against anger you know as westerners especially we have more anger you know so the burmese they 're just much more gentle people naturally but as westerners we always afraid that someone is doing something or we always aware of everything especially when we live in a big place in a big city perhaps not so much in the country but um so it 's it 's a relational practice you know and uh and the animals come to you and people come to you it 's just really um quite um an amazing practice when i was there in burma um we had classes of decider there which is amazing and mossados teach the personal intensive persona this aldo teaches meta he was the first teaching and was the first time he was actually teaching an only meta retreat because my teachers said to him they will love it they need that they 're westerners they really need that and he told his story he was teaching in burmese and and my teacher would translate and he said that he has a lot of businessmen that will go to his monastery and and this man said to him he was having trouble with this person at work you know and uh and and then he said you have to do matter for this person you know when we go and retreat we first start of a dear friend and then we go to a close friend and then um a neutral person someone that we don 't know their name we 've seen him around or her around and then we leave the enemy you know the person you have trouble last you know for the last sort of week uh because it 's harder to sit there and wish a person that you have problems with to be well and happy you know but went back to work this person was completely nice and friendly to him it completely had changed and and was like wow so is that kind of thing have i changed has him changed it 's so those kind of magic uh that happens it 's powerful powerful uh meditation and of course leads to uh friendliness leads to a peaceful world it 's not that kindness acceptance we open our hearts to others we lead to a peaceful world so [Music] i will stop here i 'm not sure how long i have been talking to someone has been counting the time and then um if people uh want to ask questions someone has to coordinate that for me perhaps people can ask right questions let me know how we do that and um and i 'm happy to i do have recorded meditations on my website you can download them i recorded some meditations for the buddhist library of sydney you have to do buddhist library of sydney what else you go to overseas libraries and i recorded on youtube it 's just a recording but it 's meditations that i have recorded or the ones on my website a little bit better recorded because my son helped me to do uh it 's living inharmony.com.au_,_3746.16 the bottom of my meditation page i think there 's two or three there 's a relaxation of music and if you can 't find anything um there or what you wanting because i have changed things i 'm not quite sure it 's there you can email me it just says a a at livingharmony.com.edu so it 's just anna s-a-m-a at livingharmony.com and ask me and then i i can upload whatever is not there for you i i teach body scan as well it 's very good it just requires a little bit more attention to more teachings involved with that but i hope you have enjoyed our sessions and um and if you have questions you can use the chat um we can coordinate um and people putting their hands up so there is someone here the chris yes it is can you hear me yes i can hear you hi hi anna thank you thank you for years and um you know there 's a lot of overlaps between all these sort of sort of things with yoga but one thing i always found when we did meditation at the end of yoga was was how it 's difficult to maintain your consciousness if you start relaxing because you automatically start relaxing and then you start falling into a sleep and i do know that occasionally someone would have a snort or something in yoga as they were as they were meditating now what what 's you say you 've got to keep in in the yes so the reality is um i teach buddhist meditation so it 's very different so when i go to yoga it i i love yoga and but it 's a relaxation so it 's a body awareness relaxation that you go through and you you you feel tired you will fall asleep so it is a relaxation it 's not actually a meditation so meditation is mostly done upright so that 's why people sit on a cushion like the cushion is not to make you suffer is because the to sit cross-leg yeah i had to train myself it 's because of the flow of energy is perfect so i can sit for an hour of cross-legged better than i can sit in a chair for an hour so so yeah so upright so meditation is really upright so when we lie down unless we have chronic pain and if we have chronic pain we can sit against a cushion but it 's best to trust our our body you know to be upright by itself so it 's good for for the muscles too if we can and and of course we can start on a chair until we have um someone to teach us how to sit nicely on a cushion you know needs to be in person yeah so hopefully now everything is coming back to having in person help which is great but yes sitting sitting is much better we even when we 're sitting we lose it isn 't it but with meditation you 've got to stay in the time you can 't you 've got to stop yourself from from going too 're not i mean yeah so meditation is not relaxation it 's it 's awareness you have to be aware and you 're paying attention yeah so if you feel very tired it 's not a good idea to try to meditate but if you wanted to do every day and you do it even when you 're very tired you can there 's nothing wrong with that but um but you have to find a time that is suitable for you so the first thing the morning go get up some something sometimes people go get up have a cup of tea just a plain cup of tea come and sit you know sometimes people go get up have a shower and then sit and meditate you know if you get out of bed and roll into your cushion or your chair it 's kind of not ideal like you know we like one of my teachers he was very strict about that he said we have to be dressed you know like to meditate we 're not going to meditate on our pajamas we have to be there to be nuts yeah yeah thank you thank you for that my pleasure so let 's just see if there are some chats and questions here so so yeah so there is um someone uh rayleen asked why sitting up is better so i just mentioned that i hope i answered your question you have thank you and uh so people saying thank you uh why sitting up is better because we stay awake yeah and if we sit on a cushion the position on a cushion cross leg i have to show people how to cross leg without harming themselves sometimes we have to start with a very high cushion until the legs you know soften chair is fine sit on a chair no problem uh put a cushion on your feet so there 's that extra comfort uh and if you have severe pain that you can 't sit on a cushion for a normal chair for a long time sits the most upright you can you know leaning on something but but upright is best even if it 's leaning a little bit back or something because no other choice yeah because we lie down to sleep so it 's hard to stay awake i have done it like i have done overnight wall or meditations that you go one hour walking one hour sitting when i lie down every hour lying down that i did i probably slept 40 minutes of it you know it 's it 's hard it 's hard so so um so my email was anna i 'll just type here my email the messages so it 's just ama it 's leaving thing money dot com dot a u so my website is living harmony dot com dot a u so you go to living in harmony the dot com dot au slash meditation that 's my meditation pages scroll all the way to the bottom um so it 's living hell.com meditation and uh and so at the bottom you find um certainly you 're going to find a breast meditation um and perhaps the body scan i sort of but anyway you can write it to me and ask for normally uh how have a loving kindness or meta scan there but um we didn 't do the body scan the body scan takes a little bit uh longer but it 's it 's a good one too so for some people you know paying attention moving through the body is easier than just focusing on the breath you know for some people like i have a very analytical mind i 've noticed that some other people have very analytical minds they also do the body scan they prefer to do the body scan you scanning like you have that technicalities scanning the body from the top of the head the face the throat the shoulders you know like we a little bit like we did with the relaxation but the relaxation is about lying down and relaxing so i used to teach even in classes so people come after work we just slide down and relax before we get up to meditate so when your next class will be available i am not sure i 'm not sure so yeah so we need to to plan for that but uh but once a year i come to the teaching in person again so [Music] keep keep track of my on my meditation page thank you very much anna for giving us your time today thank you so much everyone yes so we 're hoping that the time we see you you 'll be back in the library yes and in person

and acknowledge their spiritual connection to country good evening everyone i 'm therese from osman library service and welcome to this author evening with tanya blanchard talking about her new novel echoes of war which is published by simon echrister it 's lovely to have you all online here tonight and thank you to tanya for her time this evening this talk is being recorded and will be available later on our website a big thanks to my library colleague kenny for doing all the zoom admin for me tonight there will be time for your questions toward the end so please submit them by the chat function on to our author tanya blanchard is a sydney based writer and is the author of three previous novels the girl from munich suitcase of dreams letters from berlin in her latest echoes of war she takes the reader to calabria italy in 1936 right through to world war ii young woman who dreams of having an ambitious and independent life away from the village which is a place full of people she loves dearly thank you tanya we 're looking forward to talking about your book this evening i just want to ask you first what drew you to write an historical novel set in the late 1930s with the spectra of world war ii looming initially hi therese thank you so much for having me this evening um look it was really interesting um i saw a photo on my father 's fridge a few years ago it 's a photo i 'd never seen before black and white and it was of a man in uniform and he looked awfully like my father and i i thought it must be my grandfather but from what i knew about my grandfather he 'd been exempt from war during world war ii so i 'd been told so obviously i approached my father and and asked him about the photograph and he explained that his father actually had fought with the italian army uh in in the wars with in albania in 1939 before world war ii and that really just sparked my interest my grandfather was a very quiet man and i just couldn 't imagine what it might have been like for him to leave his tiny village which was very remote in the south of italy in calabria and go to exotic africa far away from home and how that might have changed his perspective of life and and how he 's how he viewed the world um and so i wanted to sort of explore what it might have been like for those people in those small communities um that had left their countries or had contacted um war for the very first time and and obviously then leading up to world war ii the big one and how how they viewed the war with the allies and and also mussolini 's regime so and that that 's that 's what initially sparked my my interest in in that so a photograph instigated your whole you know the whole start of writing this novel the black and white photograph yeah it was yeah yeah um a herbalist what 's the inspirational or reason behind her being a herbalist and and in the book you write the greatest responsibility of all rested on the shoulders of women we were the ones who kept the family together kept our farms and businesses running so julia is very strong in in the village in her family but she 's also you know wants to have a trade as a herbalist can you talk to us about that yeah sure um so the inspiration behind julia being a herbalist is that growing up when we were at my grandparents farm they were on 10 acres outside of sydney on the outskirts of sydney they had a market garden and i remember growing up playing games with my cousins where we 'd pick herbs from the garden and we 'd pick sort of grasses and things like that and pretend to to make remedies and pretend to cook our dinners uh so from this imagination um i realized that i must have heard something about my grandmother being a faux healer or a traditional healer and i spoke to my story and he said that um she she wasn 't known as a healer as such a faux healer but she certainly did do a lot of traditional remedies children would come to her with colic and she 'd use herbs and olive oil people would come to her for headaches and that sort of thing and he described a technique that she used um on people 's backs called cupping where that where a flame is in in a glass or a cup and then it 's put onto somebody 's back to help draw uh inflammation and and you know phlegm and that sort of thing with respiratory conditions um so i knew that she was some type of healer and and it was fascinating that um also i 've i 've had a lifelong fascination i suppose with um herbal medicine um and i actually trained to become a herbalist myself many years ago um so all of this kind of crystallized together to create julia 's character and and her love and desire to want to help people and heal people and become a herbalist which traditional herbal medicine and the traditional folk healing of southern calabria it 's really ancient rare very very long tradition they use specific herbs and specific remedies so it was just amazing to research further and and then place julia straight in the action in the in the book her father andrea was quite skeptical of her choosing being a herbalist as a profession yep yeah absolutely um i guess he he viewed um what she was doing with the herbal medicine as a form of witchcraft um i guess the folk healing was the was the realm of women um that was women 's power remedies often were passed from one family member down to another so grandmother to granddaughter mother to daughter that sort of thing and often they exchange all these recipes which were just basically remedies were handed down at christmas time to the next member of the family so it 's certainly an area that um women knew lots about um and and men didn 't sort of become into the equation quite as much so it was their sense of sense of power um a lot of men wouldn 't have understood what the women were doing and were worried that they were losing some of their male power um to to the women who who are doing these particular remedies and looking after their community we 're going to have the pleasure of hearing a short passage in a moment but can you tell those of us who who haven 't read the novel how pivotal the role of women are in the village in this book because it 's coming from us very strongly yeah well of course um and certainly you you see that women are quite strong and powerful through the story through the different characters we 've got um julia of course who wants to become a herbalist and flout the the traditions of of getting married young and having a family and living in the village forever she wants to live this big life and she 's inspired of course by her non-mariana who 's the the folk healer of the village um and she is a woman on her own her husband had died years ago she sort of travels the district as well healing people and so that 's quite an untraditional role for a woman she 's outside the box so she 's obviously a very strong woman that will forge her own path as well and another person that influences julia is um dia francesca who 's her father 's sister whose husband also died some years before and she now runs the trattoria the restaurant in the village all by herself and on her own and she 's quite headstrong like julia and she drives a red fiat and you know she has a little car and and she does her thing so julia 's really inspired by her zia as well and she also gets some magazines from the north of the modern woman and julia 's able to look through these magazines and she wants a piece of this independence this modern life that is so different to the very traditional values a really ancient way of life in calabria so having said all that then of course we have war that steps in and more and more men are sent behind to have to continue running the farms to run the businesses to to have the village life continue as it always has done to deal with the bureaucrats so women 's strength is by bonding together and the women have always known this they 've always known their strength even though the men think they 're the strong ones but binding together during wartime they can get so much done and we see julia 's sister paula who runs the farm while her father 's away again not a very traditional role for a young woman and she works with the black market and she thinks of ways to help the people in the community so we really see this real strong sense of women binding together women being the strength and and the base base of this community they they look after the home they they look after the children they heal the community and and they run everything else as well while the men are away would you be able to read us that the short passage that you mentioned thank you okay so this is a um it 's it 's uh set in 1943 when the allies have already invaded southern italy and so the allies are now on the mainland through columbia and the germans have come down of course to fight against the allies as well so julia is in her village with her family and i 'll just share this passage with you now okay one morning as i was collecting the yellow flowers of saint john 's wort from the fields before breakfast i heard a dog barking in the distance straightening up and stretching i surveyed the landscape coming towards me along the road was a squad of about 10 soldiers i squinted in the sunlight and felt sure they were not italians they weren 't wearing the right uniform i picked up my skirts and ran back into the village soldiers are coming i yelled i went to the church and banged on the door of the priest 's residence pad day soldiers are coming i repeated through gasping breaths as he opened the door and stared at me in astonishment they 're just outside the village are they don 't know if they 're allies or germans he grunted either way the people of this town won 't view them kindly he thought for a moment i 'll ring the bell it 's the only way to warn people in time knock on as many doors as you can and tell people to stay inside with any luck they 're just passing through and won 't trouble us at all i nodded dubious but there was nothing else to do i turned and began knocking on doors encouraging others to help me warn the village as the bell started to toll i made sure i warned santoro and theresa at the school masters house and rosa at the general store before climbing a stone wall to see the soldier 's progress i could see helmets at the end of the at the end of the road may the madonna protect us i breathed and sprinted to nunas but she was already outside her house come on i said pulling her by the arm let 's go to mummas soldiers are coming we ran with the other villagers some i banged on mama 's door and she opened it quickly come inside she said slamming the door behind us and bolting it firmly we rushed into the we rushed to the shuttered windows and peered outside as men in uniform milled about the street their german whispered nonna after we heard them speaking amongst themselves they were thin haggard and dirty desperate men and not at all like the tall proud germans we 'd heard about but desperate men were the most dangerous of all i remember what stefano had written about the nazis in sicily and i shuddered what did they want here they 're our allies said paola they might be but i 'm not letting them in here said mama i hope antonio is safe in the mountains we watched as they knocked on doors but nobody answered our knuckles walked right against the shutters as we waited to see what they would do i don 't think they mean as harm said no no otherwise they would have already done it i 'm not so sure i whispered more afraid now than i had been away muttered number the soldiers climbed over fences and walked into gardens picking ripe tomatoes and anything else they could get their hands on they broke branches as they roughly pulled fruit from the trees the hide of them said paola they 're stealing all we have that produce has to last for months she started for the door and i pulled her back although i wanted more than anything to rush out and snatch the produce back no paula you can 't go out there we don 't know what they might do they could attack us or shoot anyone who tries to stop them it 's not worth the risk a squealing pig was dragged from its pen the soldier jubilant at his find i was appalled by the theft in broad daylight but then i noticed how frail his wall he was his uniform hanging off him and when i looked at the others on the street i wondered how long since they 've eaten a decent meal i think they 're hungry i always been in surprise i don 't care if they 're hungry said for what they 're taking like anyone else would every theft was a blow to our community but nobody came out to confront the soldiers instead we watched silently from our windows yes but like julia pointed out they still have guns on them said paula well we 'd rather go hungry than be shot or have our daughters raped said none grimly other soldiers followed his lead and the chickens were taken from their coops along with the eggs in our milking cow not bella cried mama we 've had her for so long she 's part of the family shh the writer whispered paula can find us another milking cow can 't_''_921.68 you you know i will she said confidently but i wondered how scarce livestock was going to be if germans were scouring the countryside like this where do you think they 're going past mama peering through the window away from here his nonna i think they 're headed to reggio and the west coast to stop the allies when they crossed the mainland i said but maybe they got separated from the rest of their suddenly one of the men kicked in a door across the street and four men followed him out inside oh dear said mama her eyes wide with shock we could only watch helplessly not knowing what was happening inside the house of our neighbour senora romeo at least there were no young men or women there just a wizard old lady the door opened and the men walked out again with bottles of olive oil jars of olives wheels of cheese and strings of dried mushrooms we have to do some things at paola if they raid every home like this we 'll have nothing left and we 'll all starve or whatever else she was going to say was cut off by the little old lady stepping outside of her door and waving them in goodbye she 's done it to save the rest of us said mama slowly moving her hands in the sign of the cross as the men disappeared down the street carrying their fines and leading their stolen animals to the other end of town without touching another home thank god for senora romeo said have enough now i guess we 'll have to wait and see i said it could have been so much worse than mama mopping her brow with her handkerchief after a while when we 'd seen no more soldiers we felt game enough to go out onto the street senora romeo greeted us i have to thank you she said as she shuffled towards us without your warning i would have had my best produce out for them to find whatever happened asked mama one spoke a little italian and somehow i managed to get him to believe that my preserves and oils are the best in the village and everyone else 's is poor quality why would they believe that paula asked because i told their mom estrega and that i cursed everyone 's olive oil this year so mine would be the best then i waved around an old amulet i had and mumbled some words in front of them telling them that bad things would happen to them if they took any more from the village she shrugged i thought it was the best i thought it put anything back was asking more for more trouble i told them they could stay a little longer that i 'd enjoy the company of young men like themselves but unfortunately they decided to leave she began to cackle uproariously slapping her hand against her black skirt mama grasped her by the shoulders and kissed her down her cheeks you could have been killed but you saved the village you saved us all it was nothing she said but she beamed with pleasure there you go thank you so much you should read the audiobook i don 't know about that so that leads me to my question about the way you create drama without it being melodramatic which was illustrated in that passage but also another time in the book where i won 't give a spoiler away my heart was in my mouth for julia our reading when there 's a certain scene with a tidal wave approaching so how do you manage to write so intensely without being melodramatic i guess the most important thing for me is authenticity so with the title way of seeing for tsunamis around the world about the effects that they have i read first-hand accounts of people in those kind of situations and more specifically i went back to the 1908 earthquake that hit calabria and sicily and after this massive earthquake i think was about eight on the richter scale or something like that there was this tsunami that that broke across messina in sicily and reggio and columbia and those coasts and devastated so much of those communities and that 's what inspired me actually to write this scene with the tidal wave because i wanted to illustrate the incredible volatile geology of the region through calabria and how people had to live with this on an everyday basis and that that i suppose provided part of the way i could write julia 's character through this scene is that they 've seen all sorts of manner of destruction volcanoes earthquakes you know tidal waves um floods you name it so they were quite a matter of fact about these things happening and then having and they knew exactly what they had to do they were very resilient and and and dealing with the situation so there was there was that i suppose so i wanted to remain authentic to what the event might be like and also to how the people 's reactions might be like and reading some of those first-hand accounts i guess were really helpful then all i could really do is just put myself into julia 's shoes and imagine what it might have felt like and and really try to dig deep to find the right emotions i guess that 's quite important to me that i i use authentic and real raw emotions in in the story and not just skim across the top which is sometimes easier to do so it took probably a few goes to get that scene actually right to really get that heart-stopping fear and and the disbelief and bewilderment and the shock that she would have experienced watching this unfold and and similar with the nazi um coming through the village um and interestingly i just might like to also add i forgot to mention before um that that scene was actually based on a story him about um that she witnessed during the war about the souls coming in through the village so um that that was another layer i suppose on on top to to to provide an authentic scene it 's a rich family thread through this novel then yeah yeah yes been wonderful um so it 's written in the first person and i 'm wondering it could be a long shot is it to reflect julia 's strength and determination which to me comes across as a reader more powerfully when it 's something 's written in the first person third yeah most definitely that 's something i discovered when i was writing my first book the girl from munich i had sort of played with other writing styles before writing from the third person um but when i started writing the girl from munich it just somehow flowed so much better when i wrote in the first person i could put myself into the the main character 's shoes and and write from a more personal point of view i suppose and i guess that that felt more powerful to i could really tap into those those deep emotions as well um so that 's something i 've obviously carried through with each of my novels and you know i 've i still just slip into the into the story into the character a lot better when i go from first person now you have visited italy when you 're a teenager and covert put a halt to your plans to visit there to do presumably some work on this novel can you share with us how you brought a bit of calabria to sydney in order to help write the book yeah well i guess the first thing i did um after i could put aside the disappointment was i got on you know the computer looked at youtube and some fantastic uh videos of of people in the small remote communities in southern italy in calabria particularly and there were these fantastic videos of the mountains they were rugged and and you know just not a lot on them um and there were these uh villagers right perched on the very tops of these high peaks which just there were these fantastic videos of people doing some some wonderful dancing some tarantella dancing and that just got me straight back into into what southern italy and calabria is all about um obviously i i did some research online as well as some cultural sites looking at some fantastic photos of all the cultural parts of italy of calabria particularly but also looking at the landscapes but also another thing that was wonderful was that my father and aunt had been to italy the year before and had spent some time in columbia my aunt wanted to go to the the festa of the madonna it 's a festival of the madonna that happens every year and these festivals are quite a big cultural part of italian life and particularly in in the south of italy and calabria the madonna is really revered so she wanted to go to the local village festa um so that was amazing that my father and aunt could tell me all about this wonderful festival and how this church was perched in the middle of nowhere between two towns and and that they the madonna the statue and they and they travel um in caravan form uh with processions of people behind them singing and dancing to the church so that was another great way to to get into the sense of what calabria is all about and certainly i talk about these festivals in the in the novel and the best way of course of all was talking to family and friends um often they were people that i hadn 't seen for quite some time and so reconnecting with my my family and the collaborative culture eating lots of fantastic italian food i got to experience salami making and actually got my hands in there and and tried to to do some of it but i was hopeless compared to the friends that were showing me who 'd been doing it for years and years but it was a really wonderful experience and we got to take away the salami and we 're still enjoying it it 's just wonderful um so and then i i actually um spoke to my my aunt and my dad a bit more about some 's uh recipes as well that she she 's kept on from her mother um so i would make i was trying to think of a biscotti and i made some um zipli and some different italian or particularly collaborating recipes and that sort of got me back into the mood of what calabria is all about and and reminded me of some of the memories that i 'd forgotten i had of when i was a child and watched my grandmother cooking and all the arts around the kitchen stove doing all sorts of things in in the kitchen cooking up a big face for the family to come and sit down at the table and there 'd be 20 or 30 of us around these tables every week you know having these fantastic meals so they were all great ways to get into the sense of what calubria is all about i was very very fortunate to be able to tap into that all right here and who who was your trusted reader to read um you know the manuscript of your book before you sent it to to my to my daughter to read and she she read some of it for me which which was great and she gave me some great great feedback she 's nearly 20 now so she i really valued her her feedback um some things that didn 't quite make sense or that she thought would be worked better so she was great but the other person of course was my my aunt um the one that had been to italy a couple of years ago so she she read some of the passages as well in the story um and i really wanted to see whether she got that sense of authenticity in the story and whether she loved the character of julia who of course is kind of based around my my grandmother to some degree and i was very pleased when she said that she loved it um thank goodness i don 't know what i would have done otherwise um yeah so i was very lucky to have have those influences um do you feel in the future you might write another novel said in calabria or will um purely because i don 't think i 'm finished with calabria and i don 't think collaborators finished with me i 'd really love to get back there one day and explore the landscape to explore the culture get back in touch with family members that are still there and hear some of their stories about their family members about stories that have been brought down through the generations too so i don 't know that it will be whether it 'll be a story set sort of more recently or maybe further back into family stories i 'm in the past but yeah i definitely think that there 'll be another collaboration story coming up sometime down the track so tanya when you 're not writing these amazing historical novels what do you like to read or who are your favorite authors well i guess i like to i like to specifically read fantasy and historical fiction i guess they 're my two favorite genres um that 's what i 've always loved to read um i also like to read some good thrillers too so from am sorry i just got a dog parking in the background there [Laughter] a fantasy book that i actually finished reading earlier in the year was phillip pullman 's his dark materials and i know that 's quite quite different to the historical novels that i write it 's more young adult but i was absolutely fascinated with his large fantasy world to rival you know the lord of the rings really it was was beautiful beautifully written and i really enjoyed that um i guess other fantasy i like george r martin of course the game of thrones i mean who could miss that that was amazing but something i 'm really interested i 've noticed on telly recently that they 've shown a new movie coming out or a new series on june by frank herbert i haven 't read that for years and years but i absolutely loved that series of books back in the day another great big epic world look i think at the end of the day it comes down to the fact i love big epic stories and same with the historical fiction earth and i 'm yet to read the prequel to that hopefully i 'll do that pretty soon um diana gabaldon i love her outlander series that 's just gorgeous lots of sensory um scenes and lots of historical detail really beautifully written and i love love jamie fraser he 's such a great character as is claire um and the thrillers i guess um look tom clancy of course i love to read um and ken follow used to write thrillers as well once upon a time which was interesting so yeah lots lots of good stuff there but yeah i 'm in between books at the moment and waiting for my next good read excellent so tanya what would you like our audience to take away from your book this evening look i think the biggest thing is um what i found fascinating and what i learned during my journey of research and writing echoes of war and i guess predominantly was the fact that i knew very little about italy 's stance during world war ii i had no idea that there were so many wars leading into i didn 't know much about italy and mussolini and the fascist regime and how he was aligned with hitler and how they entered world war ii and what i 've found really fascinating too was the fact that when the allies invaded in 1943 it split the country into two so it was the fascist north against the allied occupied south and really created like a civil war and i didn 't know anything about that role that italy played in this war so i guess i guess that 's probably one thing on a historical point of view i guess the other thing was the amazing culture and landscapes of calabria it 's a really really ancient part of the world it was colonized like in about 8 bc by the ancient greeks originally so very very ancient and lots of greek traditions still come through in the in the culture today which is really fascinating and it was occupied by big civilizations as the ancient rome you had the normans you had the byzantines you had the ottomans lots of it 's a melting pot basically amazing food and culture and music and the vibrant people of calabria that you see today so i think at the end of the day it 's um a story about a region that perhaps a lot of people don 't know about um and viewing world war ii through italian eyes something that i think not a lot of people have seen either there 's a lot from the you know allied point of view and some also now from the german point of view but i don 't think there are many stories out there from the italian point of view and and how they viewed world war ii so i guess you know some of the things i 'd like people to take away and and the fact that it 's a story about strong women and if there are always strong women in the world um we just don 't get enough recognition for those stories and then now that 's starting to happen which is lovely yeah i think that 's probably what i enjoyed as well learning about italy and the walls i knew to open up the chat so look at your questions and send them through um what is the next book of yours i should read tanya now that i read a curse of war they 're lined up behind you yeah uh yes well um i have all of my books here so we have the girl from munich which is my very first book um and that 's set in germany during world war ii and follows my grandmother 's story growing up and then suitcase of dreams is the next one to to it there which follows um my grandmother 's story basically migrating to australia and becoming new australians in the 50s and that 's basically her story letters of war go sorry letters from berlin um goes back to germany during world war ii and follows a mixed family so mixed jewish and and german family and their story of of wartime in in germany and how they were affected by the nazi regime um so that 's a really fascinating story too which is also based on one of my grandmother 's uh cousin 's and i 'm writing a new book at the moment too um which is completely different i 'm delving into my husband 's family 's stories now and his his father 's side of the family comes from england so this story is based in durham which is in the north of england around the turn of the 20th century so the late victorian era and it follows a young woman who is a school teacher and and also is involved in running a country pub so a really really interesting story there that sounds wonderful looking forward to that thanks um tanya we 've got a a comment from sue and she says i 've read your other books and i 've just started your new book was fascinated to see this book is based in italy i love your work thank you so much sue thanks thank you has anyone else got some questions i am so happy for you my friend beautiful thank you so very very much love it really appreciate it uh magda has asked tanya how long does your research take and how do you write at the same time sorry or just do the research yeah look first up i come up with a story idea and then there 's a lot of research that obviously goes into the family stories looking behind the family stories and also the historical events that are happening at that time so the research i guess probably i would work on for about uh three or four months solidly um i 'm also doing bits and pieces for another few months before i actually start writing um and then during the writing process there 's there 's always times i have to go back to research it 's like um what i don 't know um what what did the how did the allies uh cross from sicily to calabria during the war what did they you know what transport did they use or what routes did they use traveling up to the mainland just little things like that that i may not have the great detail that i need to write in the story um so often there 's lots and lots of research that goes few sentences but you need to have that understanding um to actually write the scene authentically and and historical detail and accuracy is really important to me so i need to make sure i have that there thank you does anyone want to place a question in the chat or unmute yourself and ask tanya a question i think i read somewhere telling you that i mean you wrote this mostly in lockdown did you have a time frame you had to write it in was it a bit yeah okay yeah yeah um as you know um letters from berlin was published last year um so essentially it 's it was a tight turnaround i suppose to get echoes of war out this year so it essentially i guess was written in just just over a year i suppose um so it was it was a bit tight um during lockdown really interesting having everyone under one roof um luckily for me i was able to hang on to my office so i had my quiet space and serenity that i could concentrate and write and and like any i i try and write to a word count at the end of each week so i make sure i write a certain number of words and move forward in the manuscript so it actually gets finished and then go back and review and edit as i can and thank god i 've got a wonderful team of editors at the publishing house summit in schuster and and they 're absolutely delightful in helping me bring it all together and sculpt and and and you know sort of pull pieces out and that sort of thing just to to make it more pacey and and to get just where it needs to be excellent um annabelle has asked you 've written four books now which heroine was your favorite to write and why oh that 's such a good question oh wow um look i love each of my heroines in their own special way they 've been each really amazing to write um each story has been quite different look i i think i have to say lottie um especially in the girl from munich it was my very published and it 's basically my grandmother 's story and she only died in 2015 so i was really close to her and she told me lots of stories growing up about her life in germany and here in australia and so her stories were really really close to me i suppose so um writing lottie and remaining true to my grandmother 's spirit and her larger than life persona um i guess lottie 's got to be my favorite heroine does anyone else have a question for tanya i don 't have a question i just want hella renata um i 'm very happy to have the chance uh to join that zoom meeting from germany and to to listen to chanya and i have so far i have no chance to get the book it 's difficult because of corona but i think girl of munich was the first book i read i bought it when we were in australia and i think that 's a great story but my favorite is suitcase of dreams because it tells me more about what happens to migrants and i think migrating you can your whole family is getting uh to australia from europe mostly yeah yeah thank you thank you so much renata i really appreciate that and yeah look i think um suitcase of dreams is is a great story and there are so many wonderful migration stories here in australia that we 're yet to tap into so um i certainly think that there 'll be other migration stories happening at some point in time too whether it 's my italian family my german family i don 't know there 's lots of stories to be told but i see why the migration story holds a special place in your heart and i hope that you get echoes of war very soon well we 'll have to make sure that you get it and thank you for joining us too i really really appreciate that 's lovely to see you and hear you all the way from germany tonight yeah right you 're welcome um tanya annabelle asks you always write such wonderful romances full of heart and totally believable how do you manage the balance oh gosh back to saying authenticity it 's got to it 's got to mirror true life i think it 's got to mirror the ups and downs that ordinary people experience every day and i guess that 's what i love about writing these books is that there 's stories about ordinary people like any of us who go through extraordinary experiences set against like these major historical events um and look romance can be um a real coming of age and it is for a lot of the the women in these stories that they are of that age where they 're learning about romance and and love and and and the way forward for their adult selves um so yeah i think it 's just trying to put myself in their shoes and imagine what life might be like at that time and and and what real life is all about and and real emotion too i think it 's important like i mentioned before for me to stick to the raw true emotions um and and sometimes they 're not so easy to to write or to read even um but i think it 's really important to remain true to your story and to to your character 's arc thank you i 'm sue sue 's comments many thanks for the opportunity to hear about the book thanks session um and is it saying to you love all your books tanya real life and adventures and this thank you and from dubbo yeah well thanks anne okay does anyone have any other comments or questions for tania it doesn 't seem like it look i want to thank you tanya for a really wonderful novel as i 've mentioned to you before really transported me straight to to italy i i 've thoroughly enjoyed it thank you

you do everything 's got to be perfect i have designed a number of boats and a couple of those boats are currently used in the olympics hundred thousand people cheering and yelling pretty much a high competing for australia at the olympic games there is no greater honour mossman has a long history with the olympics beginning with frederick freddie lane australia 's first olympic swimmer winning two gold medals at the paris olympics in 1900 when lane returned to australia he settled in mossman at the curlew artist camp once home to several leading australian artists by the early 1900s the camp was a place for sailing swimming and outdoor pursuits the curlew and balmoral camps provided semi-permanent retreats from the pressures of sea life and freddie lane made the most of this commuting each day to the city by ferry and remaining at curlew until his marriage time australia hosted the olympics mossman was there with award-winning journalists and author gavin souter on the ground for the sydney morning herald mossman was not only reporting but coaching and competing too mossman sam herford was an accredited swimming coach for the 1956 olympics and the 1960 olympics in rome herford was a talented swimmer and surf lifesaver before switching to coaching in 1936. after the second world war he became owner of the spit baths and coached to numerous olympic swimmers who trained there two of his chargers murray rose and john devitt had great success in 1956 and 1960 and herford as one of the key contributors to the golden age of australian swimming helped lead australia into our most prominent olympic years it 's not surprising that mossman with as many bays and beaches saw much of its olympic success in watersports what is not so well known is mossman 's family success the olympics and the herford family are no exception sam succeeded as olympic coach daughter kim an olympic swimmer and son gary as an olympic grower pretty much started with my mum as and my dad was a state and national champion surf in stillwater mum would have gone to the games in 1928 but was passed over as being too young and edna davie was taken instead she was a few years older than mum my auntie claire won the gold breaststroke medal in 1932 that 's pretty much the basic history of how i started swimming moved to the spit baths in about 1949 and as i 'm told i taught myself to swim at the age of two because it was my backyard it was probably the thing to do i left school uh and a third term in 1963 to train they tried to make me stay and said you 'll be sports captain next year i said no i 've got something to do meanwhile across the ditch the bethwaite family was sowing the seeds for olympic family sailing success frank and neil bethwait and their four children moved from new zealand to sydney in 1959. father was a great man he was a great pilot in the second world war flying in the pacific against the japanese forerunner to what is air new zealand he then went into small boat design and manufacture then wrote a number of books on the science and technology of sailing frank beth white is remembered as the father of high performance sailing with expertise in designing building and sailing boats with this pedigree it is not surprising children mark and nikki became dual olympic sailors and julian an olympic boat designer i sailed for australia in the 1972 olympics munich i sailed for australia in the 76 olympics which were at montreal with a sailing at kingston ontario and i was in the 1980 olympic team for moscow but that was the year that australia boycotted due to a war in afghanistan my name 's nikki bethwaite i 've represented at the 1988 games 1996 and 2004 88 in 2004 as a competitor and 96 as a coach my name is julian bethwait and i am not an olympian i have designed a number of boats and a couple of those boats are currently used in the olympics and a couple more are being considered we grew up in the east where in fact i went back for the 2017 world masters game so it was a nice homecoming i recall seeing boats sailing off the beach there and one day i expressed interest in sailing and that changed my life my father was quick to put an old boat under me so i started sailing when i was about six i always say we didn 't have a lot of choice in whether we went sailing or not if we didn 't go sailing we sat on the beach and we pretty quickly got tired of that so i 'm the youngest i 'm the baby i think of all the children i probably got the best out of both of my parents in the sense that my three elder siblings flew the coop and i stayed in the family business and that allowed me to have a very close interaction with both my mother and my father people talk about my father because whatever he put his hand to he did extraordinarily well look my first experience sailing would have been with my parents i think it was about curled up in front of a thing called an ns14 down at northbridge uh it was a family day they had to carry an extra person i was probably the lightest so it probably suited them down to the ground and yeah apparently my mother tells me i was singing songs most of the way around infuriating my father but that 's another thing when we came to sydney the family settled in northbridge and there was no sailing club there at the time there are a few people who did sail off the beach in clive park northbridge my father was actually instrumental in bringing that group together and forming the northridge sailing club i mean i remember curling up in the cockpit of the northbridge senior that mum and dad were sailing and that i 'd been three or four years old i suppose and and just i would have had no idea probably asleep for most of the race but anyway i guess that sort of just led on to i had my first boat when i was six and they were all built at home and first coat of varnish onto the plywood of the of whichever boat it was that was that that we just finished building so i started with northbridge juniors which was a design that dad introduced at northbridge sailing club and then i just sort of as i got bigger dad just built more boats that suited me the bethwaite family may have sown their sailing seeds out of mossman but the wilmots sailed into olympic success from the shores of mossman hello i 'm james wilmot i went to the 1984 olympics in los angeles a resident of mossman since i was eight years old went to middle harbour public school hi i 'm bob wilmot grew up uh youngest of six kids a single mom mum was a ballet teacher we had a water frontage in mossman and my brother loved sailing and he was very very successful at it and he learned at a very early age how to build boats i 'm nathan wilmot i represented australia at the olympics in 2004 in athens 2008 in beijing where we won a gold medal and more recently was rio my grandfather 's place was just down the road and next door to him were two very famous sailors who ian brown who won a medal in 76 and john dawling who was very competitive in naturals and stuff anyhow they had two little dingies and um i pestered them enough to be allowed to go sailing with them now and then and finally got a flying out of my own and i could sell that pretty well whenever i wanted from my grandfather 's place at the time we 'd sail from mossman cremorne around to walton 's boat shed down at balmoral and get a pie for lunch and a milkshake and a bit of sailing and sail home and it was good fun sailing wasn 't necessarily a war should i go sailing it was like when i was just that young kid going when 's it my turn can i go and uh for four years old jamie needed a crew one day and and he 's manly junior and i got the gong and just loved it and uh never looked back our weekends club and race at either middle harbour yacht club skiff club clontarf balmoral or northbridge sailing club and we would probably average three races a weekend at three different clubs mum was the dance instructor at middle harbour primary when i was there and it was just what i did same with sailing dancing was a big part of my life and uh so when it came to going overseas and needing funds to to do that mum would put on concerts so when i went to perth my sister rowena was competing in the flying and australian championships which i competed in but i 'm pretty sure i went to perth as a as a young whippersnapper when jamie went over for cherub worlds with my sister janine would have been competing then 1969 i was i actually learned to drive across the board one car had what two cherubs and a flying end on the top and the other car had a flying ant on the top we had four boats and two cars if it wasn 't until my second year in flying ants that we happened just started rolling from there [Music] the windsurfing it hit australia predominantly around 76 and so i 'm at school i 'm you know 14 years old i think my brother bought a windsurfer he was selling 18-foot skiffs at the time and he 's like i need to get fit so i 'll pick up a windsurfer and i would take it out i just couldn 't get enough of it we 're like well if we can race each other we 'll take on the world and um so we organized some australian championships around june of 77 at belmont sailing club so i 'm you know 15 i 've been watching my brother and sisters flying off around the world competing and i 'm like when 's the way to and as it turned out i won every australian championship from 77 till i retired in 84. 84 was the first year that windsurfing became an olympic sport middle harvey yacht club was a home away from home in the weekends for the wilmot children the 1960s and 1970s and then to their children in the 1980s brothers jamie and robert wilmont and jamie 's son nathan apparently when i was four years old watching dad compete in la in 84 and i turned her mom and said i 'm going to go and do that mum and i 'm going to do better than dad or along those lines and so the olympic dream for me is quite a long one and i mean obviously it was always going to be sailing yeah once i started saying that it was it was a great boat 83 was when the when we got going for 84 definitely didn 't spend enough time uh doing it we quite easily won the states and the nationals we had a very close olympic trials down adelaide we 'd only been in it for um five months or something and and i should have really started a year before it was good experience for when nathan came along and started his campaign that everything 's got to be perfect the idea i guess was probably sailor flying dutchman like dad did and he 's still got one still got it sitting woodwork but unfortunately that didn 't make it in or got kicked out of the olympics so next choice was a 470. and at the time when i was 17 i was a perfect size for it we had four kids at the time and you know it just it was hard it was hard work to balance everything and as it turned out we just didn 't put the right boat on the water in los angeles to have a good show striving for excellence brought these families together as they shared their olympic dreams and courage if you have success at club level then it 's natural to aspire to success at state and and national level to set your sights on an olympics is a different order of magnitude i hate to think how much it cost him but you 're talking half a million dollars probably back then in the 70s and he would have funded all that himself and nikki did the same thing and i watched um my two siblings do all this olympic stuff and i went i 'm not that stupid because really great aura around an olympian sure i mean you had dawn fraser and all those people winning gold medals and everything else but in the sailing field the ultimate sailing boat in the world was either the sydney hobart or the 18 footers and i just got sucked straight into the 18 footers so the the season in australia started uh the second week in september and finished at easter what we tried to do was extend the season by sailing in europe we took all the ideas we 'd learned from our australian season we 'd started building boats in january and shipped them to europe and then sailed those boats for three months in or one month two months in europe very intensively at the end of that those boats almost invariably got sold into europe because these were like having a ferrari and you couldn 't buy it anywhere but in australia well all of a sudden these ferraris and there weren 't very many of them we 're only talking about five or six boats we 're sitting in europe so we had people coming swiss francs on one of those trips we came back through the united states because i had to do an inspection of a site in rhode island and i ran into a guy called peter johnson so we decided to collaborate and that collaboration was the 49er and the 49er evolved extremely rapidly we were selling almost 150 boats a year before it was olympic we had this trial on lake garda in italy i mean i knew lake garter well because i 'd taken the 18 there as part of the european tour it 's just one of these meccas of sailing we won that trial comprehensively in the end the boat was endorsed almost 95 vote and from then on it 's just been a rollercoaster ride the people who sell the 49er into a lesser extent the 29 are evolving faster than the boat is and they understand that if we don 't evolve the boat they the boat can 't stay with them evolution is inevitable you just and to reject it is what 's the end of the class it 'll die i always look can i make it it 's actually very much my father 's philosophy come the summer of 63 64 my times were just getting better and better and better at the state championships that 's where i started to really show some ability then went into the nationals which i hadn 't been to before and came second to dawn fraser so i was selected on the tokyo 64 games team the headlines and has an olympic swimming team announced and you know you 're walking past something like that knowing it was you and that that that sort of thing that 's when the excitement started where in the southern hemisphere usually the lead up out of our summer times they used to take the swimmers up to townsville to train one good thing is we didn 't have to get up at four or five o 'clock in the morning to to go to wherever you trained because of the weather up there i think we started training around about seven or eight o 'clock in the morning so it 'd be a three hour session in the we went straight from townsville to brisbane to pick up the rest of the team we didn 't come back to sydney and flew to tokyo that 's where i picked up my big brother and mum and there was a place in with within the village called the international club where all the athletes met up at the end of the day and that 's where you got to to meet all the other competitors and that was fun every night i met a man called tim alexander when we were both undergraduates at sydney university he was doing architecture i was doing engineering we were selected uh independently to sail together with one other on the university sharpie in the intervarsity competition that 's how tim and i teamed up in the first instance we formed the view that we would make a good flying dutchman team of two and we had our first flying dutchman built in 1970 and we trained hard and won the australian championships in 1971. the olympic selection trials for 1907 for the 72 olympics were held on port phillip bay out of and tim and i prevailed in those trials and so we were selected from then on we did have some funding to go and compete in pre-olympic regattas in europe the montreal olympics were a lower key event but they were most enjoyable nonetheless to be able to get back for a second olympics and to compete again for your country is it 's it 's it 's just a marvelous [Applause] sense of achievement the quest is always for a medal uh i 've been fortunate to have won a number of world championships and so you could say that i picked in the wrong year they give me a great sense of satisfaction and achievement but i trade them all for even a bronze medal from a personal point of view it was it was incredibly exciting to represent your country and to sail in an olympic regatta is the culmination of a huge amount of work and ambition and the olympics themselves the 1972 olympics were a fabulous celebration of youth uh of germany 's reemergence following some fairly dark history in the second world war the whilst there was some bonding with other teams it was intensely competitive all that changed halfway through the regatta when the plo staged its invasion of the israeli team quarters in munich that happened whilst we were out on the water in keele we became aware of it as we sailed back towards the olympic harbour in keele and the security both on the water and on land just clamped down in a manner which was which changed the whole dynamics the whole atmosphere of those games it went from a very high level of as i say celebration to well let 's get on with this and get it over and done with the 84 olympics was uh quite an eye-opener for myself and um bruce wiley my brother was at the sailing event so the starting was the event was in long beach california which and we were in santa barbara california and the way the rules were made up we weren 't actually allowed to be on the water anywhere near long beach then in 1986 um the announcement came that there would be a women 's made a short list of of you know the people i would like to sail with and fortunately the the person on the top of the list was available and that was karen davis who became karen goynich and um and that sort of started a sailing partnership of about 20 years so that took us to uh career no funding available karen and i had to take out a bank loan guaranteed by our parents you know all this sort of thing to get a boat buy sales do the traveling hire a coach we sort of brought in a few innovations of our own um by being the first women involved we girls were the best performed of that olympics of all the sailors of all the boys in australia so in 1999 or in 2000 there was a boat selected that was just ideal for women and it was called an england now i 've been coaching the souling in uh atlanta and the england is just a scale down souling and we won selection to go to athens the lead up this time was so different ourselves the top 10 in the world and then we just sort of get stuck into our very regular regatta season in europe and it starts at the end of march and about every two weeks there 's a regatta over those six regattas you would get to know your competitors and and you 'd form your friendships we just had some great times and again still great mates with a lot of those people we didn 't go so well i didn 't have the same feelings of failure as before i did think that we could have done better and the upshot was i wanted to have another go with beijing in 2008. and and everything went well and we we got selected and we just come home from china uh for uh which was our last selection regatta having um secured our spot and uh i was off doing some cross-training on a mountain bike and i came off over the handlebars and ended up with a shattered shoulder and plates and all sorts of things and that was basically the end of my sailing career as was always what 's next what 's next and i met a guy who wanted me to do an 18-foot skiff he owned a gold mining company and his wife she had a aloe vera company said he 'd sponsor me for the olympics his company was square gold had a bit of a bit of a roll on and he helped me financially make the olympic team it was very different from 84 because i was the helmsman i was responsible for two other crew the two other crew were part of our team with bondi so i was responsible for funding for boat equipment for transportation of boats for yeah i was responsible for a program whereas before i was only responsible for making sure i had my harness and my shorts and got to the event on time there was a lot more responsibility a lot more campaign planning fitting in with the other coaches with the australian sailing team the olympics is not something you try it 's like uh give it a go for a year it 's like it 's not something you do like dad did and he 's still got one still got it sitting there ready for me to get it out of the woodwork but unfortunately that didn 't make it in or got kicked out of the olympics so next choice was the 470. i started malcolm page and originally we scrapped and begged and borrowed for the first tour we did of europe so he used his old boat we were training partners with the japanese for the 2000 olympics so we got a lot of equipment from them that we used and he was working for telstra i was working off and on with sale makers and wherever i could and so so we battled away for a little bit for that first year i guess but then when at the first worlds we did we got third so that put us straight on a level funding with the ais victor came in and started in 1997 with the australian team and he had just coached the ukrainians to gold medal in the men 's and a bronze medal in the women 's none of us could were doing and i think he was watching us capsize and thinking what have i got myself into probably still does at times but um yeah he was with us from from then basically day one that we started saying well i started signing 470 he was there and right up until we crossed the line in beijing in our way in athens we went into the olympics we were ranked number one in the world we were favourites i think well we were world champions we were european champions the our training partners were the gold medalists from sydney the girls so we 're pretty confident we went into athens just a little bit immature and we let a few little things get to us and ended up being a bit too extreme on the racecourse and just watched the metal get further and further away as soon as we finished i think we were even on the toeing going well gotta get ready for the next ones and there 's nothing gonna stop us so the lead up for uh china even though it was we did worked a better frame of mind we knew what we had to do and it was just up to us to do it and no outside thoughts going to change it and we executed it right at the end of the day after we won after we got ashore and i 'm not sure how that our a few of our team members came down to the boat ramp with a couple of beers for us and a little bit of a celebration and off you go to do the media program and go and talk to everyone and and then a couple of people come up to you and say all right all the medalists we got to go get drug tested by this stage all you want to do is eat and have fun after that though we went into a marshalling area which had thankfully mars bars and snickers and chocolate bars and watch all these six skinny guys that haven 't eaten for a year suddenly eating chocolate and putting on the tracksuit and getting ready to go and stand out and us listen to our own opening ceremony is it 's a long day but then when you walk out it 's quite an amazing feeling a hundred thousand people cheering and yelling and amazing feeling just to be to do the lap and then stay in the middle for a little bit see the fireworks at the end they had balloons they had dubs i think they had jets doing the olympic rings and that was about it apart from all the speeches and anthems and quite playing compared what we get these days to be on that podium you know it was it was just a celebration of the time that we spent together that was a special time for us getting off the plane going into the hanging and seeing all the family and tv cameras everywhere prime ministers it 's it was quite bizarre and got a message from the whoever was in charge of home saying yeah everyone put their medals on and watching the swimming girls just going like this putting on like they 're four medals and we put on our one so we let them go first and the rest of the gold medals us pretty much a high yes yes no it was exciting coming home and being greeted with you couldn 't move at the airport every olympic athlete it 's like being at the top of the pyramid and and all through here are all the people who 've supported you all the way through so you know the the result of of of that team or that individual at the peak is the result of a lot of effort from a lot of people any advice that i could give would be totally dated but i would say to anybody who aspires to competing for australia at the olympic games there is no greater honor well i guess is for a medal but i think the quest is to do as well as you can um to do your best once you walk away from your competitive career you really struggle to find something to replace it has it all been worth it and so forth from my perspective now it was worth every second part of the thing i think that you don something that you love as far as you possibly can and test your limits and you you never left wondering what if i 'd done something else no i don 't think i 'd change anything apart from my result just enjoy your position on an olympic team commitment and determination made their dreams come true mossman bounded on three sides by harbour waters provided the perfect backdrop to their success in the local clubs and communities supported these families i have lived in mossman many years and we had 21 very happy years there ray 's two children and i used to run and swim on balmoral beach pretty much every day it was a fabulous place to live and we still have very many dear friends and wonderful memories of our time in mossman it 's just a really nice friendly suburb which has suited us exceedingly well for a very long period of time and i probably die here try and sell twice a week once out of middle harbour and the other time out of um out of mossman bay the mossman i grew up in the middle harbour at the time middle hub yacht club skiff club we had so much talent we had some of the we probably had half the olympic team for many years out of you know a 5k radius i now sail out of middle harbour yacht club but i i race offshore on a sydney 36 called storm away and um and we have a great deal of fun and so again it 's this feeling of camaraderie um it 's it 's about sailing with people with a bit of purpose well my time career i mean it wouldn 't happen without mossman and middle harbour and grandma 's place just down the road from here where we are now i remember going off the wharf down where dad grew up and still there i think i 've still got three boats in the boat shed down there it 's just been our sailing home middle harbour either skiff club or the yacht club the support continues for current local olympians now facing the challenge of the unprecedented postponement of the 2020 olympics _"

    "text": "[Music] and i am the public programs exhibitions and media officer here at mossman art gallery uh before we get started i first want to acknowledge the traditional inhabitants of the land that we are meeting on this afternoon including the baroque borough people and acknowledge aboriginal elders past and present and pay my respect to them and their heritage so again welcome to our audience here in the gallery but also those of you who might be watching via facebook live thank you very much for joining us on this really lovely sunny day so thank you for coming indoors so this afternoon i 'll be chatting with of course the winner of the 2020 mosman art prize salati and then there 'll be a short opportunity afterwards for you to ask some questions so to introduce salati um so for over 15 years salahi tawali has exhibited and performed nationally and internationally most notably at the australian center for contemporary art sydney festival cambertown arts centre and spring workshop and parasite gallery in hong kong in 2017 she received the inaugural create new south wales visual arts meet and 2019 she was um she took a stray council studio residency in london for six months and was recently appointed as the associate lecturer of screen arts at sca at university of sydney so welcome saladi and congratulations once again for winning this year 's major prize um so to start off i thought i might um get us to talk about your wedding work which is um mangroves which is just over there in the corner for those who are watching from facebook do have a look at the picture on on social media and on our website um so yeah so what you might could begin about talking about ideas sort of behind the work and how it sort of originated okay thanks jane i 'd also like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet today and pay my respects to elders past present and emerging um and just glad to be here hi everybody there 's a handful of people sitting in front of me for those people online um yeah mangroves actually i started to make whilst in uh lockdown um gonna be a more of a half-life skull kind of painting and um i guessed like everyone else lockdown 's a solitary place even if you 're with your family it 's you know when you can 't go anywhere you kind of feel a bit uh trapped but so i think what happened was it the form became less of a skull but at the time i was just thinking about you know our situation and considering the environment and what our future might be and um also i often think about where i come from i come from the mangroves in a place uh in rawa in fiji and from northall and i was really thinking about how those mangroves have changed since i was a kid and they changed a lot due to progress they put a used to have to take a punt to get to the village and then they put a road in there and that really kind of changed the ecosystem so people were able to travel a lot easier but um what changed was like the animal life and just the bit nostalgic it 's a bit of sadness and a bit of nostalgia at the same time and i probably say that most of my work is situated in this idea of being diaspora so growing up in australia but also being from fiji and also having this settler colonial history here great um yeah so i was just gonna you 've sort of got on to my next point about sort of the overarching kind of concerns within your practice and and you 're talking about yourself cultural heritage and being from you know sort of those two um kind of you know having those two sort of heritage and that sort of um the conflict that that may raise but also um i guess what you touched on before about yeah that uncertainty or futures and things like that i 've noticed that that sort of um do you think that 's starting to become a a kind of a concern more concern in your practice at the moment that 's sort of like coming from things like covert and stuff like that and being locked down and take on more of a yeah i think it 's it 's always been there but i think it 's everything 's a bit heightened now about that but um i guess the materiality of things that i make is decided by not only these heritages that i speak of but what 's available to me now and um i guess my painting isn 't stretched on canvas it 's a hanging painting and it 's sort of there to mimic mussy or what people might know as uh tarpa which is this paperback material used in the pacific for a lot of things for exchange because it 's so useful it was used traditionally as clothing it also uh is probably most recognizable as having designs on it so you know it 's the closest thing i guess to a written language it 's still very much used in um in ceremony now and so i kind of thought i 'm not going to paint on a canvas at the moment what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to mimic musty i could i could buy i what i really wanted to do was make something that was a more like me which is sort of a hybrid of different cultures and so i i remake that by um getting paint and sometimes canvas and sometimes what 's that cotton calico yeah because with enough layers on that it does start to kind of mimic that but it 's a little bit different it also um isn 't as perfect as a canvas can be so there 's uh what i have to deal with is all of the like little imperfections that exist in that um i said i want to talk about materiality and materials a little bit more later on but um sort of before we go further i might sort of talk about how i guess maybe people who are more familiar with your work may be more sort of more known for sort of saying more of your video installation and kind of performance work um do you think the painting has taken on a kind of a bigger role within your practice recently definitely over probably the last five years after having lost a family member and i was trying to work out how to deal with those emotions while i was away and i started to paint also when you 're on a residency it 's easier to roll that stuff up and put it in your case than to make bigger things and i guess what i was trying to do was work out in those early paintings and drawings uh ways to articulate um the grief that i was feeling at the time and so actually because i usually make videos with myself in those videos it was a much more abstract form and part of working out how to articulate those feelings i also kind of i guess it was in not only the the abstract shapes that i was using but also the um i guess uh physics sometimes physically doing something helps you uh in your mind as well helps you with your emotions yeah yeah and so then i guess those those work started to turn up in my installations which i 'm very interested in installation because of um the way that uh i just started painting more because i was painting before for myself and and then now it 's become a part of the installations yeah yeah um did you paint much sort of earlier in your practice uh i did i actually started off as a photographer and i was really interested in landscape um landscape photographs but actually what i realized early on is what i was interested in was like walking into the landscape and sitting there and no matter how beautiful a photograph i could make from that it was never that same experience i liked sitting there having a reason to sit there eating a sandwich you know watching the light change and taking a photograph and so um and then paintings were sort of more of a background thing that was done based on a feeling or to exercise an idea and actually in actual fact i find drawing very uh like really great for my practice and great for working a lot of stuff out so paint for me painting and drawing often come hand in hand sometimes some of that feeling that to that or you know um and so along with that residency you 've done quite a lot of kind of overseas travel particularly in europe in the last five years um with the the fellowship and the residency in london i guess you talked about the sort of being on that other residency and being able to work through your grief and and also the um the i guess the more accessibility of of painting as opposed to putting together an installation being able to roll it up but what do you think that being in somewhere like somewhere like it being in europe and whether that has uh do you think whether that had a great impact on um your painting practice being in sort of yeah yeah and this painting in particular um because uh i was looking at archives of fijian stuff in cambridge as a part of my residency i was i went to innova to the stuart hall library i was looking at other kind of arts practices and particularly the history of black british art and film because you can also take a doing that and meeting artists and having conversations actually a lot of my time back in the studio in london was um uh like and thinking about these things that i was seeing and these photographs and the fact that these people that i may or may not be related to in these photographs were not around anymore but there was this kind of this image of them and clues to my heritage some things lost through like i guess colonial progress but those photos are still there which was i thought was kind of amazing and i guess drawing once again going back to drawing and sitting in the studio and painting and i mean the great thing about that residency is that six months and you can sit in your studio for three days and you can you know uh paint some things and throw things in the rubbish and you know you can work through stuff and you know i was looking at not only archive material but also contemporary practices so i um i got to see the work in of labana hemet who is one flesh and it just kind of really when you when you 're looking at them there 's two experiences i think you have especially as an art student is that you see things in the books here in australia and you i guess you get attached to artworks and then when you go and you see the works in the gallery it 's a totally different experience i think they 're both important but different like being there with the materiality of something the scale of it i just actually took me a while to kind of think about how i it was okay to like both things for different reasons yeah yeah um and you when you were talking about accessing those collections of fijian material and the photographs and things like that i mean what was that like to be on the other side of the world accessing you know your own kind of cultural heritage in this kind of quite sort of strange you know in this dis that sort of disconnection did that sort of kind of enforce that those feelings of that that sort of we 're living in this little farmhouse in cambridge and then we 're walking through what feels like could be an episode of vieira or some kind of like you know british crime drama series um and i remember being on a train with a friend and saying there 's a body in that field and they 're like there probably is we just don 't know how old it is um yeah and then to go in and look at the material and the material looks very different in um situation like because you it comes out it gets unwrapped you 're wearing gloves you know you fee feeling the weight of it uh all that kind of stuff is really amazing um and actually can 't_''_850.639 be experienced anywhere else other than in those collections and at the fiji museum they don 't have all the same things and um and it 's a real like treasure trove you do need a bit of guidance going through those things like you know three thousand objects you can 't see everything yeah um but having like conversations with i collections as well and pacific peoples who have gone to the collection so there 's a real kind of like need to kind of connect with different people in the community over there over here like it 's really um it was a really amazing experience but yeah i mean it 's now some of those objects are so old that um you know it 's i guess a privilege to be able to save him a blessing and a cursing say yeah i get to go on a trip to london but also like you know um all those objects are over there yeah yeah um you talked about this sort of previously but talking about you know exploring cultural identity you often place yourself and using your own body whether it 's in installations and live performance and photos i mean you sort of alluded to the half life skulls and and this painting but is do you do you see it as sort of like a self-portrait in any way i do i do a bit actually i feel like it 's also a bit of a think i had mentioned before it kind of got away from me and then i got it back again while i was making it and uh it yeah so it really ended up being about my feelings and i yeah i guess i do even see a painting as a performance in a way yeah yeah that 's interesting um because looking at some of your previous paintings that uh whether they 've been sort of the standalone paintings or paintings that you 've incorporated into installations you 've used kind of more geometric shapes and um and you 've cut thing you know you 've cut those shapes out and it 's um do you think that that perhaps your there 's been sort of like that kind of sort of evolution of your painting practice to be a little bit more sort of portraiture or more figurative or um it may seem that way i think because what you see in a show is not like everything that 's in your studio you know uh it is um a bit more um figurative in than maybe the things actually i 'm not those skull paintings really it 's just i think it 's not it 's a bit more delicate than this other kind of more um you know i spent a lot of time trying to make it look rough with less strokes and this is actually um actually has quite a bit of paint on it um and i think actually that is to illustrate more what the issues were in making it if that makes sense so it does have a quality about it that like maybe i would have stopped before now and started something new but when i was making this when i was quite feeling um quite lost in things yeah so yeah um i thought we could talk about your color palette um in some of your previous work you 've used the colors um black white and magenta but in this painting you 've got softer pink and the greens perhaps you could kind of talk about your thoughts behind your choice of color in in your work i think initially i had a really narrow palette because i was were photography and video self portraiture i was trying to look at a way of making a um a version an abstract version of myself uh in the representation of these kind of geometrical shapes myself and my family and my community and so i really kind of took from those musty paintings that i 'd musters that i originally had they 've got a limited palette so i was doing that but then actually when i went on my residency i bought a few more colors and you never look back yeah once you start mixing a few things and uh you just kind of get a bit caught in that right um and to get the fleshiness of something and then something that isn 't that fleshy and kind of get those contrasts with things yeah yeah so just sort of i think uh that residency was very uh was a really great time for me to expand that color palette yeah um and we sort of talked about that 's you talked about the joke those geometric kind of shapes and how they are in your previous family members do you want to maybe oh yeah i guess i guess the thing is like um you know like musty designs are sort of a a language within themselves and actually a language that i don 't understand that well and so um i think the things i make are just as much about what i don 't know as they are about what i have i 'm learning at the time and so i think those geometric shapes actually more relate to personal experiences of family dynamics rather than like actually speaking to an older language that i don 't speak and um in the painting for those who are watching at home there 's um you 've got this sort of a dormer that 's placed uh above their head which is being made out of is it top holland yeah it 's a tarp and sulu which is um is that the word it 's a wrong kind of material and it 's like a rosette that i 've made there and so it is like you know for me that discussion of different histories from like that colonial history and so fiji in here and so um uh so for those who are questioning i didn 't know i was going to win i didn 't put my winners i think it was our i don 't know it was one of those kids programs and one of the we took them around and one of the little girls um thought it was because solady had one that was you use different types of adornments in lot of your work i do because i think actually you know the value of of materials is uh subjective to how much you need them and what you need them for and so something like a tarp is invaluable in actually can be invaluable in both kind of situations in fiji it 's used to complete a temporary room or cover something in australia it 's used to cover stuff keep it you know keep your things safe um but yes and it also has kind of replaced a traditional material that you would or uh something natural that you would cover to protect something with so i was painting kind of um deciding about the painting it was gonna be uh on down lower and just sort of making the painting longer by um being attached to the button but i started painting it quite um low um and then i was going to add in say some hair uh but then whilst i was painting it i sort of decided that i would complete the balance of the composition by placing it up higher and you know then its symbology also becomes even a little more symbolic yeah yeah um i think if some of you may some regular visitors who may have come to our new sacred show that we did with parramatta artist studios back in 2018 uh celotti uh was in that exhibition and uh she had um an installation video installation up upstairs and as part of that you had um quite a long kind of sort of a large and dormant adornment hanging from the ceiling and it was sort of um yeah um yeah above that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um those kind of um sort of like lay that you get in a two dollar shop but i think that five or six went into this uh with the same color kind of palette that we were talking about a limited color palette and so those kind of endowments once again about as much as i know and i don 't or as much as like seen as pacific culture and what is and isn 't and how culture is always changing and moving and so you know some things are put in there as a point to something else that has existed or as a fake yeah something fake fake pacific you know and yeah and so there was tarp in that and video and all it incorrugated iron so i do try to balance out the materials between something that is maybe more traditionally seen as a art material and then some other material that speaks to you know like existence and living in the world and and you know using natural materials like shells and things like that as well yeah yeah yeah but also like thinking about where i get those materials from from an experience with people so actually when i 'm making an adornment that that will relate to our relationships or something that has taken part and because i feel like if i necessarily like if i just grab anything i 'm not i kind of need to feel something for that material and it needs to kind of have a relationship to the idea somehow well i thought i might we might talk about sort of prizes now because it 's sort of like it 's prize season at the moment with the archibald uh and the other sort of art gallery new south wales prizes that were announced last week and yeah and uh the salmon prize winner marrakeet santiago was also in that show yesterday at the same time um yes so yeah thank you very soon i had some paintings upstairs so that was very exciting for us as well um and lots of great winners in um the archipelago and the win and the swimming this year which is great um and we 've got dishes ghosts and lots of other prizes coming up so sort of a simple question but what was what was going through your mind when you realized that you had won that fifty thousand dollars well it 's interesting how much you think that you haven 't won something even though only you and other people who 've maybe won something in the room and a few others and uh one by one the names get announced for different prizes and you 're the only one who hasn 't been announced but you can still tell yourself oh i came here for nothing yeah so it 's sort of uh of course it 's amazing to win a prize and it definitely does a lot for your practice and um it 's also like anyone in the room could win you know and so it 's sort of you just don 't know what experience have you had with prices have do you enter many prizes or is it something that you i do sometimes uh i think a prize isn 't just about winning it 's also about being in that show and the exposure of people seeing you you 've won a prize so you could help answer that question uh yeah i mean because some artists might it can i guess be sometimes introspection i guess oh yeah the process of entering and yeah i guess you enter not expecting to win um maybe enter hoping to get into the final um it 's sort of like grant writing like you enter and you try for things but it 's almost like the lottery that you even though you go to more effort than just buying a lottery ticket once that you 've entered something you kind of have to forget about it because it may or may not come to fruition um all right well um one last question is this a harder one no not really what 's in store for the future do you have any kind of exhibitions or anything that um might be coming up that you can tell us about uh what can i tell about i do have a few exhibitions like a lot of other people i think um we have i had two years of exhibitions that are been kind of announced yet but yeah i do have a few um exhibitions in other states so hopefully the borders will open up soon um that well that brings me to covert 19 and how that what kind of sort of impact it had on your i mean you talked about your exhibition timelines and things being sort of compacted but how did it affect your your sort of your making you know that did it or you know was it better was it worse was it the same i guess it 's that thing when you 're making stuff you 've rather got a good job and a studio and you can 't don 't have any time to work in it or you have not a great job and you can 't really you 're nervous because you can 't necessarily afford to always work in the studio and so i guess i was like a lot of people kind of slowed down it was a bit difficult to think about making stuff for a while there um but that kind of uh balanced out a little 't know like other people i sort of when my shows were cancelled for this not cancelled like moved into next year all of a sudden works that i was working on um kind of had a different feeling and meaning and how do you kind of like continue making that same thing the same way and so it 's been a bit of a slow down but i 'm really lucky to have those shows so it 's not actually a complaint as much as it is about re like you know this is a readjustment about how we live in the world we can 't like go back to the way things were before so um i guess i make things a bit slower at the moment would be the way to say that thank you now does anyone else have a question for that society um john yeah obviously this is a painting prize like the mossman art prize and you 're a multi-disciplinary artist i 'm really interested in the question of like how relevant is paint to contemporary artists you know uh yeah yeah um to always be that discussion about painting being dead painting instead yeah it 's obviously really great at resurrecting it i 'd never actually died and you know it 's uh i mean i use it as a medium so i 'm i think it 's very relevant there 's a lot of um i 've had to answer that question it 's like saying that about anything like the great thing about being an artist is you get to make stuff you get to make ideas represented somehow and um i mean painting you know there 's a lot of people who only paint and you of course it 's such an amazing medium um you know you could you could be almost painting the same picture for the rest of your life and there 'd be so much for you to do in that like in the reiteration of that that picture you know it 's um i think it 's got such a like uh intense history it 's kind of amazing to see like even just looking around in this show the different styles and subject of go oh it 's always going to be something to consider is that is that kind of what a difficult question does anyone else have a

well cast in the surprise around every corner everywhere we walk we find something new down the road be family-friendly definitely in the city step and what we 'd like to see lots of ways for months with prints access the beach and have Lake you know trails walking trails what I like about Mossman is it has like a lot of trees and like spaces open spaces and wonder what it 's like to see in the future is it 's not that one of my tracks and stuff so yes go back to Exodus what I like about Mossman is that there of things for young children to do and it 's a safe suburb for a younger or family of any size very family-friendly suburb for what I 'd like to I 'd like to see Mossman continue to be a safe and thriving suburb for families something that could be improved perhaps is the traffic flow on Military Road I love must not I love the community feel of it and I hope it never changes 10 years time I hope it never changes what I like about Mossman is its marvelous mix of being close to the beach must be with Balmoral which is just superb catch a bus into the city ten minutes of the city you can love the shops here good restaurants what more could you want what I like to see in my

of thing thank you so what do I like about Mossman I just like the feel of community feel very much that friendly families it just all comes alive especially on the weekend what I 'd like to see in mossman 's future is probably a little bit more traffic flow what I like about Mossman is its proximity to the city you can be very close to the city and you can come back here and so it 's just best of both worlds but I 'd like to see in the future for those men some nice trees we can do a bit more and you know I think it will reflect the changing demographic of Crossman as well what I like about Mossman here the parks and what I would like to see in the future is leave it the same what I like a lot most money 's it 's a beautiful setup next to the beach so it 's a beautiful little town and with lots of nice interesting cafes shots yeah what I 'd like to see a Muslim in the future maybe a little bit more shots what I like about Mossman is Barbara Beach for an inner-city Beach you _''_423.159 in Muslims future is focus on more urban infill to allow more people to live here rather than try and keep people out what I like about husband is as close to the I like the outdoors and having the ovals for the school for the kids to play sports in and I 'd like to see more of that in the future more activities more people making open what I like about Mossman is the zoo the great

people though know faces and it 's a community and what I 'd like to see future is to protect our heritage and stop any more horrid developments of beautiful Federation houses what I like about Mossman number one it 's a village that 's why I came here and it 's a community but the concern for me is the roads parking and and the footpaths what I like it and that it 's a really good place to bring up children and I think I suppose the thing I might see in the future is less traffic because I mean this bit is pretty busy I 'm in love with Mossman market some I love coming to the markets once a month I guess one of the things I 'd really like to see in Mossman is a few more useful stores not so much for me but you know I 've got a daughter that 's 20 and I just find some that 's what I like about Muslim is a sense of community there 's a real collaborative atmosphere and feels like a village and what I 'd like to see you must miss future is a bit more in nightlife I think it 'd be great to have some live music venues and some places are often a bit later as well I love because we are a fabulous community where independence and in the future I would like to see that we grow in a direction that everybody 's happy about that the community need to do we 're going to provide more parking which I hope will happen and it 'll just be a most gorgeous joyous place to share with the rest of Sydney as well what I like about my son is the village lifestyle and and what I like to see in most minutes future is I guess more type events that encourage community getting people out and about I just like markets like this and the classiness of them we 're just saying you know you know of market bam and beautifully set out and a lot of it in amongst all the coffee shops and you know

    "text": "unless you 're indigenous we all come from somewhere else migrants to Mossman shares the stories of some of those that came from somewhere else and settled to start a new life in Mossman I came from Jerusalem Palestine that was Bernie Rome Jewish party a was was born in Mook Ron and the south of Belgium I was born in Montelongo reading in England small town called window and I was born in anything I 'm born in Montreal in Canada Berlin Germany China service Belgrade in Serbia Devon in the United Kingdom [Music] mossman 's rich migrant history began just a few days after the first fleet landed in Sydney Cove when Mossman Bay was included in a detailed survey of the harbor in June 1789 the Europeans returned to Mossman Bay to repair HMS serious the bay was described as a place where the men were less likely to meet with temptation to idleness and bad company for six months the crew of the serious became the first migrants to Mossman the seeming remoteness of Mossman and the perceived threat of the Australian bush meant that any in the early 19th century some of the few inhabitants of Mossman included former Irish convict Thomas O 'Neill who was farming at Balmoral fellow Irishmen Barney Kearns who was operating a ferry service across middle Harbor and bunger II and a group of Aborigines from the broken Bay Area who had been settled on George 's head it wasn 't long before Scottish immigrant Archibald Mossman arrived in the 1830s and established a successful whaling station giving the suburb its name by the mid 19th century the Whalers and ship repairers had moved on and Mossman once again became a quiet backwater a smattering of migrants from non-english speaking backgrounds provided some diversity to mossman 's population land developer Vincennes sahil from Austria captain blinks a Swedish master mariner and our ghost felon from Germany all settled in Mossman there were also the transient migrants the Chinese market gardeners at shoal Cove and the residents of the artists camps at Balmoral and serious Coe into this scene swept Irish immigrants businessman and property developer richard hayes Harnett senior used to wooing visitors on weekend ferry trips Mossman harlot could settle in 1893 Harnett 's son sharing the same name and vision of his father became mossman 's first mayor and together they were responsible for opening up Mossman as a desirable place to live in the late 19th century the boom times began and Mossman was right for migration around this time wool buyers were flocking to Sydney from Europe and Japan and many settled in Mossman these business migrants particularly the vibrant french-speaking community bought a certain urgency quarter Mossman one of these buyers was george parmentier who migrated from Luke Rohl a town in the south of belgium renowned for its wool mills my understanding is that a lot of the French and Belgians were the young people were interested in going to places like Australia to seek their fortune because in 1905 George 's brother Joseph came out to Australia and established himself as a as a wool buyer and then in 1913 approximately I think George came out and followed his brother and that was the beginning of the story of their time in Australia and it was interesting because it became a French enclave arrived until 1935 I think he had done very well in 1919 George Parmentier married Adele Biagio daughter of wool buyer charles module they resided in a grand house now demolished BOCES room at 182 Raglan Street Mossman he had engaged a fairly well-known architect Adrian Ashton and it was a very substantial piece of land it went from Raven Street at the front to shed for Street at the back it wasn 't a rectangular was kind of a triangular block so that would have would have cost quite a bit I suspect there was parquetry flooring throughout five bathrooms don 't I can 't remember a full servants quarters that there was a most career a marble staircase that went up and that was all imported from Italy there was a cellar that you went down and it had a very distinct smell and down there there were little mini bottles of coca-cola and tins of Petit Pois and pate and wines of course I wasn 't allowed upstairs why don 't you uh we used to play hide-and-seek in their wardrobe it was he also had his belt so you could see the initials inside the house I mean III touch statues of things which if he did in a museum today be arrested I mean they were just amazing artworks it was extrordinary place the main lounge room had a full grand piano and they used to have notes where opera singers would come and they 'd all be in their gowns and dressed and mum has a lot of memories of sitting listening to wonderful opera singers in the home a lot of it was the French community but those nights I think it was a pretty good cross-section but the French were always ledecky bears and the place and the lamb are arms and the lieutenant 's they were always around I think I 'm not sure how they 're regarded by the community I think because they did very well for himself and then perhaps because you know the French Belgians there might have been perhaps seen as a different class of people it was an exciting life for the wool buyers of Mossman he would spend half the year you 've go and his apartment was next to door next door to salvador dali 's and he took my husband and i they were had in adjoining door took my husband and I and once and sinned the middle of Dali 's living room was a bathtub ya reckon there what perks I don 't think it was all business no god no they had a wonderful time they took the families they could afford to have a nanny and the governess so they still had their schooling going on on the ship and while they were away we know that when he when he was visiting Salvador Dali oh the painting Dali did a painting of him a portrait so oh we know where that went oh I don 't_''_418.54 it went to one of his lady friends well there we are in 1982 almost 70 years after arriving in Mossman Gorge Parmentier passed away so he literally died with a glass of but du bonheur on his head yeah I think it would have been happy with that after the stock market crash of the 1920s and the Great Depression government supported by the opposition began accepting refugees from Hitler 's Europe the circumstances in 1935 as you can imagine being a Jew was that we were going to be persecuted and things were going to change and Hitler was rising to power and things were very very complicated and in 1937-38 we realized that we have to get out but it was a time where Hitler said okay get out leave your things you can 't take anything with you but we will allow you to get out if you can we knew we had left our our family which was two grandmothers and they were only in their 50s and the young aunt who was only in her early 20s and said we will send you visas as soon as we know where we land and we did but it was too late already so that was in 1938 already too late and they 'd been arrested and put into concentration camps the aunt aged 22 or 23 was in the warsaw ghetto and then put into concentration camps and none of them survived and my parents had check things out in Poland that letter was still sitting in them in the post office Eve 's family escaped Germany but their initial destination was not Muslim in fact not even Australia and so we boarded a Japanese ship which was heading for Shanghai we stopped in Singapore and officials came on board British officials and said are there any engineers on board and my father was an engineer we 're building an aerodrome as they called it would you be able to assist us with this construction well he said yes and we got off and we 're in Singapore then for two years and my father had a wonderful position and it was a wonderful life for us refugees Mossman was also welcoming refugees local GP tag homes and his wife Margaret established the 50-50 Club in 1939 where each week an equal number of their Australian friends were invited with an equal number of new Australians to their home for a social evening of music singing dancing and meanwhile the refugees were on the move in Singapore after two years we were rounded up and there Austria and from Germany and the British rounded us up and said we 're going to ship you out as enemy aliens because the Japanese are coming into the war and so we will put on would you believe the Queen Mary the ship which was then turned around in Australia as a troop carrier and we were sent to what we knew nothing about Australia with the outbreak of the Second World War previously accepted migrants Germans Italians Japanese and Hungarians were interned or kept under police surveillance we were under guard we were taken to a an internment camp in tuturro near Shepperton in Victoria the situation was that they were actually detained for two years my parents decided to send me to a children 's home in Melbourne a Jewish children 's home from the Jewish world for organisation what of a sudden they realized the authorities realized that these were really genuine refugees and the next thing my father was put into the Army it 's a fact for Australia I mean things were so crazy in 1949 the Department of Immigration was established and headed migration from Europe the mission on which I am now embarking is vital to the nation I am going abroad to seek ships or immigrants if we have no ships we shall get no immigrants and without immigration the future of the Australia we know will be both uneasy and brief as a nation we shall not survive mentorships I will guarantee to load them with the right type of our future babe Mossman Council made use of core walls displaced persons resettlement scheme and employed post-war migrants for road and footpath repairs housing them in a newly built prefabricated migrant hostel at Ross and park core was scheme of populate or perish transformed Australia and between 1949 and 1965 more than two million migrants came to our shores in 1945 now I am nine years of age the war ended and we we just thrived Australia was a fairly naive country and even though they didn 't speak very good English I mean they were not you know it was a case of simulating but they had a marvelous life Kerry Pappas came out in 1948 from Nicosia Cyprus was know all the buildings and there was a quote from the wall there is everybody was living he used to go to the cinema room and then on the cinema for this Australia come to Australia with a point like this we need you we complain the world when we was on this plane if you call it two propellers so hopefully I never forget this they will say hundred thirty people and they 're solely on the size of the playlist with the finest footage to see the rest of the people on the ground it was five days oxide in the air was something newly and get away from the war and the feminine of this and then here was freedom you have no your father tell you what to do for your mother yeah yeah was free in these immediate post-war years Australia was second only to Israel in the proportion of migrants accepted at the time Palestinians were being forced to migrate one of my earliest memories is actually witnessing the terrorist attack of the King David hotel in Jerusalem we stopped at barriers just collapsed in front of my eye and my memory of it was that my sister was sitting in the backseat started to laugh hysterically and I began to cry and I still have that very vivid memory of that and one day tanks rolled down our street with a hit loud hailer to say you 've got to leave your property otherwise you will be shot and so they started to organize convoys for Palestinian Arabs to leave their homes and their towns and we drove through the night through the desert because of course it 's cooler we left portside very late at night it was lots of lights lots of activities and my aunt my mother 's half-sister gave me this ring as a present and I 've still got it that 's the only thing I have from Palestine we were met at the boat by my uncle and his family he was living in a big house very sadly no longer there in Cremorne and we actually lived in the ballroom the house was so big it had a ballroom and mum and dad slept on on the floor and the in the in the ballroom we became stateless refugees because there was no longer a Palestine the second wave of post-war migrants arrived in the 1950s and 60s seeking employment and better living conditions many Greeks and Italians and by this stage Chinese too came from rural towns when they first arrived their farming skills were put to use as market gardeners and cane cutters for them it was an opportunity to create a better life in themselves because looking back through the history but what what they were doing in China there were market guns very poor and my my mother talks about the times that you know were growing up in her era that food was shortened and and as always sort of going for a hungry whereas when they came to Australia there the opportunity to make their own wealth and grain but he create a better future for themselves and for us they 're like cut care for three years when I come back to Sydney I got a job in a delicatessen the key and then I would live for of my friends he was a waiter I used to work at this place called the in York Street I was making only about ten pounds a week and he was making thirty thirty five and as luck just you remember whether as a conical job they slowly recalled a job in there and then I never looked back I was best time of my life are their family businesses were a common feature of their migration experience and Milk bars green grocers fishmongers delicatessens restaurants and boot makers were all run by migrants in Mossman Wesley lose parents came out from China to find a better life they worked hard and eventually opened lose restaurant in Mossman my family came to Australia the wind took open to working in a Chinese restaurant which was called the Kentucky lounge I believe that is still operating today my father came out in 1951 to get some money and to presumably just as a set up house then my mother came out afterwards to start spending life in Australia when my parents came to Sydney as I opened up a of all moved from an Adele to Mossman they started their own Chinese restaurant in Mossman they operate the wrister on their own because by my father was the cook and the mother did the waitressing and the serving in the restaurant the restaurant opened in 1966 I don 't record there were many other restaurants in the air because I do recall people ring up and say that they wanted a whole dinner to be prepared and and they brought Horseman 's in so they brought me into the kitchen and as the food was prepared to put them into source one and people would take them away in their own source Minh so that was something that that odds I didn 't think was any any other ordinary Inc but looking back now so I don 't think anyone does it these days when when my parents moved from 692 down the road to 639 which I rode the new restaurant that they started and wallpaper had tablecloths and and dimmable lights so the whole restaurants were proposed a bit more upmarket than what the first one was by this end there were still challenges for the lose but the restaurant was thriving and so were the children mcgirt 's spoke basic English I suppose there was enough to get them by to to deal with customers and as we were growing up you know Louise or interpretive message of stuff for my parents you know bein yeah yeah under 10 no I didn 't really notice any differences but he but looking at the old school photos is sort of easy to pick take my photo alpha class photos because I was the only Asian in the class photo because even back then there was was not much of a Chinese community in in the Mosman below area but for myself growing up in Mossman I 've I just didn 't receive any difference being other than popular local Muslim community now but Pinelli came from the rural community of Montelongo in tuscany his uncle Luigi Benelli was the first one of the family to come to Australia in 1938 Albert 's father migrated in 1950 with his cousin and soon realized if they were industrious and hard-working in that sent for him he said well you 're going your mother will follow when we accumulate the necessary finances to to follow I left Italy in 1953 my mom gave me a little I know out of her Rosen or what to do and what not to do and my mama had put a pocket in order more seamless and that net was over the list in my heart after a year at school I could speak to get by with English I left school and I started working full time crow 's nest in the there was a fruit shop nearly five five ways my father was worried at that time was working in the made a hospital and he worked for the the beginners they began lived in muslin and my dad used to work there weekend 's doing the gardens well it was a busy time but if my brother time he 'd worked in there as well my brother was an apprentice mechanic excuse me at night time he was an usher at the North Sydney cinema forth him owned by Bob Brianna and his have been willing to make great sacrifices to do so don 't we have to get a house as a moment mom and sister become so we ended up we 'd look around the speed junction in student realist arrogance offices till we found what our weight aboard has 250 pounds we handled them we are down to 1,100 something that was in vaudeville right Mossman husband was a bit of the backwater service page and properties were cheaper Mossman was the place to live for the Pinelli family and with Albert 's sister Erma marrying local fruit or a Matthew arena Mossman conveniently became the place to work for Albert too because he didn 't really know a lot of people around muslin he said well when about by the Fruit Shop I want you to come and work for me muslin was very sort of primitive in a way you do build up customers building up custome is very easy he is small you 're polite you gather your way to please the customer and they come back you build up the relationship building up relationships for Albert to arenas this time the deli not the fruit shop the daily groove business was to such an extent that PS to start that early to prepare the harder you work the luckier you become we had a reputation we used to start at 30 we 're Sinkin delivery of bread at five o 'clock we had to have X number of rolls ready for a lot of try these you bring the best the best from every day you get the best from here and life goes on another hard-working family the Pataki 's from palestine arrived in australia in 1950 and ran a corner store at 45 the Esplanade Balmoral until Gordon Betar G retired in late 1969 my dad would have wanted to have his own business because he had a very big l shop in Jerusalem and which sailed which sold electrical goods something like Harvey Norman people said to him if you want to buy a business go into the food business because people always want to eat it was a mixed business of grocery store and it was subject also to the rules of to sell groceries so they had to be boarded up so the groceries couldn 't be seen you could serve milk shakes and lollies oh absolutely ice creams lollies yeah sandwiches no groceries unlike today Balmoral Beach in the wintertime was empty but as soon as the weather heated up and people can the place got very busy nuts and that 's where we were required on hand to help especially on weekends weekends were in the summer weekends were a nightmare as far as I was concerned I really wouldn 't know where the place was very very busy family homeownership and often business ownership were high priorities for many Mossman migrants but it wasn 't always an easy path well there so work in nightclubs I missed so much money but I gamble it gambled partying castle a year and I had nothing when I couldn 't read it I came back from the honeymoon hundred pounds that 's all I had look if I 'm wrong I said to my wife we 're not going now no party no nothing he said we 'll go to the from below let 's eat I don 't need a chiasm anybody I sold a car and I say my mind there was a little house for sale figured out at the corner of Velma road and bad way road he say yeah this house he was about five thousand pounds that 's all he was and then they gave me the man up at that house I bought the show with the key a circular key they 'll talk girls of mixed business and from then on I went on and I put another shop her out and then more another show later on and I made this Jewish fella friend of mine he says to me you could exist URI you the stupid that 's why he says to me get a shop where you stay there and you work in history national poojas to me you make the money work for you know you for the money anyway that 's what happened and then I went on and on I had a shot in my time not all post-war migrants came to Australia looking for work and Italy in 1955 as Maria Teresa polyarny with all the glitz and glamor that comes with being a former Miss Italy and an international model so when I was about 17 I started to model in Italy and I was in Pitti palace in Florence doing some showing for the buyers of the world and somebody from Davy Jones was there and apparently they wanted to do a very big Italian exhibition in Sydney with clothes and cars and everything really and they asked four of us if we were interested with the agent obviously you know and I said oh yes yes you know but of course in those days you know I was only 17 so basically I had the permission of my mother which my mother said that you must be mad and eventually you know we went to solicitors and so on and my mother gave permission and it was a fantastic experience actually the same you know very well chaperoned and it was it was pretty amazing yeah four models we came to Australia with Qantas we took 78 hours to get here we stopped pilots in Singapore and my English was really bad and I did a bit of a gaff there one night because we went to dinner and then we started to dance and I just said I was so tired you know because I suffer from jetlag tremendously and I said okay now we go to bed and so they made big joke all through the thing you know about this and then we got to to Sydney and came to the Australia Hotel and we started work and it was a very hard work because we had 200 garments to show twice a day in Davy Jones and that was here for months and then we went to Queensland then we went to Adelaide Perth Wagga and also to New Zealand Terry came to Australia for work and stayed for love well there was a guy here that was a navy of Ann Handley you know the Fiat people and he was here to bring the chin sano the drink you know just started and he wanted us to go to his house and have a party and so on but eventually we said okay and that 's what I meant John yes but I didn 't like him very much so you know we just I just sort of trying to take me home and I didn 't want him to take me to back to the hotel because I didn 't know him you know but anyway he was very persuasive so it took me to the hotel and then he started to ring and then follow us all over where we went you know it was a bit mad so that 's what he did they took a car to come to Brisbane for the weekend and the car broke down 150 kilometres from cinder and so they left the car there then I run back with with the taxi or something to the airport and took a plane back you know just madness of those days you know one stage his mother said he wanted to meet me because you know we were in the papers all the time so we were fairly well known by then and so yes we went to dinner with his think I was a bit shocked for him for his mother because I owed the summers Peregrine left half of them because I didn 't like the wife and he told John I was a very extravagant so it to be very careful John Carew and Maria Teresa Polly re married in Sydney in December 1956 it was a small wedding we married at Riverview with the French priest and then the reception was at this mother 's house poor John put up with a lot well when we were first married because I really did not cook after the first year of marriage in Melbourne the newlyweds with their new baby headed back to Sydney first queenscliff and eventually Mossman well from queenscliff we came to MouseMan quite often and I quite liked that you know the atmosphere well though there wasn 't very much fun was very compared to today it was very expensive and he was the sort of person that had to have cash to buy everything so we actually didn 't buy a house for eight years but and then of course you know the had a heart attack and died suddenly you know some years later I met Joe bit but somehow you know it was such a great man that things happen and we got married in 1980 and he was one of the greats of most men by the way in painting Terry 's died in the fashion world and stayed in Mossman then they 1987-88 I opened the bonnet Bennett and shop in muslin we had to have everything from Italy it was therapy expensing we had to pay for all day the things coming from Italy in advance so and then of course there was the big stock market fall and you could see immediately what happens you know people weren 't buying anything much so IJ enjoyed it you know Balmoral enjoy the shops now you know I enjoyed the vfi of this place in the early 1970s with a Labour government elected a policy of multiculturalism meant migrants were to be chosen according to personal and social attributes and occupational group rather than country-of-origin Alessandra Pucci was born in Eritrea to Italian parents and after her schooling returned in 1970 my father was a journalist he had founded an Italian newspaper because at the time there were many many Italians not only in Eritrea but all all along the Middle East Ethiopia which was the the biggest country next to it took over my father who had been in his papers he had been going for the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia he was it was given 48 hours to leave Alex was already studying in Italy and soon her husband Gino Pucci would be encouraging her to come to Australia and settled in Mossman there was a visiting Australian fellow Janne Blundell and so she spoke a lot about Australia fantastic country blah blah and so my husband was you know I was enticed and he said why don 't we go and she managed to get him a contract for two seasons when the job was over he said I like the country like to stay and I wasn 't convinced at all and eventually I decided it Australia was better he set up his own company and he called it with Islam our own name up a factory to make them make handbags and shoes so the very first day we were in in Sydney he took us to Balmoral Island and and my husband turned to me and he said I want to live here Alex 's husband Gino was an entrepreneur in the fashion world whereas Alex who had studied pharmaceutical chemistry and genetics in Italy had more difficulty finding a job and I did apply and I had 200 responses all negative no one wanted to deploy so I decided to go you know from the bottom and and I found a job as a technician in a pathology lab and and when I demonstrated that I knew what I was doing I could get a job with as a research assistant at the University and when I did that that professor said look realistically with your Italian degrees you 're not going to go anywhere and you better do a PhD here and I did Alex went from strength strength creating the first biotechnology company in Australia in 1981 and when I was in the States I saw the very very exciting that I came back and said I 'm going to do it in Australia and I got some initial funding from my husband and a friend of these and then I went to the and and I set up a really advanced laboratory and and then I went to the to the government and I said look I 've done my feet now it 's it 's up to you and and they were very direct actually they 're very very generous and they founded me for the next five years the accolades continued for Alex and so does her researching and writing on topical scientific issues so 86 was business Woman of the Year 87th I became an officer of the Republic of Italy 9 88 was the officer Australia after that I became being a director a non-executive director ins itself not a number of different companies one of these companies was the Sydney IVF company it 's a fertility company and he 's relevant because this book contains it the story of that government policy and world events continued to shape migration in the 1970s and on skilled and business migrants growing up in Montreal food and cooking were strong influences for Sarah 's doll Pharaoh owner and head chef at the beta 's Pavilion at Balmoral Beach we always had a huge garden my father was an amazing gardener my mum was a cook of the family she would cook do the meal my grandmother was a used to be like a caterer she used to work in lumberjack camp with a team of men she was a big influence in my life as far as cooking also because she caught a cook in a semi semi professional way and since it was well I had an uncle there was a professional chef and he was one of the famous chef in Canada that used to run in big hotels and and I got my first job through him and I got employed there as a as a kitchen and so washing pots and pans and I had never came in contact with other nationality and it was very french-canadian where it was and suddenly there was a Haitian that came from IAT that used in the pots and all that there was Swiss chef there was French chef there was Italian waiter as it was it was fantastic was German it was all those different nationality and I got not only the bug working in the kitchen I love the environment but also the fact that all those people came from somewhere else and eventually the the head chef said to me why don 't you go to cooking school you know because he could see I was really enjoying it and I applied to the best cooking school in Montreal and I couldn 't accept it when I graduated then they gave me a job which was a funny title there was called chef on ice and chef on ice meaning that you you wear a bit like a person that would help anywhere that they need it so we had seven Hotel in our district I would go from Sherbrooke to Quebec City to Cornwall to Ottawa you know after doing that for three four five years I decided that maybe it was time to have a take a different direction you was kind of ready to to take a posting overseas eventually the phone call came in and they say Sydney Australia so I went to the library and in the library they had a beautiful and I look for a book on Australia but there was a book on Sydney beautiful book with all the photo of the beaches the lifestyle there the the the Red Roof and remember and the boating the sailing and all that and laughs and I know I I was absolutely blown away IRA always will remember that book that just suddenly made me realize that I was going somewhere else and I said the lifestyle of Sydney and I was hooked from that day on you know so I came to open the region hotel in Sydney I was second in charge with the kitchen and it was a very large kitchen and it was a very visible tell was the first true five-star hotel in Australia I remember the president of the company that owned the company came in one time he told the general manager the director for the beverage and myself we thought we were doing pretty well because old Irishman was full every single day and he organized for the three of us to go to California at that point of time there was the explosion of Californian cuisine it was very much a new way of eating a modern way as opposed to being very classic and French and formal it was the beginning of the chef the chef came out of the kitchen the personality was a chef the food was what people came for the legend of California cuisine Jeremy Tower years later credited surges use of fresh natural and local food as influence and the real creator of the California cuisine social success in the Regents flagship restaurant cables led to his creation of the chef 's table whence it was supposed to be just for one night the restaurant was absolutely full and we had an over booking and the Metro D absolutely didn 't know what he was gonna do and was somebody quite important to measure they I said look I can sit him in the kitchen I 'll look after them you and people loved it because I look after them and obviously they told her to people and then people started to call in to see I would like to come to the chef 's table after 16 years at the Regent sirs wrote his first book while traveling through Italy and France and returned home to take up his new role at bathers pavilion Vittorio Alexander approached me after all the the effort that you put in to try to do a small hotel and when she got told by the console that he could only be a restaurant then she felt that she needed somebody with her to help her like at the region I wanted to make everything in-house so from the bread even the butter that we make for the restaurant homemade down there but the restaurant took off because my name because of what I 've done before at cables and so the restaurant in the cafe just build up and build up and win in a year it was full every every day and I was kind of riding this tiger trying to find enough to guide them and I still had to build her with defect and I still had to you know organize the food change the menu or it was it was it took me a good five years before I could feel on top of my work from Montreal to Mossman Serge has achieved in the industry and contributed to the community humpty-dumpty became really a charity that was part of Mossman it 's fantastic this year they raised 2.6 million dollar we still do all the catering we still do the the footwork we still last design the menu it 's really a full event that husband can be proud of today different backgrounds are still part of the migrant mix to Australia but moving for quality of life unites these more recent lifestyle migrants to Mossman my family migrated to Australia will Melbourne when I was seven so in 1990 I think there was always a bit of segregation between sort of Australian born students and migrants supposin most of my friends were Italian or Greek I decided to leave friends not so much to leave but rather to Mexico and I lived there for B also lived for a few years in the United States in various cities in New York Philadelphia Miami and also lived in in the UK in London that 's where I met my wife Ivana in London invited to even our house for lunch and I was just expecting her and maybe the parents but the whole family was there cycling the grandma the grandmother the young called the cast and everyone everyone was here to see me and which is great London is good but if we wanted to start a family and so forth it just was too hectic of a city to do that and the quality of quality of life that he had afforded just wasn 't right for us Australia feels like home to me I lived in Boston for a while and then I came back to England and I met my husband who is Australian the life balance is much better in Australia and living in central London with young children is not a lot of fun so the schools aren 't very good they don to Australia as a back pocket spent a lot of time working on a farm on and off in Victoria and loved the way of life especially the rural way of life here in Australia so even then there was something about Australia that kind of had me hooked and then came back and then proceeded with my life in the UK and my wife who was Australian she always said that she was going to end up coming home and I always loved the country so I didn 't really have a problem with him my mom was a doctor and my dad was a was a lecturer in the local college so all the people who were in similar professions right like accountants doctors engineers they all had a separate kind of township kind of thing on the outskirts of the town my dad is a reserve bank officer so it was a really nice apartment complex that we lived in it was quite secluded and so we had a lot of space to you know as children to play around and we had a really close-knit social go back to the US should we go back to Canada should we go back to UK so we had like four or five english-speaking countries because we didn 't want to learn a whole new language so out of the pic we chose Australia we thought that Australia would be really a good pick because my brother had really nice things to say Australia the lifestyle is great it was only a matter of time before Mossman was discovered I came to Moscow because I I just looked at a map actually if I had met Ivana I probably be living in Paris the quality of life is likely to me to be much better in most wonders as far as I 'm aware is not like a such a beautiful such as Pall Mall anyway in Paris one of the great thing in most mine is that the food is it 's great there 's a lot of excellent bakeries so a French man all of my friend mike rizzo and we quite lucky to have a number of great boulangerie on the doorstep I think we appreciate of feel like a little village within a city well I think so we moved to five years ago I think for the first few years it was a bit like living in Disneyland you mean you drive around the corner and you 've got a beautiful view of the ocean and it 's always sunny I think Australia is friendlier and I think Mossman is particularly friendly it feels very neighborhoody say yes people talk to each other in the shops and different places particularly if you have children or if you have a baby perhaps less than a mite on them at all but when you have a baby lots of people come and talk to you I think I like that there 's a lot of people moving in and out so there 's lots of English people there 's lots of America there 's lots of people from all over the place who are quite keen to make friends the things that I love about Mossman are the facilities as I said it 's beautiful beaches are beautiful you can you know my children are learning go to you know we 'll go to the oval or what there 's we go to different there 's lots of kids to cycle tracks with coffee shops nearby so we spend a lot of time doing that which is great people are great really friendly particularly the older generation I find in Mossman the coffee shop culture is great as well I also like the fact that you know you have the beach you also have access to the city so easily but the National Park as well so that kind of fulfills for me that kind of outdoorsy sort of spirit as well you know there 's just so much to do it 's so beautiful it 's so picturesque and and it 's so easy to walk around then I mean eventually we will want to buy a house and I don 't know if we can have further cause it was fun so I don 't know if affordability will push us somewhere else but if possible we would love to be able to continue to stay on in Moscow I love the accessibility to so close by the access to green spaces and swimming pools is right around the corner so and you take a ferry to the city that 's my favorite five data it 's a beautiful experience historically Australia has been the most welcoming country in the world to migrants and that includes Mossman long may at last i 'm very much part of muss man oh I do enjoy everything about walls my mom and dad loved being here it was peaceful the wonderful opportunity I mean we 're very lucky really in Mossman we came to a great area we couldn 't do any better than that there 's no now we 're better than Muslim yeah we love husband it 'd be great if a real estate was a bit cheaper but other than that that 's probably the only downside that I can find I don 't see why I 'd live anywhere else Mossman is probably one of my favorite places that I 've lived in all my life [Music] you _"

was born in anything I 'm born in Montreal in Canada Berlin Germany China service Belgrade in Serbia Devon in the United Kingdom [Music] mossman 's rich migrant history began just a few days after the first fleet landed in Sydney Cove when Mossman Bay was included in a detailed survey of the harbor in June 1789 the Europeans returned to Mossman Bay to repair HMS serious the bay was described as a place where the men were less likely to meet with temptation to idleness and bad company for six months the crew of the serious became the first migrants to Mossman the seeming remoteness of Mossman and the perceived threat of the Australian bush meant that any in the early 19th century some of the few inhabitants of Mossman included former Irish convict Thomas O 'Neill who was farming at Balmoral fellow Irishmen Barney Kearns who was operating a ferry service across middle Harbor and bunger II and a group of Aborigines from the broken Bay Area who had been settled on George 's head it wasn 't long before Scottish immigrant Archibald Mossman arrived in the 1830s and established a successful whaling station giving the suburb its name by the mid 19th century the Whalers and ship repairers had moved on and Mossman once again became a quiet backwater a smattering of migrants from non-english speaking backgrounds provided some diversity to mossman 's population land developer Vincennes sahil from Austria captain blinks a Swedish master mariner and our ghost felon from Germany all settled in Mossman there were also the transient migrants the Chinese market gardeners at shoal Cove and the residents of the artists camps at Balmoral and serious Coe into this scene swept Irish immigrants businessman and property developer richard hayes Harnett senior used to wooing visitors on weekend ferry trips Mossman harlot could settle in 1893 Harnett 's son sharing the same name and vision of his father became mossman 's first mayor and together they were responsible for opening up Mossman as a desirable place to live in the late 19th century the boom times began and Mossman was right for migration around this time wool buyers were flocking to Sydney from Europe and Japan and many settled in Mossman these business migrants particularly the vibrant french-speaking community bought a certain urgency quarter mossman one of these buyers was george parmentier who migrated from Luke Rohl a town in the south of belgium renowned for its wool mills my understanding is that a lot of the French and Belgians were the young people were interested in going to places like Australia to seek their fortune because in 1905 George 's brother Joseph came out to Australia and established himself as a as a wool buyer and then in 1913 approximately I think George came out and followed his brother and that was the beginning of the story of their time in Australia and it was interesting because it became a French Enclave arrived until 1935 I think he had done very well in 1919 George Parmentier married Adele Biagio daughter of wool buyer charles module they resided in a grand house now demolished boasts a zoo at 182 Raglan Street Mossman he had engaged a fairly well-known architect Adrian Ashton and it was a very substantial piece of land it went from Ravens Street at the front to shed for Street at the back it wasn 't a rectangular was kind of a triangular block so that would have would have cost quite a bit I suspect there was parquetry flooring throughout five bathrooms don 't I can 't remember a full servants quarters that there was a most career a marble staircase that went up and that was all imported from Italy there was a cellar that you went down and it had a very distinct smell and down there there were little mini bottles of coca-cola and tins of Petit Pois and pate and wines of course I wasn 't allowed upstairs why don 't you uh we used to play hide and seek in their wardrobe it was he just above the belt so you could see the initials inside the house I mean III touch statues of things which if he did in a museum today be arrested I mean they were just amazing artworks it was extrordinary place the main lounge room had a full grand piano and they used to have notes where opera singers would come and they 'd all be in their gowns and dressed and mum has a lot of memories of sitting listening to wonderful opera singers in the home a lot of it was the French community but those nights I think it was a pretty good cross-section but the French were always ledecky bears and the place and the lamb are arms and the lieutenant 's they were always around I think I 'm not sure how they 're regarded by the community I think because they did very well for himself and then perhaps because you know the French Belgians there might have been perhaps seen as a different class of people it was an exciting life for the wool buyers of Mossman he would spend half the year the hotel Meurice and his apartment was next to door next door to salvador dali 's and he took my husband and i they were had in adjoining door took my husband and I and once and sinned the middle of Dali 's living room was a bathtub ya reckon there what perks I don 't think it was all business no god no they had a wonderful time they took the families they could afford to have a nanny and the governess so they still had their schooling going on on the ship and while they were away we know that when he when he was visiting Salvador Dali oh the painting Dali did a painting of him a portrait so oh we know where that went oh I don 't_''_418.54 it went to one of his lady friends well there we are in 1982 almost 70 years after arriving in Mossman Gorge Parmentier passed away so he literally died with a glass of baat du bonheur on his head yeah I think it would have been happy with that after the stock market crash of the 1920s and 1938 the Australian government supported by the opposition began accepting refugees from Hitler 's Europe the circumstances in 1935 as you can imagine being a Jew was that we were going to be persecuted and things were going to change and Hitler was rising to power and things were very very complicated and in 1937-38 we realized that we have to get out but it was a time where Hitler said okay get out leave your things you can 't take anything with you but we will allow you to get out if you can we knew we had left our our family which was two grandmothers and they were only in their 50s and the young aunt who was only in her early 20s and said we will send you visas as soon as we know where we land and we did but it was too late already so that was in 1938 already too late and they 'd been arrested and put into concentration camps the aunt aged 22 or 23 was in the warsaw ghetto and then put into concentration camps and none of them survived and went back to check things out in Poland that letter was still sitting in them in the post office Eve 's family escaped Germany but their initial destination was not Muslim in fact not even Australia and so we boarded a Japanese ship which was heading for Shanghai we stopped in Singapore and officials came on board British officials and said are there any engineers on board and my father was an engineer we 're building an aerodrome as they called it would you be able to assist us with this construction well he said yes and we got off and we 're in Singapore then for two years and my father had a wonderful position and it was a wonderful life for us refugees Mossman was also welcoming refugees local GP tag homes and his wife Margaret established the 50-50 Club in 1939 where each week an equal number of their Australian friends were invited with an equal number of new Australians to their home for a social evening of music singing dancing and meanwhile the refugees were on the move in Singapore after two years we were rounded refugees mainly from Austria and from Germany and the British rounded us up and said we 're going to ship you out as enemy aliens because the Japanese are coming into the war and so we will put on would you believe the Queen Mary the ship which was then turned around in Australia as a troop carrier and we were sent to what we knew nothing about Australia with the outbreak of the Second World War previously accepted migrants Germans Italians Japanese and Hungarians were interned or kept under police surveillance we were under guard we were taken to a an internment camp in tuturro near Shepperton in Victoria the situation was that they were actually detained for two years my parents decided to send me to a children 's home in Melbourne a Jewish children 's home from the Jewish world for organisation what of a sudden they realized the authorities realized that these were really genuine refugees and the next thing my father was put into the army it 's a fact for Australia I mean things were so crazy in 1949 the Department of Immigration was would be mass migration from Europe the mission on which I am now embarking is vital to the nation I am going abroad to seek ships or immigrants if we have no ships we shall get no immigrants and without immigration the future of the Australia we know will be both uneasy and brief as a nation we shall not survive mentorships I will guarantee to load them with the right type of our future babe Mossman Council made use of core walls displaced persons resettlement scheme and employed post-war migrants for road and footpath repairs housing them in a newly built prefabricated migrant hostel at Ross and park core was scheme of populate or perish transformed Australia and between 1949 and 1965 more than two million migrants came to our shores in 1945 now I am nine years of age the war ended and we we just thrived Australia was a fairly naive country and even though they didn 't speak very good English I mean they were not you know it was a case of simulating but they had a marvelous life Kerry Pappas came out in 1948 work and he was know all the buildings and there was a quote from the wall there is everybody was living he used to go to the cinema room and then on the cinema for this Australia come to Australia with a point like this we need you we complain the world when we was on this plane if you call it two propellers so hopefully I never forget this they will say hundred thirty people and they 're solely on the size of the playlist with the finest footage to see the rest of the people on the ground it was five days oxide in the air was something newly and get away from the war and the feminine of this and then here was freedom you have no your father tell you what to do for your mother yeah yeah was free in these immediate post-war years Australia was second only to Israel in the proportion of migrants accepted at the time Palestinians were being forced to migrate one of my earliest memories is actually witnessing the terrorist attack of the King David hotel in Jerusalem we stopped the whole building collapsed in front of my eye and my memory of it was that my sister was sitting in the backseat started to laugh hysterically and I began to cry and I still have that very vivid memory of that and one day tanks rolled down our street with a hate loudhailer to say you 've got to leave your property otherwise you will be shot and so they started to organize convoys for Palestinian Arabs to leave their homes and their towns and we drove through the night through the desert because of course it 's cooler we left port side very late at night it was lots of lights lots of activities and my aunt my mother 's half-sister gave me this ring as a present and I 've still got it that 's the only thing I have from Palestine we were met at the boat by my uncle and his family he was living in a big house very sadly no longer there in Cremorne and we actually lived in the ballroom the house was so big it had a ballroom and mum and slept on mattresses on the floor and the in the in the ballroom we became stateless refugees because there was no longer a Palestine the second wave of post-war migrants arrived in the 1950s and 60s seeking employment and better living conditions many Greeks and Italians and by this stage Chinese too came from rural towns when they first arrived their farming skills were put to use as market gardeners and cane cutters for them it was an opportunity to create a better life in themselves because looking back through the history but what what they were doing in China there were market guns very poor and my my mother talks about the times that you know were growing up in her era that food was shortened and and as always sort of going for a hungry whereas when they came to Australia there the opportunity to make their own wealth and grain but he create a better future for themselves and for us they 're like cut care for three years when I come back to Sydney I got a job in a delicatessen the key and then I my if one of my friends he was a waiter I used to work at this place called the in York Street I was making only about ten pounds a week and he was making thirty thirty five and as luck just you remember whether as a conical job they slowly recalled a job in there and then I never looked back I was best time of my life are their family businesses were a common feature of their migration experience and Milk bars green grocers fishmongers delicatessens restaurants and boot makers were all run by migrants in Mossman Wesley lose parents came out from China to find a better life they worked hard and eventually opened lose restaurant in Mossman my family came to Australia the wind took open to working in a Chinese restaurant which was called the Kentucky lounge I believe that is still operating today my father came out in 1951 to get some money and to presumably just as a set up house then my mother came out afterwards to start spending life in Australia when my parents came to Sydney as I opened up when my parents moved from an Adele to Mossman they started their own Chinese restaurant in Mossman they operate the wrister on their own because by my father was the cook and the mother did the waitressing and the serving in the restaurant the restaurant opened in 1966 I don 't record there were many other restaurants in the air because I do recall people ring up and say that they wanted a whole dinner to be prepared and and they brought Horseman 's in so they brought me into the kitchen and as the food was prepared to put them into source one and people would take them away in their own source Minh so that was something that that odds I didn 't think was any any other ordinary Inc but looking back now so I don 't think anyone does it these days when when my parents moved from 692 down the road to 639 which I rode the new restaurant that they started and wallpaper had tablecloths and and dimmable lights so the whole restaurants were proposed a bit more upmarket than what the first one coming to an end there were still challenges for the lose but the restaurant was thriving and so were the children mcgirt 's spoke basic English I suppose there was enough to get them by to to deal with customers and as we were growing up you know Louise or interpretive message of stuff for my parents you know bein yeah yeah under 10 no I didn 't really notice any differences but he but looking at the old school photos is sort of easy to pick take my photo alpha class photos because I was the only Asian in the class photo because even back then there was was not much of a Chinese community in in the Mosman below area but for myself growing up in Mossman I 've I just didn 't receive any difference being other than popular local Muslim community now but Pinelli came from the rural community of Montelongo in tuscany his uncle Luigi Benelli was the first one of the family to come to Australia in 1938 Albert 's father migrated in 1950 with his cousin and soon realized if they were industrious would follow but that sent for him he said well you 're going your mother will follow when we accumulate the necessary finances to to follow I left Italy in 1953 my mom gave me a little I know out of her Rosen or what to do and what not to do and my mama had put a pocket in order more seamless and that net was over the list in my heart after a year at school I could speak to get by with English I left school and I started working full time crow 's nest in the there was a fruit shop nearly five five ways my father was worried at that time was working in the made a hospital and he worked for the the beginners they began lived in muslin and my dad used to work there weekend 's doing the gardens well it was a busy time but if my brother time he 'd worked in there as well my brother was an apprentice mechanic excuse me at night time he was an usher at the North Sydney cinema forth him owned by Bob own houses and have been willing to make great sacrifices to do so don 't we have to get a house those moment mom and sister become so we ended up we 'd look around the speed junction in student realist arrogance offices till we found what our weight aboard has 250 pounds we handled them we 're down to 1100 something that was in vaudeville right Mossman husband was a bit of the backwater service page and properties were cheaper Mossman was the place to live for the Pinelli family and with Albert 's sister Erma marrying local fruit or a Matthew arena Mossman conveniently became the place to work for Albert too because he didn 't really know a lot of people around muslin he said well when about by the Fruit Shop I want you to come and work for me muslin was very sort of primitive in a way you do build up customers building up custome is very easy he is small you 're polite you got a your way to please the customer and they come back you build up the relationship building up estate and back to arenas this time the deli not the fruit shop the daily groove business was to such an extent that ps2 start that early to prepare the harder you work the luckier you become we had a reputation we used to start at 30 we used to get delivery of bread at 5 o 'clock we had to have X number of rolls ready for a lot of try these you bring the best the best from every day you get the best from here and life goes on another hard-working family the Pataki 's from palestine arrived in australia in 1950 and ran a corner store at 45 the Esplanade Balmoral until Gordon Betar G retired in late 1969 my dad would have wanted to have his own business because he had a very big l shop in Jerusalem and which sailed which sold electrical goods something like Harvey Norman people said to him if you want to buy a business go into the food business because people always want to eat it was a mixed business of grocery store and it was subject also to weren 't allowed to sell groceries so they had to be boarded up so the groceries couldn 't be seen you could serve milk shakes and lollies oh absolutely ice creams lollies yeah sandwiches no groceries unlike today Balmoral Beach in the wintertime was empty but as soon as the weather heated up and people can the place got very busy nuts and that 's where we were required on hand to help especially on weekends weekends were in the summer weekends were a nightmare as far as I was concerned I really wouldn 't know where the place was very very busy family homeownership and often business ownership were high priorities for many Mossman migrants but it wasn 't always an easy path well there so work in nightclubs I missed so much money but I gamble it gambled partying castle a year and I had nothing when I couldn 't read it I came back from the honeymoon hundred pounds that 's all I had look if I 'm wrong I said to my wife we 're not going now no party no nothing he said we 'll call of fat from below let 's eat I don 't need a chiasm anybody I sold a car and I say my mind there was a little house for sale figured out at the corner of Velma road and bad way road he say yeah this house he was about five thousand pounds that 's all he was and then they gave me the man up at that house I bought the show with the key a circular key they 'll talk girls of mixed business and from then on I went on and I put another shop her out and then more another show later on and I made this Jewish fella friend of mine he says to me you could exist URI you the stupid that 's why he says to me get a shop where you stay there and you work in history national poojas to me you make the money work for you know you for the money anyway that 's what happened and then I went on and on I had a shot in my time not all post-war migrants came to Australia looking in Australia from Italy in 1955 as Maria Teresa polyarny with all the glitz and glamor that comes with being a former Miss Italy and an international model so when I was about 17 I started to model in Italy and I was in Pitti palace in Florence doing some showing for the buyers of the world and somebody from Davy Jones was there and apparently they wanted to do a very big Italian exhibition in Sydney with clothes and cars and everything really and they asked four of us if we were interested with the agent obviously you know and I said oh yes yes you know but of course in those days you know I was only 17 so basically I had the permission of my mother which my mother said that you must be mad and eventually you know we went to solicitors and so on and my mother gave permission and it was a fantastic experience actually the same you know very well chaperoned and it was it was pretty amazing yeah four models we came to Australia with Qantas we took 78 hours to get time with the pilots in Singapore and my English was really bad and I did a bit of a gaff there one night because we went to dinner and then we started to dance and I just said I was so tired you know because I suffer from jetlag tremendously and I said okay now we go to bed and so they made big joke all through the thing you know about this and then we got to to Sydney and came to the Australia Hotel and we started work and it was a very hard work because we had 200 garments to show twice a day in Davy Jones and that was here for months and then we went to Queensland then we went to Adelaide Perth Wagga and also to New Zealand Terry came to Australia for work and stayed for love but there was a guy here that was a navy of inanely you know the Fiat people and he was here to bring the chin sano the drink you know just started and he wanted us to go to his house and have a party and two tiles but eventually we said okay and that 's what I meant John yes but I didn 't like him very much so you know we just I just sort of trying to take me home and I didn 't want him to take me to back to the hotel because I didn 't know him you know but anyway he was very persuasive so it took me to the hotel and then he started to ring and then follow us all over where we went you know it was a bit mad so that 's what he did they took a car to come to Brisbane for the weekend and the car broke down 150 kilometres from Cindy and so they left the car there then I run back with with the taxi or something to the airport and took a plane back you know just madness of those days you know one stage his mother said he wanted to meet me because you know we were in the papers all the time so we were fairly well known by then and so yes we went to dinner and I think I was a bit shocked for him for his mother because I ordered some asperity and left half of them because I didn 't like the wife and he told John I was a very extravagant so it to be very careful John Carew and Maria Teresa polyarny married in Sydney in December 1956 it was a small wedding and we married at Riverview with the French priest and then the reception was at this mother 's house poor John put up with a lot well when we were first married because I really did not cook after the first year of marriage in Melbourne the newlyweds with their new baby headed back to Sydney first queenscliff and eventually Mossman well from queenscliff we came to MouseMan quite often and I quite liked the you know the atmosphere well though there wasn 't very much on us we are compared to today it was very expensive and it was a sort of person that had to have cash to buy everything so we actually didn 't buy a house for eight years but and then of course John 's I had a heart attack and died suddenly you know some years later I met Joe but somehow you know it was such a great man that things happen and we got married in 1980 and he was one of the greats of most men by the way in painting Terri 's died in the fashion world and stayed in Mossman then they [Music] 1987-88 I opened the bonnet Benetton shop in Milan we had to have everything from Italy it was terribly expensive we had to pay for all day the things coming from Italy in advance so and then of course there was the big stock market fall and you could see immediately what happens you know people weren 't buying anything much so IJ enjoyed it you know Balmoral enjoy the shops now you know I enjoyed the vfi of this place in the early 1970s with a Labour government elected a policy of multiculturalism meant migrants were to be chosen according to personal and social attributes and occupational group rather than country-of-origin Alessandra Pucci was born in Eritrea to Italian parents and after her to Australia in 1970 my father was a journalist he had founded an Italian newspaper because at the time there were many many Italians not only in Eritrea but all all along the Middle East Ethiopia which was the the biggest country next to it took over my father who had been in his papers he had been going for the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia he was it was given 48 hours to leave Alex was already studying in Italy and soon her husband Gino Pucci would be encouraging her to come to Australia and settled in Mossman there was a visiting Australian fellow Janne Blundell and so she spoke a lot about Australia fantastic country blah blah and so my husband was you know I was enticed and he said why don 't we go and she managed to get him a contract for two seasons when the job was over he said I like the country like to stay and I wasn 't convinced at all and eventually I I decided it Australia was better he set up his own company and he called it with Islam he set up a factory to make them make handbags and shoes so the very first day we were in in Sydney he took us to Balmoral Island and and my husband turned to me and he said I want to live here Alex 's husband Gino was an entrepreneur in the fashion world whereas Alex who had studied pharmaceutical chemistry and genetics in Italy had more difficulty finding a job and I did apply and I had 200 responses all negative no one wanted to deploy so I decided to go you know from the bottom and and I found a job as a technician in a pathology lab and and when I demonstrated that I knew what I was doing I could get a job with as a research assistant at the University and when I did that that professor said look realistically with your Italian degrees you are not going to go anywhere and you better do a PhD here and I did Alex went from strength to strength creating the first biotechnology company in Australia in 1981 and when I was in the States I saw it was so exciting that I came back and said I 'm going to do it in Australia and I got some initial funding from my husband and a friend of these and then I went to the end and I set up a really advanced laboratory and and then I went to the to the government and I said look I 've done my bit now it 's it 's up to you and and they were very direct actually they 're very very generous and they founded me for the next five years the accolades continued for Alex and so does her researching and writing on topical scientific issues so 86 was business Woman of the Year 87th I became an officer of the Republic of Italy 9 88 was the officer Australia after that I became being a director and non-executive director ons itself not a number of different countries one of these companies was the Sydney IVF company is a fertility company and he 's relevant because this book contains it the story of that government policy and world events continued to shape migration in the more emphasis on skilled and business migrants growing up in Montreal food and cooking were strong influences for Sarah 's doll Pharaoh owner and head chef at the beta 's Pavilion at Balmoral Beach we always had a huge garden my father was an amazing gardener my mum was a cook of the family she would cook do the meal my grandmother was a used to be like a caterer she used to work in lumberjack camp with a team of men she was a big influence in my life as far as cooking also because she caught a cook in a semi semi professional way and since it was well I had an uncle there was a professional chef and he was one of the famous chef in Canada that used to run in big hotels and and I got my first job through him and I got employed there as a as a kitchen and so washing pots and pans and I had never came in contact with other nationality and it was very french-canadian where I was and suddenly there was a Haitian that came from IET the washing in the pots and all that there was Swiss chef there was French chef there was Italian waiter as it was it was fantastic was German it was all those different nationality and I got not only the bug or working in the kitchen I love the environment but also the fact that all those people came from somewhere else and eventually the the head chef said to me why don 't you go to cooking school you know because he could see I was really enjoying it and I applied to the best cooking school in Montreal and I got accepted when I graduated then they gave me a job which was a funny title but was called chef on ice and chef on ice meaning that you you wear bit like a person that would help anywhere that they needed so we had seven Hotel in our district I would go from Sherbrooke to Quebec City to Cornwall to Ottawa you know after doing that for three four five years I decided that maybe it was time to have a take a different direction you know kind of ready to to take a posting overseas eventually the phone call came in and they say Sydney Australia so I went to the library and in the library they had a beautiful and I look for book on Australia but there was a book on Sydney beautiful book with all the photo of the beaches the lifestyle there the the the red roof and remember and the boating the sailing and all that and laughs and I was absolutely blown away I always will remember that book that just suddenly made me realize that I was going somewhere else and I said the lifestyle of Sydney and I was hooked from that day on you know so I came to open the region hotel in Sydney I was second in charge with the kitchen and it was a very large kitchen and it was a very busy I was the first true five-star hotel in Australia I remember the president of the company that owned the company came in one time he told the general manager the director for the beverage and myself that we didn 't know pretty well because old Irishman with full every single day and he organized for the three of us to go to California at that point of time there was the explosion of Californian cuisine it was very much a new way of eating a modern way as opposed to being very classic and French and formal it was the beginning of the chef the chef came out of the kitchen the personality was a chef the food was what people came for the legend of California cuisine Jeremy Tower years later credited surges use of fresh natural and local food as his influence and the real later of the California cuisine sergers success in the Regents flagship restaurant cables led to his creation of the chef 's table but it was supposed to be just for one night the restaurant was absolutely full and we had an over booking and the Metro D absolutely didn 't know what he was gonna do and was somebody quite important to measure they say look I can sit him in the kitchen I 'll look after them you know and it started in I look after them and obviously they told other people and then people started to call in to see I would like to come to the chef 's table after 16 years at the Regent sirs wrote his first book while traveling through Italy in France and returned home to take up his new role at bay this pavilion Vittorio Alexander approached me after all the the effort that you put in to try to do a small hotel and when she got told by the council that it could only be a restaurant then she felt that she needed somebody with her to help her like at the region I wanted to make everything in-house so from the bread even the butter that we make for the restaurant homemade down there but the restaurant took off because my name because of what I 've done before at cables and so the restaurant off in the cafe just build up and build up and when in a year it was full every every day and I was kind of riding this tiger trying to find enough staff to do the I still had to build her with defect and I still had to you know organize the food change the manure it was it was it took me a good five years before I could feel on top of my work from Montreal to Mossman Serge has achieved in the industry and contributed to the community hunted on table really a charity that was part of Mossman it 's fantastic this year they raised 2.6 million dollar we still do all the catering we still do all the the foot work we still I still designed the menu it 's really a full event that that husband can be proud of today different backgrounds are still part of the migrant mix to Australia but moving for quality of life unites these more recent lifestyle migrants to Mossman my family migrated to Australia will Melbourne when I was 7 so in 1990 I think there was always a bit of segregation between sort of Australian born students and migrants supposin most of my friends were Italian or Greek I decided to leave France not so much to leave but rather to Mexico and I lived there for B also lived for a few years in the United States in various cities in New York Philadelphia Miami and also lived in in the UK in London that 's where I met my wife Ivana in London invited to even our house for lunch and I was just expecting her and maybe the parents but the whole family was there cycling the grandma the grandmother the young called the cast and everyone everyone was here to see me and which is great London is good but if we wanted to start a family and so forth it just was too hectic of a city to do that and the quality of quality of life that he had afforded just wasn 't right for us Australia feels like I lived in Boston for a while then I came back to England and I met my husband who is Australian the life balance is much better in Australia in living in central London with young children is not a lot of fun so the schools aren 't very good they don 't have a lot backpacker spent a lot of time working on a farm on and off in Victoria and love the way of life especially the rural way of life here in Australia so even then there was something about Australia that kind of had me hooked and then came back and then proceeded with my life in the UK until I met my wife who was Australian she always said that she was going to end up coming home and I always loved the country so I didn 't really have a problem with it my mom was a doctor and my dad was a was a lecturer in the local college so all the people who were in similar professions right like accountants doctors engineers they all had a separate kind of Township kind of thing on the outskirts of the town my dad is a reserve bank officer so it was a really nice apartment complex that we lived in it was quite secluded and so we had a lot of space too you know as children to play around and we had a really close-knit social network there we the US should we go back to Canada should we go back to UK so we had like four or five english-speaking countries because we didn 't want to learn a whole new language so out of the pick we chose Australia we thought that Australia would be really a good pick because my brother had really nice things to say Australia the lifestyle is great it was only a matter of time before Mossman was discovered I came to Moscow because I just looked at a map actually if I had not met Ivana I probably be living in Paris the quality of life is likely to me to be much better in most wonders as far as I 'm aware is not like a such a beautiful such as a mall in any way in Paris one of the great thing in most mine is that that the food is is it 's great there 's a lot of excellent bakeries so a French man all of my friend Mike Rizzo and we put lucky to have a number of great lingerie on the doorstep I think we sort of feel like a little village within a city well I think so we moved to five years ago I think for the first few years it was a bit like living in Disneyland you mean you drive around the corner and you 've got a beautiful view of the ocean and it 's always sunny I think Australia is right here and I think Mossman is particularly friendly it feels very neighborhood II say yes people talk to each other in the shops and different places particularly if you have children or if you have a baby perhaps less so now my turn I 'm a daughter but when you have a baby lots of people come and talk to you I think I like that there 's a lot of people moving in and out so there 's lots of English people there 's lots of America there 's lots of people from all over the place who are quite keen to make friends the things that I love about Mossman are the facilities as I said it 's beautiful beaches are beautiful you can you know the moment so we go to you know we 'll go to the oval or what there 's we go to different there 's lots of kids to cycle tracks with coffee shops nearby so we spend a lot of time doing that which is great people are great really friendly particularly the older generation I find in Mossman the coffee shop culture is great as well also like the fact that you know you have the beach you also have access to the city so easily but the National Park as well so that kind of fulfills for me that kind of outdoorsy sort of spirit as well you know there 's just so much to do it 's so beautiful it 's so picturesque and and it 's so easy to walk around then I mean eventually we will want to buy a house and I don 't know if we can have further cause it was fun so I don 't know if affordability will push us somewhere else but if possible we would love to be able to continue to stay on in Moscow I love tracks that are so close by the access to green spaces and swimming pools is right around the corner so and you take a ferry to the city that 's my favorite five data it 's a beautiful experience historically Australia has been the most welcoming country in the world to migrants and that includes Mossman long may at last I 'm very much part of muss man oh I do enjoy everything else my mom and dad loved being here it was peaceful the wonderful opportunity I mean we 're very lucky really in Mossman we came into a great area we couldn 't do any better than that there 's no now we 're better than Muslim yeah we love husband it 'd be great if the real estate was a bit cheaper but other than that that 's probably the only downside that I can find I don 't see why I 'd live anywhere else Mossman is probably one of my favorite places that I 've lived in all my life [Music] you _"

    "text": "please welcome Michael marketer thank you Bill and um Thank You Dylan do as well on the staff of mosman library very kindly hosting tonight 's event and thank you to all of you for coming out tonight I 'm really touched to see such as such a bubble yum turnout in a town that 's very far away from mine arm from down just south of women so it 's really good to come up and see people turn now I also thank you very much to to John home charles arms son and it 's a real treat for all of us myself included to have him here tonight to hear from him and and and certainly here 's some pizza early members of his father and then and certainly memories of the people he was associated with and what I wanted to do that first just briefly is give you a bit of a bit of an insight into the book that I wrote flying the Southern Cross a little bit of an insight into what I tried to do with that book and indeed what I as phil mentioned one of my main research areas that i 'm interested in growing a PhD thesis on the moment is Australia 's involvement in the first world war in the air now if you 're like most people you may ask will do we even have airplanes back then in fact when I first broached this topic about several years ago university of wollongong the lecturer I was speaking to said I 'd I didn 't even know we had airplanes back then and that was a history professor who said that to me not a military history professor but history professor nonetheless so I knew that like that this was a good topic because it was something that we didn 't know so much about in September 2010 my first book was published fire in the sky the Australian Flying Corps in the First World War most people do for thesis and then write book I did it back the front for some reason and it 's it came out in September 2010 and when it came out it was it was reviewed in a few few the managing editor at the National Library of Australia and very time she was looking for someone to take on a project involving Charles Ohm 's law book of the 1928 trans-pacific flight and she thought that I might be a good choice for an author and when she contacted me and asked me I 've got to say even though I just out of a PhD I jumped at the chance because in a sense this allowed me to take the stormy beyond the Armistice in 1918 and to follow some of these men home from the grave war and see how they turned the skills they learned while they are away for war fighting into something that would benefit Australia in the Civil sweet so certainly civil aviation and so I saw that this was a almost as a sequel to my first book fire in the sky unlike that book though which the publishers pretty much gave me carte blanche and said do what you want with it tell a good story a library have very definite idea about what they wanted this was an interesting challenge the library came to me and they said that this book was to be part of the series they 're doing to highlight as they call them treasures in their collections so the idea is with the series that they take an item from their collection that 's got some great significance to Australian history and they use that item as the centerpiece for the bullet to tell the story i cants not the only source that you ought to use this but it is the primary one and what they also do is they reproduce pages from the document throughout the book facsimile pages with transcriptions and that kind of tells the story as well as the words of the historian Israel in my case it was charles arms logbook a small brown notebook that he purchased probably on the way to taking off in now on the thirty-first of May 1928 in oakland california and in it he recorded his impressions of the 85 hours that they were in ear earring Charles Kingsford Smith and their two American colleagues Jim Warner and Harry lion he recorded his impressions minute by minute running tree and you can see it very much when I picked up the original documents it has a real feel of authenticity about it there 's there 's fingerprints there 's smudges you can tell it 's being wet and creased when he 's describing turbulence he 's doing it like this it really is a document that has it has a striking sense of authenticity and immediacy about it that 's it I very quickly discovered that this would be very challenging document to use because although it had such a such a war and sort of unedited sense about it and this really kind of compelling voice about it on the other hand I very quickly discovered that this diary had been created for a very definite purpose and that is the Charles almond Charles Kingsford Smith to help fund the fly had actually signed a media exclusivity deal with a number of newspapers notably in Sydney the Sun which was a daily afternoon afternoon newspaper at the time i also had contracts with other papers around the world such as the los angeles the son 's case a thousand pounds which is probably about two years of a GP salary in that donate so reasonably considerable amount of money in exchange for that at each of the flight stops they stopped in hawaii and then they stopped in Fiji and then flew on to Brisbane and each of the stops are would take what he 'd written in his logbook and he would cable it through to the newspaper editors and would appear that afternoon so in a sense this was almost like CNN in 1928 it 's real-time news reported and I 've got to say for us that might not sound so flash but for Australians at the time who were generally removed from world events and used to reading things two or three days after and also used to reading things in Sydney the same as two people in mobile we 're reading the same as people in Brisbane because they are all coming off Associated Press cables or other your tables to read this kind of kind of I guess immediate you know news rapportage was quite a remarkable really was revealed to me early Ottoman but this love was created for a purpose and that us Alan was sitting up there rocking around in the plane he not only knew that people in Sydney would be reading what he wrote the next day but I think he had a sense that we would be reading it many years into the future and I think he wouldn 't be surprised at the sort of book arts produced and there is that sense that he is writing for posterity the mob also is not perfect document there 's no such thing as a perfect historical document they 've all got the ball but their foibles and there are some gaps in this one for instance when they get to feed jr. he was incredibly busy organizing the next stage of the flight was a monumental task logistically to get the the petrol and the Southern Cross repaired and so on and he writes nothing for the entire time they 're in Fiji on the last night between brisbane and server they hit a monumental tropical storm and it nearly nearly to future where it is evolved because for nearly six hours he writes nothing because they 're trying to it took the strength of both of them to keep the aircraft airborne so because of because of those two things because this was created very much for a for a public audience and because also there are those gaps I had to use other evidence and I certainly wanted to use those other sources to put a log into context to sort of give it I guess a you know to weave the tapestry around it and to help give it meaning and significance and a few of the things that I use the library has got a lot of you know what I can see what i call them traitors because they 're really quite wonderful documents one of the most exciting ones for me to use was the handwritten messages that were passed during the flight because of the engine noise for the 85 hours though in the year the crew couldn 't actually speak to each other so they wrote notes on scraps of paper after the two mates as souvenirs some of them were even lost between the floorboards on Southern Cross and retrieved years later either way the library has gathered up probably close to 100 of them there 's more of them at the State Library of New South Wales and using those I was able to eavesdrop in on conversations and I 've got to say they often gave a more candid version of events than the long-term the log book too and interestingly they gave an insight into the fear the danger at times and one of homes main concerns with this flight was to emphasize how safe it was to a public who we was hoping to sell troops like this to one day it was anything but safe and I think the message is being written and passed to each other really give that sense from from the wireless set operated by american jim warner there 's also a log of radio messages there were a few points in the flight received on both sides of the Pacific they did in Sydney radio stations were able to relay them live is one of the reasons why this flight resonated so much with destroying public it 's one of the reasons why when almond Kingsford Smith and their American companions arrived here on the ninth of June in sydney at mascot which was then just a big open take two hundred thousand people turned up one in six of the city 's residents at the time and it 's because they 've been listening to it on the radio it 's because they 've been reading arms log in the newspaper it 's because they 've been doing those things that they had almost vicariously experienced the flight and it was a natural end for them to go and see that you see the conclusion of it just for themselves the newspapers as well of course were a really key source for me I 'm the son obviously being the exclusive outlet for the recovery the summer I was interesting in i think in it shared a bit of light ons for the to the matter that these flights being remembered one thing I discovered very early on is that while to the Sun the sun 's editor is there actually changing the the extracts and that particularly what he 's doing is he 's changing the personal pronouns to make it sound as though Kingsford Smith is writing the woman now he even goes as far as changing the name and certainly makes it sound as though on is not the author at all that was corrected later in the fight but for the first few days of the journey other than the Americans barely get it mentioned at all which is quite ironic considering it 's it 's own who 's masterminded and he 's absolutely in control of his home media I guess coverage that you know it 's going on um but I think that 's almost the start of elves opaqueness I guess oh sorry arms I 'm being covered up in the story and I 'm sort of almost receiving with the background i 'm walking suits with step to the front and i might add that as much to Kingston Susan embarrassment he said many times in publicly and privately that we know that that the others should have got their do as well um but not just the son of course there were the other newspapers and some of the best things I got came out the other newspapers the competition because of course their journalists were digging in the dirt they were looking for a scoop and one journalist in particular Norman Ellison found some very interesting things about some fractures relationships among the crew particularly between 0 and the Americans Oliver other business dealings and things that you could read about I won 't go into more detail here but that was useful as well look at another really fantastic source could I drawn immensely with the photographs there 's 120 photographs in the book nearly all from the National library 's collection and we selected them with great difficulty from several hundred photographs this was an incredible incredibly photographed and well documented event I 've got to say that I think some of the best photographs come from people 's cameras not certainly my press photographers not stage photographers with people holding up their box Brown the above the crowd there and they 're wonderful and I 've got to really commend the library for the job that they did with those photographs like the log though there 's there 's some striking gaps in the photographic record in fact there is not one photograph that we could track down taken by the crew during the flight now had all had the ability to cable photographs as well as words I 'm sure it would have been very well photographed but as it happens he didn 't so there 's almost no foam and indeed even photographs of the Southern Cross in flight were very difficult so we had to be a bit clever and a bit creative when it came to giving a sense of what is absolutely flying Southern Cross although of course avoids being honest it 's not an actual picture from that flight finally just to give you an idea taking all these sources looking at this evidence I think the narrative that I 've created I tell the story starting with almond Kingston Smith 's birth yeah the early their early years and I take the trans-pacific flight and then there 's a final chapter on their lives afterwards which of course were both tragically cut short six and seven years respectively for all hospital the trans-pacific flight but within that narrative I think there 's three big ideas that I was able to draw our emphasize the first one is the role the child 's aren 't played in this in this flight case it to me the course went on to be a household name as he still is today he 's on between dollar note Charles own really after his death received into the background and has more or less I think being largely forgotten that 's a real shame because I 'm played not only at a really important role in the Pacific fly he certainly organized it was his business mind they 've got the whole thing off and certainly launched his in Kingston Smith 's careers I mean Kingston Smith was a magnificent pilot and that really did coming up that don 't mean there 's a lot of legend and myth about him but it 's clear from wasn 't much good when it came to administration and business and in fact he was standing on hopeless when it came to money all along the other hand wasn 't and I think it was a huge achievement of his to get the flight off the ground in the first place beyond that though I think arms role as an aviation pioneer in Australia I think comes through in book as well though that 's not something i only spent a chapter on their subsequent lives but i hope i 've done that justice and i think that he needs a full board on even life I think he needs a lengthy biography there 's a short one by Ellen Rogers who is his assistant later on faith in Australia it 's called and I do recommend it to your wonderful book but I think something much longer and much much more today would be would be a great thing to see the second view idea is that this flight signaled the dawn of modernity in Australia and by that i mean this us i was so surprised by flyer real-time news rapportage I 've already mentioned and the way the media sort of fought over this and when the media didn 't get the exclusivity they started digging for dirt it wasn 't the only time this happening to cancel sweeping arms careers corporate advertising I was amazed I then I mean the range of products that Kings it Smith an arm and Southern Cross we use to promote is staggering islets biscuits bong singlets oil petrol holidays you name it they we use to promote it okay really quite incredible and again something that we 're so familiar with today and of course also this transfer the idea of transport and I think the thing that really I think the thing that really distinguished Oliver 's his sense of vision he saw importance that airtran one day had for Australia a good two decades before it actually came to fruition it was very much before his time and like a lot of people who have a filter in that who had that characteristic I think he probably spent much of his life eventually frustrated because the people that I hope two of them really drawn out of this story was Australia and US relations I haven 't_''_1024.4 said a great deal about the Americans but they played a key role in this flight as well I 'm very much one of this to be seen as an Australian achievement and despite his best efforts to make it appear like that by managing the press coverage he couldn 't actually hide the fact that two of the crew members were Americans very very important as well the role they played of course but also the flight had been bankrolled by an American GL and hancock entrepreneur from California in fact the australian government had withdrawn financial support and Southern Cross was actually on the market waiting to be sold when he stepped in board the aircraft and then gave it to Kingston Smith at home as a gift and then allowed them to fly to Australia really quite a remarkable thing I think this flight very much sparked off an important thing in the 20th century and that 's obviously our relationship with the u.s. at the time First World War American culture was was quite fun to Australians and it 's interesting the response when the Pacific flight arrived in Australia they did a tour publicity tour of brisbane sydney melbourne and camera and it 's interesting that the Americans were one of the most popular again speeches of the two of people wanted to see the Americans people wanted to hear what they had to say and I think one waiter i found one letter to the editor I found sums it up nicely where a man he was a listed mr. John someone mr. John light from with go wrote in and he said that that this White had changed his perception of Americans we thought that maybe Australia America be friends after all and of course when we 've actually interested in Pacific with this applies very very obviously I think illustrated I think that he was it was very pressing and comment so anyway I might get John if if you want to come have a seat with me I 've got to say though with all those sources the source that I this being here John I hope he doesn 't mind me describing him as a source a consequence well teams each I I the couple of others we were having a drink with him when he was unveiling the doggie daddy portrait group of smithy and arm which you might have seen is in the portrait gallery and you know how many connections and I said to right now on the only registered offspring we got what I also met Mindy 's are numberless thanks but okay offering us a drink it is a few were cities and you ruined the old parliament house and they said oh young man i show you how to make a martini and the staff brought what 's this got to do with aviation well as if it 's quite an information from sufferings and the human race eligible and the staff brought a junk and they fill that you couldn 't put another ice block in it and wendys took a new bottle of Gordon 's gin he poured the whole bottle in then he took a lot of knowing proud I think and then he bought himself a martini like that I mean he had another one so I do Menzies martinis no but I will warn people they must one surrender their car kings and prepare prepare to repair to the guest room at least up his first life but there 's a good physic connection there these wonderful connections that the sidebars if you if you like Charles homes business manager it was both shield and there was a part in one of the papers here maybe it was collimate several years ago that Charles arm had given both shield a bottle of Gordon 's did in the Sydney and he said if we don 't make it drink it and toss it into the harbor under the heart of which which was then being built so the connection so I I 've always used Gordon 's not only actual ND my father so some things you 'd gather from yellow from history you missed that right by me I 'm sorry that didn 't make the books well ya thought I 'd say i mean i miss i was to come and speak to you i came in i spend the day with with john and then enjoyed his and hospitality Batiatus once you 've got a bad track hi okay no problem oh well as crap go to me when i came around and we 'd we spent the day and we talked about all things charles olin aviation and one of the things that i get surprised me that you initially told me that i was unaware of is is the arm association with mossman yeah maybe you could sir because yes well i mean isn 't document that 's that 's why i still I think it 's I 'm circular pages and pages doing this here because charles i was born in mobile through a french father australian mother but quite early they came up here and they lived in I think was 27 Keston Avenue just by just behind the school I think it so it 's still there it 's a rather solidly built duplex unit a longer side so he went to the war from there he enlisted but he put his the water I got one in August and this is September there won 't matter and he probably convalesce there cause he was wounded in Gallipoli and didn 't believe it out you may he went in under the language action so his war record when it he enlisted again under his own name my mother told me that his father who was a hate the bike french max you were not French where Alsatians disputed territory all the wars were about over the centuries and he 's got my uncoating my mother and there 's a reliable journalist I 'm quoting what what she said but he said that his father said we 'll give to what I before the limit what are you doing back here so beautifully realist and went his Jackson and his arm back into the western front he got to shut up and yeah I mean this is the incredible I guess again this getting into his mindset from the past I mean he survives he survives Gallipoli with a very dangerous dangerous wound comes back to Sydney 's parents insists on his discharge later on his eighth birthday its partner tell you know basically pushing him out that front gate again yeah we can go to the war records they 're all available you know and you see this it all done in copper plate pens pens and inks all these changes and so I got to change all these papers from whatever is number was jackson- no really are you know didn 't bring bring bring the records up to date so he could Mike will have convalesced here because the military hospital because one was a Georgia starts before the you know the Reaper hospital was built at Concord well in the early registered offspring I bought some land down and shift in gardens with a marvelous view right across the harbor and well reliable to our house there and just after we got married and people moved into it in nineteen nineteen sixty one lived there for 40 years so musselman 's the right place for the office yeah now our five reasonably successful children i put a qualification I lose my elder son who 's the problem you small three boys and two girls went to mosman hide the you know they 've done really quite will have one would expect them to of course Ballentine um so after after the war I mean I another thing I think that just saying the thing with the great war for a second of it is quite incredible when you get down to that level and look at the lives of individuals how this conflict not only changed yeah the map of Europe and you know the geopolitical setup of the whole world but it changes the lives of millions and millions of illegal and it 's because it 's at war isn 't it the Charles um first comes two comes to go to the ideal about aviation yes he was in he wasn 't a flawed person and he went to be a lawyer do you know an estoppel a stockbroker ooh that might be apocryphal anyway bear in mind he went to the war 16 he had gone grey phone in the stock exchange oh please he had been that sort of mind you know as an executive it was a an executive mine but he could he had a friend maybe when he was convalescing and after that the you know i think was October and I 've every I hate wood and currently he waggled a flight somewhere but well he 's in England right well he 's recovering yes but they 're running out of odd he has goes away from truck in LA when that would they were taken to hospitals in in in England and he supposed to plan a is done a flight there are all unauthorized well when you think of the sort of everybody they hope you didn 't really need much skills with nobody happy flying flying skills of a you would know that you know we had our way by where scores outside we had twenty four thousand Arab under the end of the world that 's a lot of aeroplanes they weren 't quite as they weren 't quite as complicated as a Boeing with three 324 330 airbus 330 isn 't cobain Boeing 747 left a lot of airplane it is yeah and i mean the yes indeed yeah um um though I guess at the end of the war he he hasn 't I do about aviation it 's keep what whereas Kingston Smith 's just addicted to flying arm sees a business potential yes and Elsa so he sees it it 's a way of making money Annie and he really comes back to Australia determined to I mean I guess marrying those two suicides you know that interesting aviation that he yes help entrepreneurial he take bearing imani we were born in October 98 he was tiller good young man buried on it was married when i was born in june 21 so allowing for the formalities that lecture Becky was properly married in married in 20 when he was only work 20 21 and almost immediately he established aviation aviation services John wasn 't because I 'm Scott he 's the guy you do have to lead out here john scalise and historian great historian and in those days everything was all the weight was in Melbourne Melbourne was the temporary capital that has been there for for yonks and aviation services if I located 50 for k and he was he was John on grateful to God John Scott for being this one out about the details of the first regular flight plan to operate from mobile up the baddest it so happened that embarrassed to the distance Australia 's the problems are essentially distance and the period that happened to be a guy in interested in aviation nothing but but he was a chemist see what was the names of Rudy Rudy first push moody yes out out out of breasts so this highly detailed old plan all laid out the publicity in the what time it would leave and all this and walk plant we had to start a service from ya know mobile melbourne about this event that the train was even out the bath responded make it was but then it gets delayed here a spark plug doesn 't_''_1836.22 were in the engine falls office visit he did that about five times i only got a reputation in Levin aviation magazine was great fame is essentially failing to get Jenny 's going yeah he buddy had this am he wrote a memoir on his way quite quite tragically on on his last boat boat trip over the United States hero then while it was never published didn 't he manuscript it 's in the National Library and he says in that but he started to feel at this time of course he 's recollecting a decade later but he says he remembered them he got the sense that this time the greatest danger of a career in aviation was starving to death starving to them yeah but they he had the beaches you know and he saw the industry and I think he says in one and one of it and what I mean letters it was wondering when he wrote was in the library that aviation was more important to Australia and to any other country in the world just because of the distance but talk about the opposition that he had which is when later on when they know they were getting major airline going the government wouldn 't subsidize them if they flew in competition with the railways so it was planning for the flight start the England Australia Australia ring with the air service and the official said he asked will go along on that but the airplane it 's got to stop cootamundra because there 's a train goes to Cootamundra we won 't have it flying straight to Sydney it 's got to get off and get on my SMA I forgot the name of the man fortunately I forgotten the name of the man you might have been a state minister for transport it is said to my father at once they job all this is this adjust really you mad man rich young men flying machine and I know no future in aviation well the CDP elm and in the family we still caught in the CDP often I get my wife says your father anyway cdb head it was a blue rubber a short fuse but that 's safe to be changed more more more diplomatic later on as weapon because weapon says very clearly yep that obit by was work if you Charles arms plan was we would build airplanes here and fired we hadn 't because the name well work it it 's a large bucket later on it was there essentially world war one fly but he was essentially an aviation engineer and he and he had Charles armor very very very close and so how did you know the if city of cities but had it all will come good you know we would have had an aviation industry year we would for his specific service which he was going to stop except he didn 't get to our little I want 1934 they were going to use the new American Douglases made here under license but the biggest the biggest influence against the development of Australia Asia Australian aviation was the British quite understandably you know they were starting to put Imperial Airways around around the world and then this out and in the in 34 the Melbourne a lot of northern air race the British built a racing plane and cotton Campbell black wooden Scotland Campbell Dracula and they screamed out and you know without any sleep and they were just about dead when they got here the second error plane to of the douglas dc-3 it was air-conditioned and warm and it came out and the Dutch were already operating regularly down to Jakarta which was then batavia but Australia understandably the brothel the bank of england and the australian British lunge to us the British will he had a spider whatever you get your bike and so you know we ain 't the visionaries I understood that yeah and it 's with that but this is the geopolitical thing yeah and you know you can 't you can 't escape that now I can go on wrong about about the British lines but dick casey who Bruce Bruce Bruce had Bruce empty casing the Bruce Bruce wanted to Prime Minister Bruce water the personal representative in London to keep him informed what the thinking was an almost every and he wrote a book which I recommend to it it 's either in their lively here I 'm sure it 's my beer p.m. and as it Casey 's personal letters to Stanley Melbourne Melbourne Bruce and although they look like Englishmen and spoke like Englishmen and Stanley Melbourne Bruce war warm and he was that he 'd broken he broke the mill broken a foot in the boy I think we 've had an MC from the First World War but thou regard rock gosh poachy whatever they were very very good Australians but the British within hands of the British banks understandably conf related to that point I guess it 's the last thing I want to ask you about before cummins and questions one of the most striking things that I removed from the day we spent together talking to you was a document you pulled out that your family came across only relatively recently over the last one yes and it 's it 's one of the tragic I mean Charles arms life is full of these tragic ironies and this one was the very final what wasn 't it and had he made the flight but he was killed on flying almost the same route via Hawaii back to Australia there was an announcement wasn 't it it was going to be made oh all year Steve I go back a bit Joe limes was the get the aviation thing almond Lundy give his aeroplane the faith in Australia to fly around on Election tours and what have you and Joe limes saw yes aviation was the way now his press secretary was Irvin Douglas him in my prestige on you and Ervin Douglas after the war was worked for astronaut on the mirror and Ezra Norton 's contribution to contact was there have a history page and that was run by edited by urban doneness of every day now urban Douglas Commission John Ford who was my became my number two later on in cuates to write the child 's own story and the reason that urban Douglas choses to publish this history story on Charles on which enabled him vendor publish a letter in in the mirror saying I Ervin Douglas drafted for Joe lines a recommendation for Charles armed benighted on his arrival here he would have arrived in sort of late December 34 now so I knew that but I 'm long as forgotten about it but everyone 's starting to get involved with the National Library and Archives and what having over of them archives take love you to ring them up and say you know sound sir so I rang up Oh God archives I 'm Val burn I 've just escaped emails and all that stuff we 're still the typos people snails and I can expand on that so I rang archives and I said I believe my father was recommended for a knighthood in nineteen December night in 34 and they said yes that would be that would be Prime Minister the government general The Guardian was Isaac 's by that yesterday yes we 'll get back to you within five days and i got it at home and i put copies over the interval live national library five here 's their recommendation by Jay Lyons now it was the format is interesting when you think then that all our affairs were handled by the Dominions office in line not by the not by the prime minister 's office by the Dominions office and when you think of all the Dominions that the Brits have you know being in the Empire from Tobago and bellezza as well so as the year was approaching knighthood time 19 years day there will be thousands of recommendations one of them would be from King I 'm both others cousin somewhere in Africa and so the format all of which are done in hand and down the left-hand column is the quota that be that the Dominions office is allowing the dominions and we can have one KCMG not commander of michael and jorge we could have I think was for memory 3cm GS and we could have two nights bachelor for each state but as it was Melbourne centenary their love of another for this is all written down beside the the quality allocation your rations so lion very late wrote to Isaac saying would equal or ganda London you know in Auckland was in the Dominions office thousands and thousands of recommendations and he wrote to to Isaac 's who was just round the corner of course from yarralumla to you know the lodge saying and the language is interesting from the prime minister of the gutter then Governor General and the governor-general was the contact with the British certain gentleman 's name which is there and so any insert instead Flight Lieutenant Charles Thomas Philippe arm and so when you look at the piece of paper that the guy 's name deferred was Stewart and it turned out he was the general manager of Fairfax newspapers so whether he then got it were they got the birthday honours and then underneath that it 's old but then that 's crossed out defer p.m. because my father didn 't get here so he was with within you know a couple of weeks ago you would have arrived here at the end of December and then he would he was to be knighted in the Indian me in the news on again on january the first when might would really meant something and as Lawrence wagon said of him in his obituaries country 's gratitude came just to dinner yeah yes look I mine are we running our time and I might open up if a couple of people had questions the historian to go on forever people with memory gave and further second there he managed to get out Warner online but when the aircraft lands it I think Brisbane first the aircraft taxing to the far part of the aerodrome and war i am line for pasta and the aircraft actually do any comment yes i 'm in in makka see I think write that in his bog received came to Smith which I should say is superb it 's the best one by far and there is a photograph that appeared a little bit ironically on the cover of the Sun because the Sun was very diplomatic it 's reporting the Sun didn 't want any the Sun very carefully avoided any of the kind of fracture asst things that went on between the crew members but ironically they put a picture on the cover in which you can see these two tiny figures we ever come across it it 's in the book and near Makka see I credit in for finding that I do differ on one point with me n 0 because n does believe that they were tossed out that either are more kingston 's with it more or less turned around and 's actually the case i came across an interview with john actually was involved in getting hairy line Jim worn out in 1958 from the 30th anniversary to other with quad rooster yes yeah you flew them out of them and they did a bunch of interviews while they were here with the press and they they actually spoke about leaving the aircraft and they very much said that it was there I mean they 're quite unequivocal in their statement that it was their choice and in Harry wise words we had enough we just wanted to go and they know i mean that 's as far as I 'm concerned that 's about as close to the horse 's mane if you 're going to get 30 years later of course so again that 's like many aspects of this flight there are a couple of ways we could read that but my reading is that yeah they they did that and it wasn 't_''_2732.5 on the chuckle about see that they were a child on it all the organizing and the contracting and what have you later tight and Charles had this legal mind he had a contract was written down and their contract that he drew with born or line was that they were to finish it 3g because Smith Ian arm reckon well if we got to Fiji we wouldn 't need them and they were hired hands they weren 't principle to the flight and that stopped putting them down and they 're absolutely vital but you know that their contract only got them to Fiji and it was cause of one of the opposition newspapers that said no they 've got they 've got to come on and Charles arm agreed to and Smith he said well we better bring him on to bring him on to Brisbane actually I mentioned briefly but they Charles arm really wanted this to be an Australian endeavor yeah and he looked and looked and looked winner in the united states are in america from the 10 it 's organizing the flight on 10 or 11 months and some of the best I think some of the best material I reckon on Charles armor no one from it 's in the State Library New South well as it Mitchell library and it 's some material it 's particularly the correspondence that the arm had during that period where he was trying to organize the flight and in that you get the sense of desperation is looking for in Australia then he realizes he 's not going to find one he approached you the Wilkins the explora had actually bought southern cross off he had his own harebrained schemes that he was am going on with flying over the Arctic and so on then I 'll blow and he slowed the barb in any of us would say raise the bar bid me um he said he 'd say that he 'd settle on it someone who was British okay so and then he couldn 't find a British art that 's been put in so he you know I think it was only with a few weeks to go I had Harry line and then harry potter do you know a wireless operator may I board it was was a friend of Harry line so it was was fortunate that without both so splendid and their jobs Harry area line was quite a character but near this living in my qantas days i was with Qantas management as the public PR guy the chief executive were recruited me personally be fair dealing with week on the writing side well no Germans could have a better brief than that so come then comes in 1958 the 30th anniversary I sent one of my guys to UM Ford and a movie photographer ever go and find water or a line and they did find them and the Warner was a bit down the drain and he 'd been on drugs and he wasn 't he didn 't have the strength of character that Harry Harry lined it 's a Halon did did all the talking and they were very very good and we did a movie of the movie scene if it 's it 's called I gave it the title flight flight in the yesterday I think okay and it 's in it 's in the film whatever it 's cool in the camp asked me like 20 emerged little side bars in that I inherited my father 's things one of which was his flying helmet now in the flying helmet the repairs big pads against the noise and in this particular one wasn 't it wasn 't a you know sponge it was a woman 's part of a blue powder puff now how that came about me miss this second edition my guys bring bringing water line out in a modern era plane as a constellation constellation at Honolulu and Fiji they had met and arranged to meet people who met Smith ian holm on their flight in 1928 now Charles arm and something out lost his ear protection pair and a one gave him her blue enough and that was it that was it that was in the that was in my final which which I wore in the airplane when Smith he kindly took me on the last flight little Johnny age what 13 or 14 or something I 've yeah yeah and it 's his story anyway yes it 's right and we 've just what 's the young you know he they had in Hawaii to the family they stated that Harry lion had he knew some people on the oxy be in the Navy so it 's been a bit of time at Pearl Harbor and this family packed them I think about 80 sandwiches for the triage getting and furnaces of coffee I imagine the sandwiches would have been pretty like about the 21st hour and there 's one point isn 't it way we 're all rights that in a radio message to to the outside world particularly to the media at least he writes something like sneaky must be in love I 've had three he 's not eating I 've had three to his one sandwiches so they said they 're bringin white and the other thing we know that foods the coffee thermos they ran out of water and they only had coffee and it must have been open it went rancid didn 't it and one point he writes in the wild that he has a swig of coffee that makes in quite ill so you can imagine that but it wasn 't the 've all four of them were okay everybody shmoney like that yeah and that 's one of the thing that they mentioned over and over again and it 's guitar permission aging as I promised Monica but the thing I mentioned over and over again in their memoirs analog and son is that they 're just craving a cigarette at one point home writes that he 'd give it to you for a smoke yeah and in all the photographs e nom Hawaii Swiss been here and the folks unless steps out of the air place man quite right next to mine Kingston Smith 's first words on climbing out at Eglin find a bracelet worth my kingdom a little smoke and then of course there are other natural it is normally considered a bit impolite to talk about but harry charles arm had bought can or required of the best equipment have navigation equipment to drift recorder now the Southern Cross doors only about this high and Harry Lime to get used the difficult i had to hold this door open with one knee and leave me out over check his navigation and so on and when he was doing this a Smith he would throttle back so the airplane was flying slower and not so much slipstream okay and how are you I 'm said to me that he put his head out it wasn 't raining having got lip and it was Charles oh god would go pick up the front using the slower SP reduce bail on that night we might have we want to continue the discussion informally up stones with the one _"

she sort of wrestled all those children into into order and taught them how to dance very firm she wasn 't a kind of fun you know kind of teacher she was just so gentle she never ever raised of her and you didn 't need to always patient always kind fair in the extreme my mother Mavis sucks taught ballet in Mossman for a remarkable 70 years between 1923 and 1993 this is her story Vera Mavis Sykes was born in Auckland on the 2nd of December 1909 she was known as and only ever used the second name Mavis she was the second of four children and eldest daughter of Joseph celesta Sykes and Ida Jane sucks the sucks family lived in Hamilton before migrating to Australia in 1920 when my mother was 11 by the time my mother was fought in the Sykes family expanded by the addition of younger sisters Helen known at 13 why on Road Massimo Mavis developed a lifelong passion for ballet from an early age she began dancing and teaching ballet in Mossman at aged 14 while she was still a school girl attending north sydney girls high school initially she taught pupils in the front room of the family home at hwayeong road but she practiced in the back garden as well among her early pupils were their younger sisters my mother applied some of the money from giving lessons to pay for Nellie and Olga 's apprenticeships Nellie as a seamstress and Olga as a hairdresser we were nine Wong Road and they couldn 't afford to pay the rent so my mother saw Mavis and said would you like to give the girls dancing lessons as the flats become vacant and you can wipe that off the rent she had two sisters there was Miss Olga and I can 't think of the other one and I said to my mother what do we call the sisters and she said you call the eldest girl miss Sykes and the others by their Christian name and eldest of three girls and realized I 'd be Miss Dyas them and they 'd been miss Janet and miss Ethel gave me a certain status was how I imagined at some stage and while she continued to dance and teach Mavis obtained her formal ballet teaching accreditation including solo seal from the Royal Academy of Dance in London around 1930 my mother abandoned the front room of the family home and rented at the top of Bagwell Road Mossman opposite the Morris brothers school the Mavis sucks bellows studio occupied that site for the next 36 years in those days the class was held in this hall so to speak in bardwell Road our space that was all right where the kids dogs but the waiting room if he could call it that was a sort of bit of lane and it was all money these horrible school benches I mean that 's where the mothers had to sit and wait for them this was the old dance studio I remember I 'd go there after school with mum wheeling my sister in the stroller and she 'd wait mothers used to look through the wall there was old wooden wall with lots of holes in it so they could see how their little E 's were going unbeknownst to the children although I think we actually only my mother 's watching you and what about when it rained we had to dance around back at bus the holes in the roof and buckets catching all the drops the examinations for the grades were all held in Babel and she had little peep holes that she could look through divisions there were lots of play poems from the ocean about your exam he knew she was watching through the pinhole and all the boys used to look through the holes in the wall from the outside the building at the corner of Nathan Lane and Vista Street which was previously a Plymouth Brethren meet all became the new home of the ballet studio in 1966 and then we moved on to the place in Vista Street I just remember that looking really old and derelict but you know you 'd go inside and dad would drop me off on the adult evening miss science would be there and we 'd have our lesson and we had lovely miss Phillips playing the piano she was she seemed like quite an old lady then she probably wasn 't I can remember what the waiting room felt like it was quite a Vista Street where I started it was quite a dim room there wasn 't much natural light I remember that in there were wooden benches it was quite an old feeling sort of place and in the room itself the dance room had this beautiful sort of golden light because you went it was in afternoons it was always in the afternoon I don 't the light feels quite distinctive to me the Vista Street building was to be demolished so my mother moved the ballet lessons to the Mosman community center at the corner of Short Street and my Agha Road which is now the home of the Mosman Art Gallery my mother danced in city theaters as well as in suburban productions mounted by the Mosman musical society by the time she was 19 my mother had been earliest record of her as the ballet mistress of the Society is in the program for the vagabond key in August 1931 which was produced at the Mosman town hall I remember Mavis very well of all the shows that I did but apart from being a a choreographer was a well trained ballet she actually played the part of azure II in the desert song I remember her rehearsal coming up to say truth just don 't push me away push me hard so that I 'll fall on the stage it looks more dramatic so I felt a bit intimidated about this but I did but it worked because when I push this she flew across the stage land nice and looked up as much as say look at I 've had done to me the audience sort of was wonderful they all clapped and the music played that and then she performed the dance of his yuri and have went down very well but the star pupil at this time was a young Charles Boyd Charlie was already an accomplished and well-known dancer when he enrolled at dance partners and danced together on a number of occasions during World War two the Mosman music of the society went into hibernation to fill the void and do something for the war effort a number of dancers including my mother and other members of the Mosman musical society volunteered to visit Air Force bases in western New South Wales to entertain the troops with musical comedy and dance apart from doing the actual musical shows we did do other entertaining great wait soldiers they all wanted to talk to you as well and the shows that they used to put on at the old anzac memorial hall which is now country right some would just sit and look at us some would wave you know try to talk to you some would read the paper but some just sat there and they always gave us nylon stockings so many packets of annoyance every time we did it during the war not only did my mother continued to teach ballet in the barbel Road studio but she also taught ballroom dancing to one aspiring ballroom dancer was a very tall they were mutually attracted and began seeing each other outside the dance lessons they married on March 24th 1944 two weeks after I was born in June 1945 my mother was back at work teaching ballet in the afternoons while her mornings included much of the household shopping and housekeeping she was up in the morning she was doing everything making sure everything was fine for the family off to the ballet school putting on performances lesson after lesson after lesson you know so many generations my mother my grandmother my sisters everybody had this experience and everybody loved it so she must have been doing something very very right she really loved teaching dance she loved it putting on performances she loved what she did with the moslim Musical Society and yeah and I think everybody really recognized and appreciated that contribution she was a very very particular teacher she 'd get every little detail and she always started with the feet then you got the arms and then you had to put the face and the post will use my mother maintained an arduous schedule of classical and for younger pupils as soon as school finished for the day and continued into the evenings for the older girls and working women while on Saturdays she taught all day she did and we were doing triple time steps breeze that was one thing that she always did to say if you learn ballet preferably on a rady everything you could then do anything but if you started learning tap you couldn 't necessarily build ballet yes I do remember Mavis coming around the class of little girls and just turning your foot out a little bit I mean obviously it must have been incredibly frustrating for her with all these little children who were just not quite doing it correctly and she was quite gentle about it and she would turn your feet out or just always pull down this middle finger of the hand so it had to be very very feminine we had to be beautifully dressed all of the time so here had to be immaculate and I can particularly remember having to have our ballet shoes tied crossed over and all the little loose ends have loose ends on your ballet shoes when she showed us a ballet step it was absolutely beautiful it was beautifully executed and we knew exactly what was wanted of us every time we would all get to class early we have a little changing room or waiting room all the mothers would come in they would wait and the the girls would have to put the hair up there was a lot of hairspray and a lot of bobby pins and then run into the class and we would have to curtsy to Mavis Sykes as we ran in and stand at the bar who was never any talk there was no problem ever with discipline we stood at the bar and we stood to attention it was quite regimented and we absolutely adored her we had a lady playing the piano that was our music and I think her name was Jean she sat in the corner on the left and Mavis was on the right and we started every exercise always facing miss Sykes we would never start facing the back we would never turn our backs would run backwards with our face facing towards Miss Sykes we would never ever turn our back it would be considered rude miss Sykes would literally stand on our knees she would put one foot on this knee and one foot on this they literally stand there push your knees down onto the ground which I sure wouldn 't be very good for you but that 's what she did at the end of every single class you had to curtsy and the first curtsy you would take to Mavis Sykes and then she would indicate the so the second courtesy you would thank the lady for playing the piano for you so you you always had this gratitude of thanks it was later on that I realized that the way Mavis taught whether it was an intentional thing or not or just you know intuitive to her was the environment she created was very friendly very normal non competitive non stressful Mavis just taught children how to dance she obviously loved doing it and that 's what she was committed to and so it was really nice environment it then the way I guess I teach have taught myself when I 've been doing a lot of teaching is that Mavis didn 't get up in front of a mirror and and not show off but demonstrate that much in fact she demonstrated very little she 'd sort of do the conceptual sort of indications if you like so you 'd you 'd get something that was quite an idea that was quite holistic and then you did what I think is the best type of teaching you figured things out for yourself from these years my mother had many long-standing pupils who she countered as good friends I remember such names as Lorna Lester Betty Souter Betty Triple A Carolyn hedge Marjorie Crouch Bettie Gibson Hilary Crampton Shayne Carol Jane Plumlee Alison Arnott Eliska Sarkar and Eleanor vagina to name but a few many of her past pupils brought their daughters and sons along develop quite often several generations of dancers from the same family gracious the novice sucks ballets junior I loved her dearly dearly and she was a mentor in my life she came to my born in 1987 I took her along to me the Saks for her first lessons and she was this tiny little poppet probably about two years old standing at the bar placing her feet and after the first class miss Sikes said to me do you know I haven 't had a child with so clever that picks the steps up as quickly as since you first came to me she was so sweet I mean she probably said that to everyone but she just made you feel very very special number of long-term former pupils had notable careers in the arts and other fields for example Hilary Crampton voluma is amazing woman who I got to know later on in life Hilary was she was one of Australia 's leading dance academics she was a senior dance critic for the age for about more than a decade she was an activist she openly called herself an arts activist the sense I had with Mavis as a teacher is that it was about making a contribution it wasn 't about Mavis it wasn 't about her being the best teacher think that 's something I realized later on too and I think that 's a very admirable and sound way to run something like a ballet school Hilary was like this as well you know she was all about making a contribution Shan Carroll danced professionally in Europe with the Netherlands Dance Theatre in Australia with the Sydney dance company and is now active in arts project management and consultancy Mavis created such an accessible environment that 's so positive the it just enables you to sort of keep things in perspective when you spend most of your hours at work with a mirror in front of you it can tend to get a little bit self obsessive but I so I think those early that early induction into dance that was just so normal and lovely was was really critical to staying in the in the career Allison Arnott went on to study at the Roy ballet school in London and then dance professionally in the ballet starts didn 't earn birth in Germany Jane Plumlee and her two younger sisters Sally and Johanna studied ballet with my mother in say 73 then there was silly and she didn 't start with my over secretary until 75 and then johanna pushed her way in about eighteen months later she started a two and a half which was mainly because she was always there and stood in front of him over some embarrassed her january is extremely to what couldn 't get a job if you like in ballet in australia because the men were all short than me so she became one of the bluebells and danced at the leader for a year in the middle of her law course so you know even as a mature age she was still dancing after year there she died of boredom you know the same dance twice a night six nights a week the first dance of 00 p.m. the next one at 00 a.m. and then Sally Ann although she finished missmiss Sykes of energy at 15 she went on and taught adult tap and jazz at the most of leave in college so she she kept up that side of everything although she was never a very good classical and John and ever the youngest one their daughters and she didn 't really keep it on afterwards she found other interests boys Jane danced professionally in France on her return to Australia she qualified as a lawyer and is now a leading intellectual property lawyer and a partner in a prominent law firm in Washington DC my mother firmly believed that the excitement of and confidence to be had from public performance should not be confined to the particularly talented or gifted and should not be known to any of her pupils there was a great sense of friendship camaraderie with the other girls Mavis didn 't have a favor anyone there was no one in particular who was the star of the show every year we all had a chance to do things to be a gem in a shell at the bottom of the ocean or in a zoot suit for many years and right up to her retirement in 1993 she produced an annual show at nozman town hall for all her pupils these shows featured valerie vignettes from the very youngest beginners to the veterans you 'd have to get the length of material you 'd have those beautiful costumes your mother would make and then you 'd be on stage before the show started and they 'd be Kyle 's and the curtain of the Mosman Town Hall and you count people through the curtain to see how many people in the audience and then go backstage again and at the time with Hollywood and movies a lot of the dancing you did it in a line putting your hand on the other woman 's shoulder and you danced along doing all the high kicks than that and then we also did Russian dancing and that was a different type of dancing again we did tap dancing was the one when you 're in a line and that just to be good fan but was always marvelous and the audience loved us and we just loved being there each year we had a concert and one of the mothers would make the first costume Mavis would design what she wanted on a piece of paper she would have a drawing of her idea and she would make the costume then all the other mothers were called in to look at the finished product and using newspaper they would have to cut out what they thought whether it was a like a template of the costume she had this knack of giving the mothers directions to what costume she wanted made it was a barest sort of drink she 's really what hide the hem to be off the floor and that was roughly is I think and it always ended up looking beautiful our mothers had to make all the costumes and what would happen is that one of the mothers would create the first costume and then our mothers that have to come up too bad will Road and however they did it I 've got no idea but they managed a bid that have to work out a pattern and the costume was absolutely amazing it was his black can-can costume that had you know like a square neck and thin straps and it was a full skirt a huge full rounded skirt and underneath around the whole skirt were probably about had to actually do all that filling by hand and then we had these little black knickers with with red frills all around them and a bonnet which had thrillers on the inside of the bonnet you know when it came to a costume she knew what she wanted but you had to produce it maybe often with the costumes the I did 3 4 5 before I managed to get the question right I was a butterfly and I think I 'm three and I remember the color of my purple outfit and the sparkles and sequins that was my mother had to sew on the wings I just loved I loved that outfit and it kept me going to ballet really just all the time up to when I was spring well we had hoops and we had to run in put the hoops up in a circle and run back Oh a band or music I can 't even was a band but the band was playing the boys were seen but they weren 't singing in sync so we had no idea when to get running and some of us were I was a bit of a disaster but it was fun I loved being on stage and I don 't know if the concerts were always in the Mosman Town Hall but I certainly remember constants in the Mosman Town Hall and there were evenings of great excitement and thrill than you have you makeup done in your head you yeah but your mom and your hair done then our mom 's gave us a little present there was a tradition that there would be a little present because it was a really big night it was like you know you didn 't get flowers on stage but it was that kind of feel about it it was like a really big deal and again it was all run very shipshape and no talking off stage and all of that sort of stuff but I do remember being on stage and I I did really love that actually slightly embarrassed to admit that I still do actually also I used to stage manage the constantly annual concerts that she put on in the mosque from made we had to paint scenery and make sure the scenes came down and the lighting and all the props on the stage so that was my little contribution dad used to paint the sets for us yes it was always quite a feature and they had to be made of something which would stand up almost on its own and be decorative and thus were thinking they put on the stage and up again in about three seconds flat at the end of every concert miss hikes would come out and speak to the parents and then she would award each class there would be a scholarship winners somebody whoever had worked really hard would have their training for free for the next year and they get a trophy there would be special mentions and merit awards and certificates and ribbons and all sorts of things she was very very generous and the Paramount 's were Parramatta fabulous so he practice all these are all holiday haul we did all the shows and then they 'd have a pen which would run three weeks they didn 't know a had Christmas story different all the children from all ages were in it work that I remember one time there was a very large winter scene and there was a sleigh bought on stage I think Robin Jacobs was sitting in there in this life anyway the lights across the front of the stage all collapsed down onto the front proscenium and we were all in a would 've been about seven or eight I suppose all in a little line they lie across the front and the like the whole lot but dropped and just miss a whole line of girls I 've heard that story a little our way yeah we were dressed as snowflakes and then some of the larger girls were run the horses and they closed the curtain got the lights back up open the curtain and out we went again and we just hurried on one of the girls she 'd rather badge and she was dancing we 're doing the scene across the front and her scripts just busted out fairly everything and she just dancing on dancing on mrs. coming round backstage again ballet classes the concerts and then there were the early pantomimes with the Dame dressed up were greatly exciting so again we had matinee performances because we were quite young and then there was the Musical Society that all of Davis 's ballet girls went on to and so there were those series of performances that we could do my mother was held in great affection about the many thousands of boys and girls she had taught her she was so tough on us girls but the minute we did something right and she gave us the most tiny little smidgen of praise it just meant everything to us the years with miss Sykes has instilled my great love of ballet and I 've actually gone on to do a lot of ballet as an adult right up until last year I was still taking classes and I always just think about all the things she taught us and I think that personal discipline I think that she instilled in us girls really was something that carried on in our lives and the interest she took in us all me a compliment with your state with me because she was quite firm if she said something nice to you you did remember it and she came up to me once while we were doing our exercises at the bar and said to me you have a beautiful ballet body and I thought that was fantastic it was very kind of thrilled by that she wasn 't involved in ego or you know that kind of measurement that sort of thing it was just keep it straight keep it simple yeah which is good my mother was appointed a life member of the Royal Academy of Dance in recognition of her services to ballet and in 1958 the Academy appointed her an Australian national children 's examiner her examining duties entailed an exhausting schedule of area road and train travel across Australia to conduct examinations meanwhile she continued to run the ballet studio with the assistance of friends and older students my mother and father were disappointed when in late 1977 Virginia and I left Sydney to live in Brisbane where our twin sons James and Ben were born four role of grandmother to that of Ballet Mistress Barrie examiner wife mother mentor and all the other family and ballet roles she embraced eventually the daily effort in teaching ballet proved too much and my mother retired in 1993 aged 84 after 70 years of teaching ballet in Mossman I think after she retired she she was rather disabled with arthritis we 'd go to the theatre she loved going to the theatre and we go to various theatre shows I remember we took her to two shows and she really enjoyed them the first one was the Rocky Horror Show and she loved that and the second one was the best little whorehouse in Texas and she really adored that she really left under everything he was going onstage she also enjoyed going to us to Estelle foods particularly the ones at the Opera House but the problem was that she used to come on their defects of the dancers in a very loud voice which was rather embarrassing when you were sitting next it was purely a friendship when I was a friendship until we lost her aged I think she was a wonderful woman and a great Mossman legend people still talk about it _"

    "text": "it was initiated by kendo following the fact that we 've had the ospin ArtPrize since 1947 he said why don 't we do something fingers and of course one of the biggest things we can do for young people atmos an art gallery is exhibit their work so then you that price is amazing thing we get entrance from all across New South Wales we get hundreds of entries literally hundreds of young people aged between 20 12 years and 20 entering and and vying for the opportunity to alien selected to go in the exhibition and be potentially win up to nine thousand dollars with prizes and a number of other different scholarships and packages and so on when I first entered the prize I was about 15 years old I was in high school at the time I meet other my part teacher Michelle Marshall mentioned to me and I didn 't really have any conception of our prices at the time at least none that were kind of available to students or too hard come opening I and the prize it was it was really great parents and adolescent me was really really pleased at the time still and of course I after that success i kind of just cats progressively entering the prize each year that i was very that I was qualified to enter until 21 or something so over a number of years JD before his work is actually really sort out from the crowds work has been very sophisticated it 's very different it 's very playful it has a lot of cultural references its family from the Philippines and I think the sophistication of the concepts in his work and the execution of them has really made in his work stand apart and be a real stand up it 's not he 's won the various sections of the youth art prize over a number of years and then in India in 2006 the work that he entered our gallery director was particularly taken by as with friends of the gallery and the Friends of gallery actually offer to purchase that work for the loss when I gallery collection so we were absolutely thrilled to accept that offer and it 's we do want to champion work of young people and this particular artwork is just a standard and you can see that we 've actually got it hanging in the very prominent part of the gallery now we have our newly refurbished gallery foyer and right next to our nerves gift exhibition of historical images of moss mother 's is a wall that we dedicate to works from our collection and so it 's wonderful to be able to display JD 's work which is so fresh and lively and interesting and the intricacy and delicacy of that work and the way the compositions are so perfectly arranged next to work of historical works by famous Australian artists about last night so the thrilled to have to have that in the foyer and such a prominent stage so I felt really great it was kind of shocking shocking to my 18 year old soul to be right into a public collection which is inexplicably wonderful exhibit through the prize kind of gave me a general idea what an art gallery was outside of more public institutions so I kind of I could start working in a gallery myself first radish gallery where I 'm at co-director so another along with 900 people and kind of working and they also as curator as an artist it 's kind of important to wear many different hats employed in order to get yourself sort of employed in busy and I also happened to work as an odd installer and I was employed by chance at muscleman art gallery and I came back came there on a job one week and I noticed that this work though it made when I was 18 they 'd bought this hanging in the park so that was really kind of surreal like a blast from the past and I know how to chat with Katrina your approach me to have an exhibition in their newly instituted projects faith and they 've been some really interesting works in there so I was really keen to kind of come on board and the other interesting being another recent initiative at the gallery is our cube exhibition station this is a small dedicated gallery of space specifically for the work and JD of course has been on our radar for a number of years ever since he first came to prominence in the enterprise we all watched him grow and change we 've watched him go thru axle it 's in all the work that he 's produced in that period and now we 've actually loaded him to participate as one of our artists showing in the queue so I think that really shows stadium the benefits that you know watching a young artist and being offered and support by the exhibition such as the youth art prize that give me a matter such a great opportunity to show their I wear this week and I was attracted their own progress as well and now we can say that he 's an artist right merit um kind of being 24 now maybe nine or so years after into the prize I 'm much more aware of the challenges that daily face is my agent also 15 so you regardless of what your opinions of our prizes are I think it 's really great if young people 15 year olds gallery or by a public institution that 's really great that 's really important and if it can sow that seed of confidence which helps you move on your journey as an artist um that 's great that 's really _"

    "text": "alright so the first book I 've ever written I 've done a few television things over the last few days people asked fairly predictable questions which is perfectly right and you expect that you 're going to have to you know go through that again but I was very pleased that when the ABC book ties me to do it because I 'm 75 so in like 10 years time with walking remember pyjamas dribbling so you you 've got to get these things out what you can you know I will be dying right and once I started I couldn 't stop I wrote a hundred and forty thousand words and they cut it down to eighteen thousand my writing is not particularly good my spelling is appalling so the first thing is my assistant case and then my daughter Camila had to decipher everything that I 've written before it could be put into a typed form and then various things had to be taken out there 's a lot of politically incorrect things in there my age I 'm a man is going to be a sort out and there was a few defamatory things that I 'm really disappointed that they had to go but that 's the law and you can 't say you can 't_''_78.25 say the pantry 's things about that people I had a bit of a run-in with the Commonwealth Bank there 's a little bit about that that 's not funny enough when I write the very first when I wrote the very first draft of it I 've been nothing about the loss of money I 'd written nothing about getting your in Australia I 'd written nothing about prostate cancer and yet a lot of interviewers want to talk about those kinds of things so I 'll cover them off very briefly we lost blood money because I trusted an accountant I 'm not entirely in the silly but I gave the accountant the responsibility of sighing the chase I figured this might end this would turn into tears this story so it 's done very quickly we ended up having to go there with Lois we 're never dealt with those before thousands of an allegory ourselves talk fast for us and the other annoying thing is that the two barristers like our barrister and the other team they both lead investment and they work together on some particular project and so I said go up to the bloody cheese room at the fourth village where the cover little bits of paper and just have a little chat to one another you can really we can we can we could sort it out that way you don 't need to go to court you don 't need all these documents and you don 't need all of these rooms with Leedom had a mediation by Tony Fitzgerald cost a lot of money to have done picture it 's a total waste of time I mean that the common thing weren 't taking it seriously so rejected everything they did so you 'll learn something about the law and your mum you don 't want to do that again prostate cancer I was operated on a Friday I was home on Sunday I was planning on Wednesday and I 've added the whole series of pictures about subject very seriously reviewed and the critics were very fulsome in their praise which I was very pleased about I was just slightly annoyed that it 's only if you paint some pictures about death that people think you must be heard that 's really serious a bunch of liars is very serious a picture of that moment is very serious it just depends how well you do it and I went to school here in muslin and so did Judy we both went to Mossman high a very long time ago there it 's still trans and caring people and it was boys on one Sun and girls on the other and I didn 't want to I wanted to do a they didn 't teach you out two boys which is like annoying because they 're very good a reputation for for art now it boys so I convinced them that I should be able to go to the library and not a fist but a library and look at books are not like Wallis Philippine I wanted to find pictures of nude women basically in the art if you have to give up something and I said well great I 'd like to give up algebra because algebra I never met under any circumstances never had any kind of relationship Albert algebra line and infected couple years ago doing Ann Arbor in Kazakhstan and it 's a very big statue to the man who invented algebra and I could couldn 't stop myself I walk across and kicking it I saw that so that benevelon it 's a funny girl because one side boys on the other and you only saw the girls at I keep them in a half time but it 's not and it 's not edible it 's my lunch that 's the correct terminologies next time on you 're longing to screw up my life so at play lunch time you could go there and boys and one side girls on the other but you can see parts of girls and in the for going to be cheap food food parts of girls had a profound effect on my life so I 've got a special exemption to leave school to go falling too hard so I left art school I wanted to travel I wanted to start a business I started a business called visual communication with an item and went to school with me we stood together in the back of the classroom me gazing at the window basically I was very good at that gazing out the window namely thinking and things my might Bob who was my best man said in the middle and did this is explicitly technical Troy did very very complex is German tank battles quite good but didn 't have any relationship to that subject anyway so I got the exemption Lee school I went to art school I started this is a bit of waste of time but my first job was two weeks I was offered two weeks I was offered a job at Smith and Julius it 's a very old traditional the studio right Roland wetland there were hundreds with it I was there to attend reporting as a week and another guy of only 28 pounds or where he and my own office and the real clincher I was wanted they did it purple 1959 but suddenly I was an art director I was at I never considered that I would go straight from article to being a hater I wanted to travel I like mass communication I liked design I was good at it I went first of all to Japan because I was thought of straight in Japan would have a very close relationship I 've had a lot of exhibitions in Japan and the first people who really responded to we did what we did were young Japanese specially young japanese girls because they would see the things when we had but in the first exhibition i made 12 10 shirts to give to the press had a simple drawing of sydney harbour and Marian bond avestan wrote a very nice piece that you know you can hang it down on yourself for a diner on the wall is an integrity to everybody does I was pleased about that anyway are we still selling that design but it was a time kind of nationalism frustrates the 80s you know suddenly it 's it 's World Series there is the three Aswang commercials one we 've been that Lex another great normal and one with my vegetarians were feeling very confident I think it 's from about themselves timing so we open a little shop first of all I had Justin and I always knew I wanted to add my own gallery Sony like the chef learning a restaurant I mean what 's the difference since I found it I think it 's a very straightforward thing to do no one tells you how great the work is it 's on the wall by the life of you don 't and I don 't want to work for anybody else anyway so you know better for us to have our own gallery so I had a little gallery in Los Sydney I had a t-shirt on code hanging around so I used to come in and buy them and there was a magazine called bully blood that came out at that particular time and I would they always wanted to use my work mr. cutter sure I 'll give you the cover you can be space in a wider audience and I was trying to make things that people liked there 's a headline in The Guardian recently very quite a nice piece in fact a piece of service put the headliner I think this understood him I 'm probably not written by the woman who wrote a probably Roberto said editor and it said something like sell out one treat wonder or as for his most underrated artist doesn 't matter about the last two but sell out is not right not right I sold in I started to do things that were a product now young generation understands that perfectly now but an older generation is a outfit each industry would much prefer to go up a different kind of track and that came clear to me once I was a Canberra it made me in the early eighties people are starting to see what I could do and the business man singing time a suit a briefcase that he probably no they said you can do nurse eject he said I 've always wanted to meet here say thanks very much he said you else in the world liked what you did it that I think it 's great I thought to myself no one else doesn 't well that 's a fairly big number what about moment the dog in the kids no one else well I don 't make so there 's a lot of upside if no one else in the world likes what you could do I think what he made was maybe obviously even then going about things that wasn 't a normal track that Australian artists do and that was an art that we returning that was pieces of design where you design something for in an audience and if it works you do some more it 's a nice girl there with little red glasses and they 're like my glasses I could turn like if I was drawing something for you if you 're real Japanese go I can throw on koala so cute you would fight by their very cuteness because that 's what you need to do so a lot of Japanese girls would go back to Japan and they would be buying the in the other day people are talking about all of the detail we have it done what happened is that once we 've suffered to do things we are not dock shamelessly and once people saw things that a bit too bright color everybody was doing those kinds of things so it 's like annoying but you can 't turn around say we didn 't do that I 'll give an example of John Coates John Hurt 's randomly be James now Kimmel and I did the program of the opening and closing 70 the booklets themselves but John poets in a talk the other day I was in the audience he recognized me he acknowledged me which was very nicely said understand did the uniforms for the volunteers invent games no I didn 't do it at all they would bet they look bad that they weren 't that good you worked a lot of color it 's quite complicated to put it again it 's like working with a big gesture but everything that was seemingly bright we caught it I don 't move item that I am most is that somebody 'd an internship that was line for line drawing or were the Sydney Harbour Curran that I done every color correct every line correct the single day the way is underneath where I 'd written Sydney Harbour Lisbon Dominion Gulf of Thailand cherlene it includes access that 's it clear that somehow it might not be the right thing but you accept that like in America when we had licensing arrangements that people would not be such shame as we they 're like you get out of it you can go the airport in LA and all of those turret shots it all become carry not by suffice Vesta but the American licensee you can see those people they have to give you the money that you would have got had there been your designs and they had to destroy the rest of the things instead it 's much more complicated I 've never done anything I 've never done anything about it but in America I did a lot of things in America like I did I did the design for koala blood they like like that wanted to open quite a bit said sure I 'll do it because she was really promoting history and dishonor and we used to send little notes that can follow them their shoppers irking was really quite good and then they said well you know we want to use some of your drawings on lots of other things and I said will none have tits business it has to be a licensing arrangement now and instead of giving a little handwritten note back to a lady I 've got this note with all employers names down one side basically saying well I won 't use the words but basically say look we 're not interested you gave it to her that 's it so I was annoyed about that but I do want the complication so I gave it to that three weeks later God called me up said that tenderness again he said look my name is Bart Jacobs I 've got a shop in Malibu he said I 've seen the work you 've done for quality you said I want you to do some work a very big in California well I don 't really do bunnies anyway I sent him over a couple of toiletries his slightly longer ears bicycle anyway he came back if you same night he walked as a buddy smirk my god said they 're walking out the door they London so then he said look what about Scottie dogs do you discourage out well I said I 'm in this very tub said if you want to talk you got to come to spare anyway he came to Australia we started a business relationship he 's a nice bloke we we were I I did work for him and his company for a long time which meant all down the California coast you know Santa Barbara Santa Monica things like that we had shops under license we had designs going I was even later that I went to Disney you know they wanted me to look at the Disney characters to see without their son whether what I want to do it basically but it was quite interesting to go there you get down dead as they go down then down past the three peaks and then you 'll get to be signed about and it 's just that bizarre that or different well anyway I don 't want to do so I 've done all the Californian things then they want to meet to because you can write an alphabet you can write a Californian alphabet so that you can write all kinds of word little paper at that point that 's a piece of design that 's not arts piece of design has only wanted me to do with the Midwestern cities I 'm gonna calling together I spent such a long time looking at Albuquerque I could never get it right you know such a complicated word that I Albuquerque on I 'm going to do that and so that sort of came to the conclusion too so we 've had big licensing rights in America we had all the windows in bloomingdales at one stage we had we had things in Macy 's we did a lot of things but it was always under license so it wasn 't precisely the way that we would that came to a head once in Japan I was in at the airport we had a good licensing arrangement I was on I was on the way to make the person of this particular company and I saw the big shot my name there and full of stuff for the stuff that we hadn 't really done stuff that might have been vaguely about the feeling but not us you know people would ring up from other countries and let 's say I appreciate Coca brand is very good and she kept it what are you doing in brown nothing my booty brown on my face Salman spinning so those licensing arrangements always come do you trust the people and you want to do it and if those two things arrived you continued to do so we had license arrangement in Japan for about five years Mary character maybe seven years the one shot that we had became 15 shops and it was good but if you had 15 shops William had a shop in a little shop in there 15 jobs you need to have 50 shops that store managers and you need to have international meetings with people and I didn 't want to do that all of it was distracting for me for the painting and I would be spending much less time designing things than I would be painting but of course the designing thing was the thing that you are all seeing and you know a design for for Sheraton or for art and so companies like that would put the work everywhere but it was only a small part of the output that I was doing and you cop a bit of criticism on the way I use that I already told you the cameraman I use as an example there was somebody who took the trouble to ring a release the sellers in his paper and work that in his opinion Kenda does not have a scintilla of ability now I 'm not going to university but I understand it 's until a tiny I 've got more than a scintilla and at the other extreme this is very nice lady in canberra who continues to write to us and she wrote Monet and David Hockney and one of those people and if you put them all together that I was ten times better than all people now in defense of that lady she 's actually just gone into a home in Canberra sir she 's not you know she 's not into I I am burning place that she should feel those things but in between it 's kind of up to people what do you feel about it painting yourself is up to you it 's not you can 't add it up it 's what you feel The Tipping paintings up in the front door just that hadn 't seen for other libraries either all right hanging is it you just don 't know where it 's going to end you start off with some kind of idea but then it has a track of a time and it 's very hard it 's only up to what other people think about it I I spoke recently so I 'm not against installations but I 'm a painter not really been artists and artists a very misused were kids and send itself into our police now I 'm an artist well probably not I think you probably got it on paint 519 and then and then talk about it 's a strange journey because you spend it on your own you set the project yourself and it certainly led us to some amazing situations and all I ever wanted to be judged by was what I was trying to do I was trying to do swim it was a good swimmer if I 'm trying to do mainly positive it wasn 't a good painting but everybody has different ideas about things you do have to accept into what other people think about things it 's one day think about it and it 's like painting it shouldn 't give you everything on the first view it should give you a pleasure over time and in the time when we are bombarded by horrific things on television every night one is sitting there watching watching the news Peggy should be more about pleasure I think more like poetry if you play it over time make you any out of a room and if there are pictures that you don 't look at get new pictures you know it 's such a personal thing and I often find pictures that have more love and more honesty and sometimes little country shows or I once went to the Royal Easter Show and I found this picture of a woman called Fran Garda she 's dead now better than Grandma Moses lived in the upper reaches of the Hunter Valley and I collected a lot of her peaches and there were just little naive pictures of the little house she lived in and her husband on the on the front porch with one of those little metal things where you fixed up issues and everybody pansy was painted absolutely beautiful beautiful you don 't need a vortex to tell you that 's good if you like that kind of thing it 's good and you can even swim it there are other people you can 't use the word pretty or better than is you attempting out there shouldn 't live like that that is right now since anything like that I trigger behavior process I used to have it I still have it I suppose although however doesn 't happen now I just had the kids when they first got into the business look here 's I think it 's called the Mozilla option the Brazile option but what I mean by that is if you wake up in the morning you think I 'm really learning to go to Brazil get a bizarre little Brazil you have to love it it 's a great privilege to be a buyer I don 't take it lightly at all it 's it 's I 've never saw the government go ahead on anything from anybody but so I wanted to see whether I could support us by that now they 're supporting us now the the fingers die halfway through their life in other words there 's never enough time to paint all the paintings that you 'd like to paint and there 's never enough time to get better at it that 's the drive the drive is wanting to get better at it this guide that interviewed me today if making and I always say it 's the next one and I 'd already scream I described it today that the guide no Saturday is a fantastic day senator it 's really a beautiful day sunday was a very beautiful day is very gray and very soft it 's working along Chinaman 's beach in the morning and the sky and the sea were almost the same color you can hardly see the horizon just two kinds of Gray 's one a slightly greeny gray one a slightly yellow gray and there were three people on tracks going out towards what middle head and there were one two three yellow boys in the market being in the water and the edge of the sand was for the strange mark of the picture I don 't think that 's in my head and that 's probably the next series of pictures I 'm doing essentially about where we live in those kinds of things and that 's enough information to me I don 't want to do it very gradually I want to see whether I can make a painting that we have a broad order from Magnussen Roberson 's had a yellow cover that was a bad thing loss in fact that 's a very obvious one to start off with because of the quality of the paint and the whole story about him and they kind of knew the flowers and looked if you did so then you moved from Van Gogh and then you go through male and then you go through the t 's then you go to American abstractionist and I like it 's a plain American practical Milton Avery dialog very much very simple painter very beautiful things so I like I like everything from that still lives to naive pictures of these to show it 's a matter whether you use your eyes where you like but art doesn 't drop out of the sky and hit one person on the head so you learn from every single thing that you see and there 's no point were disappointed but you can 't spend a lot of time talking about begging not to be dating about mating you have to do making it for say work faster and bigger brushes don 't around no little bloody fiddly bits faster bigger brushes but in saying that it almost sounds like an island of Europe which is not true because you might want to do little small friendly things which is method you 're right but I think if you can remember that every single person in this room are and will were artists you could paint and draw before you can walk was the easiest thing to do there 's a thing in the garden the other day some guys very pretty or critical in my work saying it 's not as good as kindergarten work of course it 's not as good I 'm not as good as a 25 year old I mean I went I had a big exhibition more about a couple years ago all of the big roof paintings as far as I could make that good pictures and in every gallery that you have there 's always a book where people write comments you want to read them but you can 't_''_1683.67 be seen to be rushing out of wait till there 's no one else in the gallery so I went across when there 's no ads in the gallery and you 're pretty you know fixed through the morning you see over there to review protocol and you see all these really wonderful watch this and you think early cases of the course agree with meditation stuff but the things that you remember the less complimentary one and it 's a terrific one they 're from a ten year old girl in Louisville and she did really well you can I can do better paintings and I 'm still in primary school next time try harder it 's a really good promise it 's a really good promise because of course I can 't do pennies better than kids in primary school and yes I will try harder next year or next time in fact that it 's the Tweed region of gallery they want to have another exhibition I say oh you can call attend and Ranade so this always there 's always space to go I grew up in little country town called mcclain and see my father he was five like a lot of guys born in 1940 when the war started I hope it wasn 't that something I said but anyway the war went on for five years my dad came home I didn 't know quite what to expect anyway we moved it in a plane I 'm an only child so I 've spent a lot of time in my head and I my mother will open it [Music] congratulatory to their kids but my mother really liked what I did and that she had a subscription to The Saturday Evening Post the owners weekly was in sepia in those days I see brown why there were no color magazines in Australia so it 's certainly been said lately post aramis the love to look at look at the color of the magazines and also the love to look at the flowers and when the country was flooding is this wonderful party color with bits of bright green hyacinth and kind of ultramarine blue as well as I 've looking those kinds of things so the short answer is there painting on the wall and even in my grandparents house in Elmore I think there were a couple of a sort of Egyptian scenes but no that made us my uncle cubed he was a great sign writer and once took me to he was doing a sign on the outside of a fish shop in her still beautiful painting it to be paused [Music] being good you know forget jeff koons the public client which you could have been a very cruel key changer of the world thought it was the war never stopped short answer is I was encouraged to do it I like doing it more than anything else and I wanted to go to many other things I have a report or a number of thoughts were to been embarrassing this but you 're from Austin architecture the one teacher had written who then is the most inventive student with a head thank you very much a couple of lines further down another teacher had written if I ever had a son I would like him to be like in thank you in between another teacher very succinct use of the English languages and I think it shows you you can learn more we cannot win awards some people you likely did some people dig your soul [Applause] [Music] you _"

    "text": "Oh art has always played a big part in my life and I 'd really contemplate this question a lot because I actually don 't know the answer to it I was a I was never taken to an art gallery as a child but I always drew and I always gravitated towards looking at pictures in hindsight the pleasure or the joy of actually walking into an outer studio and seeing the creativity but all of the smells that go with it the smells of oil paint it 's absolutely fantastic and it 's that that from the very first time I went into an artist studio is stayed with me all my life project began with the death of Brett Whiteley and it was a situation that I was frustrated upset that I hadn 't taken the opportunity and try to make a work of someone that I really admire the project encompasses other people apart from artists because I 've been listening to a radio program where I heard Brian Sherman speak on his philanthropy and as soon as I heard him talk and I heard the perfect mix I chose to do a port of Edmund Capon because um he was nearing the end of his tenure at go at New South Wales I thought like this is a perfect opportunity to get someone that 's been you know incredibly important to the Australian are saying that when I was after a more powerful image every every image that I 'd ever seen of Edmund was a laughing smiling jovial presentation to the camera I was after something deeper the most important thing for me about a portrait is the subject I 'm not interested in backgrounds or environment I 'm only interested in the the life that 's in the face in the roadmap their history Kevin Connor 's portrait is really about the light and had the most wonderful face and the textured hair and beard was fantastic just actually a really simple lighting approach Pete Kingston was initially reluctant to actually sit for the portrait I went to meet with him and we had a talk and as soon as I walked into his studio it made me smile so in this instance the humor I was luckily presented with James Gleason 's power I did an image of that and that led to do Russell Drysdales hat and a whole series of other objects the most important image for me in the ephemera series as the Brett Whiteley chair as soon as I walked into the studio and saw that it was the the one piece that I desperately wanted it 's featured in a lot of his painting and kindly Wendy whiteley sort of gave permission for me to do that so in essence the the project sort of painful sir every image i create begins with the drawing I 'll jot down notes I 'll sketch the concept that I 'm trying to achieve and in an actual fact I find that a lot of the time in drawing out the image I 'll sort of make corrections at that point so that when I go to meet the subject or to create the portrait I have a completely clear vision of the image that I 'm going to try to achieve the dell Catherine Barton image I it was until i heard a speak on the ABC about her childhood anxiety and at that point it resolved itself where I had deal clutching a one of her drawing books to a chest because drawing had become her soul assessor as a child I don 't see the project ending I think I 'm sort of always inspired when I see new exhibitions and you artists so for me I 'll continue on and actually with the ephemera as well it 's sort of like it 's quite almost an archaeological dig to keep going with something like that because you never know what you 're going to uncover you _"

    "text": "it was actually 2012 Phil when when we launched the text classics and we have spent a long time painting what we 're going to do in some ways the planning was as old as text itself because we had always brought back old books and the grandfather of all of the or books that were brought back is what contentious 1788 which we did with Tim Flannery way back in the 1990 's and which has since gone on to sell tens of thousands of copies but there was a bit of a crisis in the book industry in 2011 people were pretty keen Enda books the end of bookstores and so we decided to change the conversation and do something different and perhaps because we thought our time was limited we 've got to get a hurry on if we were going to launch a program of lost and forgotten books so we started with the plan to do 30 books and a number of people suggested an Elizabeth heroin to us one of them was an editor of text david winter and the others the wonderful writer ago the Patrick wine award and Joan told the story to us and then in the interaction that she wrote when when we put the the wash guarantee takes place except being a student at the University of Western Australia 1966 there was of course no such thing as Australian literature taught in universities but she found a novel and the library shelves for the watched her and she rated and the reading of that novel was inseparable from her commitment to become a writer so she was absolutely the right person to to introduce the watchtower for us well we thought that we were publishing one more we had we had a very polite correspondence about that but there must have been in late 2011 penny Houston and I came to Sydney and Elizabeth caught the bus to the menzies hotel and we had afternoon tea now I 'm going to head over to Elizabeth in a minute because all we did was talk and we talked for hours and we knew then that I need to Elizabeth you that we found a new friend but one of the that we read and how important reading was for us so I 'm getting to know Elizabeth since then I 've learned that reading for you has always been an absolutely important thing and something that you 've always done from the time we were very small absolutely you know how did that all start it 's how did it all start reading well I was read to before i could read obviously by my mother and obviously read any print that was available from a very early age and i went on reading until today more or less and you know I clamored to hear more reading all the time and then I tried to read newspapers books I just read my whole life and I realized when I met Michael and penny that we belong to the same sort of tribe of people who actually love books and I knew immediately you know they became bosom friends because of their great attachment I think I said recently to him that that I and a few other friends used to be like evangelists we would find a book and appreciated it the way we did and Michael 's exactly like that himself so I had found a very happy home with text and what can I say I think if you 're going to have any thought of being a writer all you must do is read endlessly and read great books forever and finally you see what you 've produced and you see what a great book looks like and it gives you something to think about so that 's you talked about the mother yes she she did read to me I 've still got Alice in Wonderland and a a mill and as I think I might have said on the ipad i found a little note in pencil they 're fairies please come tonight not very well written fairies fai re yes please come but they didn 't or they were hiding or I was asleep or something so so it 's just been a great passion reading and it 's made great friends for me we it 's a huge thing to have in common so important you can 't overestimate it and Elizabeth I think you were 17 when the war ended anything but you were a devotee of the sydney city library I was it was in the queen victoria building smells strongly of hops or oats or whatever they made beer out of and i just read the library two pieces i was never seen without a large book and not only fiction and the great novels of the world but nonfiction and philosophy psychology politics the works so i think we could say I was a great reader and whether particular writers who who were more important than others I know you read so many but was it was a Dickens or was it home or was this someone in particular who spoke they all spoke they I and I think in the Australian book review recently there was this question have you ever turned against a writer that you once admired very much never never no I mean I knew what I liked and there they were we were just I just think we should all feel so grateful that these books exist and that over the centuries people though I know that one fairly well but most of the others no unfortunately I 've forgotten at all there isn 't he zipped up a bag and put it against the wall there isn 't enough time mentally Emily shrugged and raised her eyebrows he was nice this man but what did he mean time that was one thing there was too much of he was after all a bit nuts like all grown ups with kg critical eyes she watched him roll down his sleeves and stack one empty bag inside the other he noticed her again and said don 't wait to ask if you want to take any of those anytime he paused and looked at her for what seemed a long time in a serious searching way yet as if he knew her it was a bit confusing and embarrassing especially in view of what she had just thought about him and especially when he didn 't look exactly happy about it she wriggled and fiddled with some books and spotting a dark red box from which the man at that moment lifted a raincoat to her expression of repressed delight he said do you know how to work it would you like to play something I wonder what she couldn 't think yes but you say I don 't know are you going to stay here plugging in the machine he told her where he had come from and what he would be doing in bilara because he was more than tired he gave a heavy sigh half-grown half sigh as he knelt beside the girl on the floor to explain how to use the machine and emily kneeling there listening to his voice watching his hand point to a piece of mechanism turn a knob suddenly felt at a great distance was conscious of his unconsciousness of her of his mechanical concentration on the task he was performing for her and she felt a wave of compassion for him she felt a small physical reaction on her spine to the suddenly strange living humanity of the man beside her yes yes I see he nodded dreamily I understand _"

    "text": "you know it 's obviously a really lovely beautiful suburb you know what i 'd like to see more of the muslims usually a better community spirit more community things events like the the market here are great but more of that what i love about mossman today is the community feel and um what i 'd like to see in mosman 's future is to keep that and make sure that we don 't overexpand the area what i love about mossman today is um the weather divide and what we 'd like muert obviously longer and more partly availability what i love about muslim state it 's got a great community feel and what i 'd like to see is more family activities and planned activities like this market for instance but more family-orientated activities i think you 're great look i love the sense of community about mossman so that 's what i love about mossman and i want to see that continue i like to see the high street and i love to see this market as well and obviously we 're here for that reason especially and the culture around here it 's all great it 's all fun saturday sport going on down there it 's all very fun what i 'd like to see in moscon 's future is more of this you know more fun and games entertainment and the whole community coming together would be really good and also the changes i 'd like to see um nothing really it 's all quite good at the moment i suppose what i love about mossman is that you see the shopping and the the coffee and the atmosphere and the people and you know that 's what i like what what brings me to mossman what i love about mossman it 's just a nice area you don 't like not many bad things happen it 's a nice place to live and like everything 's like closed like the oval 's here school is down there yeah we go to muscle um the shop 's like yeah um changes i 'd like to see or whatever oh what i 'd like to see in muslims future um more clothes yeah more in monsters you have to go like chat restaurants yeah the facilities the shopping the beauty it 's close to balmoral beach it 's just handy to everywhere that i live and you 've got good schools good sports facilities good shopping what more could you wish for and you crashed the city as well i had no complaints about the western area i love about mosman the villagey atmosphere i guess the community what i 'd like to see most in the future is preservation of that i think and more traffic circles what i love about mossman today is its close proximity to the harbour i love the parks i like the the fact that mossman is full of nice people and my family have lived here for three generations so it 's obvious that i was destined to live here what i 'd like to see in mossman 's future is i 'm basically continuing on as what 's happening now i 'm really happy with everything that 's why i 've chosen to live here what i love about mossman today is um uh the environment lots of soccer fields what i 'd like to see in mossman 's future is um no parking of boats in streets and um more playing grounds particularly for soccer and for the kids more places to go out that 's what i 'd like to see for younger people yeah so more of a nightlife and what do you like about austin um the convenience how close it is to the city um you know the transport 's so easy in and out the fact that you 've got the beach like you know with balmoral right next door um but yeah the only thing that i don 't like is the fact that yes gets it 's a bit quiet overnight time what i love today about musselman is the architecture and the small alleyway type feel of the little community area yeah and what i 'd like to see more of is less well less construction of the knocking down of the colonial style terraces and then more of that what i love about mossman is the fact that there 's pretty much anything you you want lots of parks and and green areas and i do like the shops and we do like the cafes and the bars and of course you can walk down to the beach and back from the beach so and it 's um quite close to the city as well um what i 'd like to see in the future i don 't know really it 's pretty much it 's pretty much got everything that um that we need there 's the library so there 's good facilities um and good schools so i can 't really think of anything else that that we 've made what i love about mossman today is the energy the buzz the weather i 'm from canada and uh it 's just like nothing else i love again the scentsy community it 's great it 's a great sense of community it is i like all the things that seem to happen in the summer maybe more events and things like that and music and uh just yeah because the sense of community is great but more i want more more action why should is less parking meters because i think that 's wrong to have them all down at bummer what i love about mossman today is the whole community atmosphere that we have and it 's so wonderful to walk along and because we 've been here a long time of course we do see people we know so that 's always lovely as well but it 's a wonderful place to live close to everything buses into town just love it nasty what i 'd like to see in mosul 's future is a reduction in the in the trap somehow i think it spoils the wonderful atmosphere in this suburb and if something can be done to correct that it would be a great advantage what i love about mossman today is well among other things the art gallery and what i 'd like to see in mossman 's future is less traffic and more parking spaces what i love about westminster is the library i use it a lot um there 's a lot of good books and it 's really good to get the magazines as well the place to visit um what i 'd like to see in mossman 's future is look a bigger library would be great um look i think the bigger live would be fantastic i wouldn 't mind a few more crossings i know that sounds a bit weird but sometimes when you 're walking around it feels like there aren 't enough pedestrian crossings what i love about mossman is uh the nice community feel and particularly in the center part central part of the city and how much green space there is this nice little village what i 'd like to see in mossman 's future probably for kids activities i 'm always big on youth events and youth youth development programs okay what i love about mossman is the great living the beach environment down at balmoral the shops and the nice close community what i 'd like to see about mossman 's future is perhaps fix the traffic uh military roads nightmare i 've lived in mosulman all my life and uh perhaps some more parking will be fantastic and a few chapters the village feel the sun 're close to the harbor it 's fantastic what i 'd like to see in mossman 's future i think probably sustainability and the continuance of this village feel um low density living and continuing the nice culture that it has what i love about mossman is that it 's so green and lush it 's just a beautiful place to live and come around and see places like this market um look what i 've seen what i 'd like to see in austin 's future is more of the same i wouldn 't change things um mossman today i liked boronia house offering high tea functions it was great had a free champagne while we were there um in the future maybe a little bit more of this you know more markets and things like that um no changes i think it 's perfect i love living here it 's great um what i like to see preserved is places like baronia house um i guess it 's like that army place that we saw exactly down the end of mossman the the pub down there like bruna don 't change them so i guess i like about more than the village feeling um being close to the beach in balmoral um yeah it 's just a nice community close to the city nice place to visit and all the little boutiques and cafes that are starting up it 's really nice to see like the restaurants um so probably more of that what i love about moscow today is the absolute beauty of the surroundings and the friendly cosmopolitan atmosphere what i 'd like to see boston future is more of the same i don 't want to see huge high-rises sort of destroying the wonderful intimate atmosphere that we have here i think and also again the beauty is one of the huge draw cards i thoroughly agree about the high riser i saw some sort of um opportunity to talk to the council recently about some proposals and i thought oh no keep things pleased under five stories or ideally three stories but i know we 're pushing it there and keep the sunshine and so the feeling of the beach and the flowers and love about mossman today is all the wonderful friendly folk popping by and saying good morning as we open up the boronia tea rooms today it 's fantastic loving it uh what i love about mossman is it 's got nice village feel and everyone 's really friendly it 's great for kids lots of trees and yeah love it mossman 's future i 'd like to see some cheaper house prices so i can buy a place and stay here forever and i think the future is just to keep it as it is well what i like about mossman today is the uh the shopping and restaurants and of course the harbour around it the future i 'd like to see less traffic on my military road that 's one thing i 'd like to see and of course and not too much over development with uh high rise and all that um what i love about mossman today is that um there 's lots of fresh food and um vibrant sort of places where you can go and it 's more community um centered like port village see in muslim 's future is maybe more parking facilities that are not where you don 't have to pay what i love about mossman today is the people they 're very friendly and they 're great to do business with what i 'd like to see in mossman 's future is better parking facilities what we love about mossman today is um it 's got a good atmosphere yeah lovely atmosphere very nice we 're from the eastern suburbs and we can tell that this isn 't the eastern suburbs yeah oh i just love the markets and the good coffee shops like all around can always get a good coffee um in the future i would like some better shops maybe since it 's very dated and more like old women 's shops and then also maybe some more casual casual coffee shops that 's more like formal so they need a bit more casual stuff it 's a village it 's got a lovely village atmosphere got some good shops one of sydney 's best butchers yes and then what you 'd like to see in nathan the people who actually live in mossman and we wish we still lived here because we used to we used to overlook this park um what i love about mossman um today is that the community feel and how like the markets like today and just how everyone knows everyone and it 's kind of a very nice neighborhood to live in and then um what i 'd like to see in muslim 's future is maybe some more kids kind of areas like playgrounds like even though there 's a couple maybe a few more places like that it 's what i love about mosman today is i love the open spaces i think we 're really really lucky um i love up um you know near george 's heights and everything like that what i would like to see in mosman 's future is some facilities for teenage kids we you know given what just happened in the news um i think we need some kind of youth club something where they can go after school and early and even well i love mossman because it 's a and you feel like home once you 're in there and it 's just a really nice natural environment well mossman 's future i love it the way it is and i 've lived here for so long i don 't really i don 't really care as long as it stays a friendly way really and everyone yeah i think i probably love the sort of village atmosphere about mossberg and all the nice strips of shops and the mix between sort of old traditional and new architecture probably like to see some more bars and interesting things um to sort of carry that daytime cafe atmosphere into the night what i love about my swim is the library homeless facilities um but i 'd like to see mossman 's future um i 'm not sure small markets i love these markets um changes i 'd like to see are um maybe more uh young shops for teenagers and what i 'd like to be preserved is uh what i love about mossman today is i like all the parks around i mean i used to go there a brother still goes there now and we used to meet there after school and i mean a lot of other suburbs don 't have anything like that but that 's why that 's one thing i like about muslims the great thing about muslims got a bit of everything it 's got sports parks schools zoo everything uh what i 'd like to feel about mossman 's future more library hours yeah longer library hours longer library hours yeah it 's better for now really muslim 's pretty good at the moment so what i love about mosman today is uh yeah it 's nice weather nice uh comfy weekend just strolling around it 's a nice community feel to it

Balmoral bars and all the excitement and adventure the young man can have in this area what must been in the world to me because obviously I 've lived in mosman for a long time and I had an opportunity to walk around the Esplanade and watching bama beach and also seeing the batter 's pavilion when it was in its original state which was needed really lots of care and I was able to to gain the lease and create a restaurant my restaurant design my own kitchen right now and then you hire my staff and just create a restaurant that is really personal and so I will forever be grateful to muslin to have give me that chance in the most amazing location I love mosman I love all the nature or the beautiful bush tracks out of the beaches for the nature of moss room that it 's managed to so I just I 'm so proud to bring anyone overseas to show it off thinking look how far we can see this evening but we live in this beautiful unspoilt part of the world to me it 's home because we 've lived in the area over 40 years we have brought up for children in the area and we 've found a real sense of community here with you know just the local schools the local primary schools our children have all gone to schools to local schools and we have some very good friends and a feeling of that sense of community that we live in which which you no one really values and that 's important as a family an extension of that for me being an artist is the community of artists that also live in muslin I just love it I 'm a real country person at heart and to live in a fabulous City like Sydney and to be able to when it gets too much for you to go for a walk and have the most wonderful with my dog most one it really connects me with country in a city atmosphere which is so unique no other another suburb in the world has this is a live coming in from the city on the boat and arriving at that Wharf I 'm walking off and seeing that view right across the harbor makes my day and I 've been a very active member of the municipality in relation to Council many of the counselors will regret that because I wasn 't always friendly to them but over the years I 've realized what a wonderful organization the council is and what a great job they 've done when I think of the special things in mosman I think of the environment of mosman I think of the things that we fought to save if you ask me one of the special things I think we fought to save middle head and that was a huge community wide involvement we fought to save why arjun and I think that was terribly important I think it 's all about saving what we want to pass on to the next generation and the generation my life and mossman councils by far the most responsive and the most service orientated place I 've lived in so that 's how I decided to become involved with mossman and it is undeniably one of those beautiful places on earth so I 'm privileged to be part of a tiny tiny part of mossman history mas well as a result of all those that came before us our parks our beaches the beautiful environment we have is a result of everyone working as a community to protect our environment and make it great and we must continue this battle and we must continue the fight for our children and for the rest of Sydney as well having lived sixty years of my life in Montreal Canada and having lived just four years here in mosman I feel just as at home here in mosman as I did for the rest of my life back in Montreal mosman from the moment i moved here has just felt natural at ease welcoming loving peaceful and just kind of embodies all of the elements that make me feel like this is it 's as simple as that I think it 's the best place in the world to live been overseas for 15 years and came back and can 't believe my luck every morning when I wake up and see where we are it 's a wonderful wonderful community it 's all about community it 's about relaxation and it 's about friendships which is what I think drives the whole community it 's a nice spot to go and shop it 's nice spot to just be at any stage my love of muslin comes from my beginning of the day where I go down to the beach and I swim with people and I talk to my friends and there 's a community and every day we stand and look out to the ocean and we think and say to each other how lucky are we to live in this suburb and what a great way to start the day how fantastic is that it 's something that gets inside your bones it 's it 's not about your friends don 't happen overnight it 's it 's whether it 's swimming at Balmoral Beach whether it 's getting involved in sports teams or anything else and it 's suddenly then you discover that it 's a wonderful village and and I think what attracts most people is when they they give in to the concept of having a village do you really understand the power of moss mano power of any any place to live is a sense of belonging and that becomes because you you feel at home mosman for me is it 's all about the natural beauty whether it 's the sunrise in the morning when you 're down on the beach running with the people that are getting up early and getting the best out of their life or it 's that wonderful that sets when there 's a full moon and you see the whole of mossman completely filled with light and you come down Raglan Street to me the natural beauty of mossman just takes your breath away so we 've moved across into mossman I hadn 't really been to a beach before in my life or anything and I speak English but um i guess it was quite a warm culture when i first came into that um it was just really nice because i went to mossman primary school i met a lot of new friends and it was just a really good culture because after school would go across to allan border oval just have some fun playing some cricket and playing some soccer and it was just a really nice community to be a plot off whether i 'm actually in muslin participating in community events or volunteering at the youth center i 'm actually representing mossman out at willoughby when I volunteer for mossman netball so it 's been nice networking meeting people like specially the mums and the families and then babysitting and everyone coming together at the community events are so nice you just never find that anywhere else that the fact that people are so interested in what you 're up to and how you 're going once we arrived in mosman we just fell in love with it it was the bush and the sea and it 's quiet and yet it it was love at first sight because we are a thousand miles from a city that 's what we think that 's the impression we get right and then all of a sudden you can hop into the city but in 10 minutes you 're in the CBD mosman means glorious one day fantastic the next and every time I come back from overseas I just thank the original owners of this land what a wonderful place they left us in such a pristine condition well to me the spirit of mosman is the history of moths minute starters a little sleepy village with a whaling station and the punters we saw in the video used to take people to the city it was the bridge that really created mossman as a suburb because it connected it with city mosman for me has been a place for my children 's formative years it 's been a place to live that I feel is so very special beautiful horizons wonderful bush walks and beautiful Balmoral to take refuge to enjoy the sea my kids have loved it I have loved privilege for me _"

    "text": "but we 're so lucky it 's not unlike a tent there 's a place that we are live in here on federal land and be as a result of the kindness of the Sydney Harbour Federation trust which one controls all of this land here to be bit like being in a camp so the spirit is with us and but when I was asked by our love because they 're so if I could talk about the others can you hear that yeah um I thought gee I 'll be able to lie and make things up and then I made the mistake of mentioning the name of Panama Albie Tom 's who wrote a book about the artists camps so I thought oh my my my capacity to fabricators severely limited however we 'll see if he would take us if he puts his hand up and say it says no Paul you got it wrong well the arts camp that my great-grandfather chillingborough see Ashton was involved in was on Edwards Beach the north end or edited speech now you all know possibly most of your that was the site of that cab so they took away those glorious artifacts to build that bill put up that building and I think that mirrors in a way if you can see behind lb there 's the as a painting of the harbor with its there 's the amphitheater which of course was also pull down to make way for the the flesh the block of flats which client Lucas has been arranged out of here if you were to put on what PDA a bit early you 'll find at night walk as many digressions because I can go down little Creek 's that helped me hasn 't been down you see and whereas the big issues of course I 'll be understand now I was on a walk with my grandfather Howard Ashton down those steps at the north end of the step you know the steps into the beach going down those gypsies of course all ball this was all a rock face here we used to go around by the beach and there was a creek that came down alongside that road the grove actual account was just alongside just drifted into the sand and in the 1880s Livingston Hopkins now Livingston Hopkins this is the Vixen Hopkins here that 's the original of a drawing by full may it 's a wonderful glory I going to have to have it restored because it 's obviously getting rid of foxy but that 's Livington Hopkins that 's effective in each shelf it was a an American artist and this is Julia national profile and that would have been done about the time of the arts capita would speech now that 's part of our collection he Livington Hopkins in the 1880s at least 50 acres of the north end of the beach of England speech and he built care and there were a number of tents probably about four or five tents and Julian joined him soon afterwards now he pre Julian did previously at a camp on the horse street at Dora Creek JJ Hilda 's mother had a house of Dora Creek in quite a lot he 's no friend well actually his cap with the original characters with that JJ to aren 't you we were wonderful artist but he was also involved in the camp now but Julian had a foot before that adorn a creep and creating a lot of his students who 's become with him through bad though the Cabot Bell moral was mostly involved artists from the picturesque a little strapless of Australia Julian was brought out to from England to as you 've known as an illustrator in England he was brought out to work on the administrative that person needed just to go around Australia these artists painting scenes and the percent back to Sydney bought another and where the work was done sign the publishers and then they would be turned into engravings and that 's another of course which is very lost it was a haven for unconventional spirits who wish to break with the Academy the Academy of dogs with red noses and stage that very hard for us to imagine now that art was so restricted and of course the Julian and have studied in Paris at the academy shooting at the same time as quite a number of the europe and the this is ok I was painting because obviously mentioning that one min sorry now maybe I 've said take my little file here where are we just yes you this is quoting from Julian sport and it 's give you a bit of background shortly after my arrival in Australia I made the acquaintance of Louie boo below it was a Swiss a dear old chap simple somewhat silent and of a serious turn of mind yet not much English and my knowledge of French made me a welcome guest at his little cottage in east melbourne often i SAT with him under the shade of iron covered trellises home and discussed a bottle of over a bottle of red wine and talk to the old days and the old vans he 'd figured he was a guest over average height and a little stooped he reminded me very much of John France by midday as I saw him walking along the large sketch book under his arm he was stalked before some tumbled down old humpy with a tree big tree growing over it and perhaps carefully beautifully pencil drawing you will take this home and redraw it on a larger scale there the color of his work was under all-australian it was produced with a knowledge and facility of execution which gave me everything he touched artistic value one painting of his the water pool at colerain faded in 1860 which is a national calories melon that 's the background people used to actually draw outside and then go to their studios the pain and he goes on during the weekends are where they are sketchy still in love painting outdoors and sketching put it in this way came across a young there of about 14 or 15 years of age whose drawings interested me one week a tweet dated Drake Grover Baker 's card for his mother and on Sundays and Ted beds and Sundays you lay the foundation of his knowledge of art in the open air young man was Fred McCubbin so Julian go back goes back a hell of a long way and he this is his introduction I suppose the introduction he gives two hoots and Hopkins film during my over its and hopkins and film the bulletin Hopkins brought Phil made to my studio the day he landed in Sydney and I saw him frequently from that time until his return to London in appearance may was very slight about 5 foot 7 inches in height because here was cut straight across his burrow and he wore very close fitting garments giving him some of the appearance of a jockey he had a very observant i slightly hook-nosed house I 'm Norman Lindsay doesn 't an expression for global mouth his manner was Curtis and nearly always deferential and he could suffer fools gladly to agree that i do not remember seen equal um so now with that water and then he goes here we go on to Livingston Hopkins the Linton Hopkins he was a man set up the camp remember an American at a very early age displayed a gift for humorous drawing though he had no artistic training in the usual sense of that term would begin to take a prominent place in America North Australia journalism when mr. Traill who was the editor of the to the bullet the bullet Metro he was a tall man with a remarkable face deep set dots dark eyes strongly marked murders and a thick dark hair his habitual expression was somewhat sad made so I think because he 's heavy drooping of his having drooping eyelids there was a picture up here on that he did pop did at the time of the cat and very top closest to this big mural who see he 's actually pointing to a feature of himself in his head um he would brighten up considerably under the influence of a drink or two and and with a solemn face till humorous stories of his early adventures he greatly regretted that they had not been training with Dorothy he once said to me I am the last artist who will be able to amuse the public though not a draftsman an actual fact how wrong he was I don 't think Patrick cook what I love my ever went to art school nevertheless succeed and many of other artists course haven 't_''_557.7 up to if I we say I did go to in very heavy he was growing him Luger up together you take miss great things for the suspect over now nevertheless he succeeded in making Australia love once a week for 20 years so we had a byzantine reenactment asthma camp the wonderful mayor of mossman I think he 's still the longest-serving mayor of Mossman Barry O 'Keefe I don 't know whether anyone has succeeded his incredible contribution the Muslim but it was during he one of his reins that it was decided to do a reenactment of the artists cap and here 's a painting by my uncle Richard ashen who is Julian 's grandson did of the camp and I did quite a few paintings but unfortunately are sold and didn 't have the business of mine will photograph them before they disappear but that 's very much as it was and that 's exactly where actually not exactly where this for the bridge buggers on the exact site but that 's that painting is really we have a series attention we had speeches we had talks we had music we have a wonderful exhibition at 't give you see you remember that yeah let 's do it wasn 't half your pelvis up and speak the same number what thank you i 'll be rigid us to the vegetable 1998-99 yet yes it was an idea that 's store in the originals but it 's recreated that 's right i sort of the original Kent various effects Emily chancy reenactment with the camp you had long enough oh I 'm wondering about my planet of course this is a sort of thing that happens in the art world in Boston people are concerned you know it 's a wonderful Bobby but that 's how we got the art gallery did you know that mr. G 's money you idiot mr. cheezle should know if it was the moscone our society and people who felt passionately about art in mosman who lobbied the council and eventually the council said yes we will do it and the wonderful that lady was just ok Clark rang me up and said we 've done it we 've done it and they got money from his government and so and the people mossman that fought for that fantastic bad Oh Ben I thought it was all over him who was in that kitchen which you did we put it up I don 't know but it wasn 't in fact i 'll be telling me no no Paul you can 't get that song that one there it 's not all be it 's not it 's not isn 't it sit somebody else this is this is actually the curler camp but that 's right that 's to cook at the co ok let 's run Oh bid was the cooker at julia 's go at the Pop 's cap now there 's a wonderful story but few stories that all been and I 'll tell you things that you haven 't heard before and of course that will be recorded by that instrument of terror the back of the room for posterity all been first came to minor just threw my grandfather how that stirs because you told me the story of the painting of that painting of the prospector in the IP of yourself world he said turned his back on one of the most beautiful views and placed been against the cliff face and that 's why the line is so wonderful yeah it 's it 's a saturated light it 's full of animation that by full of goo little gold full of gold lb and it was a spade is so beautiful it 's a wonderful piece of painting really and he he said I used to go down after school and help bring things up to me the head of the house because Jillian just beat up and fetches great glen which was just up behind it i know this is not Ricky conservative the camp but I think Ben 's an important figure and he said Ben was quite simple to her poor because I said to him on one occasion what are you doing then he said well master hard I am posing for your father I am fossicking for gold and this is the pen that I am fossicking with and being a boy and a naughty boy I said to him have you got any gold thing and you thinking for a long time and then finally decided no come to think of it young master hard I had not got any gold which I think gives a poignancy to that painting you know the census it was total disaster on the gold fields and it 's all written in his face but it wasn 't the girl feels it was time around the beach after all but that painting is it one of the great paintings and whose interesting i was invited by the curator of drawings prints

used to sleep on occasions in an old boat on the beach he loved the open-air life and was a very early riser and my mother remembers the Fred Fred smell of freshly brewed coffee at 5am when she was playing his house Rhonda his son thirsty was a young was a sea captain sailed around the horn and he used to deal with coffee mr. black body it was a dining tent been as I say was the permanent kept cool camp the camp oven with a cab oven and roast meat salt beef and all that sort of stuff and one I 'll spinach they used to eat which grew on the beach and still down there by the way injections an expert on my great president was a counselor of the women 's suffrage league with Rose Scott and one of the soleus first one journalists and there 's lovely story that how I told about his mother being chained to the railings of government house while his father Julian was having dinner with the governor inside years later I found the Julian box under Julian 's a paint box under the house of Palmyra poet to that was barren Avenue and I thought what are these city legs on the bottom of this box is where useful box this side of them off the head was absolutely furious and you did nobody ever angry with me once I felt such a grand that if I had made him angry a kind know what the hell it was it was me that 12 so what I think was I later on by arrange to have someone to fabric fabricate the legs I should have it here today I think we had a new exhibition from here in it and if you do it again I offered to you again vol be visitors to eyes distinguished artists visitors but visitors of the word artists included Robert Horry students who knew AJ Devlin and Julian and presented been the cook with a copy of Treasure Island Julian describes him as a thin fragile figure and he said the literary world of Sydney lionized him which he know and in the Union Kluber which I remember there is a cartoon by George molnar and Stephenson is up in the carton in the cartoon used to pace the floor when he was thinking and of course people came from the far corners of the union club to listen to listen to him recite his his poetry and in the club there was a chair a fantas chair

Montefiore the secretary of the National Gallery trust and I were asked to go down and make such purchases we consider advice less weight is talking resolution be agreed upon the purchase of ever-shifting home by Stanhope falls and the Venetian cafe of Milton fishing mr. Montefiore was very desirous that we should purchase a small painting by Waterlow called the fisherman 's return subject was a woman hurrying along appear her bath was to the spectator and she was holding a baby but loft with his little arms outstretched water a burly bearded fisherman in heavy see boops and conventional Sou 'Wester the picture was well drawn and painted wood was far too sentimental I thought if I if I agree to the purchase of imparted in the afternoon somewhat frigidly this is a very important historic strolling down cold street I met young McCubbin but by that time become a teacher the national art school national art school he asked if I had seen the exhibition of Australian art and put a little gallery on eastern hill I had not betrayed your traced our steps to have a look at it majority of the pictures were not interested I was brought to a halt by a large canvas still Blige the stream and shower forever glad I asked my cupboard who painted it you said it would be painted by a young Australian are part of arthur street it was learning lithography with one of the firm 's in Melbourne I 'm pride the price of the picture which I learned was 83 85 dollars up to this time no Australian picture with the exception of one or two in Sydney the work of mr. pignier had ever been caught by either the Melbourne for the Sydney guards isn 't it shameful unbelievable God we shall be Bohemians when the subject of the fishermen 's return was brought up again I mentioned that I had been impressed by the work of the young artists to which only half the amount was asked and asked if he would come to us with me to see it what what which he did I told him I would agree to the purchase of water last picture on condition the street ins campus was also bought Melbourne rubbed its artistic eyes the next morning when it heard that the sydney national game had purchased a picture by young of the stream it is an interest rate and fought about the same time in the same place recently bought a thousand guineas this was written a name for you to the president of the trustees of the New South Wales our county honored with honorable it would kuz in avenge F&T being prejudiced against the purchase of victoria picture this is amazing that fight so hard for such obviously beautiful pictures um still probably applies here 's your eye but his first remark when we met was I cannot see what made you so I reply well this is an australian r kelly and that is certainly the best place there 's a piece of Australian landscape I 've ever seen it is has the very spirit of a calm summer evening to a sensitive what do you make of that bird in the foreground does be honorable Edward I said I thought it was all right probably an egg pie well he has the whites of in the wrong place and that grass in the foreground well what are they ebooks all right but man it 's Parramatta graphs how do you have Parramatta Ross in velvet I told him that Street himself would be coming up shortly and that he could put banana before you Street was a slim dem in the a young man about 24 years of age little golden quite a beard and fair complexion when he wasn 't painting was quoting Keats and Shelley I went to the gallery with him his picture was taken down to the basement for him to look at after considering it for some time he rubbed a little oil over the Parramatta ago and it asked me to bring the president down when mr. coupe saw the picture he told scheme he had greatly improved it two or three years later straightened painted his large canvas fires on it represent the mouth of a tunnel on a blazing australian summer 's day sandstone surface which have been blasted to pierce a tunnel through the hillside shows yellow against the darker the steep hill on the left is in shadow the heavy sandstone walls are covered with that bluish grey patina which time gives to sandstone in the open from the entrance men are seen running out of the tunnel before the charges explode the haiti bluer than midsummer looks down upon the hole i exploded onto several other trustees about this extraordinary thanking the vitality of the work the accuracy of the observation and the simplicity of the means is to produce the bed blaze of light and tethering when i meant to the present mr. differ at the opening of the exhibition where this picture was shown you said he believed i was in favor of the purchase of the picture so much I said well first of all it does not rely for success upon any one of the usual sentimental transcripts of nature the earth has been taught and blasted to carry a train through the hill the heat of the day is tremendous and what is attacked by the simplicity of the means you each brush strokes a unfaltering Lee what it has to say with very few colors telling the story of the everyday life in the toilet of men in this vast continent I thought this might soothe him but it didn 't well mr. Ashton he said that fit your melody purchased as long as I am president of this trust I fear I lost my temper for i replied that picture will be bought whether you like it or not now that 's a preamble for the curb you can which was at a wonderful book of course which was written by Linda slutsky who God was the most wonderful and yours late dear wife and the one for every time so I had over to thank you before we leave that I just from Richard about how the hell did told him about going to that camp because happen how it would have been quite young and he lived when his father over there kameyama and they look to get to the camp they walk into the city to the ferry get the ferry across to mosman bayy walk up ever new road by that time Howard was very thirsty who always insisted when he got to the top of the hill of a minus rho 2 did his father and he made come t so they must have carried it Billy with then they walked along the country road up to mend along down the men along to the camp so there 's quite an effort for a little kid if you covered all that way obviously for Julia new secret city uh apparently physically fit because of one of the stories in his book repenting growing that 's right Amalia back through the addition it is skipped he must have been physically very strong so I just remember that just painting remind me of Richard telling me that that 's what by the breast brothers as particularly rumor I don 't know how many remember the freshest department store up there knock sensor on that was established by Ruben when he moved from money his family come out to Melbourne in the gold rush they were German Jews they said I 'm making ten something 's for that fully the gold biggest became very wealthy and then Reuben then k merced unit established restore his sister gold has stayed behind in Melbourne and she married louis Abraham 's who was a friend of top robertson one of the painters in the heidelberg camera melbourne the abraham his family manufactured cigars and they were the ones that made the cigar boxes that you see in those nine by five paintings by the northern artists gold up and the Arabs Got Married in Sydney and tom Roberts came up for the wedding and that 's when we met Reuben and the rest firmly so that when he came back diseny five or so years later he went over to the camp that they had a little serious code I 'm sure you want Bey it was a bit of land reserved for the military before it became the zoo it was a military land and so they unlike hoppy rented his property for the camp they just grabbed it and put it put up their tents there and used to cut pro a pro across from parsley Bay on the weekends to camp there not long after they 'd established the camp you can see if you go down there there 's a rock it 's got 18 on unit so that 's when they established a Sydney Sydney Australia was supplied by a big depression a much bigger than we just had I think but not as big as than oriented so and so a lot of people were out of work and never did so that camp Gallacher became a resonance for a number of people it 's all cook I cover with memories now what 's what 's it all been but they also had a permanent cook and went on our first of all street in it as Paul said street and came up to Sydney retouched his painting depression adhere no market so he decided to come to Sydney with obviously there 's a market one people did mrs. Julian got a lifted a trustee of the art gallery one of his first acts as a trustee insisted that they reserved a thousand pounds yet for buying Australian art I wasn 't given time no no no you 've said that are perfectly exactly with the art gallery having that money Sydney was the best market put the only Margaret join us because no one else was pretty much it was in buying there 's for explaining so street and came up and we no money no in a stays of course you 've got in touch with with Reuben and they 're not becoming a permanent prison there for quite a while at that camp tom Roberts was still involved at that time but he came up a bit later and then he joined in there there 's wonderful correspondence between them collected in a book called from smoked a bulldog which delivers that street and wrote before before Roberts came up explaining what a good tomasevic straight there we 've got some pictures well this is the only picture of the curly hair this one here I was taken by Fred dull he was one of the reasons the cabbie was oh a mathematician at Sydney University these days mathematician theaters he probably getting pretty good hey but obviously an in the depression there wasn 't much peso heatley cameras and again when he took the only photo we have of that building period there 's another one a bit of street and painting on the beach there kirron kher probably that looks like pretty much knew where the Scout Hall is there in serious person that was taken by Rodney cherry who also took this one which is tom Roberts sitting in a boat I 'll pass that branding past that run around I was lucky we found those photos in the position of the daughter of Romney cherry do their own little snapshots little Kodak snapshots and that one extreme pain had been used in a book no no no one who 'd taken it then we found one of the totem there 's around that 's the beach just between serious Cove and trauma group forgot the name of you remembered yeah why do you think so that 's on the ego instead on the spot where they played pretty good so Robertson street from the main artist of the curlew care living there with the brush brothers but met many visited and Julian visited any cookie mentions visiting there and they get the ferry to mossman walk over the reach and down to serious Cove there 's some steps that have recently been restored and they bring a bill or shout out and somebody row across and pick them up and take them out of the cab and there 's a Devlin painting don 't you pass that one out already I think it 's been passed down yeah I 'm somehow someone reference there 's a painting painting by off Alfred deferens that looks like it was painted I still this bottom unless he 's look like it was painted their off on that landing where they used to go from that one you Julie 's holding it up there at the landing where they roll across to the curl it cam another of the residents there was Henry Ford who also was was employing the people who lived in it was peach pear and he was also one of the others upon the pictures at the substrate level but he down on his luck had the governors of care because eventually his fortunes were stored neatly lived in various houses around mosman and continued to paint it brought up to the 1920s by the number of forward paintings of mosman scenes done over Pete of about 30 or 40 years al Alfred Apple do who did that painting as far as I know didn 't it 'll live in the in the the colonel camp but of course he was the only opponent cut from I 've been the only permanent residence in hops camp for a while he was he was a teacher for the society the artist and he did in that camp there and he wrote a book which was standard sort of text on landscape painting in it this this copy is I think about fifth the night in twitter pic upon recruiting at landscape painting from nature in Australia that Devlin had studied in Paris and painted on plein air in the open air in the fontainebleau forest but with the barbers and painters as if Julian and George Collingridge also another Sydney painter at the time they were the first people to actually get out in your urine and do finished paintings i mutter there as Paul said figure it out and sketched went back to the studio and finished it but because it did early in the ninth century someone invented Zeke tubes for oil painting so you could you could actually take your paints a out and paint it on the spot and it was quite controversial it with an academy in Paris Simple Simon in England that thought that sort of thing what wasn 't right they watercolors that people are using force to sketching to be considered drawings they were finished works so said that one was very important in Australia to promote that idea as was Julian in the two of them in fact talk together then before to the opposite I 'll pass there anything like them alone this that page mark there there 's a phone of a painting boy of William mr. Lister which we 've done just on the hill over here looking up for the hint so we 're very close to the site of one of the paintings there 's also recently in auctions but it was a street and painting got on that point there so while they lived in those two camps they also wandered around all these hills and ridges Julian was on one of the first to paint was about there 's a very famous tom Roberts hanging out wasp invaders in the Ewing that our gallery collection should be in Muslim collections ended early yes obvious what the is what a possible oh yeah Roberts is best paintings that wonderful this one is in the art very beautiful it 's it 's a painting of the curl of hair quite time it 's a tiny button that 's about the size of research in that is this a sort of suburban 11 capture captures just that that idyllic pass that one I wrote so Robertson Street live live there for a while then they come and go as they make the trips around Australia doing doing other other paintings and commissions Robertson vinegar with was making his living as a portrait painter at most of that time he landscapes when selling in fact that yes he 's very famous painting of the failed up which was done it in industry 1997 wasn 't wasn 't assaulted on in 27 knots so as well as those stupid famous painters are almost anyone that wanted point wanted to paint in sydney in those days would visit the camps and there 's records of many many lesser known peters go in there but it 's become non for the work of street and robert paul mitchell charles condom being a student at the camp down in edwards beach he then from there went down the milled room but it says with the heidelberg heaven people tend to think of him as a melbourne Pater but i think there 's a whole sort of myths been established that the Impressionism was invented don 't one of the pages i visited often was sure alimony leader yes italian painter who paid wonderfully impressionistic works before Robson Street so moving at the first art historians and they wrote the books about Australia and the higher bergkamp then became the place to be in fact i think this camp edward speech was really cement than the other thing is that the paintings that Robertson sweetener probably best known for are the ones done while they are living here in Sydney so talk about the reverse stone the false history of all that after they they make that they moved on from the camp street and went on to London and tomahawks went back to the oven the camp was taken over by Freddy lane it was a swimmer and straightest firstly be gold medalist in swimming and he left some photos I got this from his daughter mrs. Robinson and then Italy now in the moscone library but there 's there 's photo freeze tendency it 's quite an elaborate and then that could be Freddie they 're in the cabinet but this was this more money around pretty an improving business in bridge street in the city so that our lovers of the open air and that 's why they preferred Cavs this this was thought to be maybe after two not I think it 's probably Freddie line and then this is the cook there is not all been that very very similar and it seems that the must nutrition book for cook step growl long being and and finally about to two strings wonderful pictures off of the cam this one done done at the time he was in the camp this one done wait he went in and roll on then came back to australia in 907 and a he made a film in which back to the cat and that 's when he painted this one no this is an early on actually uh ok this is listen behind the cat moving down the hill and it 's a interleague scene that 's got nukes running through the bushes with germs was yeah sort of neoclassical some uneven and my minor recall some trivial amid fair but like like like fond it wasn 't their men 's cats and the we were only only visited it doesn 't everyone which were actually living them so the cab persisted there under free lady in the early dynamical in about nineteen fourteen or fifteen it was the area was rezone for taronga zoo the zoo originally been out where Sydney high schoolers at moorpark but they decided that they needed some lands over to do a check out the best bit still ahead and see the zoo and because of it be named by the particular able to rezone it and give interrupter on the park they had no use free for that earring area of ground the walkway around around that point as a war which is the edge of the zoo so the area where the cab was was just neglected and got overgrown remained overgrown for about 50 on years until people rediscovered it and i 'ma goin over there in looking for in the 97 isn 't barging through the bush and i found an old well and some program crockery so i was pretty sure that that of course was once someone perhaps it was you I we got cleared off that day later turn off the lamp timer to reveal the engraving on the rock with the date and that pitch said that was the spot hmm that was Marie block but no yes whoa no difference yeah it was a chapter bleep you mustn 't all his life and he remembers seeing it when he was very very yeah and he 's clearly had machetes with ya so now it 's been reclaimed and revisited what we did it we grease for the exhibition we heard at the arc a weary stage the camp and a lot of painters are perhaps port was one of them with their and paint it in the camp you gave lessons there and things and we hope to redo the exhibition some time at mosman go in which case we 'll probably do the same thing again if you have the support of the school in essence thank you any question I 'm happy to answer any questions about it im- is probably relevant the most of the other mean there must have been a lot of Watson 's Valley it wasn 't particularly in a better look yes the reason people originally came over the Muslim because it wasn 't deluded Sydney in the middle Adonia said she was horribly food it was this go coal fires everywhere drainage into the harbor there was abattoirs chopping up meat and the referees just go into the harbor it was horrid so this became the pleasure grounds of Sydney Balmoral was was blown the first pleasure grounds come on point spore and spit there was a Chinaman 's beach every one of those places and a pleasure garden with film kiosks serving food WrestleMania wickets in fairies coming across the East be very inkling of Balmoral and normal childhood and so it was established as a wonderful place here forever love this idea las movies that do it by dealing with it still is remarkably it 's fantastic how it 's still preserved that wonderful follow me and that was the attraction for the artists I think there are more aesthetic cyber in the eastern seaboard yes it 's about but mosman certainly and had that note that no so this was this was the wonderful place for artists very early honest if you look at the young the first Art Society of catalogs like from the alien 80,000 listing a pic packages that have disappeared the listing mosman view and when they come out here on and both cells and have painting classes at the head of the ad society at the very precipice John point who made a very poppy he liked the area very much nothing was in Julian 's book one of the first things someone took him to took at mosman food and of course hop same with hoppy he loved it so much he bought a house here with the clean air you know you know ti Casas here was obscuring the mural there does her thing they are these same cars it 's in the rocks black on the top and so nothing 's changed this is still a good place for us love little tiny story there that I like it your vision Howard tells the story of working with street the how it was younger than straighten and he said I 'm here I 'm in the painting with him and going out and happy straighten used to love to get away by itself to find if you didn 't like nany with others and he puts himself on a hill we know they could get behind him and how it said I remember climbing up the hill and I could feel straightens eyes boring the top of my head as I approached and then getting behind it look at the work and Paul he had a slightly stop the time he changed everything because I me remember that any who reads like the book bulldog street drummer remainings they were in here observable romantic and so the works that they did will work some poetry and of course how was more prosaic unit journalists of an artist as well and so thinking said he 'd moved trains he changed this you 've done this that 's the reason why I didn 't want people looking obviously yes idealize landscape idealized as here when I did exercise filled exhibition it that went to the locations where the painting to be painted and dissolved on the other and the the changes are try to me sup sup quite better was like for shortening of distance it 's like that get all the different ease into the picture not not distortions as and say surrealism or modernism but just just three arrangements is anything it is you know but that 's asked artistic license though they weren 't photographers that out yeah and though Aiden 's does anyone else got any questions for either pool well I 'll be the truth because I official war artist you still to be in England at the time and he went across the western front this is extraordinary to see those very very sad so obviously tortured works he did of the the front you know not the broad panoramas with the unmistakable straightened technique but this groom rim subject but painted with great objectivity unless there 's a limousine street and story I hope the person involves not here but many years ago I got I got a call from someone that was trying to they said it was painted by straighten that was one of the ones paint student when he came back to Australia and not in every 17 in winter they can the cross is where that be bush with houses he did very nice painting including that but stream is a great environmentalist and I don 't occur painting was celebrating the house quite the opposite yeah which was used it at your court case crime president preserved the house has been ironic _"

    "text": "he had a rollicking good time no doubt paddy with very much a good time Charlie we got the sails in those days if you had the work you kept the work I said oh well just go to the right agent haven 't you it 's amazing to think though from the 1890s the Mackenzies still a dealing with lays in Boston on October the 3rd 1877 Patrick Leigh arrived at Port charmers New Zealand on board the ship James Nicole Fleming by afternoon Patrick was on the train to Dunedin a city that had become New Zealand 's largest since the recent Gold Rush of the 1860s born in March 1855 the second son of Thomas Leigh and Catherine Shanahan Patrick was one of six children all but the two youngest emigrated from Ireland by 1881 Patrick had moved to Christchurch and was working as a clerk when he met and married Fanny Josephine gray sadly four years later Fanny passed away aged only 27 after her death Patrick moved back to Dunedin and perhaps taking advantage of the aftermath of the gold rush he became a jeweler Ellen Carol Ellen Jane Carroll was born in Melbourne in 1863 the eldest and only daughter of Mary Dalton and Thomas Carroll soon after Ellen 's birth the young family migrated to Dunedin and a younger brother Dalton Thomas known as Thomas was born in 1865 Ellen Carroll was 27 and Patrick Leigh was 35 when they married at st. Joseph 's Church Dunedin on the 24th of May 1890 it was not long after that they set sail from Auckland on the SS Minnow way arriving in Sydney on the 3rd of August 1890 in Sydney Patrick and Ellen Lai lived in the inner west and within a few years they were running their own real estate agency in Peterson Patrick Leigh was reinventing himself again farm laborer in Ireland Clarke doula and watchmaker in New Zealand and now Sydney real estate agent Patrick and Ellen Leigh were about to discover Mossman a Mossman that was being developed by fellow Irishman Richard Hayes Harnett and his son Richard Jr who would later become mossman 's first mere Mossman had a big future and the lays were going to be one of the first to open a real estate office in Mossman it was a small where the board building on Military Road to which he traveled by horse and buggy from Peterson every weekend a few years later this building became mossman 's first telephone exchange so the story of the regional office is almost as long as the business has been established a little weather board office in a bush land clearing in Military Road was the first set up it was mossman 's first telephone exchange carrying all 52 subscribers of which peel a real estate was one the weatherboard cottage existed for many many years in fact perhaps a century it was moved from its original location on the street front of Military Road to the rear of what was Brandt schools Pharmacy which is still a pharmacy in Military Road for many many years the Rotary Club of Mossman stepped in and suggested at the time that perhaps it should be shifted to middle head unfortunately when it was shifted to middle head a bush fire swept through with Hetty leis real estate office was the end of what was the original weatherboard cottage and also the office of Patrick leis real estate office in Mossman with the advent of the electric tram from North Sydney to speak in 1893 and its extension to Mossman Bay in 1897 houses were being built along the tram route and owners were subdividing their land speculative builders were buying up this land and houses and shops were being built the newly arrived residents needed a reliable trustworthy real estate agent Patrick Leigh was your man my family that 's the McKenzie family brought in Mossman in the 1890s there were three shops the part of Military Road this is is right near the corner of Raglan Street on Military Road in fact the shop that people will recognize most is the cheese shop the cheese shop amazingly is still in the family after all this time the other two have been sold but the cheese shop remains the Mackenzie my grandfather bought the shops when he was still living in the country it definitely would have been an investment by arriving in 1890 Patrick was ahead of the he had some serious competition Raywood to Ian to e Staunton back house and Goyder Griffiths and Co McKenzie and son were all there in these boom years for Mossman if not selling and renting they specialized in in management really because they were good at it and they had a good rent role and they had good tradesmen that 's probably their biggest business today but they 'll be around when a lot of those agents are not they probably have seen a lot of agents come and go in must been well they 've been there well I know they have by 1897 he and Ellen permanently to Mossman and both became actively involved in the Mosman community with his original weekend where the board office now a telephone exchange lays real estate agency was a little more established and the office had a more salubrious setting as part of the newly built post office buildings business was booming for Patrick lay he was popular he was gentlemanly and he was making connections with enterprising men in the real estate world namely land development partners and speculative builders would both have been in Mossman at the same time and my great-grandmother me moved here from Peters him in the 1890s to what is now one Mossman Street into a house called car tuna I grew up just knowing that my grandparents and my mother knew the leis and just running a business without any technology you know I mean they probably didn 't have a telephone in the beginning everything by hand everything had copy it 's kind of hard and then it made it much more of a people business as well so you did you know really make hard and fast relationships because everybody had to come in and pay their rent you had to do the current transactions face to face rather than obviously online so it would have made it who you are was definitely more of you know reflected in the business but a lot more than today it 's all about your website but that website didn 't exist it was you it was your personality your ability your charisma your likability that would have made the business like Smith and the two would follow in their footsteps as merrill developers on Mossman council agents were and land developers were very much needed back then you needed to sum divide and you needed to get as many houses as possible but it 's a very different world now where you can get such enormous financial advantage if you 're an agent on council I mean me here I would but it 's certainly not a nice idea the reason why the mayor 's were developers because they were opening up the up the opening up these communities and there were leaders of the communities and but they have no doubt they substantially benefited from the from their roles and the saying that just wouldn 't be tolerated today I would think that you know Patrick Leigh wasn 't the only developer or or real estate agent who was a mirror of a Metropolitan Council in Sydney Melbourne or anywhere else in Australia it 's a different era things have changed there 's a lot more ticks and balances and checks and balances and I think to a degree people a lot more Patrick Leigh was elected to Mossman Council in 1902 as an alderman and by 1905 due to his popularity and great contribution to mossman 's activities and civil affairs he was elected mayor he would continue to be elected mayor every year until he 's untimely death in 1909 almost the entire population of Mossman turned up to his funeral at Sacred Heart Church Mossman the farewells continued as the mourners in horse-drawn vehicles passed by the shops on Military Road all with their doors closed in honor of Patrick lay along the way a welcome mid-morning drink was offered by the publican at the Oaks Hotel at neutral Bay and by late afternoon Patrick Leigh reached his final resting place at Gore Hill symmetry and supplements prior to his death Patrick had set up his office and residence on the corner of military and Avenue Road this is the same building the family business continues in today thanks largely to Patrick 's wife Ellen who would prove ready willing and able to carry on the business after her husband 's sudden death in 1909 as great-niece Noreen Powell described on Perry 's death Ellen was left in charge of the business Ellen was the most industrious forthright clever sincere woman who knew exactly what she was doing when it came to real estate running a business as a woman as a single woman in 1909 is just extraordinary I mean women had only had the vote from 1902 so this this was really something and just the way she then went on to be a property developer buying the best land to put her at houghton house on and Balmoral Beach was pretty smart move apart from running the real estate business and buying up land herself Ellen was responsible for the erection of many buildings in Mossman these buildings included five shops at spec Junction and at Mossman Junction three shops from a hundred and seventy-five to 179 Avenue Road Ellen Lai also owned land at the northern end of Balmoral the Balmoral Beach Club established in 1914 was built on her land and further north in the 1920s she built her home Oriana which still stands today well she 's just a story of of doing things it innately like she was in her business and when she took Ostman council for a ride a few times about that property next to the beach club that had no building on it and they wanted to buy it from her for a ridiculous amount and she wouldn 't sell and so instead she built this block of flats there I don 't know if you remember it but it was this little brick horrible ride on the beach horrific thing and then sold it back to them years later for ten times more than what they 're asking previously so she kind of took it back to them which is you 've got to have a personality to do that you can be able to try again and succeed amazing and capable but I think quite she was quite tough she bought and sold many properties throughout Mossman she built them she sold them she redeveloped them she did everything her era of ownership of the business and guidance of the business was perhaps the foundation proper not only was Ellen lay business minded she was also community from its earliest days and elected the first lady 's president when women were admitted to the club in 1920 her continued involvement in the club saw her become the first woman to be named a balmoral beach club life member in 1927 in 1930 she was honored with an MBE for her charitable work including having been on the executive of the Red Cross for 15 years she was just on a mission to to really contribute not just not just to the community and not just a business but just in just the whole package or the way she looked after the community she looked after the family she you know she was not afraid of progress so I I could have met her Ellen Leigh a successful businesswoman community minded and charity worker also cared for her brothers two boys from the later 1890 the eldest boy Dalton Carroll known as Jack was born in New Zealand in 1886 and came to live with Ellen and Patrick when he was 10 years old younger brother Sidney Hubert known as Sid was born in Sydney in 1891 and from an early age she did an enormous amount of work for charity raising huge amounts of money you know we all know that ladies committees and ladies clubs were very strong in that time but she really made some things happen as as Melissa said you know negotiating with Council to develop property negotiating all of those things and then the maternal side you know obviously I 've got to look after these two boys because that 's going to give them the best opportunity I 've got to look after the business to be able to hand that on you know I mean she really she just brought everything into the picture I 'm I 'd be surprised if there were many like her at that time Jack went to school at Fort Street High and on leaving school joined Pele 's in 1902 and at the same time started work as an apprentice carpenter so Jack Carroll 's job in the morning was to walk along Parramatta Beach to the paddock also on the beach to fetch the horses to drive up Raglan Street and pack them day would start early he drowned the horses up on the corner of Raglan Street and the Esplanade and the evening job was similar so he would return the horses down Raglan Street look them loose in the paddock having done a full day 's work from dawn till dusk after Patrick lay died in 1909 Jack was needed more than ever in the agency to assist the newly widowed Ellen lay she was insistent when the first world war broke out that Jack not join up as she needed him in the off with his younger brother Sid and many of his friends going off to war he was resentful of the power Allen Leigh exercised over him boys you would expect you know they 've gone to live with their uncool aunt and uncle brought up by them there 's a certain amount of onus that they kind of would feel and imagine in that era they would have told them about that so you know it was really one of you can go one of yous got to stay someone 's got to take the business and be you you know so you can feel that iron fist in that and I think even Noreen says that Jack sort of really did whatever she said and obviously Sid didn 't so it was clear path as to who was gonna go and who was gonna stay super went to war and dad wanted to go but lady she said no you 've got to stay here and help her husband was dead then you 've got to help me run the associates and she cannot about to go and dad always resented that in a way but he she she had him under her thumb and he just did what she said and he he said you 're not going to war and he felt awful about as you can imagine him so Sid went to war and came back and couldn 't sit instead and went to live in the eastern suburbs get away from it all Sidney Hubert Carroll served in the First World War rising to the rank of captain and receiving the Military Cross his stint at lays was rather short-lived he did own business SCH Carolyn Cove in the city in the eastern suburbs tragically in May 1942 he died at the age of just 15 when his car collided with two trams on new south head road at Rose Bay C it comes back from first world war goes to working in the family beers which his brothers been working him but according to Noreen just can 't handle Ellen she 's just too tough so he goes off to eastern suburbs opens up his own real estate someone as tough as that they can get through World War one can 't handle a woman like this and has to move away it 's kind of you know you start to get a real essence of what she was lying from Jax early days in his uncle 's office he became interested in mossman 's history and Pele 's was the perfect place to feed his passion this was the beginning of a lifetime of collecting and preserving mossman 's past it was not only for himself in leis but for the Mosman community and beyond like his uncle Patrick lay was also the foundation captain of the newly established Balmoral Beach Club later he came back to the council and served from 1932 to 1937 including a term as mayor in 1934 in May 1924 Jack married Eileen can still who had grown up in 61 Bradley 's head rode Mossman she met Jack while working at the Commonwealth Bank across the road from Pele 's and together they had three children William Patrick and daughter Noreen like Ellen Eileen was a great charity worker and she played for the Mars at the wild wild west party this afternoon and if she was up the rifle lady she did love charity work very good woman for Jack and Eileen charity work and contributing to the Mosman community was a big part of their lives and a memorial in Mossman square commemorates them Ellen passed away in 1914 and the 1945 Jack was joined at Lai 's by his son Bill William Dalton Carroll known as Bill was born at his mother 's family home sixty-one Bradley 's head road on the 23rd of August 1925 he eldest son of Jack were inseparable sailing rugby schooling camping and Balmoral Beach were their life after their school years Pat went into the building trade and bill after training as a navigator with the Air Force during the Second World War join the family real estate business his father Jack was keen for him to join lays but his mother Eileen was not so happy about the decision the expectation was that dad would take over the business regardless of what other ideas he might have and I think there were other ideas like going to university and studying engineering but you know that was the that was the error like you hand over the business and you look after the legacy so Bill 's position when he took over the business was interesting he combined the new facets of real estate which weren 't previously a feature perhaps of the early days of real estate he became a managing agent collecting rents he became a strata manager agent looking after blocks of flats he became a value of real estate and well renowned as an excellent value specializing in acquisitions and resumption time he was also an auctioneer a bookkeeper in those days he was one at all and did it beautifully he did his own options but then of course there any prospective buyer his nervous and his wanting to get on with it and Bill 's just about ready to get on with it when he says but this before I go a bit of history about the street and the area and he would start on how the street was named and who it was named after and any other points of interest around then of course the people that for it waiting to bid you know we 're getting more and more nervous but he was sort of completely oblivious to that and then we 'd get on with it but he was effective as any other option here so he needed somebody to take down the bins and and so you just sit up there and he would ask you whether you were up to like what was the last bid in case he lost track and um and so you 'd sit up on stage at paper and try and keep up with the thousands as the bids would go up and every now and then he 'd have to come and check and whether you were right or not at 10 wasn 't really in my mind it was just about watching this auction go on in in the Town Hall and there the slide machine was just always this you know the projector with that with all the slides in it that would come in sideways and upside down and and or not at all just blank like a big white wall it was just ridiculous and every auction that he 'd start you 'd be sitting there with your pen poised and he would have to tell an Irish joke first it was I think it was tradition that were unspoken tradition but he 'd get up there and it was just a little chance to do a little Dave Allen and tell an Irish joke and there he wasn 't too good at it but there was so bad they got that be great laugh if you not I mean we got wasn 't hugely professional it just was a job that needed to get done and so whether a ten-year-old did it took the beans or whether the slide was upside down didn 't really matter as long as the job got done and yeah he did he sold plenty of houses that way yeah he 's auction star was very natural and people liked coming to his options he had a little bit of a local following a surprise oh you know you always deal with the people you know he then there was strangers and no dead that 's always saying you know that Jack was a solid man and Bill was good and so that 's why we always stay with Bill and Bill sold the house in Park Avenue for us and they 'd bought the unit in stand right off him and he saw there that property is 700 Force and got the record price here he 'd rattle off three or four auctions in one morning get them all sold bang the hammer down and then get out of the office and drive down to yacht race bill Carol took my place to go to Hobart because he was a navigator I went around the big bill up and he came out and he I was Rowand to say tell mama be happy on Sunday this is Friday out there he picked his little bag up for did because geraniums his early walk they had a nice funeral I said he was a bit of Alaric and they knew that the Carroll boys there at Balmoral bill proved to be a natural salesman at lays and successfully combined business with a commitment to the Mosman community and helping others his advice was to certain properties that he thought were reasonably priced cheap on them at the time and that were in favorable positions and that would be good value in the future and every time I go past the news agency in Mossman Junction that was one of them right in the center of the junction which he had pointed out he said it 's the best site in Mossman and it was for sale at a reasonable price probably 1965 or somewhere around there bought round here it would have been much different because apart from the fact that you 're getting an income from what you 've got well the in the end gang was much greater I should have stayed a man backyard dad style of selling was very natural he was a born salesman I think because he had a very broad grin and smile and that seemed to please a lot of people in he always one of my main observations when I started was seeing people walking to the office with in rage something had happened in the Strada building and the pipe burst and they were the plumber hadn 't come quick enough so they 'd come in and you know with fire coming out there is dad to say fix up mr. Carroll but get the plumber straight away and dad would pacify the person get the plumber there arrange what had to be done whatever the situation was and they 'd always walk out smiling and shaking his hand he was you know nature 's gentleman a really nice guy smoked like a chimney used to out and see what to do and get his good vice and of course that continues cuddly always feeling good and bill always explained to me things he had to do properly and and also things were going on in the area and information he gave me even pepper and her father was dying he he was like a father to me it was very very well known in the community I think a very generous man too in the old days he pretty much hire anybody that you know he thought would would need a job and there 's a spare seat and if there wasn 't a spare seat he find one you know so sitting in auction rooms when I was a child and listening to his bantering the way he dealt with people and and just the I just the day-to-day it never left him though people would find him at home so it was always on the telephone now I 'm dealing with problems when I first met Bill Carol in March 1970 when I started at the council all those years ago and obviously local government but bill was the council 's valuer and he used to come in and have access to the right books I have no doubt that he was also getting information for his own private practice as well but good luck to him as I said things were different in those days but he was helped the council with the purchase of all of the car parks and he was trying to extinguish the Eastman 's for the council and get dedications of land and in that time you know in late 60s early 70s there 's a lot of development going on in Mossman you know residential two and three story blocks and Bill used to help you know the council get those bits of land off respective developers through as little as possible I think Bill Carol would have saved this community hundreds of millions of dollars over the years in those days if you had the work you kept the work he was a founding member of the Rotary Club of Mossman and the first meeting was held in his office at Pele 's real estate been 1969 when I joined Muslim and Rotaract which was being just being formed and he was a big part of the next few months as we got organized and had our charter night in the February of 1970 and I can just see him now a very handsome man and a very intelligent beautiful manners and always very courteously interested in anything that you know that you had to say who Carol worked for rotary you know we are selling raffle tickets to the staff just wandering through the offices if he hadn 't having bill in the office allowed Jack more time to collect more material on early Mossman it seemed only natural that Jack would become the council 's honorary historian in 1949 and in 1953 he founded the Mosman Historical Society the photographs and records he collected formed the Carroll collection which is now in Mossman library and online a lasting record of mossman 's early history and Jack Carroll 's service to the community around this time Helen Tennant joined Pele 's and remained with the business for 36 years she called Jack Paar and that continues to this day Jack Carroll said to me don 't call me mr. Carroll call me power everybody calls me proud should ever you need a job just come and see me and I 'll have one for you so I went in one day or something that 's how I started and that was in 1957 and 38 years later I retired from leis did everything in writing and typing I did the receipts in writing but by the time I left I could actually do that on a computer there were two big ledger books that 's where all the rentals were all the properties the owners and the tenants and the amount they paid every week now I can definitely remember coming into the office as a young child the tram stop was just outside the office and I do remember getting on the tram and paying tuppence I love to the wall telephone we had the the speaker and the beautiful big oak counter with all the great you know these books that were they weighed a ton or meticulously you know every entry full of smoke that was smoked but it was a very busy place there was people coming in and leaving and chatting and paying their rent and you know lots there was busy busy busy and there was lots of you know things to go in envelopes obviously this is before the world of email so everything was handwritten everything was put in an envelope everything was stamped if not stamped hand-delivered because I think dad was doing a little bit of cost-cutting we do the the run in the morning and deliver all the invoices my first memories of coming into the office as a child was first of all the smell it always had a particular smell and it was all the timber in the office and the paneling there 's lots of paneling and son because at phase D so it had this particular smell about it but we were always being dropped into the office in the school holidays or after school or you know in-between times when mum and dad were busy or they had to put us somewhere so we we grew up on foot of Edwards Bay Road was officially opened and dedicated to Dalton Jack Carroll in recognition of his service to the community of Mossman Jack passed away in 1917 leaving behind a fine collection of early records of Mossman and of course thanks to Jack the family tradition of leis continued to flourish in 1986 Bill 's son Rowan joined the business Rowan and Bill worked alongside each other as a team while Rowan was bringing leis into the computer age bill was the frontman keeping up the contacts so might you started in 1986 indeed so that map to the 2016 marks 30 years in the business so 86 was certainly a boom time coming into a boom period 1987 88 89 were great years in real estate perhaps that was fortuitous and perhaps that encouraged me to stick around a bit longer at the same time as those boom there 's also bust so I think we 've probably all recalled black Tuesday in 1987 when the stock market crashed and I can remember having options on the following Saturday which were all warming up to a wonderful there was not a better insight the streets were vacant it was a desert nothing happened so bill sensitive teaching was learned by yourself make mistakes and if you do make mistakes you have to get out of them yourself one house was being eagerly pursued by three potential purchasers bill of course could never say no and he said yes to all three potential purchases that was fine except that was a Friday on Saturday he was leaving to Russia on the Monday they all approached the office saying that I had sorted it out with three potential purchases to sort out the bill in Russia I knew nothing of what was going on and a month later he returned from Russia none the wiser in 1989 Rowan 's younger sister Edwina commenced her real estate career at leis dad was really busy and he kept intimating that I should go and help him because he was really busy and he could do with an extra pair of hands as an open for inspection or an auction or in the office or anything and then one day it was he said hold this or come with me and that was the beginning it was about June 89 and it was just the end of the boom so it was still busy but it wasn 't as frantic we learnt from his style of dealing with people and a lot of it does not worry about small stuff just let them have their aunt or their what they want to say say yes nod and smile and then and then just deal with it if you have to we were one of the first computerized officers we took it on with Gaston it was a magnificent and most wonderful thing to do it 's streamlined the office Helen who had been with a firm well was to be the firm for 38 40 odd years except that it not willingly but realized that that was the way forward so the computer age dawned around the late 1990s 2000 we created a website and at the time we realized the potential the internet could really have and to this day of course it is the most valuable selling tool the nearly with technology and I think that 's that 's very very important today the way real estate scorin it 's very much marketing is that marketing is their priority and I think we 've had to keep up with her with that to stay afloat really in this competitive world of real estate Rouen gradually took over the management of the agency from Bill who continued it lays until the early 2000s and Rowan 's wife Allison joined in 2007 bill passed away in 2009 so we have a property portfolio thanks to dad still and some of them in the same clients and we 're just delving dealing with the next generation now and then they 'll sell a property and hopefully we get that back to rent and then sell it again so a lot of the investment portfolio we we still managed for many years later my role today in the office would be we always say anything and everything because we do rentals and sales we do a little bit of our own handyman jobs and often taking off the high-heeled shoes and you know attending daughter Shane and more recently Rowan and Alison 's daughter Isabel representing the fifth generation are the weekend reinforcements when needed the family speculates leis is the fourth oldest family founded family-owned and family run real estate business in Australia we are the same and that 's what most people like most clients like when they ring up laser real estate same number for the last 100 odd years they will get a Carol and usually because it 's an open office we all know what 's happening definitely there 's a lot of family pride in their business because it 's our name with over a hundred and twenty-five years of continuous operation leis has contributed not only to the real estate world but to the Mosman community the business and the building is part of mossman 's rich heritage and the Carroll family are firmly in control of the future of the real estate agency that Patrick Leigh established so long ago ladies in hospital is a tradition I think it 's a vision tradition that for many many years it 's amazing that as I was treated 'm still treated almost like family I think it does look old-fashioned but the values that they have are old-fashioned in terms of just reliability and honesty and just being decent people _"

    "text": "um some great discussions already going on some really wonderful work I know in a group sets an tastic to see and we 'll get back into that course after lunch but I 'm just going to give a lift up now bats and tools which you may find useful things we travel which can help you assert not just for this project that generally introduce you to a few possibilities yeah as I say why don 't you introduce you to the digital humanities creations before you never heard of the digital humanities community and remember it 's all about like this is some B 's maybe some muscle infographic recheck you give you a quaternary view of the digital humanities community and I 'm entering it go into any of these factors will show you that something that 's happening all over the world and lots of money being spent on the u.s. not so quite so much money in shredder unfortunately and something which is growing why would you be interested in the digital humanities community well because me and I kept myself as a digital cutest we share stuff you 're talking about what we 're doing we share our code we help other people it 's a really sort of funny the the characteristics of the community is a desire to share information share approaches and so if you want to find out what 's happening limited regime attitudes community for example and you can go along to this site which is called digital humanities now which pulls material from the various blogs around the world where people are discussing what they 're doing with material and this includes historians of course and also includes a literature scholars all sorts of us who are starting to use digital tools in there research and the surface earning examples of what we can do with this material and how you can start to visualize it analyzer if you want to just figure to do a question that you relax and help with is also a site which actually specifically set up in order to answer your questions it 's it 's a site where you just so you basically if you if you tackling a research project not sure fools to use you can go along to this site and you can ask Christian and somebody in the digital humanities community will jump in and abuse of hell and of course if you just want to stay connected with what 's happening we are fortunate in that we 've actually just established last year an australasian Association for the digital identities and as a member of the executive committee are contractually obligated to and say that you should join the relation association for the digital identity their first conference earlier this year so there 's a growing group within Australia we were starting to look at the possibilities for using these sorts of technologies and what we might do with them ok but what 's going for about tools what 's my schools and there are lots and lots and lots if we go to just like this is basically a categories list of tools which could be useful in terms of the digital humanities by the symbol by the bamboo project which is a sort of keeping up fella project within the digital pin entities it familiar with sort of commercial services things like Google Docs only there as well because they are useful there 's a collaborative platform but is sort of work but there 's also a lot of things which in good material off tools which have been developing to tackle specific problems that can also have more general applications as well it can have tools for example which help you analyze large amounts of text if you wanted to examine word frequencies within a text for example there are tools which will help you do that if you wanted to pull out all the names of people with interesting to be recognition and there are a number of tools which are available which have to do that sort of work as well it 's a fascinating area and there 's new stuff being developed all the time there was a big digital communities conference in Europe recently and there was you know four or five neutrals which I didn 't know anything about which popped up during the discussion thing so it 's worth to sleeping in oil and see how some that you want to do in the possibility that it does raise for four new avenues of research now I 'm not going to I 've got to set my time again anyway media I 'm not going to go into detail all this all these tools obviously because there are hundreds of the list of you but I do want to talk about wanting to do and that is material now um you already know that cetera because it 's what i 've been using or warning this is the terror sottero is a way of managing research i mean i 've been using gear just we 're sort of 26 bookmarks and easily accessible you can do a lot more bit as well Zotero is really useful because you can sell a material from existing databases for example if you 're in a library catalog and want to save a reference quite likely that you can there will be a little I climbing that the location bar of your browser you click on that icon the Zotero will save the bibliographic information automatically to your own research database there 's a full of them as amicable things about the Giro if we just go on to the show boobs make the database for example I didn 't say the daybreak for the purposes of this demonstration it doesn 't matter i just want to show you that if we look at a particular newspaper article and it 's something that 's interesting and we want to say but see the lightning pops up here that 's the quickly advisor taro and we can just click on that and it will save the details of that newspaper article to our own research database so go back here and we see that newspaper article is popped up you know antimony then it 's also sent a PDF of their article hopefully so if you have it within your own database which you can forget I 'll fly it also just as in terms of capturing information about websites as I say it 's a bit more than just this sort of standard bookmarking tool because you 'll see the head of just if you right-click on a web page you click on that and again it will effectively save the URL save a bookmark but what it also does which is really useful is it does say a set top of that page in your own research database so does it does it take whatever make that is used by the particular graduation show that your yeah it feels there 's different ways that it gets information some databases which expose their mess out of the standard ways it can sort of all automatically you know that when it 's just capturing a web page it will just be capturing the sort of title of events is there you can also construct what are called translators so they 're little bits of custom code which people right and contribute to the project and they enable information to be obtained from specific databases so the reason why you can capture their information from pro for exempt from the newspapers database is because I wrote a translator which does that yeah okay so it gets the metadata the structured data on the page and send something to to oversee database once it however you want you can add notes tags so you can then start to sort of develop your your own research collection so you mean by new version transfer i programmed a bit of code it 's as I say it 's a collaborative venture I mean this is an example of open source software it 's free it 's constructed by a digital humanities center in the u.s. originally but now there 's a whole lot of other people who contribute to the code and they do that in a lot of different ways and one of the ways is by writing translators for different databases so I wrote it 's in a language called JavaScript and it actually just looks at the web page and appliance that bits of information in at once and it feeds to Zotero so it can then save that structured information so your code is now part of such a hero that 's right or audience that 's right yeah and what if the site you looking at is a it you can it depends how to set up there certainly are translators make an answer to that but certainly depends on how the ADEA information structured but sottero if your login sit here I should be able to access or the informational be exciting um yeah this some other cool stuff about zero and one is another one is that you can share things so it 's not just a matter of set having your own search database you can actually create groups on this aterial website and I should also say that you can choose to sync synchronize your database we can secure our server so it can be accessed by hina computer that you are you 're using your laptop and we will desktop on whatever you can have them all synchronized by a density Rho server but you can also choose to create a group if you 're working on a project together you can create a group and you can all be just dragging and dropping material into that group so it 's all available to share and yes I have set up a group for Muslim 4 1030 which is the appropriate more about that later so can just first of all you need to go to the group and just join it and I 'll write a blog post about this for the sites i 'll have more information once you 've joined the group in drag and drop to that group keep you synchronized across everybody who 's accessing that material so it 's a good way of building collaboration across the source analysis well what happens to people get the same information there will be duplicate and there are ways of managing it says it 'll talk there 's other cool things which I won 't go into detail now but for example if you get a PDF file somewhere like a journal article you can ask the Tarot to go look for metadata for that PDF file in the middle register there which is really cool if you like me to die um ok the Terre no just go we 've done that so if I go in and I want to see how do i search to see what the group 's find are facing am looking yeah this is what is yeah there 's all sorts of different ways of searching material within your own databases link once you join a group that becomes part of your research collection so you 're setting up a search then of course of containment you really were selfish you sort of want to keep track paintings yeah okay now i just want to show you a couple of other things as I see it we in the integral humanities make stuff so I 'm going to do little self-indulgent and show you some stuff that I 've made and which could be useful so this is my title well double and you 're welcome to explore but i just want to show you some of these digital tools I ok there 's a couple little things here and I have that sort of long-running love-hate relationship with record search the National Archives database a lovely collection heck interface so I 've been only over the number of years so creating little tools which actually improve the interface for me and let them make it sort of slightly easier to use and again they will is perhaps deeply relevant in this project is a little script over which connects mapping our antics to record search so record search is the main database of the National Archives series be true for 55 is the robot one service records but many are entities totally separate has information about those service reports but and maybe no text links back to the service records but the service record in my cottage don 't link depending on engines so they can 't for example going to name search in the National Archives database find something and then fine for remapping our own deck circle now you can if you use my little script um if I ok let 's go to the site I should have said with the bat Zotero to that it started life as an extension for the Firefox web browser but now it has a standalone version which will work basically on any system any browser so anybody can use it now now this is where you can install mother in script and it 's if you 're using the Chrome browser it 's a matter 's slightly more complicated but there are information how to do it 's not really very hard if we go to a report here in reportage you 'll notice look this is a bad knee this is view in mapping our index read that back and come from I became from my little script and I can prove that to you by switching off No okay so my little script and also need something interesting here if you normally view reportage you don 't get that nice little bit of information with Jersey the number of pages in the digital environment so that 's another of modern scripts doing some work there so we switch them back on again okay so actually the script goes off and looks into the digitized file sees how many pages there are and it tells you we 're also work for you 've got a list of items so if you have a search and you 've got a list of items and you want to see whether really do CD files that you can easily get a glass to see which pay which page so it just makes a little more convenient for browsing for using the reportage in the case of this project you know if people are going into reports option is to say name search and searching for things we also want to connect to that file in reporter if we want to have that URL but we also want the connection to mapping ons because there 's some information in libya insects which isn 't in record search so this makes it is you can just click on there it does to the recording mapping our man 's ex and we can capture that URL as well so again just a very simple little thing but it actually does make it like a lot easy when it 's working with your nails or user scripts yeah yeah in better I look let 's um let 's switch off again so what happens we click on new digital copy this is what we do it 's a lot of problem with this page one is that you don 't actually have any contextual information you don 't know that the another problem is that if you want to print it instead of trigger to punish at a time which gets very annoying if it 's on on the file and we get around there through the magic of user scripts let 's try that again shall we okay so we 've got the additional information control simple beer we 've by the time okay fades in and out isn 't that nice now perhaps most importantly most usefully you can create the whole phone or you can print a range of pages just using this level do that here so that makes life a lot easier this browsing through dating doesn 't quite work at the moment it was using a particular thesis which isn 't sort of being supported much anymore but I intend to sort of redevelopment because is actually a whole lot of other options now it was a visualization of that file that show all of the pages of the fire on this nice trendy browsing the wall and there are now since i did that and there was a few years ago that actually wrote of material so i 'm going to actually work on something before it 's a bit different than using that okay so there 's a few tools which can just help you in doing this sort of digital research and i say you know there 's a lot of people who are actually developing things and sharing them and making them available for you to use some there 's also some stuff to deplane so both of you could like your newspapers and you think you 're pretty good at history consist yourself with headline relay this is actually drawing a random newspaper article from the Troad newspaper database and you have to find guess the year and it becomes quite addictive strangely the this also I 've been doing a lot of work with the newspapers database last year or so and one of the outcomes of this is this tool called query bit you put a word or a phrase in it it goes off at searches the newspaper database for each year and it it takes a little while because it has to get them in chunks it as a nice graph showing the number of occurrences of that phrase over time so it 's really useful if you 're particularly if you just want to get an idea of the trees where a particular phrase occurs over time or if you 're sort of starting a research project or just have a bit of a hunch about something and you just want to see data visualization get a picture of power it might have occurred within the newspaper database it gives you a really quick impression of that so be very good for language researchers in if you have either particular word if you want to say that did that vocabulary chelating 70 or yeah yeah yeah I mean of course you can even do that just in a normal trophy know facing tips of looking at picking up in a bit obvious reference but it does actually do with those trends over 200 square useful for example I had a guy contact me recently who 's researching Americans the use of the word larrikin and so we did a few dress for him to show Sydney you know there was some interesting differences in there too so it looks like you look great more it says so that 's that 's what you see and it 's again yeah I started off talking about the connections between big pictures and stories this is the reason why there 's that that if yes by the way is the default view shows you the proportion of the matches of that the number of articles so that the new years is not many papers so the proportion can seem high can actually switch that if you are eligible raw number of matching articles so the gift of surging by mossman yep now if you want to actually drill down like I said connecting back to the stories affecting the big pictures to the stories you click on any point on that graph half and it pulls up the first three articles which are so you can actually see I mean if you want it 's more a further 25 notice or take you in to try to get the pictures in the content of bed early and you that being so and this i should say is possible it was tribe has what 's called an api an application program interface which means you can create programs scripts yourself rich actually talk to the computers at the national library and get back structure information and then they need to build things with it doing out it will have an API so the people can actually construct resources as well it 's important thing i 'll talk more about that later but this what becomes possible people can go off and build tools on top of your resources they can create new ways of looking at them which email on a portal and that 's what we say to each other making material available in a way of computers can understand okay i 'm kidding you from lunch more like an awesome other stuff I 've been doing I 've been doing some explorations of the wave front pages because of course that you can always hit the hidden act like a friend and a lot of difference between your newspaper kicking off in school stuff as well now a mystery box challenge for that and the idea of that is I 'm not going to sort of say you do it either I might like to do it after today but what I did everything I just started assembling a pretty much abandoned a few legit that things which I found so so the vets here which is the newspaper articles some people places and the challenge was really to see what for the series you can create this sort of material and I had in mind I don 't know any of you know of the service called Storify even a Storify road on it 's it 's really quite fun and quite easy to use so if you just go through storify very quick to sign up and what you can do is you can actually just create you can actually just with those materials which I mean there 's a 20 group you can actually just get that URL we can paste it into Storify enable people to show you that webpage so this is one some of the newspaper about your ID and the comments or thoughts as well you can put in units of text and so it 's it 's a fun way of thinking about how you actually use material to put them together as a story in a way which you can then share other people can view so this is the interface here so you can brag to eggsy somebody 's been tweeting about something you can go to flickr photos put them in as i said you can just give a me so if we go here and have a look at the people royal okay it 's got that wrong world we can Australia bit across here and so then we can just start assembling our resources that we can if you want to make a comment about that you can say something here so my challenge really and as I tell you can fiddle playing with this at lunchtime or you can go home and play with it is to see if you can just assemble some stories using some of the material either the two mullets invert the there 's a terror group and we just go to the city recital search for most of 14 I 've seen that will take you there as well using some of those materials to see what you can make with them so any tell us about it share them and we can link to them from the blog and we can all sort of fit because it 's a way of thinking about how we use these materials and the sorts of stories you might be 10 which is dead easy but time for lunch thanks it right _"

giggle people had been living in Mossman for at least 6000 years it 's quite amazing the things that have happened in this place well the origin of Mossman really starts in 1831 when Archibald wasallam came here to set up the famous whaling station in Mossman Bay he also built the first home and must be called the nest unfortunately this has nothing left of the radio station except for the barn which is relic of the whaling station and the ring bolt famous rainbow the real development of Mossman started around the 1870s 1880s when developers built many large homes perhaps the most famous at a time was home built by Richard Harnett which was the original Buena Vista following the 1880s was really the growth of MAS from the famous Federation architecture was a major feature of the period of course oh really the whole heritage of Mossman the origin of muslim council 's borough but following positions from a large number residents the government that they agreed that most must be an independent council and the first mayor that a was rich hard at jr. mayors of Mossman have been in the forefront of local government for many years in Mossman has been a trailblazer in many ways this council has done things that councils many times its size have not been able to do and remain solvent why do I like living in Mossman it has an extraordinary sense of being part of a big city yet there are places where you could be hundreds of miles from a city you go to charter head you walk through the bush land there the birds are singing there are trees around you you can see glimpses of water then you walk out on to a little rocky promontory and spread ahead of you is the high rise of Sydney so you move from bush the city in an instant it 's that environment that is so wonderful in Muslim I mean you 're six what seven eight hundred how many miles from this absolutely Wonderland it 's just just such a beautiful place and I 'd like more people to enjoy it what makes Turanga that incredibly special place is that stunning view and you come around the corner and you just simply gobsmacked so you come through the main entrance that fantastic main entrance and one of the things I 'd look out for on the way which I 'm sad that 's no longer in muslin is one of the buildings at one of the corner buildings used to have animals heads on it bit like the zoos entry point I always knew I was getting close even before you could read signs maybe an age before you could read you were near the zoo because you will need a little shopping center that had all the animals so then you get to the main entrance and out on the animal something that was pretty exciting the barn was a meeting place it was one of those few facilities where everyone could come together it was known as the place to be on a Saturday night and many of the if you hadn 't played the barn you hadn 't played the Mosman daily in Great Northern proprietary limited was a very small little firm run by the Walker family it was an old-fashioned country press in the middle of muslin the party feel is to go across there and there was also a theory that used to take a tram and they had had a tram on it that used to go across there as well pack remember the Chen 's running down to their terminus they still called the championship at the bus shelter down there still refer to as the champ shed it 's it 's interesting how it sticks in the nine although it lines down to the spit then the other one went down to the zoo a branch at the Buena Vista Hotel down to Balmoral and a branch of Mossman Junction down to Osman war the shockwatch set up after the war not the second war with young men up in the amphitheater the star an amphitheater issued with binoculars to search out for the Sharks and then they would use a signal shark alarm bill at the club and of course meant that on a long sunny day that everyone was focused on the Sharks rumor has it that some of the young we had to have their binoculars may have been watching more activity on the beach but there would be no it 's a pity you know why the amphitheater isn 't still there as a ruin it would really really be something something to add to Balmoral more more perhaps than the home units submarines invade Sydney Harbor their only victim an old ferry boat converted to Navy use two torpedoes found their mark before the invaders were blasted to the bottom I remember being huddled up in the corridor area of the house where early Japanese subs came into the harbor and the whatever was going on in the harbor noise is fun remember we were huddled up there I remember going with my mother to Mossman primary school and watching her put cellophane on the windows because they thought perhaps attacks were imminent never happened of course but all the windows of the school were cellophane and head and the prisoners of war dressed in their red dungarees will add the freedom of Moscow well after the wallet took off after the war took off everybody was happy and it was wonderful report should live in a wonderful natural environment and a really historic environment but above all it 's it 's the community that makes life great a quarter of all our adults work together as volunteers looking after each other looking after children than the elderly and it 's that spirit of community which were really I treasure and I 'm sure most people treasure more than anything else you may remember a little kiosk next to where the Beach Club is which would sell hot water hot water propidium whatever to make you tea so they 'd pick up this images and then somebody said well why don 't you join the beach club right next door with picnic facilities and a place to change that it 's a beach club not a swimming club and that was always the origin with those smugglers they didn 't go down there have shooing races they to socialize to be able to enjoy each other 's company so three of us were nattering away one day over a beer John John Sykes myself and Tommy Lopez and we said one of us ought to get onto Council and see if we can smarten things up a bit for sport so Dom he said okay I 'll stand for council and he did and you know the history of dami there 's some very good musical societies around the time they 've knocked down us of some PCM who the original ones and the Metropolitan and kagura and and various ones but certainly the only one that I know that ever got to the ear was it was Muslim you rush on and you rush off and you change clothes and you change hairstyles yeah boom boom boom boom boom and you 're finished with one scene you three seconds later back more ways to start the next one we had eight or nine fruit shops later anion butcher shops chemists were quite a few five different grocery stores there we even had two or three shoe mothman Junction you know it was like the back end of Mossman but to Mossman junctions credit build up a tremendous amount of goodwill and it was like comparing double bay to to new town see the bottom end Mossman jacks with like double by and speech acts with newtown you want any cheaper you gotta you gotta spit junction I was here in Balmoral in my studio this lady rang up and she said we want to form a Mossman Art Society I said why she said we want a place to paint together I said I don 't like painting with other people and she said well we were told by somebody in Mossman Council that if you became our patron they would give us somewhere to paint so we drove a manifesto the first point of that manifesto was we will work with Muslim Council to help create an Auslan gallery as part of the regional gallery Association and I got a call from Kay Clark about the year after st. we 've done it Paul we 've just voted the money and we 've just got then of course Mossman has so many wonderful wonderful painters you know you 'd probably never have to go outside of Mossman to have to fill that gallery continually it 's it 's a great place to grow up it 's been a great place to live and grace being a great place to paint muffin is the pearl of the Pacific the people the shops the heritage and last but not least this wonderful count you _"

    "text": "these you can lift you in currency thank you so much Jill for welcoming me to your beautiful library and thank you very much for inviting me i know it 's a busy time for book stores and thank you so much for coming this evening I know how busy everybody is and that 's just lovely of you to come it still amazes me that people would be interested to read anything that I 've written by us that seems a long way from Main Street Miranda little town that I grew up in at the top of the Hunter Valley so thank you very very much indeed I am I 've been to Melbourne for a few days talking about the new book and somebody a young person came up to me at one of the books homers in Melbourne said look I 'm really too young to remember who you were my grandfather loved he 's been in love with you for years so would you sign this book for you so I just reminded me that I have indeed been around long or quarters at this really a search for meaning and to my amazement it 's now 10 years since the first Australians story went to air is this remarkable isn 't i think it was many 1996 and the joy of that experience is that people seem to get so much pleasure of watching the programme which is just marvelous our production manager nita Adkins was on holiday recently in mufti either Irish you know as you know no one could see that she had anything to do with Australian story anyhow she went to the bucket and caves which is a very beautiful spot in Victoria and as the issues with a group having a tour and as the guide came to the end of his description of the beautiful caves he said well ladies and gentlemen it 's time now to return to the bus and Anita heard one of the tourists turn to her companion say thank heavens for that we 'll be back at the motel in time for watch Australia this was wonderful and I do too and I was envy at the skin cancer too did the other regular checkup I do find it I mean it 's not funny but sitting in the waiting room all these sort of people of my complexions are the patients and we 're all sitting around with her various complaints and waiting and hoping that it won 't be too frightful and it just amuses me that every time one of the young medicos comes out to get the next patient at this clinic anyhow they are the most beautiful young people and a number of them a young alien doctors and they have this beautiful is no no sign of any blemish or skin cancer I 'm city grab you are looking like a lizard both in a lot of us look like lizards because we we sun-baked too much in our impressionable youth anyhow that 's not the point of the story is somebody one of my fellow patients said to me and I just loved the Australian story last night because it was the one about the women who had had breast cancer and is part of your recovery they 've taken to the dragon boat racing never tears in his eyes and he said we love that story because he said my wife 's had breast cancer and he said just seeing those women and their families for training that story it just made me feel kind of relieved as though people would understand how hard it has been for us and how brave people are when they go through this and how difficult it is for their families and so on so I thought that was wonder what he said but of course now my wife wants to talk to a dragon 's oh and that started a conversation going in the waiting room and somebody else at home yes I said I enjoyed that too but my favorite is that we like an all-australian story part you know dr square degree which passed the time pleasantly before we went in and got zapped there was nothing about feeling of you know swapping stories and names as though we knew the people who 've been in the program as though there were some how are our friends though we were perhaps at a school reunion remembering we do know them and i had just found that really a lovely experience what interests me is that we to really make the programs have been changed by making them and I 'm thinking of Claire Foster one of our most wonderful producers she wrote on the sheer it has written in her chapter in the Australian storybook lovely little description i wonder if you remember carve their names with pride beautiful story quite an early one and Claire is one of our producers rights carve their names with pride told the story of a group of students from North Makai high school Queensland who were visiting the battlefields and cemeteries of Gallipoli in France they were on a mission 598 headstones that marked the death in world war one of men and women who and sisters of present-day Makai residence when the students return to Makai they presented photographs of a grave stones to the siblings children and grandchildren of those servicemen and women who was a precious gift as many of the locals have never seen their loved ones last resting place and Claire goes on to the headstones being moved to tears and grieving for soldiers they had never met made me realize once again what a privilege it is to work our program where people accept your presence during intensely emotional and personal Germany 's and she says that she 's a young woman with two little children I don 't have these girls do everything today they do everything anyhow she has changed her life just working on the program I 'm sure we can all say the same thing we just all think we 've got the best job in the industry and we know how fortunate we are to be part of this program what interests me is why people respond so in such a heartfelt way too many of the programs and I 'd like to explore the reason for that because I think the reason touches each one of us personally in our own lives I mean it 's true that Australian story is entertaining to watch but there 's also usually something very satisfying about programs and I wonder what that is I think it 's to do just a story that communicates very readily to feel in psyche or the human imagination more readily than saying oh I don 't know a mathematical formula let your about Albert Einstein or a lecture on psychology important and interesting those those things are I think that the power of the story you know if you think of revival old and new Testament almost written in story form every television drama it 's a story isn 't it and and I suppose I 've got a theory i 'd like to try out on you and i 'll begin by telling you a story of course how else some of you will have heard it before maybe from me i just love this story I got it from Patti Miller who among other books has within a beautiful book writing your life you may be familiar with that and she got it from an American teacher called Barbara meyerhoff and Barbara meyerhoff was teaching a course in urban anthropology it sounds very American I suppose it 's the study of people in the city is it anyway she gave an assignment want you to go and find somebody who lives a life very different from your own and draw out that person 's story and write that story down as fully as you can that 's your assignment so off we went and one student had terrific trouble with this and the deadline was coming closer and he had done nothing about it he was quite from quite a wealthy family he lived in a lovely palatial comfortable home and he actually didn 't very often encounter anybody who lived a life very different from his own so the night before the assignment was due he was pretty desperate and suddenly along the corridor of his home he saw Maria and Maria was the Guatemalan immigrant home help who lived in their house and did the cleaning and the cooking and the mending and many other things to make life comfortable for that family and he got an inspiration he thought well she lives her life very different from mine and rather tentatively went along the corridor and he said to her Maria could you would you tell me something of put down the broom and she drew herself up to her full height which wasn 't very high and she said and she said oh yes i can tell you my story because every night before I go to sleep I go over my story in every detail and I do that to keep it all together just in case one day someone might ask me to tell it gracias adios so she looked so poor and so little and had so little in the way of material wealth and yet it seems to me she had a great richness inside in conserving and honoring and acknowledging her story with all its loss she had in a sense conserved a very self I think you know it 's a hard thing isn 't it have to move from one country to another for whatever good reasons you doing it must be always a sense of Exile about it the loss of one 's language family culture everything that 's familiar so I love that story for all that she had lost you know she still had that precious story and and has its own special value and I often wonder do you acknowledge and conserve your story as Maria did no one else can live your story and your story your life has its own particular contribution its own particular gift to make to the world without it there would be an irreplaceable gap in the world it 's very obvious thing to say I know but not everybody actually understands it and I suppose that 's why suicide or the death of a young person is so heart-wrenching because well because that person 's story was not fully told did not come to fruition did not to fullfillment adopted people often come to the point don 't they wear at a certain time in their life suddenly they need to know and they go looking for the original family called the birth family I think isn 't it and of course my group you know people who have come from another country sometimes not always i know but sometimes get the the desire to go back to find that part of the story that they 've left behind i ago on radio on the search for meaning she was a migrant to Australia who as a young one had lost many of her family in the bombing of Budapest during the second war she took the huge step of migrating to Australia and made a home and started a new family in Canberra but one day twenty years after her arrival in this country something happened which gave her an urgent desire to go back well she spoke to me in that world weary middle European accent that I must say I find very attractive and she said I won 't attempt the accent there was one day when there was a really big snowfall in Canberra and I walked out and saw the snowflakes falling and I thought I must go back I haven 't seen snow in all those years and I must go back I went back to Hungary my my wonderful husband and brother understood my need to go and they financed the journey and after 20 years waiting there is written up on that airport in deterring Gators buda-pesht and I stepped off the all my friends were there the babies they were holding in their arms when I left were now young women and they were holding their own babies in their arms they are all waiting for me it was an incredible moment of time I walked slowly as if my legs were led because I knew this would never happen again it was such a mixed wonderful trip when I came across something that spoke to me in my own old language I wept and wept and wept every time I walked up into the hills there was an old oak tree and I found on it a heart a heart which represented the first love of my life with an arrow or cross which we had carved out then suddenly there was a war millions of people died the city collapsed but the big oak tree stands there with our heart and cross on it details like that really bring your heart you walk up to the hills and look down on that city and from there is this misty outline of that place you love so much I had walked around and just bet the memories of the reality mix and I started to miss my husband and son back in Canberra so in like you 've gained things and things are taken from you but it 's all part of your story beautiful people say to me where do you find those interesting people for Australian story of course I don 't have a story I 'm just a housewife mother I 'm just a retired engineer or walking home it 's just it 's like an arrow to the heart to me and I just think it 's really bad thinking because it 's not true and of course that 's what I 'm exploring in an authentic life I wrote it this one I wrote it as an invitation to the reader to reflect seriously on your own story to believe that you have a story to trust trust that it has a meaning and to make a deeper discovery of your own gift your own talents and your only inner resources I wrote it as an encouragement to live life to the full whatever your and purpose and gladness and I mean I wrote it not to preach but because I mean that 's my quest you know how to live a life of integrity and you know a real life with courage and compassion and interest in other people and I I really don 't make any claim to have all the answers but I 'm deeply interested in those questions how to live an authentic life with integrity and purpose how to find hope and courage in the face of suffering and change how to feel happy and at home in myself how to live with compassion for others and with a sense of belonging so I just offered this book as a companion to your own search for meaning if it appeals to you this book offers my company and band of others who might have interviewed as we describe our milestones and discoveries and how we 've faced the hard times and how at times all we could manage was just to survive where we have found solutions how we 've kept our faith in life even when it was tested some reassurance that we do matter but we are doing our best and but we are not alone in our endeavors so important isn 't interested have a feeling that you 're not alone and that life is worth living so look if there 's someone you know who 's having a bit of a struggle this may be a gently encouraging gift for them I don 't know you 've got to be very careful giving books to people haven 't you in case it seems like an amazing position or something the puppies also written as a guide to keeping a journal or scrapbook which is a way of conserving one story and as a resource for small group discussion and it 's used to all around the country for that purpose I have a lot of letters this book was first published in 1998 and as fuel has said if this is a second edition so if you read it in 1998 you don 't need to write read it again if you know you know it 's the same book with a new introduction and a want you to be buying something which has a false pretenses because it looks different I got some lovely letters after it was published and one of them any came from Sinan from one woman who was part of a book group in outback Queensland and these seven women traveled like I don 't even know how many hours occasionally to get together you know if you just visualize them driving through the dust to get together to have each other 's company for one day every month I think they did and they put they use the authentic life as one of their books for discussion and they they really do it up she said to me Sylvia and Sylvia said we the questions that you posed to us made us share our stories with each other in a way that we hadn 't quite done before we 've known each other for many years but this kind of pushed it a bit further in a bit closer I was really thrilled about that well um these two books are cousins these two books are cousins very look like the way from very card you said it it 's an autobiography look it easy in the sense that it has got some of my story in it but I would never write an autobiography and call it an event you in a bit embarrassing what title beans is how do we it 's like a question and how are we to live an authentic life that 's really what it means I wanted to call the book a companion to the search for meaning because that 's what I think it is good anyhow it wasn 't a suitable it wasn 't qualified anyhow but an authentic life grew out of the radio series of search for meaning which was on the air from 87 to 94 eight years of storytelling and I had the privilege of listening to the life experiences of my countrymen and women in only variety week after week as wonderful tools were broadcast across the continent on radio national on that ephemeral yet powerful medium of radio waves and these stories I think seeped into our national consciousness people take them and shared them that we laughed and cried as we discovered how people have negotiated their perilous turning points and we heard the insights they 've gained as a consequence the search for meaning revealed Australians as articulate and thoughtful spiritual and resilient people and the town of the stories do you drew a powerful response many many wrote to us as though us to tell a story invites a story and I do really believe happens wonderful letters so the search our meeting was actually one of the inspirations for Australian story the search for meaning and a big country or become beautiful appropriate and that 's how I came to be involved with Debra Fleming one of the abc 's current affairs producers was invited to start a new current affairs programme she took a fresh approach to the job she thought that what she suspected the audience was tired of confrontation and also tired of reporters dominating programs and she talks about this in her chapter in the book it seemed very interesting how she you know what she was attempting to create so Australian story her reporters had to convert into listeners keeping the background behind the camera to help the subject of the Australian story tell it in their own words find a visual ways to give the person 's story depth and a context so the reporters became producers enhancing illuminating and expanding current affairs reporting by lending to important issues greater depth in human interest by providing a wealth of background for instance in this Australian story behind the scenes book one chapter is written by Matt Nathan I don 't have anyone got their copy of the book yet no okay well um this is a he 's a wonderful man you probably some of you may would know him he talks about being the subject of an Australian story there are three chapters in here which are written by people who 've been the subject Matt Levin is a young lawyer who works in the office of the director of public prosecutions in Sydney he 's he has a happy and hectic social life he ran for Lord Mayor of Sydney a few years ago he 's on the rugby a judiciary all this use of an electric wheelchair make him look very very different and present him an enormous challenge every day of his life from the moment wakes up so you may have seen that as this Australian story but as we see the story unfold removed engaged and of course educated about the life of a person living with a severe disability in a way which is more touching and powerful I think than hearing an expert speak about the needs of persons who are disabled of course the interpret would make his own her own important contribution to I 'm not denying that but i think it 's the it 's the real-life story that grabs our attention first it 's the man 's tremendous laugh and his zest alive it just lifts your spirits and there is a beautiful photographs here of Matt Lappin with some of his friends his story is a blueprint for how to search suffering with hope and courage and don 't we all need that whatever a particular suffering or challenge it might be and I think that 's one of the values of of a problem into the exploration of possible solutions I really like being part of that and to come to my theory that why we found the Australis very satisfying I do believe we 're compared by each other 's stories because they tell us much about ourselves each one of us is a story in the making as it were and these Australian stories give us important clues about the puzzle of what it is to be human and how to negotiate accenture creatively and with courage and compassion I mean I know I wonder as i watch how on earth would I cope with that disgrace you know do I have that resilience that generosity would I give a kidney to somebody else do I have that capacity for forgiveness that Joey and being alive could I survive that setback or be happy under those circumstances but then i watch how they do it and I learn rich lessons for myself and I remember them later so I suppose I think of the story as maps which people have gone through their own hard-won experience to chart their stories are all the more valuable for the inclusion of obstacles or failures I mean you might not even like or approve of some of the people on the program I think but but you learn from them even if even if you learn what not to do these stories ask the questions we all ask Who am I and where am I going and what 's it all about and how do I make my contribution to to repeat a world all the stories together with respect and fascination for their differences are what go to make up our culture and i suppose what you don 't see on an Australian story is what happens behind the scenes so that 's really what the book is about how we make the programs so Matt laughs and I dr. Michael hold and reveal their experiences of being the subject of a program we might love to watch the story but you know what 's it like with the council girls on you you remembered michael holt perhaps he 's on a cover of the book he was the head of the street was knocked over vibe and you know it just just his perfect life was just absolutely shattered what would it be like for a doctor to be a patient I thought that was one of the most fascinating parts of it and what of the future person would he ever be able to be a surgeon again and what was it like for him to take part in that Australian story and watch do you remember one of his Fiat assistance remembering what an arrogant person here would be sometimes you theatre by the same token she was inspired by him arrogance and all to take up medical studies herself which are going very well by the way so so that was exciting so behind the scenes that 's where we 're going with the book and you 'll find out how these remarkable stories are made and how ordinary people like you and me are encouraged and supported to tell the stories with such unusual candor it 's not easy for them I think you become vulnerable when you share something with story don 't you it research the stories there 's one chapter which gives a camera man 's point of view you read how arduous the whole process can be several some of the stories take several years to make others are very interesting one written by Vanessa Gorman Vanessa produced the story about Wayne Bennett which I think has been one of the great favorites to see that granite faced person everyone the media is really scared of to see really what his life is like with his wife and his and two of his children who have disability and you know test to see underneath the exterior and to be given an insight into his family life I found absolutely wonderful so Vanessa produced that and a number of our other very fine australian stories and then she another chapter transforms from producer intersubjective story and she tells it the birth her second baby Raphael after the grief of losing her first child you may remember seeing so I was going to mention some of the other story specifically but I think it 's better for us to wait and see what you celebrate the 10th anniversary of the program published by ABC books Australian story behind the scenes and if you enjoy the program on television I hope I hope I think you would enjoy the book and if it 's you know it 's entertaining but it also helps us to know better our fellow Australians and I think there 's something sustaining about it in meeting the challenge of our own lives there are also two volumes of Australian stories on CDs that 's right and a DVD of all of the stories and I 'm just so happy to answer any questions or hear any observations you may like to move and later very happy to sign mine or both of the books perhaps for you or for someone as a gift if you if you do watch the program we 've got repeat programs running on Saturday lunch times at the moment for 30 saturdays and then from the minimum january your plate will come back on to monday nights and play three favorite programs do you remember Mack and Gail Shan she was that beautiful young woman are working on home as a post on video knocking accident and she lost one arm row doers and that my own husband meg has done everything you know that he can to care for her I 've always remember something in that story he said he looked so young and it was such a terrible thing that happened to the memory of saying well I said I seek for better or worse in sickness and in health and I 've mented and boy did he need to mean it so that story he 's going to be one of the ones that 's on a Monday night in January with a little update on how they 're going now which I know people would be interested to see and I 'll peter andrews to remember that man up in the honda valid who had 30 years of ridicule and so on for his methods of restoring ravaged land that one 's on again and firmly i think the young woman who brought together all it would have been involved in a car crash outside foodie remember quite extraordinary reconciliation little something about them I 'm mad about stories as you know the personal story I think that the telling of a personal story is a generous gift it 's a glimpse of their heart and soul and it renders them vulnerable but it makes our society stronger for the truthful telling of our human experience today 's a pathway on which we may walk forward together with trust and confidence do you like a you were choosing Caroline I see you on your team seek out people you know to find out more about their stories but does it ever happened that people might offer their story to New it has happened a couple of times it 's more common the question was do people ever off in their own story for telling on Australian story it 's not very often but people do recommend others whom they know or they know all and that has resulted in several of very very good stories i mean the problem really is an embarrassment of riches there is so many possibilities out there and you we all would know it doesn it sounds like the five ladies in Queensland yes typically we story the rethinking of the seven-hour fact property women in Queens that wouldn 't that be wonderful as they traveling into towards each other yes and bringing up its this stories of the different flavors from that be wonderful how would you do that in half people challenge though how could I do you think that can quite short that you sing to 30 with the greatest respect a private person how did you balance giving of yourself was that hard to reveal yes yes I know exactly what you mean just the suggestion as a fairly private person and an introvert myself that 's why would I know you didn 't set up and I am how would I what was it like for me trying to tell something of my story in North ended life well you know I just it 's a bit personal this but how do you know that some of you know that my mother took her own life and it really broke my heart because I felt you know she but you you do not know why somebody does it never even pretend to say that funny when you see somebody lose hope I lose the possibility of going on it 's just terrible and I think you know part of it it happens you know young people a lot no I just can 't find a way to go on and I just wonder if part of that isn 't not really having faith or confidence in one 's own story and at some point I don 't_''_2189.47 I out of the grief for the heartbreak at some point it came to me but one of the most genuine things you actually can give in fact it might be and that 's not the only thing but it 's a really genuine thing you can give issue over story or your version of your own story because it 's real and it 's heartfelt and it comes out of your experience and it 's something like that that 's a bit of a scrappy answer but it was something like that and I thought if I 've got a job to have confidence in their own story to understand that your life matters it 's not just a matter of no consequence it 's not something that can be through we can 't_''_2242.0 do without it now as I said not everyone knows that so I think I came to the point where I thought my job is to be an encourage long those lines and I really think that 's actually what my work is about so they don 't yes it does then nothing using the word courage since we took a lot of courage on your part and do try to encourage on my part I think once you get a passion for so once you get an idea of your own vocation is that we 're all right your own purpose and I suppose we have a number of purposes in life especially different stages and once you get that you know when you get the bit between your teeth and you think this is what I want to do this is my job this is what I can do I think then you 've got a as a very shy child I walked around with mum and sometimes dead at the age of 70 and try to get a cadetship on a newspaper well no one would look at me I mean I would have looked at me you know I mean you really though it 's funny but i think i was showing us as a child also you might learn to listen because you don 't know what to say but you find out you can be part of things by just listening everyone loves a listener it 's interesting isn 't it you know money everything that happens go is some little bit of learning something like the bowerbird gathering all these bits and pieces and they all are in the nest and if you look did you think what everybody yes but it 's all learning don 't you think you know hardly any experience is wasted even the ghastly things he 's pretty rude on the Christians question 1 you think I the satisfying story come on Chinese oh so many will be no I just will we ever see in is your life horrible and I 'd you cannot just say something about that because I think it 's quite interesting this is your life tricks you it 's a secret or all sorts of people around you and may are sworn to secrecy and they I can 't tell you what a feeling of betrayal it is I think some people might like it and you have to respond to it with good grace because you know people need will but the difference between that and what we do is we do by choice by invitation would you like to share what would you like to share you know so big difference question and from 972 share with you of borrow bots in rural today what is the ABCs a good disorder what 's it putting chairs like this together compared to IVC I don 't think any audience Couture part start store I don 't know I thank goodness if I do I think I did so there I you 're not Boyer istic we don 't go into the seamy side of things you tell the truth and you think some of those Australian stories you 're a bit green yes the great is different you 're not you 're not seeking that sensational you thank you what happens right thank you I think you attract a different type of journalists a journalist are with depth often with a sense of mission the Andrew Ali 's I can 't name I mean all of your presumably listen Dre DC range in which letter should the German is like go that are drawn to the ABC that are attracted to the ABC that I paid less of a beezy are a different type of person or a person with them with a sense of mission with an idea that journalism has to serve the public interest and not be a vehicle for narcissist and the vital difference between Australian story in every other program on television in this country is that it goes to the soul and the mind and the spirit of the subject and it 's not about self-promotion it 's not about conflict in the sense of inflaming conflict yes we do see conflict but thank you for it with all my heart because I 'm i adn 't viewer _"

    "text": "thank you very much peter and good evening everybody achievement what do you see at first glance it looks pretty formless doesn 't it just another vast suburban sprawl could be anywhere really it almost looks like a caricature of a suburb a stereotype standard three-bedroom housing stock dominates sliced and diced row upon row so similar as to appear homogeneous from this height unrelieved by much vegetation though there are thousands of front lawns and backyards down there many with swimming pools and a few playing fields and parks dotted about yet if we were to swoop low over southwood low enough to glimpse the lives being lived under all these red roofs well enough to sense what 's really going on here we 'd get a very different impression southwood like every place of human habitation is a rich and complex cultural phenomenon yes it 's one of those much maligned suburbs but the suburbs where most poems are written most cups of sugar borrowed most flowers grown most dreams fulfilled most passions stir most sexual relationships consummated most babies can see most marriages celebrated it 's the swelling like silken manners in the heart the suburbs are where faith is most often tested by experience and where the most painful lesson of all that loves work is hard work is usually learnt suburbs are where the joy of sex is most often experienced and its disappointments most often faced where most intimations of mortality are first detected and where a feeling of contentment yearned for yet unexpected most often descends on people this is not because suburbs are better or worse places to live than anywhere else all those things happen in country towns too they happen in inner city terraces and apartments in caravan parks and fishing villages but the suburbs have the numbers which is to say most wife happens in this other ones well that 's a few paragraphs from the opening of the new book the art of boring it 's a book of social analysis about what 's happening to communities and neighborhoods around australia but throughout the book i 've illustrated it lavishly not with pictures but with stories from a fictitious suburb which i 've created called southwood check your sure there are many echoes of mossman in southwest and there are some features of southwood that you might want to own as moss mines but southwood is an example of something that i think is the most important thing to know about human beings which is that we are social animals who not just like to live in communities but need to live in communities just take a look at how most of the humans on the planet live chip by jail cities towns suburbs villages this is our preferred way of life there are hundreds you don 't know any because they 're hurts generally speaking we we act like so many other species on the planet that is we live communally with herd animals it 's in our dna neuroscientists are now saying to us that the center for cooperation can be identified in the brain but the center for competition doesn 't exist competition is something we have to learn so here 's the deepest truth about human beings not as we 're so often told that we are ruthlessly self-interested preachers desperately competing with each aggressive and even violent if someone stands in our way yes that 's in all of us too that 's there but the much deeper truth about us is that we are born to be part of something we are born to be neighbours we are born to belong to communities but of course the other deep truth about human nature is that communities don 't just happen i detect more than a hint of pride in the way the mayor talks about muslim and other people tonight have talked about muslim and not surprisingly given the history and the culture of this suburb but suburbs like this and communities anywhere don 't just happen and they don 't necessarily survive once they 've been created so here 's another deep truth about us that there 's a kind of symmetrical imperative about human nature which is that we need communities to sustain us and nurture us and protect us and those communities need us to sustain and nurture them so it 's not just it 's not just sad but it 's serious when you hear people say as melbourne brisbane increasingly the smaller cities and regional towns as well people saying we don 't know our neighbours or i feel a bit like a stranger in my own street or the neighborhood doesn 't seem to function quite the way it used to that 's become that that we don 't know our neighbours has become almost a cliche of metropolitan life not just in australia it 's a western phenomenon and it 's so persistent i hope it 's not true of you i hope it 's not true of your neighbours that they don 't know you but it is so persistent as a theme that it seems to me it 's a symptom of something very significant that we have to understand about what 's happening to our neighborhoods and communities and that something is that over the last 30 or 40 years australian society like western society in general has been undergoing such profound change social cultural economic technological change that our society is being reshaped in a particular way some sociologists refer to it as the atomization of society or the fragmentation of been reshaping our society and put them together you 're looking at a picture which does suggest increased pressure perhaps unprecedented pressure on communities not to function the way they used it on neighborhoods to be more atomised for people not to feel as though it 's important to know their neighbours now i don 't want to detain you for long tonight you want to have some conversation then you want to get into the serious work of the evening but i want to just take a couple of minutes to remind you of what some of these changes are so that we can quite fully comprehend why fragmentation is an increasing risk and what we have to look out for if we are as i guess everyone in the room is passionate about making neighborhoods into communities let me just run through a few of the sort of key uh changes that have been contributing to this changed picture our pattern of marriage and divorce in the last 40 years has undergone a revolutionary change up to about 30 years ago only seven or eight percent of australian family studies tells us about 35 of contemporary marriages will end in divorce unrecognizably different situation they were not here to have a seminar or divorce but simply to note that when an institution like marriage undergoes such a change and when divorce starts to be to seem commonplace where only about 60 of the marriages that take place in australia this year will be first married to this obviously that has an impact on the stability and the cohesiveness of local neighborhoods and communities marriages are not just disruptive sorry the horses are not just disruptive for the partners who split or for their extended families or their friendship circles but also for the communities that they belong to and of course for kids we live in a society now where a million independent kids about 20 of the dependent child population live with just one of their natural parents about half a million kids are engaged in a weekly or fortnightly mass migration from the home of one parent to the home of the other the custodial parent to the non-custodial parent usually this is pretty new for this kind of thing a mass migration of half a million kids is very disruptive for the kids for the parents and for the micro communities that those kids are moving in and out of and while we 're talking about kids let me mention the second major uh disrupter of community life and that is the plummeting birth now the birth rate is not at this moment plummeting in fact it 's picked up slightly in the last couple of years very very slightly people have talked about a mini baby bird and well that 's all right if you shout mini and whisper boom because what 's happened is the birth rate has staggered up from 1.7 babies per woman to 1.8 babies in the last few years this does not constitute a boom the replacement level for a birth rate is 2.1 babies per woman so we 're well below that if it were not for immigration we gradually die out at this rate and we know what a baby boom is we had one in the 15 years after the end of world war ii when exactly half out of them i 'm not inclined to pull out a bird why do i mention this well if you think about your own childhood and perhaps if you 're a parent at the childhood of your kids uh it generally turns out that children act as a sort of social lubricant in local neighborhoods the kids get to know each other in the street or in the school bus or the playground and gradually their connections create networks between their parents and other members of the community it starts with the kids and the families follow that 's the normal pattern so when we 're dealing with such a low birth rate something very significant changes that social lubricant is in shorter supply than it used to be in fact to put it in perspective relative to total population australia is now producing the smallest generation of kids we have ever produced the smallest the quietest voice of any generation of children in our history so they 're not there doing their job in such large numbers as they used to we have to compensate for that yourself sometimes take a look at two graphs the graph of the falling australian birth rate and the graph of the rising level of dog ownership in australia and of course we know because people are now quite explicit about it that the rapid increase in dog ownership is people taking on the dog as a kind of child substitute you know that they 're doing it i was told recently that couples with our children who require a dog or even a cat refer to them as their third children um i haven 't yet heard directly but i 'm told that 's now in use but they give them human names and you notice that there 's been a big change and some people say well we get to meet our neighbours when we go walking the dog we go to the dog walking park or even just walking the dog on a leash uh the dogs start playing with each other and so the dog owners get to know each other rather than the way parents used to there is this problem about having to remember whether can solve that so that 's a huge change a couple of other quick changes i want to mention the rise of the two-income household which has been dramatic in the last 30 years uh is another great social phenomenon we could we can have a whole center on the rise of the two income households but typically now in australia where there are two or more adults living under one roof and they will all be working either full time or part-time in about between 70 and 80 of cases why do i mention that well in a two-income household when it gets to the end of the week everyone 's been very busy levels of patients energy in shorter supply than they used to be people don 't have the time or the energy for nurturing the neighborhood to the same extent they 're shopping or they 're catching up with household chores another huge household change that 's had a big impact on the life of communities all around again not just australia but western society is the rapid shrinkage of our households it 's been happening accelerated in the last 30 years in the last 100 years the australian population has increased fivefold the number of households has increased tenfold so in other words we 're creating households at twice the rate we 're growing the population uh in other words our households getting smaller than the average household in australia now is 2.5 people heading the bureau of statistics tells us for an average of 2.2 and the single biggest household category in australia is the single person household accounting for about 27 of all households projected within the next 10 years to account for 30 of all households put the single person and the two-person households together and you 're well over 50 of all households if you think of the typical australian household as being mutton damn in three or four kids well these days what you 're describing there is the eccentric fringe the mainstream is a person living alone or two people living as a couple that 's where obviously there are more people living in multi-person households but in terms of the household statistics the big story is the single could talk all night about why there 's been this dramatic rise in the number of households with just one householder and what the consequences are very hard to generalize there are many pathways into solar living and there are many experiences of solar living some people have sorted and loved and see it as a symbol of independence and freedom stay in the pjs all the way again eat baked beans out of the tin no one is going to criticize you and that 's simple other people experience it as desperate loneliness and being pitchformed into it through divorce or bereavement and want to get out of it if they can but depending on their age they may be locked into it and never quite adapt to the fact that they 're living alone so sometimes it 's freedom sometimes it 's loneliness the risk of loneliness of course is greatly enhanced when we have approaching 30 of our households solo householders which is why when you draw up a list of major contemporary social issues in australia and again the same in western europe and north america even put on the list 30 years ago high on the list is low levels so here 's a huge challenge to anyone who 's interested in making neighborhoods work like communities we need to make sure that all those people who are living alone not necessarily permanently there 's heavy traffic into and out of solar households but all those people need special attention they need specialty we need to be very very sure that we 're not leaving someone behind when we 're creating neighborhood events and activities social isolation is a terrible experience for most people it can easily lead to feelings of social exclusion which can easily lead to feelings of alienation this is a warning to the rest of us we all heard that terrible story just before christmas in in sydney in another part of sydney where a man was discovered dead in his house and had been there for three months tragic but there were no family or friends who noticed that but where were the neighbors not noticing that someone had appeared for three months well a couple of other obvious things now just like americans move house on average once every six years so the stability and the cohesiveness of local neighborhoods is to some extent threatened by this high rate of mobility i was talking about this in geelong a couple of months ago and a woman in the united is it worth get to know them i think you could guess my answer yes yes their neighbors even if they 're only there for 12 months or six months they 're part of our community for as long as they 're there car ownership has taken a toll on footpath traffic and therefore on the extent to which we 're likely to bump into each other incidentally accidentally those little contacts that feed the life of a local neighborhood and there is of course one other factor i should mention you perhaps think i should have made it number one on the list and that 's the information technology revolution the fact that we have so enthusiastically embraced all the new modes of information technology has produced a paradoxical situation we now say we are the most connected we or less continuously and yet this technology makes it easier than ever for us to stay apart it 's so brilliant it 's so clever and so convenient that we are inclined to use it at the expense of the time we spend with each other now as a whole chapter in the new book on online communities i noticed there was no one getting a book signed representing the online community group but but there are people who 's who think that their social life is happening online they 're people who think they 're falling in love online the good news is that in about 90 of the cases people who fall in love online when they meet find there is no chemistry at all it still does count being in the same place at the same time a large number of research findings on this and they 're all contradictory at the moment this is also new you can find research to prove anything you want to prove about how this is wonderful uh how this brings us together and solves the problem of loneliness or how spend hours a day trawling through facebook find a better depressing experience etc so take what you like out of all the research but there are a couple of very obvious things that this does point to one is that we have begun to blur the traditional distinction between data transfer and communication we used to think that communication was something you did like this face to face where the richest part of the encounter didn 't come from the words but from the facial expression and the tone of voice and the rate of speech and the posture and the gestures and the ambience the situation all of those things communication psychologists will tell us all of those things contribute at least 50 of the meaning that we take out of an encounter so when we go online all that 's gone all we 've got is the 50 or less of the potential communication that 's just there with the words that seems to me to be a qualitatively different kind of encounter but more and more people are using it as a substitute for face to face through uh 40 years of social change and just just pause to say isn 't it pretty obvious when you put all that together what the impact would be whether we 're talking about the i.t revolution or the divorce rate or the birth rate or the shrinking of the household put all those they all point in the same direction it 's a bit harder than it used to be to maintain the stability and the cohesiveness of local neighborhoods and communities peter 's cowling university a few years ago published what i think is one of the saddest pieces of research i 've ever read was a national survey and they concluded that only 35 of australians said they trust their neighbours now what does that mean it surely does not mean that most australians are untrustworthy as neighbors surely what it means is we don 't know how that is we don 't spend enough time nurturing that special relationship called neighbour which is very different from that other special relationship to a friend or family member neighbor is a particular category and if we don 't in some way we 're all hot but if we don 't get to know the neighbours they will just seem increasingly odd as so many australians apparently do to feel as if we can 't trust them now we know that 's not the way we 're meant to live as i 've already suggested that denies our fundamental essential character as social beings we 're meant to live in communities the fact that communities are under threat of fragmentation there 's some interesting things one thing is notice we 've grabbed on to the word village village has now become one of our favorite words as though it 's the dream of how we think a neighborhood should be and as we 're losing it we 'll plant the word village on everything mossman village well it 's not village it 's a suburb camaraderie they 've got a big sign up at the shopping center in canada imagine any kind of cluster housing for people in retirement that wasn 't called a retirement village even high-rise apartment blocks which i 'm sure in a hundred years people wasn 't that 's what our humans are supposed to live but the high-rise apartment block some imaginative developers are now calling vertical villages uh kind of contradiction in terms so that 's one thing that happens another thing that happens is when people feel as though the community is a bit under threat or they 're not really connected the way they 'd like to be they become obsessed with privacy with with security and that and and that that reinforces the sense of individualism increases our obsession with things like our entitlement or our personal happiness as being the paramount thing well that 's those are not good signs one of my psychological heroes carl rogers who many of you would be familiar with roger 's work he 's written beautifully about human nature and not just towards the end of his working life said that whenever any of his clients have come to a full realization of who they are it was always to realize that they belong somewhere that their partner they 've got there 's a social context that actually defines them that who they the nearest sense seem of little consequence the crucial contributor to personal identity is a sense of social identity so recognizing that and in the context of all the things i 've been saying it 's pretty clear that we are being called on in the year 2015 to compensate for a whole lot of social cultural economic technological changes that would have the effect of keeping us apart unless we recognize the danger of this and focus on ways to get back together again in other words communities are human relationships and like all other human relationships they need work marriage you need to work friendship needs work fail to see your friends and you pretty soon don 't feel like a friend well communities are like that so how do we how do we compensate how do we make it happen and this is to my mind what is so absolutely brilliant about this gathering now it was very moving when i was inscribing the books for various organizations to get a sense of the extraordinary diversity of organizations represented in this room each of them playing a is too big to be art neighborhood but there are many neighborhoods to make these neighborhoods function more like communities and to give people who live here whether they live alone or in a house with five kids to give them a stronger sense of belonging to the place now we all need that but we need encouragement to make it happen of course we need local government to do the right thing to provide parks and cycleways and libraries uh shopping centers uh street cafes all these sort of things that we now love that encourage us to make incidental contact with each other but of course we have to go further than that we do need organizations that will bring people in we 'll encourage them to join to become part of the place and through becoming part of the bridge club or the church or the bowling club or the rsl or all those other organizations represented here to feel through the sense of belonging to the group that we belong to the place that we are actually part of this neighborhood but of course it 's bring this about and again that 's the other brilliant thing about the fact that the council has convened this meeting that the organizations themselves need to cooperate we need to be more conscious of what we 're all doing what kind of catchment areas we 're drawing on and in particular to see what potential catchment is not being catered for where are the gaps in what 's being done in mossman to give people that sense that they really belong here of course in the end the key factor in all this is each individual 's determination to make this place feel like a functioning community and that isn 't very hard it does involve things like remembering to smile when you pass someone on the footpath and we 're getting out of the habit it 's one of the things that certainly is heavily criticized for the people making an art form out of avoiding eye contact you don 't smile at strangers in the street or they might think you 're odd i 've tried this now it was a bit of an experiment in various on the other side of the harbour a few months ago i had about 10 minutes up the street i just stood on the footpath and as people went by i just said good afternoon and everyone ignored it would be a mess if someone passed you when you didn 't say hello we need to remember that and we need to remember to train our kids to do the same thing well my time 's up we need to have some conversation about this i just want to say one other thing a few years ago i did a study on why people live where they live and i 'll never forget a particular group discussion that i conducted with a group of young mothers in the suburb of mascot we don 't know where mascot is on the perimeter of sydney airport virtually surrounded by light industry not a beautiful suburb a pretty unpre-possessive sort of place and i 'll never forget this group of young mothers saying with great enthusiasm why would anyone ever want to live anywhere but mascot as though this was it and they was disparity or the north shore mascot was heaven for them why because they had created the dynamic of a village their kids did know each other they looked out for each other they knew what neighbor meant and they were playing a role which meant that mascot of all places really felt like the place where they belong well let me let me conclude by just reading a couple of sentences from the end having given you a bit from the beginning every community has its differences of opinion its social divisions and its cultural intentions which is simply to say that every community is both diverse and inescapably human if you want to master the art of belonging you 'll need to accept the imperfections and deal with them and the best way of dealing with them is to overlook them there 's a lot of tolerance a lot of forgiveness in the outer horn well why would you do it well we i don 't think i even have to raise that question to people who are as motivated as you are to make a community function couple of really good reasons one is social interaction turns out to be the best possible way of keeping dementia across words by doing crosswords are a nice ritual if you enjoy crosswords do them but as you get older social interaction is what keeps the brain alert and and keeps the benchmark but also we have to remember that the way we live it 's about creating the kind of society that we want to live in because we 're very good at bleeding about the state of the nation the state of society we have to remind ourselves the state of society starts in the street in the southern neighborhood where we live dream of the kind of society you want to live in and then start living as if it 's that kind of society well i 've been very patient mark i think is going to handle some questions so before we move to the next session so we have any questions if you want to be areas of topic like more detail on more information yes through consultation young people have indicated that they often them what would you suggest to overcome this barrier and do you have any examples of successful intergenerational initiatives yeah thanks for that by the way this is almost universal cry from younger people about older people and it 's not it 's not by any means just a contemporary problem it has been going on for some tens of thousands of years that older people do tend to be judgmental of younger people for all kinds of reasons one is that they know these young people have their lives ahead of them and they can do what they like whereas where towards the end and you know we haven 't necessarily done all the things we haven 't fulfilled all the potential so what do you mean by having all this potential it is a bit of a particular issue at the moment i think with so-called gen y um which is a generation raised in the sort of rather turbulent situation that i 've described the offspring about most of all the generation of parents a generation who got used to the fact that everything is changing all keep our options open and so on and i think older people are a bit envious of that as well you know when the gfc threatened disaster in australia a few years ago it was fascinating to me that sadly to hear so many older people say ah this will teach these this will teach this younger generation what 's what this is what they need a good crisis failing to recognize that this is a generation that 's grown up with uncertainty and was probably the best equipped generation in australia to deal with the crisis the crisis didn 't come as it turned out but that i thought was very telling so the answer as always is contact creating i mean i think it 's the responsibility of older people to get to know younger people and and to appreciate them and respect them because after all where the older people we 're supposed to take these initiatives but if we don 't go ahead invite us in i think any kind of event where you can bring the generations together to talk to each other informally to this down it happens within families it happens within a street it happens on the bus but we do need someone to take the initiative and i think it 's sad to have to say well why don 't you take the initiative but if no one else is then let mossler youth take the initiative create events which are not just for young people but which are deliberately designed to get the generations together talking um when younger people say older people are judgmental of us i think they 're right but but it 's not a new story and the first the first thing to say is to young people are you judgmental of older people maybe they sense some lack of respect or some um satirizer of older attitudes etc i mean we are we easily fall into those traps but there 's nothing like contact thank you one of the things that you mentioned was about local government facilitating uh communities and one of the challenges that we have in front of us at the moment as a community is the prospect of paris sports and perception of whether that 's uh larger councils or smaller councils would be better for developing communities i really agree with what you say in terms of building and maintaining communities is a huge challenge for uh for all kind of groups whether they 're councils governments or just streets i 'm totally totally opposed to the valve relations and i recognise the inevitability of it so it doesn 't matter whether i 'm opposed to what 's going to happen and the challenge of course is to make well let 's look at a very big example of what happens the european union there 's there 's a kind of amalgamation and what is the effect of that well a whole lot of stuff is done cooperatively and and uh throughout the union but when the union occurs the individual identities of the magma countries become even more pronounced so now that they 're in the eu the french are more aggressively french than ever before and the italian 's the same and the brits the same itself and that 's not a bad thing that 's just how have this strong sense of identity with our own tribe um so in a situation where amalgamation seem to be inevitable i think we 've got to make sure that the identity of is aggressively maintained nurtured developed within the context of whatever the larger local government area it almost certainly will mean that there will be less the local government services will be feel more remote they won 't be the same level of sensitivity to local issues but that just means there 's going to have to be a lot more local action in fact i think um uh moving beyond local government even to federal government i think at a time like the present when i 've never known people to be so despairing about the quality of political leadership in the federal area this actually brings out the best in some ways in people who say well it 's up to us i think there 's a genuine turning of the tide about the re reinvigoration of local neighborhoods and communities people being more determined to take local action to create what we want here because waived but one thing i 'm really interested in is your perspective on on the impact of the working week and the economic stress that parents face because i 've seen a change in the last 21 years since i 've been in education where working parents were not the common um you know dynamic in a school and at that stage children who were in let 's say after care were perceived as you know there 's a sort of a pitying sort of quality was not actually seeing a very positive transformation and perception of after-school care where we 're seeing kids who would normally go home and be isolated because both parents are working suddenly having community and with the new south wales new school plan there 's a shift in schools in only providing an educational um support it 's really schools becoming that social hub of connection for children and i 'm seeing a great sense of responsibility for school so is this the same embrace for future generations and certainly for us we have very strong focus on building that legacy where we would wise elders coming in and being more active mentors but um yeah i 'm really keen on your perspective on the impact of the extended working week it 's not so long ago in the 70s we had law working i think schools are more and more uh actually the two things that there 's a chapter in the new book about hearts neighborhood hubs the two big ones i think that we have to recognize are going to play an increasing role in our communal future our schools and libraries very interesting how libraries have become a sort of ideas market in most neighborhoods most libraries are undergoing massive development both in facilities and staffing as we realize they 're no longer just about borrowing books but they 're about meeting and interacting adult education kids play groups story time all this sort of stuff but school similarly i think we are beginning to understand that schools because of the nature of social change schools are no longer about children going until you 're in class and learning and then going home more and more before school and after so busy and frazzled are looking to the school to do things that we traditionally thought parents should do i did some research a few years ago on my parents why so many parents send kids to private schools and the answer was for values and discipline over the two overwhelmingly sort of top items on the list and i thought it 's a bit sad in a way but it 's a reflection of what you 're saying the hero parents saying it 's all too hard for us will pay the school to do this the very things you would have thought traditionally parents would take on was their responsibility so i mean one of the implications of what you 're saying is i think we don 't yet fully understand the extent to which the school is going to become a neighborhood i think it 's going to be not just bringing in the wise elders to do mentoring but i think that you know as the population ages they 're going to be more and more people in retirement or semi-retirement who would love to be bit of sport or or even join in the music class always wanted to learn the violin now i can you know at the age of 68 wherever they are sitting there with the kids great for the kids great for you know this thing about intergenerational tension as well but i think also increasingly we 're going to recognize that schools will have to take on some responsibility of educating parents as well about parenting about what 's going on the school understanding the nature of the curriculum all this sort of stuff all of which of course puts more pressure than ever on the staff of schools i think where as a community we 're going to have to start being much more alert and sympathetic to that thank you very much you all join me thank you for coming along _"

    "text": "I 'm Dion Watchmen I have lived in Mossman I was born in Moscow lately in cross street and Mossman and I have lived up to when I married and 56 and went to live in London for 20 years came back and of course came back to Mossman my name is Kenneth dryland I did live in Morton for many years 40 odd years and took on the job of festival director then I moved away to the country where now live in orange but Mossman is a unique place being a municipality in the peninsula in the harbour and surrounded by water which is very beautiful and has such a history and the idea of the fistful Muslim was noted in 1980 by Doug Miller who was chairman and he was a local shop owner and he was a baker and had a wonderful bakery shop the first one I think it in Moscow at that time and the inaugural festival came into fusion nineteen eighty one hundred and under my direction I was asked to do and then subsequent Festa was followed and we suggested do it from Adelaide I 've been to the Arts Festival Adelaide which was very exciting and I met a lot of people in Adelaide who were connected with their Fissel so we did a lot of talking and probing and factor a lot about so I came back all those ideas and I said to doubt about stage and in the committee this is what we should do and they said fantastic okay we 'll do it next month I said no way one year one year because if he want me to do it I 'm not going to do it in that time space because at the same time that Kenneth was on the Chamber of Commerce I had a business in Mossman with two partners and I was asked to go on the Chamber of Commerce and no idea what I was in for but anyway wonderful experience and so I did join the Chamber of Commerce and I remember that meeting very well that first one would Doug Miller and and then Kenneth then and then sort of Kenneth was taken aside I think by Doug Miller it was he was asked to be the to take over for the for the festival and so that was fine and and then Kenneth mentioned to me would I I think you asked me if I 'd go on to the committee and so I said yes and that 's where it all started Akutan ottoman had just started which was been going for a long time and it was David Prentice I 'm sure it was David and he had been in advertising and things and they had had a small promotion something like tempted more small shop in Mossman or something like that you know and he was on the chamber at that stage and this is how sort of became bigger exploded you know and I said about doing it as a fist or such rather than just a weekend promotion ting so that 's how that sort of got underway and it wasn 't only really business houses it was also people that Kenneth and I knew that would be you know enjoy to be a part of it because we will probably realized even was going to be a big thing and that we were going to have to have people as far as it went as committees went we there were there are a lot of subcommittees that didn 't and maybe one of the representatives of the subcommittee would come to the main meeting to say what had happened with them report back with them because there are so many when we looked at it Kenneth and I really looked yesterday had a good look I mean it was amazing how many things were done over those festivals so yes you know to get that all under one umbrella I was really probably the biggest thing that to do and to make sure there also that people did what they would that they said they would do really is what it boils down to and when it was first motored probably going back affection about during a festival and we had no money nothing so I went to bury O 'Keefe who was mayor and I sat in his office and sort of said you know what had happened and he looked going to be bigger than being her once we get it up and going and he said how can I help I say well we have no money so he opened his pulled out his chick walk around check for 500 and there you are and that gave us stationery to start with and then we were able to write letters and send up and Commodore Merson was a lot of units Josie wasn 't Joe Spencer they were at the head of that of organizing fundraising that was their role at that stage and read those small loans person went out and we 've got a lot of the people that he knew because they were well known animals went around a lot of those people in those Navy connections of these come on come on boys put your money you know if it 's money out and did a little so Edmund lovely they live down in Clifton Gardens they were very supportive to Ian his wife and so people like that contacts you know it also to come and we got some money to start doing things and approached business houses and one of the things that I always send still say if you 're doing something you go and see the person you don 't ring up and or you ring and make an appointment because you 're serving up and say hey look we do how about you know and going so a lot of Shula there were several shoes and going to all these business houses banks and shops real estates and all those people and on the whole everyone was very supportive some would say you know what 's a good to do for me and I said well you know you just wait and see and I said you get on the on the coattails and come along you 'll see what 's happening and then of course then Kenneth then decided that we 'd have the Social Committee we can move on to that yeah and because they were for fun that was for fundraising news and Kenneth knows more about that than I do but I know he got together good working social committee who would take on functions fashion and fashion parades and wine tastings and things like that the first opening the first the 1981 the opening that was a town hall yes yes it was a tunnel because I get bit muddled up and when the Town Hall actually closed for refurbishment but that was I remember that very well and you know just getting it off the ground it was very exciting really at that time yes it was all something really new although a lot of people said oh there used to be something like is in Mossman alarmed this is something very different come on board could put baby be part of it the lady in question was dangerous Sutherland know where she was back here in Australia and she was still performing and they were down at way our Beach their beach house and she rang me and sort of said could I go down and do her hair for something they 'll be doing one whatever night it was and I said yeah of course you should come down for lunch so I went down did all that and kinda was doing what are you doing and I said well you know about just Mossman festival and she again said do you know what you 're doing dear boy so I said well this is what we 've set out and I said no but a very special favor to ask you and she oh yes and I said I want you to be patron and she laughed her belly laugh and she sort of said well I won 't be here you know when you do it and I said whatever the year what the the month was of that search and sure well I won 't be here so that doesn 't matter when you are here if we can have your functions and things like that and she thought about you get somebody else you know and then I said no no you have to you have to do it for me and she said well I suppose I 'm paid of the Vancouver festival and I 've never been to one of this that 's it right there you are went when she opened Sullivan walk and then police station and we changed into an open Rolls Royce which I 'd requested and she had all these flowers or oh that 's always wonderful flowers so we put them on the back of the hood you know it went down and Jen got in the back and she said I was also difficult into these cars as it 's come about sit down Jeffster and we had I 'd requested a police escort so we had two motorcycle cops sir and we 've got started awfully and the next thing they were bedroom they 'd gone on their way up the indiv and Military Road notes and lobbies there and I 'd told lots of the shop owners that we were doing this drive through must they all came out and waved each time as I said you 've got to reinvent things because if you do the same thing it all becomes very ho-hum and to reinvent something different each festival really different ideas what 's the aim what he came to do and I said well again to launch a scholarship in the Performing Arts and piano player something like that you know and somebody from the area if we could possibly do that or close proximity and so that 's how that how it started and then we got got that up and going and again Dame Joan was here and I said to her that we were doing this thing and she wanted what a great thing to do and then it was Fiona James who was an opera singer or he 's an opera singer and now it 's one of the principles of Australia so she was the one that wanders and we did the said we didn 't have a town hall and we didn 't have the cinema at that stage where we had had a concert before and so I approached the Navy or might have been read that approached the Navy and we had to down a platypus in their penguin penguin thank you and and did all that and Joan came over and I did her hair and and I think she came to my house from memory anyway it doesn 't matter and and we went Mer which was one of the Queen 's day modes and it was owned by a wonderful man here in muslin who like is long gone he had two of the Queen 's diamonds and we used them in the parade and some photographs somewhere lovely lovely lovely limousines so Joan was picked up in the Queen 's Diamond ah Ken was a natural as far as we thought as far as the festival was concerned you know because he uses bright colors he he 's I I mean I love his stuff I think it 's got its fun and after all the festival has to be fun otherwise it doesn 't work so Kenneth approached him and win then and we got the first poster and of course ever since then you know for that 81 83 85 87 90 and 93 see ken was wonderful because he did that every year and then you know we had the sweatshirts and the t-shirts and then at one stage there when Bridgepoint was built which was 1990 we had up at the top of the escalators there there were to sell the things that we had for that for that year for 1990 so Ken was very obliging very it was great it was all his artwork it was all the answers I went into it and scarf as you saw and and there was all sorts of things yeah but mostly the big thing was really the t-shirts is a blue badge it is a magnet yes it 's the same logo real and the keyring yeah now that wouldn 't have been anything to do with Ken that would have been a second thing that was separate he was doing you know artwork on clothing because that was his big thing at that time as well of course because that last festival was 96 that Aaron Hill did and then of course as we know from from the history of it yes 97 was when Kenneth moved was moving and we decided that you can 't really continue something like that when the principle people are not really doing it anymore it was better to finish it on a high I think which which I felt we the pictures we seem to find more and more caravan mossman Valley Danny they gave us that I think there was well there was one in the with those pictures of in the school grounds which I think must have been something to do with the council because I don 't imagine it would particularly be in school grounds if it wasn 't something to do with the Catholic can 't remember that we had a one of our people who worked very hard on the committee Robin she in her company they had a caravan and that was the one that was up at my Agha Mews Margaret was by then that the the I 'm pretty sure that the square wasn 't wasn 't in existence then so we would have had it on the footpath up there with and where the road is and then we can see them all over the place there was one there was one of the oval and then I noticed that had a lot of the t-shirts and everything in themselves and also miles Felsted of course was very interested in with one of this spans the Scott he was also involved in and it started at Dan of Rawson Park and in those days my parents were still in a house and cross street there and we used the house and I can see my mother sitting on them on the swing the swing seat on the house watching everything happening and started there he assembled at all there my sister Jo Spencer she was my sister she was very involved and then they only when did their way into military road and down and in those days it would have been into my Agha Road yes yes yes laughing you say talking my Agha road with one of the first second or third Grand Parade and Mars was good that was his baby to do that and so many people came aboard and the Navy Band then we had the Army Band the pipe band and we had the City of Sydney band at one stage and the City of Sydney Town Crier he preceded the thing and was again which is they were big things you know and and I thought this would be a great idea to have something a bit different so I rang a double-a of bass at Richmond and I said to them mother and I said oh yeah what you all about you know that 's it we want to fly past and I said he said what and I said a fly past I said we were doing this festival Mossman and we are the first municipality within the City of Sydney to hold a festival and we were and he said leave it with me mate and I get back so anyway so later the phone hanging there was flat sergeant every was and yeah yeah we 're taking us on board we 've got four F when he 'll Evans here and fantastic and what days it was it 's Saturday moment and it starts at whatever was he lived in the coffee wasn 't it started the parade they said well muster over Sydney and right on cue the parade was coming up Military Road these four if when he livens screamed at military very low tech gone like said my reason right got on the map we turned left at my garage had the road map out that was that was a lot of fun but it was great you know everyone was cleaning the necks of these things and then the parade went on but the parades parades were great they were good and then got a lot of people on board a lot of people who had floats and things like that you know and the zoo came on board with some ideas and things like that one stage I were supposed to smoke to somebody do a muppet and they we tried to think of yesterday Oh she was she was a public relations and I spoke to her she was a great buddy into went to her and sort of said about this and had spoken to somebody else he said that 'd be fantastic we 'll get the elephant out on a float him we get the giraffes and we do this let 's say she said what okay so wonderful Co buddies have the elephant on the float coming up military room happen it didn 't happen and we had I think yes we do have an open day thing at the zoo yes and we had a band down the band 's down on this stage and he said they got involved which was good we had the freedom of Mossman from middle Harbor Yacht Club took a bit of grinding into the water to get them to do what are you all about to anyway eventually we 've got quite a lot of boats together and with flags and banners and decorated and they came from around there around soon we were onto the island at Balmoral and where we had yes we had that was actually they look fabulous yeah well they weren 't many because we were sailors to see so but was through the cruising division of Mitchell Harvey Oakland but they worked many of us there were probably about 15 maybe Birds but when they came around that headland it looked so great because they had all the flags I was that we would in daylight it was so that they could be seen and then were at under now this was when my sister was was very involved was when Joe say with Joe was doing it and I loved it because she had the music we are sailing and really the goosebumps I can 't tell you with the boats coming along flags and the we are sailing was so exciting it really was and then they came around into the past the island between the island and where the bars are and we I don 't think you could do it anymore but we 've had our anchors down there they 're a whole lot of us were there and then the fireworks of course at that time came from the island yeah so we were in amongst all the fireworks and then we got permission like dinner to let off our Rockets you know we have distress rockets Odyssey and so we did get permission to do it though because you 'd have to get permission and there were these Rockets flying on up from all the boats and inbound I don 't think Batman has ever seen it then still talking the Town Hall and they had the bright idea Kenneth and there was another man called Philip of putting the using the roof of the bomber or bar a lot more bars roof because that hadn 't been refurbished by then that hadn 't been done and so they called it revels yeah and it was all very Indian and mysterious and they were I think there were people with baskets pretending snakes or come in and all that sort of thing and and the fireworks were very good they had it on the look and I look back and if they must have had it on the back of the bar on the boss they had a festival of Mossman no ma Mossman festival was they say and that all came and that was a wonderful night it was supposed to be like you know the direction Singapore a beautiful night and the Navy band were playing and also we had the Navy chaplain there and occasionally they do the ceramide Lessing the flag and they did this which was lovely they had the drums and things there and and sprinkle water over and bless the flag which was lovely it was a nice little change you know from everything else and the Navy played on and we party then we had a reception down at Ashton Park in the old Hall there before it was anything like it is today and Dame Joan came to that and they had no power and easy location and it was very rickety and we couldn 't do this you couldn 't do that you know when we got a generator from somebody rather and it was planted way down in the tree so I was in court too much nonsense and we had lights because it was a late in the afternoon Twilight and Dame Joan derives in limousine Rolls Royce and we had flares all the way down the path and we had a pipe out and she was piped in because she was great sausage lady a pipe Doon which was wonderful and we had this wonderful reception there and it was beautiful looking back to the city which is a great view from there we had a funny there to speak to the caretaker and you know we were just saying we wanted to have this and he turned around he said well you can 't dance I said and he said ah I can 't dance because the floor was how many people you having and you recognized it was all what we were doing was because have been way out there I suppose with a lot of these people you know no you can 't_''_1398.33 do this you can 't_''_1399.02 do that and also just talking venues Scott 's perfect course which was sort of a we used Chawan Castle and they had two piano recitals there was John champ and then we had I think you know what see you after another year we had nigel net on his appearance and they were very popular with we tried to do we did do be organized a fair I think we did organize a ferry to take people around to chowin this was a terrible test to park it was the thing parking yeah yes they did you know people arrived on the ferry and we was very nice that was that was great down on the tennis court yes yeah it was a lot of fun this we had a window decorating serve the municipality you know which was great and a lot of the shops came on board and did that you know a lot of them with a poster as a stage set I suppose you 'd call it meant go from there with all but everything you know what are we going to do I said well it 's up to you you know you 're the shop owner you 've got stock and do do things with them and they did which was great and we had was those days to you really yeah yeah he lived in Austin and he did that and we had great personalities like Bob Rogers Steven who judged the sand cut one of the sandcastle competitions and Bob Rogers did several things being a local and then we also did talky of him he came on board literally we did a ferry trip from here to the Opera House to cocktail party launched at the some of I think was Ken Dan 's work was there and a wonderful lady called sandy to buy she 's still in muslin she had great she 's an artist and she had a furniture shop in Avenue Road and I think she had one somewhere else in cash it might be in cash a someone and she did I when we were doing one of the big concerts in the Town Hall if she would do a backdrop for me of Dame Joan and I gave her a photo ahead of journey and she said oh yes yes I think it 's a mighty thing to ask whether it 's got to be a backdrop and larch over to hang down the back of the screen the stage and she did it on calico cause it was a great thing of calico and she did this thing and you have at the council heaven and it 's stunning charcoal and we did this and tamed his shoppers quite closer to me a couple shops where anyway Dame Joan was coming in to have her hair done in Avenue 've got a special oh yes she said I said this has been done if you would like to sign up so we unravel this she 's married got it guys I like the red carpet it was it 's really long huge thing and quite wide and it is really very very good that was so good that was in the town hall and a friend of mine who worked with me he knew people in Lagos and he said leave with me I said that 's okay that sounds fun and that I said but now we 've got to be very careful because I said you know people can get a little bit embarrassed sighs but thank you this probably the word and I said okay because they were sent you know fantastic group and a lot of glitter and feathers and things I said so long as they do not bear their chest what do they do came on a wolf feathers and glitter and high kicks and the exact it was one I bought the house down rather down as I 'm mixing about the

thought it was well then one day the cast enjoy so much and and Betty was cheering and because he had the mayoral chain on at the end of it all I can 't think of the name of the leader of the the cars at this stage can 't thing anyway okay it came down all Stage one thing a mix but they believe with all the offenses and things like that and he said to Barry said I love your change fantastic I 've

know Mitchell the wisdom Bobby so and so ever ended in the toilet trying to get out the toilet window and this friend of mine down conservativism the mastership it was in tails and with all these kids and he said it was an absolute lie of these kids he 's I had no idea they had so much energy and sorts of escape trying to get out we had to lock the doors I said I probably wouldn 't be able to do they want to get out from the street and so they 're all in this and the doors were locked and then the pizzas came and I think took a rock cake smaller so well then they started throwing them and they were like frisbees up into the parachutes and on the on the floor and jumping on the skating well you can imagine the Town Hall so we had buskers because I remember me myself approaching somewhere in Sydney if something I thought they were fantastic and gave them the dates and they came and they 've asked you know and did that and we had those in the ground played we had those things on still true that found from somewhere over they came there was a lot of fun you know and again it presented something different each time and we introduced later on food and mine down at Balmoral which was on the off here again to sort of keep the festival alive and something different and they were very successful with food stalls all along the Esplanade and it then bought in all the restaurants go you know promotion thing and lot and came on board with that which was fantastic they were very successful and of course now I think mad she doesn 't much to say to me you know world if you were going to do something in the festival ever dinner have a a jazz pianist or somebody playing a piano or trumpet America there 's a bit of fun which happened and then we we did again from that we did the art crawl rather than a pub crawl we did this art crawl which was a great great thing and we had I think we had a government bus then we had small school buses and pickup at Balmoral people could park their cars there and then get on a bus and go we did a quite a few little art galleries so they all did things with wine and cheese and biscuits and things okay and people playing on very thick flutes from Toddlers what did all their net worth that was a lot of fun I 've written down names who have people like like deist Giles festival committee he was fantastic again with his context and things and another chap called David Robinson who had a coffee shop here he was he was great was up opposite where Moss mania was little driveway down there in the back very good and he was very supportive very helpful and Mars of course another guy called Lindsay Bennett who was the helper Louise Cullen who did the sand castle and Suzy Barnes who was I asked her to be my hostess and I was a photograph machine and I and the merson 's that the one of the openings and she was very gracious lady and did all that and sue Blakely Robin Bayliss who was with the first Caravan and did the gold whales was and then we had the festival 's Social Committee which was headed by Silvia Merce and it was a great client of mine and they were very supportive she got together Belinda Martin Betty main argument and cath Henderson whose husband was a retired Army colonel and he and read sort of got together was one of the first about the army a lady called joy Purcell who had boat Aquila got up where the cinemas there she was very kind as she gave me a few of her shop mannequins for the first Oprah costumes yeah she was in this in the cinema building in here she was there for years but people like that and decor glass who gave us the gold whale we presented today and Joan she gave us that which was wonderful Mossman designs shop Anna Marie Williams and it still is on the corner opposite the which what had was then the old Mossman Hotel Mossman design shop lilac bush which was very supportive they gave us lots of things chef chirchi beach his restaurant queen with school miss Midway of course and mrs. sands I mentioned about the badges and a man called Oscar Feenstra who helped us to meet in the beginning he helped us tremendously he was something to do with the kitchen he was great so all those people that were just fantastic helpers and they knew other people so other people come on board and did lawyer so we 'd rolled 1982 which was a great surprise I remember max Clark was ringing me and saying about this and it was very hush-hush don 't tell anybody was like getting an order from the Queen comes out and then it came up which was a great honor and I said well I 'm very honored but I said really it 's my you know it 's the committee that have done all 's helped and Gordon said no without you at the helm I wouldn 't have happened and I said no no so here it is here with the seal of the common seal of the Council of Mossman 23rd day of February 1982 and the council you know was what were very supportive of us which was wonderful I mean they will you don 't do anything like that without having the counsel behind you because it 's so very important that they are as you would say on board as well because they were just great and that was made a big difference as far as the festivals concerned because you know we could particularly Kenneth could go and I hopefully hope people enjoy us in the future what 's beneficial and may it long survive and carry on although in a different form today as to when we do but carry on _"

    "text": "thank you very much and good evening everybody I 'd like to begin by just asking you to cast your minds back to the 20th of March I 'm sure you recall the 20th of March this year we were celebrating do you remember what you were celebrating world happiness that wasn 't that the day when you went about telling everyone to cheer up was that perhaps the day when you tried to pretend just for one day that there were no shadows falling across your life but there are no bereaved months no life threatening illnesses no friends who disappoint us no relationships that fall apart perhaps you celebrated by chanting that mantra of positive psychology there glass-is-half-full_,_63.229 how do we know the pessimists are supposed to say the glass is half empty I 'm drawn to the view of the engineer who looks at the glass and says that glass is exactly twice as big as it needs to be that 's not a bad starting well happy to say perhaps you ate more yogurt my brand of yogurt boldly proclaims on the pack happy inside happy know that is specifically about really good but food is a great source of feelings of happiness and contentment and pleasure we know the blue is strongly influenced by food in fact a recent huge study into the behavior of a Parole Board found that prisoners coming before the parole board after lunch have statistically significantly significantly better chance of being to parole the nurses who came before the ball before so if you ever find yourself in this situation make sure you get an afternoon appointment we have world menopause day well I 'll tell you why not because the pursuit of happiness as its evolved in Western society seems to be to have become one of the great distractions from the good life Emily happens emily happier that well am I feeling like this until I suppose to be happier than this what I had I having more fun whatever happened to happily ever after isn 't happiness supposed to be one of the symptoms of the good life well there 's nothing wrong with that list of questions that I just raised and we all ask ourselves but to be relentlessly concerned about your emotional state and in particular whether it 's positive whether you 're feeling happy in other words to become obsessive in the pursuit of happiness is to miss out on the thrill of what it really means to be human and the richness of all the emotional experience the experiences that are available to us as humans as it 's popularly defined happiness is just an emotion it 's just a feeling one among me and yet we are in the West and specifically in Australia at the moment inclined to give happiness this privileged status we neglect the spectrum we forget there are many of the so-called dark emotions like disappointment failure loss actually have much more to teach us than the bright shiny but essentially fleeting ephemeral emotions like happiness and bliss and you forward of course our folklore reminds us that the dark stuff is vital the folklore says doesn 't it we grow through pain and then when we experience the emotional pain let 's have another drink let 's pop up here let 's work something in order forget that we 're being taught something you remember James Magnus of the Australian swimmer who failed so spectacularly in front of the worldwide audience at the London Olympics in the men 's really and you probably also remember that a day later Magnusson said I 've learned more about myself in the last 24 hours and in the previous 24 years well we know what he means now this of course does not mean that we want to wish sadness or loss or failure or disappointment on ourselves or on our children no one except a particular kind of neurotic goes in search of trouble in search of suffering we don 't hope to fail so that we can learn the lessons of flavour but we just need to recognize that we 're human and we will fail all of these experiences and all of these emotions will come to us in their turn and they will come to our children which is why I get profoundly irritated when I hear parents particularly parents of young children saying I just want my kids to be happy well of course referring to the Aristotelian concept of happiness the engine dude ammonia which is translated roughly as happiness in modern world and that word meant being engaged with the life of the community fulfilling your duty as a responsible citizen sacrificing yourself to the common good engaging with the full rich or human love and friendship these were the terms that Aristotle was using what we know about the full richness of human love and friendship don 't we there 's a lot of pain and a lot of disappointment as well as a lot of joy and happiness so if that 's what parents me and they say I just want my kids to be happy on the world for it but I fear that is not what they mean I feel what they mean is that they want their kids to experience the emotion we call happiness and if that 's what they mean and of course I 'd like to grab them by the shoulders and shake them till their case rattle because I 've been wanting to say that really you want your children to experience this the bright stuff you don 't want them even to understand happiness by experiencing the contrast with sadness and disappointment of all those things of course we don 't want our children to be miserable but to say I just want my children to be happy is a really proper thing to say we know what just happy is like I 'll bet everyone in the room has been through periods of being just happy it 's called dysfunctional this is not a good state for people to be informed to in fact there 's a very interesting research about the relationship between decision making and judgment and I attended a couple of years ago I spoke of the happiness pockets why they invited me to study and I happiness conference I don 't know they knew my views anyway the speaker who preceded me said next time you 're going to your doctor to get a diagnosis give your doctor some chocolate the chorus really all the mates that I guess who lived and moved and then I read some research published soon after value diverted yourself what I they 're just feeling a bit being when they 're just not feeling happy when they just feeling either neutral or a bit negative so I thought chocolate is exam never given my doctor chocolate that seems to be quite the wrong thing to do but happiness is really one of a cluster of keywords which includes words like self esteem and excellence and even perfection which are really little symptoms of what I described in the new book as a Western disease which I called the Utopia complex this is the neuroses that life could be perfect driven by fantasies of perfection perfect teeth I mean this is the perfect time in our cultural evolution to be an orthodontist everybody knows that to be straight and white regardless of their age perfect British beginning to cosmetic surgery that 's that 's a good business to be anything more perfect lattes perfect kids perfect marriages and if the marriages are a bit imperfect then of course perfect divorces everything has to be positive positive outcomes this is the kind of utopia complexes now you think I 'm exaggerating well not 'm very proud not to have written it comes from a book which you may have read probably haven 't appeared in the book like this one you wouldn 't have read that one but the book is called was stolen before the car published in 2011 and this is a verbatim this is a sentence from the book the faction of life is to recreate yourself a new in each golden moment of now in my next grandest version of the greatest vision you ever held about who you are but I read that and I thought well this utopian view of life it 's become hyped up you sign a credit card Bachelor and the waiter looks at this and says fantastic as they negotiate an awesome weekend weekend story with well the victims of all this utopia complex our of course our kids and our grandkids region we can swallow our disappointments we can cope with the realization that we 've made fools of ourselves by chasing these serve and unreachable goals we can sneak off to the therapist in search of a reality check but our like imagine growing up in the utopian imagine growing up as anyone under the age of 30 has grown up in a culture in which everyone is praised for everything gold stars self-esteem is the great currency self-esteem is the great gift we can bestow our children whereas we know there 's a very big difference between self esteem and self respect self esteem doesn 't have to be under total anyone can experience self esteem if someone keeps on telling them how wonderful they are even if they know they 're not they can get carried away with this little delusion that everything is fantastic and that they are special and they 've been marching into a triumph for the future well of course this sets them up for disappointment it it sets them up for the will bewilderment and in the sense of something missing perhaps even having failed their parents a wonderful article appeared in the Atlantic at the end of 2011 and I 've quoted it in the board written by an American psychotherapist the article is called how to land your kid in therapy and in the vanguard of this generation who have been constantly told they 're special and given rewards and prizes for everything and now coming to adulthood they 're discovering sometimes you get a C or even an F in an exam and your boyfriend ditches here and there are days or weeks and you just feel a bit blue and it doesn 't seem to be quite as glorious as your parents told you it was going to be and so you 're a bit disappointed or puzzled and you 're also wondering whether you 've let your parents down well that 's in Seligmann that the high priest of positive psychology many of you love ribbon segments work and by the way this is not an attack on positive psychology it has a very important part to play in forgiving people who are suffering from depression and other forms of mental illness can benefit from some of the techniques of psychotherapy from positive psychology but for the population at large it carries some very serious hazards anyway Seligmann in his most recent research has retreated very significantly from this people his latest the latest paper revisited I 've come across has drawn the very controversial conclusion that the best predictor of success in high school is actually self-control self-discipline and Sullivan says it 's self-control not the surface dating and in fact he says self-control is a better predictor of all-around success at high school than like you well that 's a very different story and there 's a story which is beginning to emerge and yet we persist with this utopian madness and in particular with the idea that happiness is the sovereign emotion of the fourth position why would we give any emotion that status we wouldn 't say sadness is the sovereign emotion would be any any emotion we emotions are actually very easy to manipulate preachers do it advertisers do politicians to parents that lovers do it composers do it actors do it poets do it not hard to manipulate people 's emotions you can manipulate your own emotions by going to a movie that will make you cry or laugh and if you can 't manipulate your emotions in any other way well there emotional response that you 're searching for and it 's no accident that the burgeoning so-called recreational drug culture has coincided with the rise in the happiness industry well an important stepping stone to the good life is the realization that it 's not happiness but hold us the ability to identify respect except perhaps even embrace the full spectrum of emotions that come to us and learn from them all and from the contrasts between them now describe happiness as the red distractor from the good life that are of course many other distractions addictions of everytime it will distract us addictions to anything from gambling or alcohol to sex or information technology the quest for certainty will distract us because there is no certainty an obsession with the future people are constantly thinking about the next thing and what 's going to happen things half-living the future that would distract us from the good life and the present Philip Larkin being this program wonderful poem called next please some of you familiar with this I 'll just read you a few lines from next please always too eager something is always approaching everyday till then we say it is a distraction it 's a lovely story about the obsession of the future and I 'm concerned in Kenneth arrow he was an American economist won the Nobel Prize for economics and in World War two as a young man Kenneth arrow was working as a weather forecaster for the US Air Force and after some months of working in this role he invited a statistician to look at the accuracy of the weather forecasts and the statistician came to the conclusion that the forecasts were no more accurate than numbers drawn out of a hat at random so faced that the evidence arrow looked to his superior officer and said the forecasts are useless no better statistically in random numbers so we wish to be relieved of this task and the reply that arrow received was the commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good however he needs them for planning purposes respective coordinate some of you who work for organizations that were won on forecast well the future can distract us the quest for life as a section in the book that encourages you to call life the quest for the meaning of life not the meaning of your own life but the meaning of life with well the endless quest to find yourself all of these things little obsessions that can distract us so if it 's not about any of that if it 's not about an emotional state what is they would like of course you can define good in more or less any way you lack of the term the good life is used in a lot of different what we do use it economic they don 't really say the good life is a life of prosperity and comfort and economic security or we define it in emotional terms and say the good life is feeling good having a good time so well I 'm not talking about any of that I 'm talking in the moral sense of the word good so the good life is alive about goodness it 's a life that 's morally right is a life that 's devoted to the common good now of vignettes little miniature short stories about various people but I 've known personally or encountered in my research just to illustrate the themes at the book and I 'd like to just read you a short extract from one of those stories about Vanessa for 20 years vanessa has been reading about the Sandwich Generation and now at 45 finds herself in the thick of it young teenage children still heavily dependent on her her own increasingly frail parents relying on her for advice support reassurance and even companionship a husband who adores her and expects his fair share of adoration in return with the children schedules become even more complicated than her own Vanessa Thames running the household a daily challenge her husband tries to be supportive but he 's never been fully domesticated though it has finally mastered the art of school lunches when vanessa has a full-time job that she wouldn 't give up for anything raised by an enlightened mother to be the truly liver woman Vanessa bevels in the knowledge that she is living a rich fall is slightly over complicated life and that but her energy levels are depleted and she 's beginning to feel desperate there are times when her so-called liberation feels just like another form of enslavement she 's becoming almost obsessed by the void of the spectrum a Buddhist retreat perhaps or a spa resort even a short stay in hospital seems attractive provider of associate eccentric the conventional family holiday wouldn 't do the trick that 's usually more work than staying at home one thing Vanessa wouldn 't say about her life is that she 's having a good time she and her husband go out occasionally always enjoy themselves though he falls asleep in movies and if they have dinner they seem to have trouble sustaining a conversation about anything other than their kids or their parents life isn 't meant to be like this Vanessa sometimes mutters to herself I never expected happily ever after but I did expect to be getting more fun out of life I expected to have more time for me well someone needs to explain to the NASA the difference between a good time and a good life and to is that she is precisely the kind of person who makes the world go around this is a very good life indeed but it 's out of that she does need more time for herself she does need to take up Pilates or yoga or join a book club or something not to indulge herself to equip myself to refresh herself in order to fulfill her destiny because she 's a human being and therefore the destiny used to be engaged to be living in life for the people who need her and she 's doing that she 's a loving and dutiful daughter she 's a responsible parent a lawyer wife a good citizen a conscientious yes you 've got to make some adjustments but broadly speaking Vanessa is an example of the guru life because the central truth about rudeness in our life has to be others that is the good life is the life for others now I 'm not making that as an assertion I 'm not expressing that doesn 't opinion I 'm going to offer you a logical proof of the proposition that the recept my first premise then I 'll lead you to the inevitable conclusion just ask yourself what is the most powerful force for good in the world what 's the most fruitful the most created the richest source of goodness in the world and I 'm sure the answer you would come up with his life not love as an emotion not live as a feeling but love as a motivation live as a guiding principle live as a sort of foundation for our lives and of course by love I mean charity compassion kindness respect tolerance all of those things which we see as manifestations of this motivation and to be loving so the first proposition the first premise in the argument is love is the source of goodness the second premise it is based on the proposition that love makes no sense in isolation initial analysis you can 't_''_1492.31 be leaving a nothing life unless you 're engaged with other people one of these have been helping me and others I 'm giving you and receiving in relationships in the context of families friends communities neighbors and qualities second premise love is about engagement it 's about relations conclusion the brutal life is a life for others it 's a life about engagement it 's a love that it 's a life in which love is given and received and again romantic love excluding that but I 'm talking about a loving motivational loving disposition what else a good life be about than that we 've been sold a very silly story about human nature particularly over the last 25 30 years where it 's kind of being generally accepted in the Western tradition that we are selfish creatures by nature and everything we do is self-interested but even if you appear to be behaving altruistically that 's really just to make yourself feel better you have a frail old person across the road but well it seems to me when you look at the evidence about how we humans operate then is just rubbish we are altruistic species yes we are selfish yes we can be aggressive and violent and ugly and we the same people can be extraordinarily compassionate caring kind and loving towards other people north coast a couple of weeks ago who on his surfboard paddle over and saved someone else on the surfboard who was being attacked by a shark and what did he say when he got to shore and inevitably the journalist Charlie my co-founder in his throat and he said anyone would have done and that 's what heroes always say isn 't it I 'm not sure about me you see someone in difficulty jumping you don 't tell them that get mad there 's a child saying did not your charge at any child you pick up or what that 's fourth man you don 't just need God for the money some people do but most of us look for the owner of the water that is just we are we volunteer we care for people who are not around but who were total strangers I was talking about this a couple of nights ago in original city and the woman in the audience said yes my mother is a very frail elderly mother and she 's almost blind she gets around the town with a matchstick helped across several streets that she never intended to some people take refugees into their homes and help them to learn English and find a job thinking as well but that 's who we belong to each other and we know that instinctively it 's a genetic truth about us Carl Rogers my psychological hero the founder of the client centered therapy school of psychotherapy said that in his consulting he said in his consulting room when people came to a realization of themselves what they realized was that they are essentially social creatures not individuals that they finally can make sense of their lives in the context of their relationships and that 's of course true so the good life is about us and others and that its heart lies the most ancient wisdom of all which I don 't really even have to say I 'm sure just in your head if you go back to the ancient Egyptians grips the Chinese follow the religious strands through Judaism Christianity Islam sorrow asterism Hinduism Buddhism all the way through to a cc grayling and the modern secular humanists they about how the good life is expressed in in human society and of course their principle which used to be called golden rule is simply that we should treat other people the way we would like to be treated a lot of exceptions to that and in the book I deal with justice has to be served fairness tempered not everyone wants to be treated the way you would like to be treated you have to know whether it 's appropriate colonial powers have made all kinds of mistakes through history by treating other people the way they 'd like to be treated without establishing what the culture gaps might be but broadly speaking every philosophical and religious tradition in human history tells you that that is the conclusion and you didn 't need any of that to tell you did you you just have to sit under a tree ten minutes and think about how a community can best work how can a society function how can a human society thrive and you soon figure out that it will only work if we treat each other the way we treat everyone else we take everyone else seriously because we ourselves would like to be taken seriously well if we did like that social politics should be transformed does it seem completely beyond the bounds of possibility that politicians would treat each other the way they would like to be treated that they would treat people on the other side of the chamber with the respect they think they deserve seem just a short stamp doesn 't it for that but that 's a step that seems difficult to take business professional sport family life community life all of this would be transformed if we adopted that central principle that leads us to remark well it is hard because there is this tension we are selfish as well as surface we are competitive as well as property and it 's all the question of what solution is what we choose to nurture in us and what we choose to nurture in our children if you 're looking for an example of how derailed the concept of the good life has become in modern society just look at that ancient proverb the street in fact I should ask everyone in this audience what they what does that what does the father charity begins at home name in the modern world we tend to say oh it means first look after your own and then when you 've got that sort of then you can start to be kind and generous to other people be amazing wouldn 't it if ancient wisdom had fed us that as a principle that 's not what it meant at all the origin of the product that should perhaps of being translated as charity begins in my home in other words children have to have their charitable impulses their archers and their kindness and at home or else these impulses may never be there 's a proverb about child rearing there 's not a thought about be selfish first and then be surplus again I heard someone in discussing this concept in the last couple of days saying that she is she short tortured Burchard her children in this way and she used to drop them at school and say I don 't have anything else and then when they got a bit older and were able to catch the bus she screwed them in with a proposition that if any older person got on the bus you must get up and give you a sip of the other bus and soon after a very old man go on the bus today and Billy jumped up and offered him his seat the bus was empty well I hope the old man took Billy to reward that behavior of course there are temptations constantly thrown in our path not probably the good life and not to live according to the golden rule but to embrace the materialist ethic or to pursue happiness as if s all that matters but all of that will distract us so that 's the rule life that this book is not just another analysis of contemporary society although there is plenty of that in it and it 's not just a philosophical argument that I offered you tonight although that 's in there too but it 's a bit unusual to me in that it 's really an appeal to us to attention to goodness in our lives in our communities the play more attention to the moral value the meaning we attach to our backers and I 'd like to conclude just by reading a couple of sentences from the poster and then over to you I say this the greatest monument to any of our lives will not be in stone but in our living legacy the influence we have had a lot of people and every point of connection with the human family you don 't have to be rich to leave a positive legacy you don 't have to be intelligent famous powerful or even particularly well organized let alone happy you need only treat people with kindness compassion and respect knowing they will have been enriched by their encounters with you _"

from his cage and the postman thought that 's absolutely dangerous apparently so unfazed he walked up the driveway and stood next the parent looked at in the eye at which point it screeched killing Riggs why penny the lucky dog yeah just stabbing 't know about how these things work of being all throughout any werkstatt alone the body works which your contributed where did the idea of publishing come come come from I 've always wondered why there hasn 't been a biography of either or both became these things in some prominent you know I mythology for so many so many years it 's 80 odd years since what purpose and was first published unbelievably and we all used to a lot of us used to identify our boots in the early days because there was nothing nothing else that was affordable workmen so and i also like gotten when i went to university I got a candy scholarship which was set up by the Sun to our Father using some of the royalties from this book and then help you with life you research for my PhD so I sort of thought I owed in the beautiful and then I started writing books for the National Library and discovered i have a marvelous collection of a que aburrido Kaylee 's father and son there was the opportunity it wasn 't your connection with her society could you to talk us through the process of the journey from german idea to to realization of work please data in God 's turning on your computer so much I 'd as more and more comfortable knowing all the time in an access genealogical information from overseas from England lives once you have to go over there yourself manually turn through all the records so what more and more honest is up dying but also it 's Allison said you know try to pick the relatives and people who people like David Kenny fans only collect us just issue every avenue that 's part of the fun the thrill of the chase and all that and in that regard as part of your research did you know the other thing that particularly surprised you about the coatings that you weren 't expecting yes I know I suppose here i think i was very surprised at how much never when you did the Sun absolutely pretty to 730 August angry bull talks managing and exhibitions and just that was a big surprise and I guess guess quality of their works very considerable on the subject of kaylee senior observes that he arrived in Melbourne in 1877 with a background in silk making did he fall into art work shortly after his arrival that something was developed over a period told him yes I what I wasn 't able to find out about his early life because he seems like he fled the family Katherine wealthy Norwich handing of silk merchants and he started training it as apprentice in another firm and and he and his brother it seems like they did a bump to Australia and fell out with the family and change their names Ivy when they got here yes so he 's I presume he went to a good school and study drawing and things about he seems to have hit the ground running when he got here very soon after he arrived here Roberta silly stories antiqued the newspapers are not necessarily birds at that point did you search inform how he developed his makeshift particularly bird oh I think it was sort of natural selection that 's what people at my to be in a landscape success is glowing yeah so do you think that society at the time promoted his pursuit of bird art he was catering to a market I think he was yes was a time when there was more wealth the gobble pressure something that people could afford to buy painting and hanging on the wall and you 're a sportsman you like Tessa 's sort of trophy painting swords with a unfortunate birds falling out of the sky go to which we probably don 't quite a group of these days but or hanging curing in a ladder with a blood dripping from them but um yeah so I think you found a ready market and also there was increasing private or things Australia then also lead up to a federation and we were becoming more proud valve is home and you know static for nightingales and things like that so much enormous body of his work evolved as you say shot things either in the act of being shot or as a result of being shot and how the models and the like was that makes that yeah fabulous because this little genius Nichols didn 't pursue that sort of art at all about the new exterior Lee country as many as cover yes yes was no longer acceptable but that time too they realize the world is an endless just yeah and I suppose by name in the early days to Kelly was always institute i think the birds were

you wanted to do like this Oh both bird lovers and wished everybody else was an okay it was actually Katie senior idea to do techniques for publishing especially in color which is so important for bird identification there just to Astarte he did a little quirky could have seven or so illustrations in it and he prepared a whole lot more but they were actually photographs and our hand colored and he did it himself in an aquarium that the publishers fish but yes as you can imagine that 's a terribly painful way to make a whole name Foxman didn 't happen and I was left to son to realize the dream when us I have had the privilege of reading and his work you 'll see that in the works of cali senior his accepted hanging on kitchen greece 's his birds are rarely drawn casting shadow why is that um well I 'm not an artist but I believe it 's because you work from flat schemes and is in the literature I wanted in thankful while so doing your art technically yeah so then you could see it in the portraiture my livestock so I think he just didn 't really know how my fellow and of course in those days I went binoculars and digital cameras so we have this place that preserves do you had he seen it was wait why do we can play 20 questions i do but i wasn 't able to elevate about and I think you mentioned you bought that his plagiarizing who may have been told flounders will flavor his copies were often been abroad than the senior himself now does that mean that we clipped it should be proud to have a thing I finally I was heavy senior I believe there 's a connection with this very venue hospital library in Kobe 's leading after that bottles yes stretching it a bit but donut daughter actually told me if that wasn 't something I found out myself to get mossman public school when it opened and all the entrance hall or something was filled with Camus the works of kaylee 's I don 't know how that came about he was that was a year after he 's dead so perhaps older dovin or someone donated them as a collector donated and the other connection is with jr. which is through taronga zoo controversial director of the zoo back in those times to end with holstrom in the manufacture of the soul of love it that 's how he made his move here once other things it 's meant to be a bit of a smuggler of rare parents and its employees but because it was such a great benefactor people turned a blind eye and some one of the people eSport it was Kenny Jr and he paid for a set of parents to be Royals a logical side and also a second set which has gone to me you go be donated to the National Library in Brooklyn retreat forms the body of Heath up adhesive works in the library 's collection but he also helped jr. out when he was both counties even though they were hugely popular they they died with next to nothing so opposed to also helped Katie jr. for things of his life pleasure wasn 't able to probably well turning now to our to Neville jr. did he his father died of 48 when Neville was only 17 years of age was Neville jr. painting at that time or did his interest in art develop subsequently songs death I have partly directly evidence of that but he certainly went out into the bush Aboriginal companion find some evidence for that but he didn 't seem to start with no public evidence evidence of his painting acceptability counselor for what painting Billy cuts artistic perhaps after a week and he could have held in herriman encouraged him to start up but it wasn 't really resolve surfing time on the beach wasn 't really until he was in his thirties only two adult their vengeance and do we know whether other cathartic moment ease of was it pursuing other interests that caused him to fall warm or into not just bird up his well known to eat later works for mammals fish study Eleanor 's body work outside that have just Birds on wife yourself I think we found the Nisshin end them so the world of science to seek to be more proud of the artistic world and as politte artistic where we belong to the Society of artists and was his work was selected for his show by galleries and but the Sun never seemed to sort side of things and conservation and I think when the gold league up going you 've had a bit of a nation so you think his like his father who kind of living would you agree that there were juniors works were driven by his other person feels etching illustrating passions for conservation ornithological accuracy yes george robinson robertson appears probably appears prominently in the life of nipple jr who was he and what was his publishing house George started published publishing house and ended up running in himself east and early childhood ship partnership with Angus but Angus dropped out fairly early and George was a great supporter of Australian talent again at a time when a lot of the South Australians redford written book in England and normal astern eggs were of an English and the information we got desires and things came from england george was a great supporter of Australian artists and poets and said lay gives you took my kids under his wing and henry lawson and banjo paterson and kaylee khaki junior murder no one 's how would you characterize juniors style of bird scientific anyone something more accurate in terms of the details of the bird you did a much greater variety of birds trying to paint every Australian bird I needed to do the third book once before performance one came out whereas these father tended to stick to the more popular suckies sunny little backfire Verrazano sort of iconic birds for that era I gather become like your book which found its way onto the chills not too long after your research that what bird is that the several field guide on Australian birds I had a rocky road why was that ah um what can he started writing a big what came to be known as for Angus with Robertson Linden of 700 species of birds in Australia they so huge job as you can imagine he wanted to do the various blue edges and their eggs and helped everybody writing about the taxonomy and the nesting and a cast of thousands involved even cover chance on and on and on he started in with with a bunch of other people in 1918 by about 1922 george robertson they had fortune to publisher and the with the Royal office royal australasian ornithological Association back then which is now food like Australia we 're arguing about how many species we had what to call them and even common age they couldn 't agree on so there was a continually changing list of birds to be done and kaylee was pulled to and throwing anyone could potentially george robertson Dominion famously can he wasn 't happy in the same Smith thrown out of the officers but Robertson and they lay down a domain upin and rotten suggested doing this much more contained Balkan finally have and did the public all we receive it but at thirsty of the shuttles no they didn 't initial sales with very slow until after the war went numb American soldiers were here on R&R they 've gotten a big time to take homers souvenir and that really made it take often obviously now it 's still still in print by which time together he 'd sold his life stories to the googly yes and hate your scholarship which she founded until 97 all their event Scott you 've never asked Christian certain turning now to both senior and junior you mentioned that neither made their fortune from their bodies of work boots ending story human breath of it and McCollum do either or both of them and have a lasting significance to all ecology if I think I dunno most homes both of us would have gone you any of you a birdie would approach exist so Kennedy names you know you know I hits here and influence total generation of people to go into pathology and study birds and I actually think that to some extent over and we helped start the bird watching movement in this country or just by making birds accessible thought before this book all there was with a big breakfast folio is beautiful but expensive and very rare Palio 's of people like John Gould Matthew doesn 't except Leon there who seemed to revel in receiving shoppers and and or sugar is also to hug them that leaving that to one side difficult might be deemed rather than have a significance to cultivation I got family that it wasn we didn 't have any much of an impact which obviously didn 't turn out to be the case but yeah totally strong and conservation training as an advocate for circular serving served in World katie loves Ian will that about exhausts my line of questioning I 'm sure that must be some questions you have of pH happy to learn to take questions from the audience after which the lights will be turned on in the exhibition and lest it remain unsaid as it will occur to you these sorts of exhibitions benefit from that I think you 'll see the likes of collections behind the all in one place anytime soon don 't happen by osmosis can I publicly think most of a library for its full-size convening the venue allowing the venue for exhibition and in particular can I think on behalf of all of us Donna braid who

    "text": "thank you very much thank you all for the opportunity to speak to you um it 's a great privilege to be here as both andrew and myself were mostly residents at one time i lived in belmont road for about 10 years quite some years ago first of all i 'll just explain a little bit about our society we 're the oldest continuously running society of its type in the world there are two others rather like us there 's crossing blockade in the united kingdom and over the front in the united states but we 've we 've been running continuously longer than they have we do a number of things we meet four times a year at victoria barracks to discuss items of interest and how we have contests and discussions and things the jewel in our crown is our journal that we put out annually we 're moving to two journals a year from uh from this year i 'll just pass around a couple of journals if you can have a look and we 'll give you an idea of the sort of thing being our 50th anniversary we put out a cd with an article from every one of our journals over 50 years and um if you cross my palm with money you can have one of those for only five dollars uh the other things we have we have a website and we 're very proud of our website thanks to the efforts of andrew it has a database on it of every australian that we 've can identify who served in an air service during the great war there 's about five thousand six hundred and something names in it um and they 're not only the men who served in the australian flying corp but the royal flying corps the royal naval air service the royal air force and two who served in the german luffa shot craft and we know of two who 've died while two who were born in australia who served who died while serving with the germans um there may be more we 're still still looking also on the database we have every one of our journals for the last 50 years are library and we 're building a library of combat reports the reports filled in by pilots after an action and uh these are invaluable to historians right that 's that 's what we do and we 'll move on to the talk and i apologize for the photograph quality in some of these they 're old photographs um i 'm attempting to cover probably the most dynamic four years of aeronautical development in about an hour so uh there 'll be quite a bit that will be left out so if you 're rather hoping for a in-depth discussion on the um uh russians and austrians on the eastern front i 'm afraid you they 're out of luck in 1903 the wright brothers flew um as we all know the uh that was because it took them about five years to actually convince people that they had carried out this part of the specifying a heavier than their machine and about 1908 the us government showed some interest from a military perspective and so uh there you see a right flyer and the us army left him up with 't much interest they couldn 't really see much sort of uh potential for military use of airplanes and then uh 1909 blurrier flew the english channel and the penny dropped people could fly above barriers like channels and rivers and seas and things and uh there was a really a need to have something like an air arm there was a military purpose to it you could see a lot from up in the air so in 1912 the british formed the royal flying corps and this was a joint army navy organisation and the idea was to to encourage aeronautical development train pilots and learn what they could do in water the the navy however split away in 1914 and formed the royal naval air service but most of the airplanes at the time were civilian aircraft that had been impressed or just bought by the army however britain also established the royal aircraft factory which was to build airplanes specifically for military purposes and this is the b2 this is a design by um jeffrey de havilland who went on to bigger and better things later on airplane a few curious things from outside of you is the observer is in the front cockpit and the pilot in the rear the observer 's in the front because the idea was that he could see over the leading edge of the lower wing he could see what was down there he had a big cockpit so he could have notes and fold maps and so forth and the pilot would take him where he wanted to go it uh this led to some problems later on as we 'll see 1914 the royal flying corps moved to france when the british expeditionary force went across in august 1914. this is actually the drawing of the very first royal flying court patrol going out looking for the the german army that was then bearing down on the bef british expeditionary force one of the the problems they first found was um how to identify aeroplanes do i have ground troops could identify airplanes there was a tendency to by ground troops to shoot at all airplanes on the grounds of whatever they whoever they were they weren 't doing on their aeroplanes and the british patented union jack you see a be2 that 's overturned and as you 'll see that the most distinctive feature of the marking is the cross so the union jack wasn 't such a good idea and was soon dispensed with and they followed french practice and putting a round but red white blue around them but they reversed the colors to distinguish from the french the airplanes played a very vital part in battle of the man which is one of the turning points of 1914 and because the royal flying corps observers discovered a break in the german line uh that led to the french and british advancing and uh turning the german flank and that this led to the what was called the race to the sea an attempt to outflank each other both both armies allied and german uh trying to head north trying to outflank this eventually led to the trench lines if you can imagine a continuous line of trenches running from the north sea to the swiss frontier which is about the same as trenches running from only people who could cross the trench lines and come back again were the flyers and here we see a royal flying called be2c flying above no man 's land with the pictures fairly uh fairly distinctive but rather than just to rely on notes it was obviously a good idea to take photographs this led to a um a whole science of aerial photography and photographic interpretation the other thing that uh airplanes did fairly soon was start uh artillery spotting and explain this is a very important thing right through the war one of the major functions for airplanes was to spot for the artillery what happened was an airplane would fly in a figure of eight between the artillery battery on the ground and the target at the top and would signal the fall of shot to the gunners to correct their aim until they were hitting the target uh they started off with the observer doing this but it was soon discovered that the observer really couldn 't observe because when the shell landed invariably the airplane would be turning or there 'd be a strut something the only person who could keep the targeting in sight was the pilot so the task of observing went to the pilot and the observer was there to look for other things such as enemy airplanes they also found it was difficult this is pre the days of radios it was difficult to signal from the airplane to the gun battery they tried flashing lights that didn 't work flares didn 't work and eventually a small wireless transmitter was fitted on the aeroplane um and initially they tried saying things like uh 200 yards north northeast no that didn 't work that was too long so they developed the plot code you can see there so you could simply say shell landed a6 and that would give the gunners an indication of where the thing landed so that was that was good that worked pretty well the airplanes weren 't the only observers in the sky there are also observation balloons uh and they were allocated about one per division along the front uh they 'd be up a couple thousand feet in a basket hanging underneath with observing just seeing what was happening in the enemy rear area uh they were a very difficult target to hit because they were surrounded by anti-aircraft guns although they were full of hydrogen some pilots used to specialise in bringing them down they 're called balloon busters but it was a very difficult and very uh a very hazardous target right there 's a coat balloon in here and you can see a little basket underneath with the observer um one of the phrase that i think is just about dropped out of english now but uh used to be a phrase when the balloon goes up meaning when something was about to start and this comes from the practice of when there was an offensive there 'd be more more divisions in an area and hence more kite balloons cut balloon reserves had one uh great advantage over pilots for the pulse and observers they had a parachute until 1918 no uh aeroplane people had parachutes then the germans and the austrians started equipping their there around them with parachutes but balloon observers had them so when the balloon there was a theory by some some pilots but it was all right to shoot at a balloon observer when he was descending by parachute on the grounds that if as soon as he hit the ground give him another balloon he 'd be back up there and uh carrying out his function again i don 't know that too many balloon observers would have subscribed to this theory but uh yeah some pilots felt once he jumped he was safe others didn 't okay we moved on to um defenses against aeroplanes uh this is the light one anti-aircraft machine guns this one was obviously good against low-flying aeroplanes and then and here anti-aircraft artillery this is a british um 13-pounder in italy for airplanes who are flying a bit higher the whole thing of flying on the western front was a like pendulum that swung from one side to the other is one side would have aerial superiority and be able to carry out their functions um pretty much unheated while they have the best better aeroplanes and then the other side will develop something better and we airplane for 1915 1916 was the be2c which was an improved version of the be2 that we saw earlier it still had it was a bit faster but it wasn 't maneuverable it was designed to be stable so the observer could have a good look at what was happening it still had the observer in the front cockpit which meant if it was attacked um it was very difficult to fight from the observer had the machine gun but he had a forest of struts and wires and propeller in front of him it was realized that um if you were in a fight with an aeroplane the best thing to do was to be able to fire straight ahead and uh a frenchman roland garros after whom the st the tennis stadium is named um at a marine center parasol not this this was a captured one here but it 's the best photographer and he fitted a machine gun to it to fire through the propeller and the way it worked was he belted steel plates to the propeller you can see them there and if a off to right or left very primitive but it worked uh brittany knew the propeller any good but he brought down four enemy airplanes before he was forced down by by engine trouble the germans had a look didn 't terribly like what they saw and uh developed a means of timing to it so they could actually fire efficiently through the propeller and this led to the focker iron decker which is a not a terribly good airplane but it had a synchronized forward firing gun and uh it could shoot out anything in the sky and the british pilots started referring themselves to themselves as firefighter there were a number of attempts to overcome this problem of firing through the propeller one was the be9 which is an adaptation of the b2 and you can see the observer has a little cockpit in front of the propeller uh this was not terribly popular for fairly obvious reasons um especially on the muddy figures of the western front where nosing overall landing was was common there was only one uh b9 saw it did a combat flight and i the one thing that terrified him was the thought that they might actually encounter a german aeroplane and shoot it down because then these things be ordered into production it wasn 't the french did pretty much the same thing that 's a spad a2 and again with the gunner in front the french air service had a good look at it and said no thank you and they were sold to the russians who are grateful for anything that could fly in fact some of them were still flying as played at the russian civil war in 1920 something that still had to be done as you can see that 's about the best a be2 observer could do is fire backwards over the pilot 's head to fire any other way here had problems with his aeroplane or rigging or something there are other attempts uh some b2s were fitted with lewis gun that fired at 15 degrees from the angle of flight and if you think for a moment how difficult it would be to aim 15 degrees off from where you 're flying at a moving did let it bring down some enemy airplanes that 's a a de havilland too and um you can see it 's got a lewis gun at the front uh the parts behind it and you can aim the airplane and the gun at the same time uh it was a way around the problem um it was a good aeroplane for a time it certainly beat the orion decker one of its its defects was it was a very cold airplane in fact i 've written account of a pilot who was forced to land or crashed actually because he was so cold that he couldn 't couldn 't um manipulate the controls because all the heat from the engine is behind you and you can imagine you 're flying at um altitude and open cockpit over northern france uh not warm yeah the another great british pusher is the bee there 's the fe2 fe2b this is one actually built in new zealand by one of our our members peter jackson and um it 's a two-seater you 've got a lewis gun for the observer in the that he can fire backwards if he can stand up um the pilot sits behind him a very good machine that did a lot of good work and in 1918 it was became a night bomber and there 's that 'll give you an illustration of what it was like to fire the rear machine gun now remember these men were flying in combat uh wearing a heavy leather coat um standing just on the edge of their cockpit with no safety belt while the department 's taking invasive action yes uh no not many life expectancy in weeks uh the life executive of a rfc pilot in well in the worst time was april 1917 which we 'll get to and when they were sending parts out to france sometimes like 10 hours and not something we did before that unpacked it depends if you if you were like if you could survive the first two weeks they say you could survive for six weeks if you could fight for six weeks it might last longer the french then went to another thing they could develop the newport fighter the wing so it can fire above the propeller the problem with that is um uh at altitude you had to pull down the lewis gun to change drums the lewis gun has a drum of 97 rounds the the farming lewis gonna have 47 rounds the air force one here uh 97 rounds but pulling that down at altitude and when the oxygen 's a bit thin uh was quite a chill so you had your 97 rounds you could reload but it wasn 't an easy task uh we 're fixing a jam there 's another problem too the next step was the british developed this very good machine the stock with one and a half structure they had a synchronized forward gun it had the observer had a lewis gun at the back on that u-shaped ring it was a tremendous airplane for its day it had all sorts of exit air brakes the first airplane with air brakes it had a variable incidence tail it could be altered in flight um it was produced as a bomber and a fighter it was a single seat obama unfortunately the germans produced something even better d2 d yeah um twin forward firing guns a bit faster than everything the british had um and made life rather difficult and so the the ascendancy that the dhtvs had had was gone the germans also produced some attractive two-seaters it 's a roland c2 and that 's got a forward firing gun and a gun for the observer it was fast and difficult to bring down the the french developed then the newport 17 which you can see has got a synchronized louis vickers gun fire through the propeller and a lures gun above and so that was that was a standard allied fighter for early 1917. and there 's a very rare color photograph of a new board taken in 1917 and that 's a drawing of newports in this case all naval air service in action british next british fighter was the southwest pup which was apparently a delightful airplane flew very well but a little bit underpowered and it only had one forward firing gun which meant it was it could match up with the albatross d2s but had so there were there were disadvantages but it was a very good machine the french developed the uh the spad 7 that was another great machine single forward firing gun maneuverable tough and uh used by just about every ally nation the um instead of the scarf of the pilot pilots in the first world war generally because they were continually turning their heads and so that their jacket would wear on their throat the next disaster to come from the royal aircraft factory was the b2e this is a cleaned up version of the b2c uh but unfortunately the observer was still in the front seat so it 's still very hard to fight from and they were sent to france and they were shut down in droves in fact um the germans brought out the albatross d3 which is the improved version a faster version of the the d2 and april 1917 was when the the d3s were at their best it was down to the royal flying corps as bloody april um losses were horrendous squadrons were losing almost their whole compliment um it was really battle of arrows so they had to maintain an aerial presence over the battlefield but things improved about the same time the british sc5a this is a improved version of an airplane called the se5 this came out in the first ones hit the front in july 1917. it 's got vickers and the lewis gun um a good stable gun platform it was fast it was stable the um performed well at altitude and remained in service till the armistice and many of the british aces flew se5as also the bristol fighter which is a two seater that handled like a single seater one forward firing gun and a gun for the observer as well um one of the classic machines they stayed in royal air force service until the late 1920s the dh4 was a bomber it was fast enough to outrun just about any german fighter good good payload two disadvantages one there was a fuel tank between the pilot and the observer so they couldn 't communicate in flight and the second it used a rolls-royce engine and they needed rolls-royce engines for other things but was replaced was finally replacing the be2 the area was ungainly looking machine but it could handle itself it could be handled well did a good job and one thing about the one mossman man who was killed uh while in the royal flying court was training on an r8 at the time but that became the standard artillery observation machine of the war the germans kept developing and they tried to improve the altruist d3 into the albatross d5 and d5a and this if nothing else was a period of delight for modelers you can see the germans encourage their pilots to have their own colour schemes there 's generally a pattern to it the green tail with a red outline indicates the old stuff or photo unit five um but apart from that the germans took the theory that the men were going to fight in these things and it helped to know who was who who was in the other machines and i 've built up their morale a little bit to have a nice colorful machine there 's a another example again albatross green tails again they were a lighter version of the d3 but they weren 't quite as successful the the next step was that the tri-plane the deep out sorry used by the royal naval air service with three wings and it was also the favorite amount of uh a number of royal naval air service aces including the australian robert little who was our our greatest ace of aces that 's a fake photo of the dogfight but um it 's it 's claimed to show what fighter air fighting really looked like you see albatrosses um a bristol fighter down there an se5a um yeah there weren 't that many of these really big fights but um when they were on you could see you had to really have eyes on the back of your head good reflexes and a good aeroplane unfortunately the good the british didn 't keep introducing good airplanes all the time this is the next one that went to squadron service replacing dh2s and newports the dh5 and this is the first mount of number two squadron australian flying court it only had one forward firing chocolate pup that it was replacing and it was back staggered you can see that the lower the upper wing is behind the the upper wing this gave the pilot a great view to the front but almost near no view to the back so it was used primarily on ground strafing we then come to one of the classic aeroplanes of the war the soccer camel came into service july 1917 still literally armistice by late 1918 it it was still fighting well but it was it was too slow it couldn 't accept or decline combat when it was around but uh very maneuverable it had a rotary engine which means that the the propeller and the engine rotated as a mass but they rotated together it was lubricated by castor oil so if you see any film of a camel or any rotary injury aircraft taking off there 's a mist around it that 's castor oil being sprayed everywhere apparently an hour and a half patrol in a camel was the equivalent of taking about a spoonful and a half of castor oil which had a either became immune to it or you becoming into it but the camel it also because of this rotary engine uh the fuselage was only 18 feet long and in the first nine feet you had the engine the guns the ammunition the fuel and the pilot so all the weight was there uh massive torque effect and it meant that uh it lost height on a right-hand turn and gained on the left-hand turn but it could turn to the right quicker than it could turn to the left it was a very maneuverable and in fact it was never actually flying in the direction it was pointing it was always slightly crabbing to the to the right and and wanting to go into it to dive as well so it took some skill they say if you could master a camel uh you were pretty good and if you knew how to exploit its its features um it 's a great help a number of aces flew camels that 's the the next one that the the french aircraft the span 13 which is a two gun bigger the belgians the french italians in fact those of you who drive ferraris uh the leaping the prancing stallion emblem on the ferrari was the emblem of the top italian ice of the war francesca barachi his family was friends with the brat with the ferrari family and when burachi was killed um the ferraris took on his emblem as the badge for their car all right we 'll talk about the aces um you hear a lot about aces in the first world war although the term actually wasn 't used during the war if you go through the archives of flight magazine aces ice as a word appears only twice and then to explain what the french mean by the term but um it 's now sort of been taken as someone who shoots down more than uh five individual planes this is albert ball he was the first british ace to um become famous he um he shut down 40 he was credited with 44 envy aircraft uh down uh he had the victoria cross the disturbed officer dirty service order and the military cross and was achievement james mccutten the pre-war regular soldier worked his way up from from an aircraftsman to a major and he was one of the most scientific of the british aces 57 victories but he lightened his aeroplane he improved the performance of the engine and he would go hunting german two-seaters he was one of the pilots who realized that bringing down fight violence photo fighters didn 't achieve as much as bringing down two seaters the two seaters were the ones doing the work the artillery observation or the photographic reconnaissance and um yeah he was a great a good patrol leader looked after his men but unfortunately killed in an aircraft accident in 1918. billy bishop a canadian a very controversial figure uh he was awarded the victoria cross for shooting up a german aerodrome on his own um and breaking down about three german aircraft um after the war they started examining the german records and the germans didn 't have any record of this um achievement it was he claimed and was credited with 72 enemy airplanes many of them he encountered on their own while were no witnesses so there 's considerable skepticism about um about bishop 's performance the next airplane of note that came out was the focker tri-plane the germans were very much influenced by the the soccer tri-plane and so they built their own version of the two guns very maneuverable and very popular with that man manfred rodriguez the red baron though not called that during his time who 's probably the most famous combatant soldier of the first world war that we remember today killed in action um april 1918 when he flew too low over australian artillery and there 's bernados another german ace 48 victories um he made a point of attacking everything he could um and mainly specialised in attacking fighters um apparently a very good pilot they took a whole flight of british isis to eventually bring him down and he was killed in september 1917. just um slightly digressing um just to give you an idea of why did why did ben join the flying corps when it was it wasn 't the safest thing in the world that 's a photograph of the was captured by the uh the canadians after a long battle in november 1917 by which time it looked like that um and on the ground it looked like that their canadians are passionate and i remember meeting a first world pilot who was a boston resident actually about 50 years ago i 'm showing my age and i asked him what made you join the flying call and he said to avoid the trenches that 's undefeated right back to the talk about trenches the germans went in for specialized aircraft for attacking uh ground troops that 's a very good one the help will start co2 um tough maneuverable you have a load of bombs you can see german stick grenades in a holder on the side of the fuselage so they fly at low level dropping those and they are very good they specialised in in quick ground attack but also the hanover co2 the same sort of thing tough maneuverable and reliable flying training was something that um this is we 've got slightly out of seconds flying training was something i was going to talk and shorthorn like that was the standard allied settler british trainer but it was realised that uh finally by mid 1917 that the old system where people were training in airplanes like that that were nothing like what they 'd fly in combat and the instructors were generally uh ex parts on who done a time in france and were back on as instructors and it wasn 't working but quite often the instructors were men whose nerves were shattered and they just didn 't want to fly or didn 't want to train and there are instances of pupils being told we 'll get in and fly off i don 't want to help you um and a man called smith barry changed the whole thing and um the british adopted the avro 504 was the standard training aircraft and um the the means of the system of flying training that 's in use today and it made a big difference to start sending and they also started training uh pilots and how to fly how to fight as well as how to fly before they went to france 're on the uk the the germans started bombing um capital cities using zeppelins now we 've seen um footage of the uh the hindenburg burning at lake lake constance new jersey and so you tend to think of zeppelins as being inherently dangerous however in up till september 1916 they weren 't they are full of hydrogen they could climb very rapidly and the british had no way of knowing when they were coming while they had a way the germans being methodical when the zeppelins were going out on a raid had to send a signal to base to say they 're only carrying a basic code book and so the british they intercepted these radio signals that they a whole lot of them were saying we 've only got the basic code book they knew they were on their way but this is through the days of radar and so detecting these things was just about impossible until they were almost overhead there were a number of things with uh measures were taken one of them was building concrete um sort of concrete cone and very often because the hearing was acute to see if they could hear uh zeppelin 's approaching um it was yeah they the thing with the zeppelin would they 'd come across the coast of maybe 10 15 000 feet even the airplanes today could maybe take 10 15 minutes to get to that height and uh if a zeppelin was approached by a defending airplane drop ballast and it would just go straight up so um they were a very difficult target until the the invention of the incendiary ammunition that 's a b2c that 's the actual one that was used to bring down the first german airship uh once the british had invented perfected incendiary ammunition you could fire into a zeppelin and they were fairly easy to bring down and i often thought it um what it must have been like to be a zeppelin crew approaching the british coast and in front of you you can see one of your other headphones and there you are underneath this massive bag of hydrogen or bags of hydrogen so the zeppelins were phased out and the germans started bombing thereof again this problem the british had of not knowing that they were there or what they were coming until they were there because it was of course pre-radar um but the squadrons were transferred from france they made life half half of the raiding gertis so they started coming over at night and in 1918 they were supplemented by the giants these are huge aeroplanes the wingspan of that thing is about um uh 148 feet which makes it it 's good uh they had generally had five or six engines uh one of the aspects of a giant was that it had the engines had to be accessible in flight because they weren 't terribly reliable so there you can see a gunner and a mechanic on a giant on its way across the north sea and there 's a photograph of the mechanic from a young a giant there 's his engine beneath him and his combat station is to go up that ladder and then his head pokes up the top of the wing and he 's got a gun on a mountain machine gun on his job at night and uh the uh the british responded by using good aeroplanes with camels uh as night fighters and you can see it 's been amended from a standard camel because the two vickers guns that were in front of the pilot weren 't very good at night because of a muzzle flash that blinded the pilot so they had lewis guns moved up to the upper wing and they also had a mountain where it could fire up at 45 degrees so if you get underneath a giant but one of the problems with the giants was um their wingspan was about twice that of the goethe and the the sights were generally fixed for gertas um so at a distance the the wingspan of a uh a giant which would fill the sights far away but uh being a giant it was being a giant it was much further away so if that makes sense it was real it was hard right things weren 't only happening uh on land uh there was a considerable effort into naval aviation this is a short 184 a um seaplane carriers and did a lot of coastal reconnaissance and hunting for u-boats and just all-purpose naval aviation another one a felix felixstowe f2a this did a lot of anti-anti-u-boat patrols over the north sea and the the hull was painted in a quite a distinctive red and white or blue and white or green and white pattern um so that if it was forced down at least it was easier to see than um if it was camouflaged aircraft were carried on ships there 's a camel on a um a cruiser or a battleship they generally put a flying platform above it a gun turret that steamed into wind start up the engine and the airplane would take off that 's that 's got an airborne getting it down again wasn 't as easy the normal thing was that it would land in the water and a crane will fix take the aeroplane out and dry off the pipe on the pilot first and dry it off take it back to land and hopefully use it again 1918 the uh the first dedicated torpedo bomber had the a um a raid on the german fleet at anchor in keele harbour something like a sort of pearl harbor type raid but don 't worry right march 1918 the coaster struck the great german offensive and the germans produced uh specialist airplanes one of the albatross j-1 and these are these j aircraft they were armoured so they could cruise about above in the infantry and they uh they had two machine guns out angle downwards from the lower fuselage so you can fly along just firing away so not very popular with allied infantry and the junkers j-1 is a reconnaissance aircraft all metal corrugated skin it 's very tough a very good reconnaissance aircraft if the german high command wanted to know exactly what was happening somewhere they 'd send out one of these they 're well as you can see it 's a noble aeroplane they were nicknamed the flying furniture van but none were brought down by enemy aircraft for high flying aircraft the germans used the rumpler c7 pretty streamlined airplane oxygen supply for the crew and that could they 'd come over the and uh take their photographs and disappear and very often um unmolested because just took too long for our aircraft to get up to intercept them the then the the next step of germs was probably one of the best fighters of the war the d7 uh maneuverable tough um and with with that 160 horsepower um mercedes engine it very good performance they fitted 185 horsepower bmw engine and it was superb in fact it was such a good airplane that um one of the conditions of the armistice in november 1918 was that all fokker d7s had to be surrendered which is something we claim to find on the allied side um the royal flying royal naval air service were combined into the royal air force which made it a separate service for the first time and um better airplanes start to appear on the front this is a french berger 14 and the significant thing about this is the markings are american the americans had started to arrive on the front but no american designed aircraft flew on the western front they um they they bought aeroplanes engines and um did they they used them a lot that 's the dh4 as i mentioned was one of its defects was it used a rolls-royce engine which were needed for things like um the felix day flying boats so there was an attempt to improve the dh4 by moving the two cockpits together so they once the pilot observer weren 't separated by the fuel tank and they used tried various other engines this they most of them were a bhp 230 horsepower engine which was a disaster and um numerous attempts with that they 'd go out on bombing raids and half the aircraft would have to return with engine trouble but in 1919 one of those managed to make it to australia so they looked after property they could do things the british also used the handling page 0-400 night bomber big aeroplane and they were used by the independent force royal air force which was a strategic bombing unit away from the british front that was bombing the german industrial air in the rural had the war going on into 1919 there would have been france and italy engaged in strategic bombing something like they did in the second world war in the first war it generally didn 't work because the the payload and the bombers was was just too light but the idea was there but things were improving on the other side as well german uh siemens sugar d4 this is a curious airplane it 's got a rotary engine a big rotary engine and a four blade propeller rotated in the opposite direction to the um to the engine so there 's quite a bit of gearing but it climbed like a lift and it may well have been the best fighter of the war but fortunately for the allies it didn 't not too many of them got into squadron service the fe2s were found a new release of life as night bombers you can see there 's an fe2 painted all the black uh and the observer testing his machine gun in the front the germ bombing the night bombing became a big thing in 1918 the germans maintained constant um sort of presence over the german of the rail heads uh true concentrations whatever that 's an aeg the same people who make uh electric tools today um on an aeg bomber they were quite a headache they caused lots of casualties and if nothing else they made meant that don 't go to sleep the sopwith dolphin first multi-gun fighter to come into raf service it um performed very well in altitude it had two vickers guns and you could see two lewis guns above the wing so these were generally removed the pilots found that at altitude it was just too much of an effort to try and reload them the dolphins did a lot of work at high altitude we 're talking about sort of 18 000 feet and one of the real problems the pilots had was this lack of oxygen it affected their concentration um their muscular control everything else there was a proposal to fit dolphins with oxygen in fact um there 's an account of a dolphin fuselage being taken to an they put an oxygen bottle in it and then fired a few machines and rounds at it and the enough problems as things were they rather than having to worry about exploding oxygen as well one of the final days of the war and uh the dh9 was improved by the american 400 horsepower liberty engine this is a marvelous aeroplane served in the raf until about 1930. and uh only a squadron of them about scotland made it to the front before the end of the war but they were showing the way for them for the future another event southwest snipe lovely airplane the successor to the camel but not too many made it to the front prior to the uh the armistice but uh they were they were good they but they didn 't start they stayed in raf service until the mid-1920s the soccer salamander was a purpose-made armored ground attack aircraft um but the war ended before they got to france the hanley page v1500 it 's a huge airplane sort of the british equivalent of the the giants um they had a squadron of these about to to ride berlin from britain um and had the the walker on another week they would they were just um they couldn 't afford to keep things like this going so they faded out of rf service very quickly the uh the vickers beanie was going to be a standard day bomber uh the war ended when one went into france before the war ended but um in 1919 one flew the atlantic and another one was the first airplane to fly from britain to australia on the other side of the lines the the germans developed the d8 which was uh very maneuverable um two guns uh probably would have done a lot of damage in 1919 but fortune got the war ended the odd thing is that um they 're rather stuck with using a rotary engine which um being phased out mother problems with rotaries they need this castor oil the germans didn 't have castor oil so they used synthetic oil which wasn 't quite as good but um nevertheless the d8 would have been a very potent machine as with that the the yucca 's cl1 that 's um all metal um two-seater ground attack aircraft a monoplane so it 's western front but some were used in the baltic in 1919 now we come to australia 's part and i 'll just quickly run through this transport there 's decided in 1913 to establish a flying corps in australia the same as the british had and that 's an article from the melbourne age of 1913 after they examined and thought about establishing a flying school in canberra and you 'll see that there 's the dimension that uh lieutenant petry who exempted they came to the conclusion that the atmosphere was too rarified and there would be a considerable waste of power in canberra he 's actually talking about aeroplanes but those of us who are public servants well i don 't recognize him first military airplanes in australia were bristol box kites they were bought in from britain and they trained at eminent point cook and so uh australia was the only only empire nation to have its own air service during the war canada was forming the canadian air force at the armistice but australia actually had four squadrons that flew that 's the uh the first to mesopotamia australia provided the men and the indian government provided the aeroplanes it 's a french voice uh we had one squadron in uh palestine they led them through the be12 which was a not very successful attempt to make a fighter out of the be2 um it worked all right-ish in palestine where the opposition wasn 't up to much but it was it was a disaster on the western front they then standardized on the in 1918 on the bristol fighter which did a very good work on the western front and did good work in palestine as well that 's a color photograph of australian flying cool aircraft in palestine number two squadron afc was originally issued with the the dh5 which is a um we 've discussed before the rearward sloping struts uh good ground attack aircraft they did lot of work at the battle of combre and ground support in the tanks but uh in essence they 're a pretty awful machine and they are number two squadron was re-equipped with the se5a and that 's number two squadron 's ses in france number 's an r8 one of their reighs was the british airplane that logged the most combat hours of the war so like 445 and curiously there 's an ariat crew were involved in a strange incident uh they were attacked by a german albatross and um they managed to put a bullet through the fuel tank of the albatross and he landed it was forced to land and the pilot was captured and the outdoors is now on display in the walmart in canberra but uh at the same time the um albatross pilot used to shoot at the re8 and one bullet went through both the pilot and observed killing them both but the airplane kept flying uh in ever increasing circles and end up uh sort of forced landing in a field about 50 kilometers wide yeah they 're a stable airplane number four squadron uh flew us off with camels you can see that the boomerang marking on them which uh they kept that until march 1918 then um they were all at all squadron markings were changed then because the germs had worked out who was and did very well with a snipe though in fact it was quite a testament to when the sniper was replacing the camel that number four squadron was chosen to is one of the first squadrons to receive smokes that 's um the royal flying call or australian flanker had two bases in britain and uh where they trained pilots that 's that 's one of them that 's mitch and hampton where we had two squadrons and two squadrons elsewhere uh that 's a photograph of um lieutenant mcnamara vc australia 's only vc in the australian flag or was only vc of the war and he 's about to take off from victoria in the first combat suite from an australian base they 're out looking for the german radio wolf that was out in the southern ocean didn 't fight australia 's uh leading ace harry cobby with uh 29 vic who 's traded in flying cause leading ace harry cobby 29 victories um survived the war came back uh served in the second world war as well and was regional director of the new south wales 's greatest ace who served in the royal navy air service robert little he um 47 victories um apparently a very good pilot very popular man but unfortunately killed in action attacking a goethe at night so and that 's for some reason this this got out of sequence but we 're talking about cam about uh observation that 's a rather poor photograph but it shows something that had to be done on roads in the western front you can see there 's a hessian screen along the side of the road to mask it from balloon observation so that the germans couldn 't see if there was transport on the road or not you _"

    "text": "it 's a great thing you should be here women are by absolute passion and it 's not they don 't like men i just think women are so extraordinary and so amazing and the more i work with women women and teens the more convinced i am and how extraordinary they are and the older we get the more extraordinary we get i believe so thank you so much i like wandering so i hope you don 't mind if i don 't stay stuck to that spot i would like to just say that purple in addition to being the color for international women 's day is my favorite color and it 's also the color of a wild women on top and yes it is a provocative name we like to have fun in our organization and we like to laugh a lot and we like to do amazing challenging things and i 'm going to share with you a little bit of a story of how i came to be here at this particular moment to celebrate women my expertise is in health and fitness and can see i 've changed a few times i 've also learned how to help women set and achieve big hairy audacious goals they 're also a big scary motivational goals because the goals that we talk about motivate women to get really fit and really healthy so hopefully i 'm here to help you achieve your goals i 've been sitting and achieving unusual goals since i was 12. when i was 12 any of you girls 12 11 11 00 oh there 's a 12 year old school when i was 12 i decided i wanted to become the national gymnastics champion by the time i was 16 i 'd achieved that goal but it wasn 't easy this was a time when gymnastics was an unrecognised sport there were no coaches no institute of sport and women didn 't really do sport i learned about failure and i learned about rejection i got chucked out of the ymca ymca which is interesting gymnastics club for being too pushy and too bossy when i was 13. when the other girls were gossiping around the chalk bowl do you you put on your hands i just jump up on the bars and have an extra turn a lot they hated me so in the end the coach had a meeting and they banned me from training at the ymca i had to go to the ywca which is interesting when i think about that now i also had to train on my own in my backyard in canberra in the winter it was very lonely and it was very traumatic like most self-obsessed teenagers i used to feel very sorry for myself i thought i had problems firstly i had a world name sound a bit like a strudel my name was kenneth huns what 's the problem with that well no one could smell it and i got teased incessantly i had to get married to get away from it then my dad was 22 years older than my mom having a dad the same age granddad was really embarrassing and thirdly my mum belongs to a quirky unusual religion she is a christian scientist is anybody a christian scientist here anybody know of it it 's never christian science combines faith with science christian scientists believe we can all do miracles including healing the sick so i grew up with food and exercise as my only medicine this was an era when other people 's parents were having a vexilar could lie down you remember that the best we never went to the doctor i mean never my mum believed that you could fix everything by praying she believes that like jesus we can all heal that we can cure disease relationship problems injuries and even cancer by praying cheering afraid when the kettle broke and when the dog got sick as a kid that may be really different it was strange well being called conital hands having a dad the same age as your granddad and having a mum who didn 't believe in doctors or medicine made me a social outcast or so i thought the good thing it taught me was that the body is a miracle if you treat it well feed it well move it loss it heals itself and there 's nothing wrong with praying for health positive thoughts are extremely journey as a kid that dishonestly served me well it set me up for life i realized that everything i resented was really powerful and it was crucial to my success i left home at 15 not to go surfing with my druggie boyfriend but to find a coach who could help me achieve my goal i left canberra and i went to boarding school in america just after i returned at 16 years of age i became the national australian gymnastics champion 24 years one husband two children and two careers later at age 40. life does begin important i had a massive failure i failed in my goal to find the highest mountain in the southern hemisphere mount baking cage in argentina it 's nearly 7 000 metres high has anybody been near that mountain you know that mountain no okay i 'll show you a picture of it later any idea why i might have failed in that strange actually the short answer is i failed because i was the brutal truth is that i failed because i didn 't have the skills the experience the mental that mountain i failed because i didn 't respect the difficulty of the challenge and i failed because i hadn 't done my homework they say you should do something you fear every day well why does a middle-aged mother suddenly decide to climb a big mountain perhaps i need an adventure to get me away from my looming domestic crisis but the main reason at the time for me i thought was because i was lacking motivation to exercise does anybody lack of motivation to exercise hand up if you 've made a new year 's resolution to get fit come on come on they say about 80 of us decide it 's really hard to stay fit and healthy and you have to have a reason most women beyond just being fit and healthy to want to be fit so i realized that i needed a reason to be fit but obviously i had no idea what i was getting myself in for i moved i think hey you up as you do and i found out that people died on that mountain i read the gear list crampons i wondered about these people walking in spiky boots on slippery ice slopes in whiteouts i got so frightened by what i learned on the internet that i almost cancelled but instead i just did nothing that was a very clever one whenever i thought about walking on slippery slopes in my spiky boots i just distracted myself with another thought friends and family taught talking horror stories of death and told me on they said no responsible mother would go and do that i told them i was sick from johnny long manly beach and going to the gym i said i won 't take any unnecessary risks and i found a goal buddy my best friend annie risked divorce to join me we both lost our husbands lots of happy endings when we got home it was excruciating and he started vomiting the next day she couldn 't even eat chocolate by the time we got to 3 200 meters we had been clearly labeled the weakest link and the rest of our team had completely given up on us but it got worse on the way there and he got so sick that we took her hat and shared her love between us of course this attitude in humiliation imagine i should have park house should my girls don 't watch the boys went on ahead and left us behind so much for the team around lunchtime the head guy pulled me aside and said i need your help you need my help he held up a key and he said you have to take this key to base camp i don 't know the right base camp imagine i didn 't have a clue where i was i said i 'm a city girl the truth is i was absolutely gripped by fear he said the boys need this key so they can get into the bags that are on the back of the mules give them the key so the girlfriend annie can get into a tent she needs a tent and he was very slow she kept vomiting i just wanted to go home i don 't know the way i said to my god it 's that way so just go up no choice he said i had to do it for annie so i headed off along the river until the track split and by this time i was really frightened it was late afternoon light was beginning to fade i was in the middle of the andes mountains nearly 4 000 meters above sea level and i hadn 't seen a soul of hours i had no map and no compass not that i knew how to use i hadn 't seen a soul and i had one muesli bar and a cup of water left and i actually had no idea where i was there was a thought in the track i was lost i thought i could die here what an idiot this was not in the brochure i took the left floor i 'm not quite sure why but i went to the left then i bumped into a man running home i said basically and i started struggling up a very steep section swallowing painkillers in my last bit of water until i saw the dots the yellow dots i dragged myself in there and i remember was being put into a tent and offered food and say i can 't eat for the first time in my life i was too exhausted and sick to even beat the next day was a rest day and by the time we got to 5 500 metres annie and i were feeling pretty good we were happy however my ziploc bag technique did fail those of you who have been an attended altitude might know you don 't want to go out at night in the blizzard so you have to learn to pee into a ziploc bag i know that 's a little strange i spilled my bag all over my sleeping bag there was a lesson everywhere our team had fallen apart completely one guy had summoned it but he was too exhausted to get down so he had to get rescued another guy had panic attacks and he couldn 't leave his tent and the last guy that we were with got a chest infection and couldn 't carry his pack that was what happened to the men but the girls got stronger so our you can keep going up alone because we 're taking the boys down they gave us a choice it didn 't sound tempting they said you could go up to 6000 metres on your own up that way we could actually see the track by this time or they could come we could come back down in the end we decided to go a little way on our own we got to about 6500 meters it was an agonising decision we 'd come all this way and we actually felt pretty good and the weather was fine but where we got to there was no trophy there was no ribbons we ended up carrying the boys bags back no glory even in the pinnacle of deluding myself this was not a trophy and this was not success we had failed or so it seemed out of this failure i created success just like when i was chucked out of the ymca at 13 and then went on to become a national gymnastics champion i started my own business wild women on top that 's because we climb mountains i re-entered developed a program of outdoor business called trick training to prepare women for challenging this is the mountain that we find and we got to about here and that took two weeks eight years later in 2008 i returned to now at the with a team of women that i trained using trek training we finally stood on the summit of the highest mountain in the southern hemisphere together there was 800 headed out from summer tonight we were the only full team of women on the mountain at that time to head out as a full team most of the other teams have been reduced to one or two and some to none eight women headed out three of them got turned back because the guy was tired and it was too slow the rest of the girls got to the summit with a different guy it 's amazing what happens on mountains along the way i 've learned i can carry everything i need for survival for a week on my back and i 've also learned that breaking down a big hairy audacious goal into small bite-sized i forgot about that you know what that is some of the coolest girls that i can 't_``_955.04 advocate you 're with these bags were handed to us by the guys and they said this is for number twos no ladies you don 't need a white porcelain bowl you can manage with a tomato bag for the supermarket if you have to in the wilderness luckily we had those beautiful guides to carry that out for us this is what we did in the base camp mistake we had baths and we got clean one month in two weeks in a little wash bowl and we 've got these most amazing undies that reason we 're there in our undies is because this lady carla gave us all the little treats in our treat for stomach undies and on the front of the undies this is what it says never never never give up and we never gave up so i took these lessons and i trained my coaches on how to be physically and mentally fit for adventure and we 've gone on to continue to achieving extraordinary inspire women to achieve health i like being my own boss working my own hours and climbing mountains and getting paid for it i usually work with john lawless as one of his handmaidens and you know because i was nearly 50 i thought it was quite funny because i didn 't mind wearing you girls probably wouldn 't do that in your job but i did it was a great education but one day john came on the radio and he said if you find a job you love you 'll never have to work a day in your life and i found that i resigned that day there it is if you find something you love you 'll never have to work a day in your life and yes i did beat you with the arm wrestlers a couple of years later they worry about the numbers fortunately i managed to convince them that it was a good idea because without them without my team of amazing women and i have the beautiful julie here who 's a very key part of that team without that team this have worked out what we can be best in the world at while women on top is the best in the world and inspiring and empowering women to achieve health to extraordinary team adventure goals to date over four thousand trekkers have achieved health by walking the stunning coast of sydney raising nearly 4 million this money has restored sight to nearly 120 000 people through the federalist foundation and that is something that is so exciting and so exhilarating and so fantastic and over 90 of our checkers are 10. and she 's climbing on seven sides she 's got a few little interruptions along the way that 's extraordinary so if you turn up the training and go oh it 's a bit hard getting here we go think about mary she had 10 children to organise and in fact she 's got 12 now she 's adopted two of her grandchildren as children this lady here lisa marshall is a director of wildlife and on top she 's climbed many mountains training trained an extraordinary young woman she 's a generation younger than me and can do fabulous amazing way is something else she is one of the most inspiring awesome women i know she has done the sydney coast trek every year since it began raised thousands and thousands of dollars for us and connected us with some amazing people to help us with our goal connecting with people julian crosston connected us with the help of minister tank for the for a number of charities amazing awesome women and i have the privilege of sharing with them so passion and positive thinking 2009 we had 10 teams we got the route wrong and they went 126 kilometers that 's what google we raised 200 and we thought that was fabulous in 2013 we had 520 teams 90 of the women checking that post and we raised 1.5 million just in that one event so if i can leave you with anything team the power of the team together everyone achieves more and take any obstacle you 're given obstacles are good they 're defining they will change your direction you either go over them or you go around them but they 're fantastic bring on the problems with our teams of women do you know who that is yeah you guys should recognise that this is yesterday morning beach that 's one of our training groups that we have down at six o 'clock full pack 18 kilos to the top of australia 's highest fountain is one of the final ones that we do children across the chain for two years to do that trick and succeed in achieving that goal so i 'd like you to think about what your goal is work out what your goal is and go go and find out how to achieve it and i 'd like to leave you with a couple of health and fitness tips because of course that is my main passion i 'm not very good at running a business but i 'm really good at building fitness tips so you need a goal if you have a goal buddy it 's much more fun and you 'll keep doing it much longer so find a goal buddy research shows that if you exercise in the morning you 'll have a much greater it 's so much harder at night time once the kids get home do it in the morning research also shows that if you commit to a challenging fitness goal you will prioritize your fitness so get yourself a big scary motivational goal because otherwise fitness will just get left off the list and you 'll get busy with shopping and cooking and kids and family and husbands at work all those things prioritize your fitness and health because without that you 've got nothing you can 't nurture all those people if you 're unhealthy and research also shows interestingly just half an hour and that includes a risk walk along our moral age of exercise equals one antidepressant exercise is our medicine oh last year i got lucky enough to go to nepal and i did the world 's highest handstand that was pretty cool luckily i had and i do have to say as i mentioned earlier men are amazing and i do have some wonderful men that have supported my goals over the years and my partner luckily happened to be there with time to take that wonderful thought and then i 'll see if you 've got any questions be the change you wish to see in the world if you can go ahead with one thought from today that is something that drives me when i feel sad sorry for myself or i 'm too busy or too grumpy or want someone else to remember the tea bags or the milk be the change you wish to see in the world where we can make the world a better place and you know i now think since i 'm over 50 that life doesn 't begin at 40. life begins at 50. you 're going to get a long time _"

    "text": "mossman 's built heritage comprises the multitude of fine houses both new and old small and large the different kinds of houses can often be seen together within a single field of vision functionalist in need the national styles ushered modern architecture into mossman often in designs by respected architects this house for instance was designed by Adrian Ashton but a great many modern buildings express their conservative or traditional origins like the Philip Morton Housing Commission flats which are one of only two such complexes in mosman Morton was a local state Member of Parliament these Ragland Street town houses which are more recent also echo traditional terrace house living but in a garden courtyard context more recently still buildings such as this residence in cardinia Road display the traditional feature of the hipped roof in marked contrast many designers now employ new construction techniques such as reinforced concrete to exploit difficult sites often with dramatic and beautiful results so it 's quite clear that Muslims built heritage encompasses the whole range of architecture past and present one way of thinking about heritage is to ask the question that those that are listed as heritage items would those listed ones exemplify what we love about mossman 's character tomorrow 's heritage will have several aspects the first is the building stock that survives from the past we seek to identify the houses that illustrate mossman and cherish them and their natural settings as well the second aspect consists of the new houses of today just as for old buildings the community eventually will have to evaluate even houses like this and decide whether they might be vital parts the heritage of mosman the third aspect will be the way we insert new architecture into the context of the old very often this will mean making an old building suitable for today 's use this for example shows a new attic story insert it into a queen anne-style house so carefully that it is almost indiscernible in this scene the new work echoes the older work that adjoins it without exact copying so that its newness is evident the fourth aspect of tomorrow 's heritage is what is called infill inserting a new house into an existing setting without compromising in Raglan Street an arts and crafts house designed by Jefferson Jackson we 're beside the old tree guide a modern residential structure has been built it was designed as a pavilion or separated component which reflects without copying the design of the original other examples of infill are these new semi-detached houses successfully inserted in a traditional streetscape the carports complement the conservative design this is another example of a new car port designed so as to respect the character of an older house and be subservient to it the carport sit slightly on the site and does not conceal or compromise the form and detail of the house one of the most significant qualities of an existing context is scale that is comparative size if the new insertion is too big it is likely to be out of scale and likely to dominate the smaller sizes of the buildings adjacent to it when a new building is built in an existing setting its scale is one of the most difficult things to manage in this streetscape the new house on the left is out of scale and overpowers sympathetic in scale too they provide visual links between the houses and also form part of a streetscape offense should not dominate or obscure the street scene but should complement the architecture of the residences in conclusion this is the message of heritage as a community we must critically examine the wonderfully rich resource of mossman 's built heritage and determine which ones we want to keep and then take the appropriate steps to secure their future this applies are like two old houses and to the newer ones which with the context of streetscape and seascape to which they belong represent the character of mosman it is because of the work of architects builders and homeowners for more than 150 years and also because of the careful management of building regulations by the council that mosman has the character and beauty that we enjoy every day I you _"

    "text": "the 1920s and 1930s were years of continuing progress characterized by the striking growth of the housing industry the increase in population meant not only more houses but also more retail establishments such as this group of typical interwar shops with dwellings upstairs in spofforth Street the style here is arts and crafts there were new churches all basically traditional in form but often making a feature of new materials and techniques such as these glazed terracotta or feints elements new meeting places such as the masonic center were also needed here is a satisfying streetscape composition which incorporates shops into its design there were also more school buildings this large interwar block at the high school is a handsome symmetrical and classical design more buildings for recreation were erected perhaps the best known of these are the ones at taronga Park this picture shows the reserve at Balmoral and the bathers pavilion designed in 1929 by mosman council 's own architect Alfred hail the wonderful diversity of house building styles included inventive uses of the old traditional material sandstone as can be seen in this lovely into war house that were made possible by advanced manufacturing techniques in this building the bricks are geometrically striated while at this house in cardinia Road several different dark colors are combined to produce a variegated texture what follows is a quick survey of the main architectural styles that can be seen in the interwar mosman the attractive arts and crafts tradition that had been so pervasive in the Federation period continued so strongly that it has become almost synonymous with mosman the crafts of brickwork cement rendering and carpentry and joinery were adroitly incorporated knowing about styles helps us to understand architecture arts and crafts usually featured informal massing as in these houses in ched 4th Street and the style was made distinctive by the handsome combination of brick roughcast render thorn shingles and finely crafted timber work the georgian idiom was revived as a reminiscence of conservative british or even early australian origins with smooth stucco walling and a touch of classical detailing the warm climate of the Mediterranean suggested forms such as gentle archers and shaded walls and lodges and window shutters evoking faint images of that part of the warm climate architecture such as was seen in the Spanish missions in california in the 19th century its tip ified by the rough textured walling occasionally perforated for ventilation by nobly roof tiles usually of a spanish form by iron work such as you see in lanterns and balconies and window grilles and classical touches and sometimes a little hint of Hollywood Old English is the name given to the style that calls forth memories of merry England by displaying such features as textured dark brickwork Tudor archers half timbering steep roofs tall chimneys and LED light glazing Art Deco was a quietly revolutionary interwar style characterized by assertive stepped forms sharp edges geometrical patterning and steel framed windows it 's interesting that so many mosman flats are Art Deco in design there is even a church in mosman displaying a most fetching combination of gothic and Art Deco forms not only in its exterior as shown here but in the interior design as well an interwar residential style that was doctored most enthusiastically in Australia was the California bungalow it started in Pasadena California wyd roofs and eaves and but our increasingly informal way of life one of the so-called modern styles was based loosely on the idea that form follows function its favorite features were the prominent curve strip windows and roof concealing parapets this style got the name functionalist functionalized architecture developed into the mode that became known as the International style because towards the end of the interwar period it spread through America and Britain and Europe from where we Australians were getting most of our architectural ideas architects such as Joseph Foyle who designed this house for himself in 1930 led the way to the architecture of today as this period comes to a close I think it might be true to say that the full on international style has influenced present-day architecture more than any other so next we 'll look at today 's architecture you _"

    "text": "in the Federation period those 20 years or so before the First World War mosman grew phenomenally this is one of the hundreds of subdivision proposals that were being produced by then mostly by speculators to advertise the beauty and potential of the place in the 19th century the district had attracted a good deal of settlement as many of the early land grants and large estates were subdivided for development this picture was taken from a house in Prince Albert Street streets like this were created to serve the houses that resulted and many of the streets were long and straight ignoring the topography in 1891 there were two hundred and eighty nine residences in mosman some of these later Victorian houses were large and built on ample allotments like this one in stanley street some were smaller like this quite elegant and well conserved matching detached pair in Raglan Street many houses were smaller still and there were some handsome Terrace type ensembles with a bit of cast-iron filigree embellishment as the new century opened Federation was a reality and Australia was prosperous at the height of this to live by 1911 there were 2687 dwellings a tenfold increase in 20 years this is another of the expensive residences that were built so as to capture the brilliant outlooks which they 're citing often but most were cottages modest in scale and design incidentally the term cottage is said to have come from cot which means a place to sleep with this housing boom several new Federation styles of architecture emerged the most prevalent was what they called Queen Anne face brickwork had been the favourite English building material during the time of the 17th century Queen Anne it was revived in Britain in the 19th century and introduced into America and came to Australia just about as popular with the Arts and Crafts style related to the artistic movement of that name in Britain in which high-quality hand workmanship and decoration were essential this is when timber shingles were favored as can be seen in these Gables the range of material is used in these styles made Federation architecture quite different from what had gone before as well as fine face brickwork made possible by new ways tiles developed originally in France fretwork and turned timber decoration which you can see in this veranda I 'll stand cast iron as the preeminent decorative material in this house as well as the paneled gable you can see the distinctive window sashes with the curved rail that became a mosman feature modelled plaster was often employed to compliment brick walling and fine joinery this house in shed fourth street displays a gable modeled in low relief most residential designs were a symmetrical informal or what they call irregular or picturesque like this arts and crafts house in kesten Avenue some were more conservative occasionally with classical elements such as symmetry or traditional columns this example is in cross street designs by tellin dirt architects were particularly interesting this is an example of the work of edward jefferson jackson who was trained in england and built several fine houses in mosman that conjure up echoes of the English Arts and Crafts movement correo in carl 's road was one of several local houses designed before World War 1 by the australian-born architect Donnell discipline and here is a design quite eccentric architect builder Alexander Stewart jolly it is located in livonia street this was also the tie when semi-detached peers of speculative dwellings replaced terrace houses this is one of the most distinctive piers located on the high side of redan street incidentally the addition to the right-hand house has been subtly designed in holt avenue this pier was specifically contrived so as to resemble a single asymmetrical building this particular design treatment became a mosman speciality these modest twins at the east end of Aaron Burr road are in themselves a very attractive Queen Anne pair but they also are part of this group which is one of the most unusual ensembles in the whole of mosman a distinctive arrangement of seven matching Queen Anne style peers as mossman 's population grew groups of speculative retail shops were also built this suite in military road now includes a bookshop but when the premises were first built the shop became the venue for an early muslin post office this suite also in Military Road was beautifully unified and symmetrical until sadly the occupancy at the street corner end at the and replaced by a very intrusive unit in this photo the demolisher has started work on the corner tower some Federation period shops are important not just for their individual quality but also as impressive landmark components of streetscapes this group shows what can be achieved by good conservation here a unified upper story has been added in sympathy with the original single-story dro this attractive house in red and Street is splendidly conserved it 's a convincing demonstration that streetscape is for the enjoyment of people and that houses are a vital part of a streetscape here the houses though different in design are sympathetic to one another in scale and in their common use of roof forms such as Gables visual harmony is a vital ingredient of a conservation area and talking about good conservation it is possible by skillful design to add a carport to a house that was built before the motorcar became dominant notice that the carport roof here is a curved cantilever one of the most frankly modern design forms it makes a striking but very complementary contrast with the house it 's important new is compatible with it then the result will ensure the continuity of heritage significance next we will look at mosman between the wars _"

    "text": "Oh if you 're watching this program you already have an interest in mosman perhaps as a new or long-term resident or someone considering living here you may be planning to build a new house or change an existing one mosman Council believes that everyone can benefit from knowing more about the area its history its people and its feelings this program aims to show why mossman 's distinctive built heritage is important and worth keeping surely the first thing that strikes visitors and residents alike is the setting mossman 's superb relationship with Sydney Harbour it 's eleven peninsulas projecting to the water like giant fingers of landscape embracing beautiful bays and coves the second is its dramatic topography with landforms that cascade down from the heights of Military Road and spit road to the waterfront and the myriad built features like these divided roads that link the different levels and run across ridges and valleys the third thing is mossman 's inheritance of handsome man made places such as urban streetscapes these views in military road from lays corner show one of them there is an amazing array tiny this is the lovely Balmoral park and this is reid park in a valley which incidentally forms another bit of muslims striking topography these old photographs show what it looked like long ago this miniature reserve is in brierley Street originally it was part of the Rangers estate one of the area 's most historic the house was demolished in 1912 for residential subdivision in the prosperous Federation period there are many public buildings new as well as old which clearly demonstrate community pride this one is mosman library but maybe the buildings that characterize mosman more than any others are it 's excellent houses there are large ones like this one in Prince Albert Street and the host of relatively modest dwellings like this one many were built by speculators who appreciated not only Muslims aesthetic virtues but it 's obvious and increasing real estate values as well there is a surprising range of entrancing details like this Victorian classical entrance feature in Balmoral carved in sandstone and modelled in terracotta this one which enlivens a small house in Orlando Avenue is designed with carefully contrived face brickwork influence there is a saying that buildings are documents embedded in time buildings portray history just as fluently as written records do the old whaling station is a well-known but now very rare example that has been saved from early times it 's a Georgian colonial memorial of mossman 's maritime origins a few houses from the prosperous Victorian period survive boronia was built in eighteen eighty five by James and John kiri whose firm made horse-drawn carriages Baronia was later used for many years as mosman library it 's adjacent partner tilapia has not fared as well in the diverse period between the two great Wars architecture in Australia was greatly influenced by worldwide fashions this arts and crafts example is in clifton gardens old english or stockbrokers tudor was a traditional and patriotic style that obviously originated in britain which people still referred to as the old country or home spanish mission was a historic style that started not in spain but in colonial california and the warm southern states of the united states of america it was popularized in the very influential print media of the day this house was an exception it was built as the prize in a woman 's weekly lottery to raise funds for Red Cross as part of the war effort after the war effluence returned and soon the building industry burgeoned once more mosman continues as one of sydney 's most attractive areas architecture today includes some outstanding houses on spectacular sights especially of course those that can take advantage of splendid seascapes old and new building designs can exist comfortably together showing that with care and creativity mossman 's heritage is not a freeze frame but an evolving experience and what is heritage it is the things we want to keep because we believe they symbolize mossman in the next program we look at mossman 's federation past _"

year we have new bicycle paths and pedestrian facilities going in at athol wharf road Bradley 's head road and here at the spit which forms part of the regional route connecting cyclists from the northern beaches to the city the bicycle path here in pearl Bay is part of a larger network of paths leading people to North Sydney it 's a very attractive way to commute compared to driving a car I right to work because firstly it 's really good for my help but secondly I was interested to see that Muslim of pushing a cycle to work day each year so this idea is great because it keeps people safer and it encourages people to use the bikes and it 's also really big bonus for people who are traveling through mossman with all our building projects now in mosman we try to integrate sustainable materials the pedestrian paths here in Palm Bay were made with recycled as the amenities buildings we have introduced solar panels as well as at the drill hall sportscenter Lori Plunkett reserved the three primary aims of the project here were to control the storm water the storm water was sort of running through the reserve in an uncontrolled fashion which been it went wide across the landscape and affected a lot of the soils and obviously brought the weeds in the other reason was to allow public access access through the reserve back then it was basically wall-to-wall and Tyler you couldn 't get through the area and then the third reason for the project was for heritage interpretation this was an old tram line there is an old heritage culvert further up the road there and obvious you can see here this is an old cutting we had to revenge some of the areas and other areas we could regenerate another aspect of the project which come in a bit later on was the retention of the stormwater this system is down on a reserve a botanic road it 's all underground it 's here that has a half a can then be reused and the purpose of the stormwater I guess in the long term is to irrigate the balmoral for short we 're fortunate here in massa that we have quite a good community base that are interested in bushland regeneration and management and the castle provides significant resources to facilitate this our local community it is about probably over 100 volunteers that helping the restoration of bushland error is in mosman we did we facilitate a group for them generally it 's where they live or if they 're not necessarily interested in working around their property area they can go into an area a group that 's established it 's good good company do it a worthwhile cause and I 've counseled and other community members appreciate their work in the last 10 years we have significantly improved the way we manage the natural environment in mosman ninety percent of our stormwater is now filtered and through that program we have collected about 3,000 tons of pollutants which would have otherwise ended up in the harbor we have also increased the ecological value of our sea boulder field and salt marsh which significantly increased the marine life around the area by providing a habitat as you can see the beautiful beaches behind me visitors and the Muslim residents use these speeches and the other beaches in mosman so it 's very important that we have food clean water also it 's an aesthetic thing so people don 't want to see rubbish floating around in the water when they 're wanting to swim we have a lot of marine life here at Balmoral as well as clifton gardens and other features in Rosslyn so it 's very important for them they need clean water to survive our council has the most storm water flowing through it devices of any council around and we do that just to ensure that we 're improving the water quality here at mosman some are purely nets which are attached to the end of a storm water drain and they just catch the gross pollutants which are cans plastic bags you know general litter others which are our main squid they are built into the ground so their concrete cylinders they coming through the catchment will go into the squid and so any gross blue to drop to the bottom and then the water or keep going out into the harbor we clean all the rubbish that is washed up on onto the beaches we lower it down so that the receivers just touching the sand which prevents it from going back into the ocean but the type of rubbish we pick up as any loop material anything that 's washed up from the shore and in plastic bags any rubbish that 's left behind why people come to the beaches removing all the all the pollution from the beach before it gets into the into the ocean is only beneficial for the ocean while our work revolves around 365 days of the year we commence work at five thirty in the morning and sometimes we don 't finished at seven o 'clock at night we take great pride in the work that we do here you you _"

lands being preserved all around here so you know it 's just a unique beautiful area for people to come and visit and people to live it was important to us to choose sustainable options where we could for reasons of the environment and also our own comfort we chose to use double glazing in the doors and windows at the back of the house we noticed immediately it was installed that it was much quieter inside when everything was closed and also warmer we installed a four and a half thousand liter water tank under the deck but it 's also nice to know that we 're a little bit self-sufficient when it comes to using water in the garden we can use water at times of the day that suit us we used sustainable FSC certified timber for the decking and so we 've done a tiny little bit to help preserve are we also have solar panels installed they produce more energy than we use it 's satisfying to know that we 're producing a bit of energy here that isn 't coming from fossil fuel sources if you have any garden space at all composting is very easy we have to compost bins and we compost all kitchen and garden waste and that is a benefit to us as well because we use it in the vegetable garden there are a lot of waste materials around that you can use successfully in the garden the garden beds have been built out of recycled railway sleepers and we 've put netting over the top of them and that is supported by arches made with recycled irrigation pipe consider very carefully each renovations decision or even whether to renovate or what to renovate you don 't want to be making decisions in a hurry before you start I 'd recommend working with a green builder who will no other green suppliers and contractors a couple of years ago a group of us got together and decided that we 'd like to set with a small area and in just four months wonderful volunteers turned it into an oasis with gardens and ponds starting the community garden movement around here has been amazing for influencing other people because the people who come to the garden I think they do get more interested in vegetables and maybe growing a few vegetables even if they 've got a townhouse like we have or a balcony everything here is recycled and recurring had to buy anything new there 's so much growing here in the sense of quite a lot of organic produce we only use organic seeds and really what we have here is just a whole selection of veggies that people love so it 's the kids have got quite a bit of an input in it as well so the things that they like to eat as well all of us grown-ups we nourish our soil with compost that we actually make here at the garden and basically everyone just brings along their fresh vegetable cuttings and more recently they 've just agreed to almost double the allocation of land and kindly paid land we 've got began to build beds and increase the a for each consider a lot of work did you I will meet as a group on Wednesday afternoons and Sunday afternoons and Sunday in particular is the big social event we 've come here when we work and then people bring food and drink and you know it 's a party basically every every Sunday afternoon in 2010

    "text": "everybody wants to may is that so many people have told themselves away from television with night and come to listen to me talk about history I 'm so grateful this has been such a joy this whole story I don 't think I can begin to convey the thrill as a journalist in being involved in such a special project if we journeyed reams of a great scoop if we journey dreams all the strain would have to push out this was life it 's an adventure that happened because of a hunch and it happened because there are still mercifully people who understand the long form journalism matters results so let me just talk for a moment about what these photos are all of that you 've seen from history a lot of old-fashioned funny tiny pictures of guys standing looking very very for these are not those the joy of the lost diggers Peaks which we found a French firm has attic two years ago is that they are basically boisterous larrikin Aussie soldiers having a good time and this one to me and captivates why they just here on this gentleman 's wrist what is a map of Australia a shape of Australia that over bully beaten and we know that this photograph was taken probably in about 1918 maybe even early 1990 these blokes have survived the war in waiting to go home and they 're making a laconic to comment to the alums we want our money 's and they 're letting their hair down they look like Vikings but what I love about it is you wouldn 't have had this photograph beginning of the war this is an image that Australians wouldn 't have had of themselves in 1914 when the war began in 1914 Australians thought of themselves as going off to fight for king and country to fight for mother England by 1918 they were thinking of themselves as Australians which is why they had that little bit of metal on their wrists they enjoyed it mates they they 've learned to think of themselves as posses there 's another thing about this particular image that I love is pairing this mic up at the top right names probably Builders with great excitement thinking that that he was their long-lost uncle I think it was and just on the way here to give you an example of how much of an ongoing discovery the story is we had a call from somebody because I put an appeal on on Facebook it turned out that buildings family when we contacted them Pete died sadly in 1918 and one of the last offenses of the war and when the family looked at the Middle 's they discovered they had the wrong medals it was another blokes name on the back guy called Clifton fitter beautiful and just all the way here this evening I got an email because I put an appeal out on her page and there are people like yourselves we have a passion a love for history and I said can anybody help me we 're trying to find relatives of a particular digger called fitter and after two or three days blood comes back to us and says I 've found his grandniece a simple post of New South Wales so as soon as I 've finished here 've got some needles let 's go to where this all came from his Terrace onion is here and vehicle the little turd I 'm taking you to was about half an hour northwest of onion and during the first world war this is an old map from the period during the first world war that shows what they did the soldiers were so overwhelmed by the degree of fighting in the trenches that within about three or four days they were rotated out and put into these rest areas and so you can see here there 's a sort of a rest area there 's the front line running down here where the Germans advanced and the Allied forces have basically stopped them here they were all dug in you will know your history but what the Allied commanders realized was that this modern warfare men couldn 't cope with it for longer than a few days and they would rotate it out and it won 't take them very far so they created rest areas and this little town of vineyard hall which I wanted to try and area here Vidia court basically was a term where people came to let their hair down and rest in that time was this bloke I called Louie Giglio and he was a man who had a passion for photography and he and his beautiful wife Antoinette Soulier lived in a farmhouse in vineya core and they were local farmers but their land was requisitioned by the local Allied command who took over the whole village and in order to make it back they started selling photographs and I should explain that in Australia today there are probably faded bits of cardboard in collections all around Australia and people are wondering why are these and the problem that Louie and Antoinette had was to turn out enough photos quickly enough in order to meet the demand because they generated me think maybe as many as 10 to 20 thousand photographs we firmed 4,000 glass plate photographic mirrors and I 'll take his version of and what they did was they developed a technique called pop print on paper and it was great because you can get a bit of photosensitive paper you can create a print the only problem was that print faded within a few years and that 's why this collection stay hidden because while Lillian Antoinette realized that historical significance of what they had the blokes that sent these photos I didn 't understand the technology was limited and so as a result that process that print often faded and unless it was reproduced on Lively 's photographs disappeared and we 're not sin until we 've dug them up again as French farmers and this is the home of louia net worth to me a and for many many months we drove past it tried to find the location of this mysterious water photographs we 'd even knocked on this door trying to find the owners but we knew it was one of the old Tullio houses really treasure chests and it wasn 't until the 1980s that anybody in literally a family realized what they were sitting on and this fellow robear Khurana a was the first to solve the mystery Revere was a local photographer at a to Leone relative who lived in the new the friendly pictures for the local council whenever there was a visiting dignitary and in the 1980s he heard there was an Australian Minister visiting from Victoria from the Victorian Parliament and he 'd heard about this odd collection of photographs that was somewhere in the town and by chance he found a small number of the glass photographic negative plates and he developed them and put them up on the council wall and if he was amazed at the quality of them but nobody asked where are they from how many more are there except for this bloke a guy called Ronald morose and the role is very much the guy who 's the hero of this whole of discovery I 'd love to claim it was me what Firth is though it was Little Rock who is the true genius and the passionate lover of Australian military history in France who I really love to pay credit there ons the Chesterfield sofa French mice holders for Western Europe so if you leave us no further he lives in a lovely chateau the love Elliott he loves history love was he ever does not he waitin Helen loves them and he nipped rubbing him and Sydney 's a fantastic interest the Australian seas do a bigger collection but he 's a bit cagey about it and so what happens is little rights to the Australian defense attorney from the Australian Embassy in Paris he publishes a couple of articles in philosophy journals including one British ability journal saying hey there 's a fantastic collection of photographs out there please anybody interested let us know nobody comes so when we finally rang the wrong about a year ago he did cry live intro he was so happy to hear from us and we hired him to help us find the remaining two Liang relatives and to Tractor this is a good collection and we also took with us this landing man Peter Byrne s is one of Australia 's most eminent First World War historians he 's based at the Australian War really not being a historian myself I thought if we 're going to be dealing with this collection we 've wanted to be sure that we dealt with along with us shot a series of stories for the Sunday night television program that you can still watch on our website if you 're interested you can just google the Las deals anyway picture dusty etiquette the spiral sittest is that pushing aside cobwebs and we come to this wall of World War two jerrycans like dozens of them and we 've got Christian to do who 's the other captain leadership of the Thule a family who 's somewhat cautiously agreed to show us what he thinks is in theoretic and we 've agreed to help them find it we 're lifting jerrycans and pushing aside old friends then we see these treasure chests it 's unbelievable that these really worth sitting in this attic over nearly a hundred years they 've been through summer winter bitter cold bitter heat in those treasure chests with the most incredible collection of negative glass players four thousand last plate negatives many of them in excellent condition and Peter at this very moment in this image is looking at whether these M should be reading you can see with such clarity aliens self can you can see the badge and then we realized we can actually help identify these blokes we 've got four thousand images of Allied soldiers how do we find out who these guys are you 're looking into their eyes and when we came back to Sydney we have them scanned by a company here in Sydney called off scared and we 're able to generate incredibly high quality energy is in some cases a quarter of a gigabyte of information and we were able to zoom in on those images we also found and this is nothing believers were still there one of the things that always intrigued Peter niece was we always known there was a they 're somewhere because there was this very definitive distinctive banner backdrop this was the backdrop still sitting at the etiquette and what happened was very tragic Louie had been a motorcycle dispatch rider in the First World War he had a year of service suffered quite a serious injury but the family when they came to Australia a few weeks ago for the launch of an exhibition theory into these chests it 's proven up into the attic in 1930s because in 1930 Louie took a pistol blew his brains out couldn 't deal with the awfulness I suspect of what he said I mean 66% 3 of the young that came through this room had their photos taken or either killed they think that he just couldn 't deal with them and so he shot himself Antoinette was so stricken with sorrow she basically threw everything yet the Nazis came through and willful to turn in the Attic upside stole the cameras they didn 't be look at silver negatives and interestingly until we actually knocked on the door the reason that house was the imitation is about to be sold and the negative is away and mercifully because of the intercession of chairman Chancellor Carrie Stokes who is a passionate lover of Australian military history he gave me a blank check basically to go and buy these glass plates for the Australian War Memorial that 's what we did now I 'm told that somewhere in the audience here there is somebody who was a relative get you to introduce yourself a little bit we unfortunately at the time that I finished writing the manuscript for the book to give you an example of how method things developed we didn 't know the identity of the man sitting at the sidecar but we know do and maybe in the questioner so we can make some introductions but these two gentlemen are Murphy middle winners and again what we did was in order to enable identification of men like this what we did was put every single image up on Facebook my wife will tell you we 've got a thirteen and an eighteen year old daughter who if they had their way they 'd be on Facebook all the time and I felt like a bit intimidated by this modern technology worrying that my daughter 's not one of them was integral in suggesting to me why don 't you actually create a Facebook page as well as a website page and so we scanned every single photograph that 's still in it you can either just google lost Diggins and you 'll find it and were able to volunteer information and suggest information and some of the photos I just love because they show a relationship between the people of this little town and the Allied soldiers between themselves as French soldier there there 's a British soldier there and there 's Australian soldiers and this French civilians and they were chatting up the French girls this is where they have time to let their hair down many of them have got mud on their boots that come in from battles in this one it 's shot probably in December of 1916 in the cold cold winter of 1916 1917 I love this image because it just says so much about this stiff French soldier surrounded by these American the scouts are these soldiers and the reason they 're smoking it 's been explained to me by people who know more than I do about the time everybody smoked was to keep warm it was so bitterly cold and those sheepskin vests one of the reasons we 're able to place it to 1916 is because the feet of us has been able to tell often one of the ways we 've been able to identify people is by looking at the design of women with the shape of tunics particular patches then we started getting if you like IDs on people of great significance that the gentlemen of the bottom right of this image is one of our most decorated heroes John Maxwell VC I didn 't even have to put this one up on Facebook because Peter Byrne is he descent still and looking or this image because it 's Joan X well VC at the peak of his powers and Joe is the gentleman who wrote that wonderful book hells bells and meta Mozilla 's which I do recommend it to you it 's a first-person account the likes of which you will never read again I didn 't know there was so much premarital sex going on Joe Joe was a bit of a Larroquette he was a bit of a rascal but he was also one of our most different combat veterans there 's a a great story about home he helped bridge the Hindenburg Line one of the major mowed down around it and there were these huge rolls of barbed wire that they just couldn 't get normally they used a kind of a torpedo bond pushed out across the road to blow up the bad wire it just wasn 't working it was too thick and the accounts of what he did are just also he literally jumped up on fellating German machine-gun fire ran across the bed and knocked her German machine guns how he survived nobody quite knows but the incredible thing is in by the age of 22 it was just 22 years old it won the Military Medal twice which is an incredible achievement it worked DCM anyone the VC all by the age of 22 and if you read his book and I recommend it to you you can hear the other side of the story this poor man came back to Australia and like so many of these blokes was a lot of trouble dealing with normal family life this one didn 't that Jim Holland last week I was his Jim Collins beautiful 92 year old daughter Kathleen and we great great great builder and she recognized Jim and the photographs one of Jim 's ancestors descendants his file Lehmann like B Smith I think president very famous Australian actress and she she told us great stories about how do you never really spoke about you know the worry disjunctive oh but Jim was a machine gun and we called him a handsome dude that we may have our cover photograph and hundred percent sure when we went to see Kathleen and rich has two children in Perth we 100 percent sure it wasn 't fast Jim so we 've learned up and you might have seen this on the story it was a beautiful moment we all cried we blowed up a beautiful photograph of Jim erected at brown paper and presented one photograph to each each of the twins Richard Kathleen and then she tipsy hit there and she goes oh it 's a photograph papa and it was just the most that 's the thing I loved about this whole story is it 's brought us together with families with lots of history that they didn 't has happened time and time again that we 've been open to bring people together I put this in just to show them one of the ways you can find out about your own tetiny history we 'll try that so questions likely once we 've been trying to answer is the most readable archives in the state libraries this is a book of photographs from the state library that people compiled in the 1920s largely forgotten largely ignored now there 's a huge sense of pride the check on the left here Frank HSN his son Sam who 's I think almost 90 or in his nineties he 's a passport user and he he was perusing the favored eyes and he saw his dead and he contacted us and we were a little bit skeptical but it turned out you couldn 't mistake it was an absolute dead ringer and you 'll see at the book Sam 's photograph he served for two he 's dead ringer for his dead but I do want to pay tribute to Frank and his mates because there 's a battle that July of 1960 and it 's largely being eradicated from Australia 's memory because it was such a bitter awful disaster for Australia I think in the space of one 12-hour period 5350 something Australian in the area not much bigger than about three or four football fields the whole thing was a travesty it was a completely unnecessary devil Frank was one of the survivors when Sam contactors he was hoping that these two gentlemen in the photograph were two men who died standing right next to Frank at framel certainly when we looked at the service files of the men that he was talking about it couldn 't possibly be because the tragedy was they got on a train and must say go straight up to the battlefield got off got to the supporter and friend was the only survivor out of his troupe of friends but there is a lovely PostScript you might all know the story of the grave that recently described grave Ranil we were able to tell Sam the story of how through DNA testing and it has resolved the passion of a historian Glaser 's the Australian Defense Department was badgered into digging for a particular gravesite he was persisted in believing was there low at the hole there were a hundred or so of Australian diggers that have been put into the grave by the Germans in Frank 's two friends so they were given a decent burial just a couple of years ago this war still lives on in people 's memories this is a lovely but I never realized forgive my ignorance on this you latently how much the constants and the Catholics didn 't get on at one stage and this is a lovely story at a Catholic priests james gilbert and protestant dr. keith doing and Keith wrote the most beautiful letters that you could read every book describing the friendship that he had with this he thinks Irish chaplain he was actually a Kiwi he probably wasn 't Irish background but they they huddled together in the coal of the trenches and heat Keith wrote letters back to his boat he later married and described this chap we were able to give the family this beautiful picture 't tell you every single story in this image but I like it because while it shows how the backdrop was used to class up the photographs but there 's one like I 'd love to pay tribute to because in the battalion diary that records his death the gentleman at the top left Harry Griffith Harold Griffith was such a loved officer when he died not too long after this photograph was taken his mien insisted on carrying him the front lines giving him a proper escort battlefield and it describes a period of history that again i i 'm cosmic time fifty this year and all of the men the young men that fought this war so many of them we 're in their teens some of them were you 'll see boys most of these men here were 20 21 22 they saw the most terrible terrible things let 's make it at the bottom right if you had a lead not an offer a limo a very little chance of survived leases residents in melbourne one of those named this the brother that Liz used to what happened to this was what happened to so many his leg was blown off and they couldn 't help at the time he died from infection you know field hospital this bloke Joseph would happier story this is Joseph in vineyard or during the war this is Joseph on the left in the nineteen forties and there 's a lovely story I was at the war memorial doing something very similar to this a few weeks ago the bloke walked up to me and he turned out to be one of the great nephews of Joseph wood and he he confirmed the story that I heard from another member of the family that Joseph was always a cheery player one of the things he loved doing was he could throw his crutch and get the kids just behind the back of the bed and he laughed tip his head back and said yeah that 's right that 's exactly what he used to do this is a special photograph because it 's probably we think very interesting it records a very interesting thing in our history the fact that ignored and forgotten about but officially only people of the white race were allowed to see the visible water was quite racist but as the terrible losses of from l+ bullet or planted they allowed people of color to begin enlisting this young gentleman was one of them and again we haven 't found him yet but the family of the man on the Left contacted me the other week we think we now know the aboriginal reserve from where this came from we 're trying to find his family this is a lovely shot purely insertbefore the fact that the two plates on either side are obvious big brothers maybe they are all brothers the tragedy was so many young men joined up in the same units and I find myself looking at this photograph asking did these plates survive because brothers often died in the same moment the same battle because they were standing next to each other and they work with the same burst of machine-gun fire until they started changing the rules about investment from spreading boys from the same family about different units often you the book devoted to brothers we basically look into their eyes but I find myself asking myself all the time do these blacks survive this one boy this one really mattered to me this chat we now believe is called George Gilbert when we first stared into his eyes I 'll just show you a close-up of his face it 's such a sad sad sad boy and he was only when he enlisted he was probably about 15 or 16 he only just arrived in Australia and he was called up for king and country and he duly served he almost made it what they were trying to do was find out who he was because his image pops up in many photographs and we found this one a French Museum that you can see him at the top right there same warface Curie my wife and I often found herself staring into his face you know he get attached to a particular photograph I really wanted to know what happened to this poor play and we had a breakthrough the wrong maruzen and our requests searching for the 't have complete captions but it had a name pattern for this bloke here poorest part and by serendipitous happy circumstance my third trigger pattern who is his son and Trevor is a Turner had a whole series of letters that Horace had written back from the first world war including a quite amusing description of each and every man in this photograph except a few including the black out the back right by a process of exclusion we were able to figure it out it was George and he died in the defensive end in the final few months of the war some of the photos are just fun they recorded village life this is our vendor stock a boxer before the war photographed by Louie tule a in the banya that still exists the Thule a farmhouse there was a lot of this kind of recreational activity they had sports they had theatre troupes they had wings Harry Hartley married a lovely girl called Simona to call who was a local venue called pure tragedy though because in the Second World War Harry of course was still a for motor cars and motorbikes in onion when the Nazis invaded he had to flee we don 't know what happened but what we do know is that he died and it was possibly of rush to Dunkirk to try and get the hell out of France before he was arrested by the bats a lot of the photos and I love this they show diggers letting their head these are not formal photographs but like on the right there is completely cut he 's he 's had a few ones I loved the fact that they portray these Bluffs and I 'd love to tell you the story of each and every one of them Angus Wilson who 's seated on the left there he was a military medal winner from memory and correct me if I 'm wrong Kari but I think he came back to Sydney and ended up working on the docks Darling Harbour basically like so many of these blokes disappeared into obscurity didn 't speak about the war and until we contacted a lot of deer family some of them didn 't know the that look at his eyes see those eyes we were transfigure out who he is right think about the fact that there are three or four photographs older than there is such great quality is you can see that middle route in the middle ribbon is a military middle and we gave it a history of repeated business we 're gonna find a bloke from that battalion because it 's quite a lot of them we have a closer look if you look you can see a little we 've discovered that there are only eight blokes from the help of the wonderful people from our National Archives and some genealogists who are as nothing about this amuses me you to find families Fred Johnson taste of life given the extraordinary sheepskin on the right I like this story because if any of you were growing up in Sydney in the 1950s and the sixties he 's the bloke who opened the door the GPO post office place if good boy and he never spoke about the war this particular photograph and I know I 've got to wind up special moments of course was the 11th of the 11th 1988 there are very few photographs of us to stay around the front lines because the British didn 't allow different cameras the Aussies took locks brownies belittling but they were allowed to take cameras to the Western Front and sadly the war photographers were generally British British centric Frek early who I 'm sure went there briefly at 1917 yeah hugely with Charles beam and disappeared to Egypt soon after so the would a lot of Australian war photographers Louie Tilly I took this extraordinary photograph of what we now know to be the very moment of the declaration of officers and they 're all looking up at something and look at what they 're looking at there and I 'll just let you pause for a moment Joe next well described as this moment to this book tells bill Jesus Christ this amazing party they have visibly opened the wine cellars and started dancing in the streets we had a great time at Sunday night reenacting met with the town 's folk of the new corps who dressed great thing is a lot of the locations with the photographs were taken still exist including this location and one of the moments that Joe describes is a moment with a trickle in the French national flag the Australian flag carried up the steeple curiously by two deers Pinsky push the arms are hanging on for dear life from the steeple waved these flags people we do occasionally you can just see the trickle in just there that very moment that john maxwell describes absent joe didn 't stick around for long he popped on the back of the truck and went down to the 42 years my old cats have great night there 's another moment and i 'll finish soon on this three days after the armistice the people have been you cool had all these Allied soldiers most of them for Australians and hundreds of thousands of Australians developed a bond and it exists to this day the woman who gave us the the breakthrough would be at Kanye 's widow in her headaches beautiful she had a flat map of Australia and I put it to said she wept and she said you know there 's plenty never forget the Australian and this woman 's friends there were two people in the village and she introduced us to one of them described her as a very very young woman she 'd gone to the grains of Australian song has intended the graves this is that moment every child in vinegar it was given a grave to look after until the Commonwealth War Graves Commission came in from the place that with the limestone grains I assure you they looked after us beautifully and this is the moment where the French military and the local dignitaries he stood up that he said of the Australians they were the bravest of the brave many of them still rest in this Cemetery that 's in-vehicle and I commend return to you because you can go as a result of the story to a beautiful museum that they 've created it will soon be moved into the Thule a house which has been brought for the purpose and it has beautiful photographs were these blown up on the world and story of an Australian soldier who will tell you their story and I remember I told my mother to take a few questions I 'm asked a fellow has been you call from Villa Britain Europe 's about 45 minutes drive one of the field hospitals that they would have been brought to at the time was the vehicle field hospital and in fact Kari and I really question from before the war to the landing of Gallipoli where he was and right through the entire war four years worth of letters have you preserved someone 's done a search on a nine well that 's one of the things that really helped us in our search is quite often as I was telling you a trivet partner whose daily horoscope by the people of the images it was because of the letters that Horace wrote that gave us the breakthrough too early to find it or set face to do George Gillett and actually there 's a wonderful thing that happened in the twenties they started collecting the died lives of soldiers and the State Library has a collection had been preserved and you can also if you 're interested at all searching of family history a wonderful thing for us I can 't speak too highly of it is the ability to access these digitized resources in the National Archives personal service files and also battalion Diaries there 's no service files are at the National Archives and a battalion Diaries are on the wall website and you can actually read these online and we would actually be sitting I can remember I was sitting on the battlefield because a year we were really keen to identify one digger and I 'm tapping into the internet with a dog internet connection on the battlefield year looking at the service file in the battlefield and picking up bits of shrapnel on the battlefield at the same time very very moving you 're thinking wow black I 'm reading of that died right here you get a sense of the ridiculousness the horror of this my grandfather was forced to stay we may have a phone yesterday we ran in fact one of the chapters that funnily enough I find graves the temporary grades that I showed you overages on earlier there 's a horrendously said chapter where a mother was pleading with the Defense Department to give a beautiful pea carved cross and the reason I say we might have the photo of your your relative is because of this photographs of blokes from the grave burial team standing beside some of these crosses and this poor mother lead it for years right into the nineteen twenties to try and get a copy of the people to get the cross delivered to Australia the brutal in an emotional way that they dealt with this poor woman it 's so sad these days we take for granted to be able to hop on a plane flight in France but for most families even people over means it was an impossible thing to hop on a boat go to the other side of the world your son 's grave site and there was a policy of not repatriating these men 's remains and so for a lot of these families the only way for them to do anything was a favor there are a lot of the photographs or crosses in the that 's probably a good point to stop because October any that three questions _"

    "text": "i 'm ken doan and i had the great honor of um being commissioned by the mossman gallery by john cheeseman uh and katrina cashman probably i must be a year or so ago now and i knew a little bit about the attack on sydney harbour by the japanese submarines but of course not not that much about it i was only two when it happened but in some ways i guess i am the right person to attempt this opportunity or this project because i am quite well known in japan and i 've spent a great deal of my painting life making paintings about sydney harbour mostly optimistic paintings about sydney harbour i 'm fortunate enough to live beside sydney harbour i look at it every day i swim in it most days of the year and like all of the artists who 've had the great the great gift of living in mossman you are continually uh inspired by the harbour but i 've never had the opportunity to look at it in this sense to look kind of under the harbor i suppose or look 'll show you where i started i felt right from the start that i was as i was interested to find out what these young brave japanese submariners must have felt before the attack and i had always imagined that in in the sense that kind of samurai feeling would be something within them and that something that had been handed down uh through the japanese navies and armies and air forces over the years so the first uh the first work uh was really the pile light which is the middle of sydney harbour the ferry 's still going across and in the sets being attacked by a kind of traditional samurai warrior all of these preliminary drawings were done without any kind of reference of exactly what the submarine might have looked like or even what the blokes themselves might have looked like i just wanted to find out what was in my what was in my mind so i think this is probably the second drawing where i 've drawn the three submarines more like bombs and in a sense one two three four five six at and of course the japanese flag and through a lot of these works or even say a lot of the drawings i 've painted them in a slightly japanese manner in the sense of the brush stroke or making them fairly fast fairly immediate so it 's the relationship between the hand and the brain what 's in there how quickly can you get it down again this is one of the earlier drawings uh the fleet in sydney harbour the sense that the japanese were coming to invade that particular space to conquer that particular harbour and of course without the opera house in those days the kind of familiar skyline of the harbour in the distance and at the bridge and with the navy ships right again i didn 't look them up to find out exactly what the chicago looked like or things like that more what it might have felt like more what a ship feels like or to me it feels like the man in the submarine or in a sense the man inside the bomb because that 's what i really felt that they man even though there were two people in each submarine and the lines of the of the water again in a kind of slightly japanese manner uh i first went to japan in 1962 and i 've been very interested in japanese art for a long time and the mark and the brush stroke and the way that even the simplest stroke if it 's put down with some confidence can be really quite beautiful in this drawing um i made two references in this entire suite of pictures related to sidney nolan related to ned kelly i was struck by the fact that i imagine maybe it 's only me but i imagine that the at the end of the periscope it 's a kind of it 's almost like a ned kelly it 's almost like a ned kelly helmet so i drew it i drew the end of the periscope that way and again i made the water in a kind of oriental way a kind of japanese way the first person to in fact see the submarine the first submarine that got caught in the net rowing boat and so i 'm sure he literally wasn 't wearing a scottish outfit but i made him vaguely scottish and with the kind of one of the with the with the big squad of scottish hat on and uh this was the submarine the first submarine caught in the net and to most people an absolute total surprise that anything like this could happen uh this print this poster i first did in in 1980 and i guess it 's one of the things that people first knew of my work and that continuing interest in sydney harbour and so i 've taken that original crayon drawing or a print of that original great drawing and superimposed it with the japanese symbol of war so here 's the first painting in the sequence of 15 works this essentially was the plan this is the japanese symbol of war that i had on that last poster the simple principle was three submarines would make their way from tokyo through various islands in the south pacific and they would attack sydney harbour an incredibly audacious feat this second picture is 16th or 17th century i 'm not sure uh it was called uh farewell to the ferryman and it showed this beautiful japanese girl waving goodbye in the original uh to the ferryman going in his and he 's very it was a rather soft kind of print i 've changed it obviously i changed the sea into red i put the submarines in i simplified to some degree of the woman herself and then i 've made these little i 've scraped in the sea and again used a kind of a kind of japanese way of symbolizing the waves themselves farewell farewell to the submarines from farewell to the ferryman this one a man may journey to a place he knows but it takes a man of rare courage to go to a place from which there is little hope of return they were the words of the japanese minister to australia tatsuya kawaii in 1942 he was still here hadn 't gone back or hadn 't been sent back to japan and up in the corner is sydney harbour from the air and the flight of the week before the attack to simply find whether where the fleet might be within the harbour itself this one is a kind of incredible statement that that katsuhiro ban said about the attitude that was necessary for japanese people to have nations that fear death will surely be destroyed it is necessary for the youth of japan to know take notice of this sure to die is the spirit that will bring about final victory that that 's what you have to believe in these i imagine that you have to believe in this kind of situation something that i guess only people who have been in war really really understand so there is the statement that he made there 's the symbol of the six submariners in there in the submarines and into this i 've just scrapped kind of heads almost skull-like heads symbolizing the six boys that led this mission this is a statement by amamura ashib our mother is old now and all alone at home so please don 't say anything until you receive this notice this he was having dinner with his brother and know i might not come back then he said there is no greater wish than to be given the most honorable place for a soldier to die as i have been in other words he knew what he had to or wanted to achieve he knew where he was going and i guess he really felt that there was very little chance that he might come back and he shared a meal with his brother and so i put some kind of small sake cups and some little sake drinks and maybe some plums that they might have been drinking but i 've also put in the revolver because in the end he shot himself when they were being discharged shot himself uh and his companion he saw that as the most honorable way the japanese way no cause for alarm this was the kind of feeling in sydney harbour or in sydney at that particular time and yet a week before the attack um ito in his float plane which had been launched from the mother submarine out out to sea off the heads or probably down off kiama meters a couple of times and had been caught in the searchlights and as he said every he was at 700 meters when he was first caught in the circular and then he had to quickly get up into the clouds so there was the chicago waiting sydney harbour the net from which they 'd have to go through uh north and south head and his plane being caught in the searchlights but he lived i believe till his 90s he came i think to australia sometime in the in the latter part of his life this was kind of the defenses on middle head at that time i think they were probably a bit more sophisticated than that but i 've often go up to middle head and the big cannons are still there that i think have been there since the first world war the cannonballs are still there i used the pill box that they had up there again in a slight reference to ned kelly 's sydney nolan 's painting and i repeated the you know the sunrise that was coming up that particular morning where in a sense a japanese sunrise because the submarines were just outside waiting this is just before the attack i symbolized the three submarines as kind of you know frightening warrior masks the three clocks are the times in which they uh were ready to attack and i painted the c in very much a japanese style very much using the brushstrokes to to add to that sense that what they wanted to do was to make sydney harbour or be briefly a japanese harbour and here in the distance the harbour i believe there 's strong southerly wind it was quite a dark night they had these radio waves that also the submarines had to go through before they went through the net that was somewhere up up there so south head north head the light the storm the japanese waiting so 10 35 in the evening on the 31st of may 1942 the first submarine is caught in the boom net and and is death charged and at the same time the two submariners of the captain shoots the lieutenant that was there so even at this stage and certainly a lot of people including the heads of the the navy i suppose and that were having dinner that night in tresco with the with the captain of chicago still had no inkling that sydney harbour was under attack so as soon as that first submarine was depth charged suddenly messages happened to me had to be flying back and forth across the harbor to the various uh people in charge you you couldn 't send a message from taylor 's bay which is where the submarine was attacked off the off the the light you had to go back to vault clues and put before clues back into a gartner so it 's an incredible amount of confusion people were saying yes something has hit the pile light some guy 's saying look it 's a bloody submarine other people say no there 's a suspicious object in the net we 're not sure what it is but then there realized there were subs in the harbour we have to do something about it the official line came out to say we have to attack with the vessel escapes at sea these were basically all the kind of official things that went back and forth but uh then i was struck by a comment of one of the sailors on one of the one of the the navy ships he said where 's the bloody trigger on this thing in other words they weren 't really expecting to be fighting in sydney harbour so here 's the attack on sydney harbour itself there were tracer bullets going everywhere depth charges explosions incredible amount of confusion no one really knew what was going on and i must say you know to make this picture i had to be i had to work very fast there is i kind of do it in my painting you have to make these lines very strongly and again in a slightly japanese manner but these lines of the trace of bullets and of the light and of the gunfire you have to do it as fast as that to make it work then step back and look at it for a while see whether it needs some other little there 's all there 's bits of enamel there 's bits of shiny paint for the ships themselves there 's bits of watercolor there are all kinds of things it 's an attack on sydney harbour and as a painter you in a sense have to attack the canvas itself i think in a sense this was the hardest picture for me to do because i 've never you know gone into the studio and think well i 'll make a picture of people drowning or being killed and when i first did it i did one part of it then i left it for a while in the studio and looked at it for a long time to decide what i 'd do next i think the first part that i put in was this man 's face here the top is obviously the submarine here is the the water but i wanted to do the feeling of people under the water not able to get up and so it was quite a spare kind of painting and i looked it in the studio for a long time and i realized it all these other heads i started to put in the feeling the explosion i started to put all of these marks again pretty much like the attack painting you actually have to attack the canvas and do it and do it fairly rapidly your brain is only just ahead of picking up the paint to do it um so as i said it 's not a subject that i had any experience doing but i hope it 's a powerful picture and i hope that it tells people something of the sacrifice that various people made which in a sense i think is probably what this exhibition is about it 's about two things isn 't it it 's about the act of what happened uh it 's about remembering the sacrifice that people made so that we can uh live in such a beautiful place as mossman or sydney or australia or stuff like that and that people that were enemies can become close friends and allies these are the names of the 21 people that lost their life that night that were in the uh sheltering in the as accommodation that was right next to the chicago the torpedo mr chicago hit the cuttable 21 people 19 australians and two british ratings died so these are the crosses symbolizing all of them these are the ships that were still left in the harbour and this is the big crane that they brought in the next day to bring up uh the remains of the submarine that matsuo and suzuki had had lost their life in this is the last painting in the whole sequence this is the funeral that was given by rear admiral muir head girls to the japanese submariners they didn 't know at that time that there had been a third submarine that had escaped out through the heads and had turned north the mother submarines were waiting south of kyama but one turned north and i think it was only about 10 years ago that the remains of that submarine with the the bodies obviously still inside were discovered off the reef up in newport but this is essentially what uh viewer headguard said i ask you should we not accord full honors to highest order to go out in a thing like that steel coffin how many of us are really prepared to make 1 000th of the sacrifice that these men made and i think that 's that 's a pretty perfect summation of no one wants to get a war no one wants to do any of these things but if you were forced into that situation these guys showed immense courage in what we did so here they were human omori matsuo matsuo and tsuzuki at this time the submarine of ban and hashib had in fact escaped so 15 paintings part of australian history that i think is very important and that and that we should never forget and as i said a few minutes ago the great thing about it is i think that previous enemies can become the best of friends you _"

    "text": "thank you phil thank you all for coming tonight um it 's very consoling to be in a library amongst library sort of people uh so i 'll i 'll start phil 's told you the important bit that it 's not a book i 'm talking about a book it 's a book of words and that to me is a it 's a whole it is a new world because no longer am i um when you draw you 'll do a fella who draws those cute little ducks and things and it 's been lots of fun and it will continue to be so that suddenly you know i 'm at i 'm amongst the people of words and that 's a different a slightly different world and maybe that 's why i found myself doing it because you get rather stuck in that cute area of being a cartoonist and you get stereotyped just stay there stay drawing the ducks and i like it but there 's more to life of course and all those drawings um that they 've been very enjoyable but there 's 's all vague and you can kind of see many meanings in it and and the trouble is you can hide behind that a bit no one 's quite sure what you mean and it 's easy to keep on not really coming clean if you know what it means it 's beautiful but there comes a time in life when you want to say what you mean i don 't know whether that 's a wise thing to do or not but it 's too late now and um so yeah the the compulsion to write is seems to be a natural development and wanting to talk to society and as an artist or a visual artist or a cartoonist you eventually get talked about and you get criticisms and all those things come at you it 's always in the form of words words this intellectual process and dissection and criticism and but as a drawer you have to always sit there like a child and take it in a sense i mean obviously i you know you can talk back to it but but to write back bit more you want to talk back to to it and so that the book has come about from doing a column for the melbourne age i started to create a column called curly world and it 's the idea that the world is a curly place delightfully so and uh frustratingly so at times and so i 've been writing and i guess it 's something of a memoir you also get to an age as you probably a lot of you know when you feel like you 've gathered some stories that you took for granted but when you look at them they 're not bad some of them you know they might be fairly mundane but they 're very they 're unique they 're their own things and you have this compulsion to write them down like a diary and to yourself as much as anyone else so there 's that element of memoir and and the storytelling that is natural to humans as they get older i took my father 's storytelling at the kitchen table for granted now that he 's gone but i seen so was something i appreciate greatly at this point in my life so i 'm leaving some for my children because i hadn 't written for so long so to speak drawing i probably built up a bit of a backlog of words in me and i suddenly was like a kid let in the lolly shop with all these words and i stuffed my face with them i 've had a tendency to override you know like a cook who was dying to get all the ingredients and throw a bit of everything in but that 's how i feel now when i look at some of them i think oh i better learn about minimalism too but look there 's so many pieces here there 's more than 50 little essays each probably about 1500 words and um they just cover so many things they arise from my own life principally they arise from my own life i mean you know the locale i live in what i experienced from day to day set against world events and the things that have consumed me the politics of the violence of the world etc etc on one hand and then this you know others domesticity and the geography of your life and where you find all your conservations and your delights and where your life is and it 's blending a lot of this book is kind of blending these things together so it 's very difficult to know what to read to you tonight it 's as if i 'm reading your little bedtime story and there is a piece called the bed in winter with the bed in winter and i don 't know why i could have easily flicked the next page build shelters for the soul and i could have read that and it would have worked as badly or as well as this one but this is the bed in winter and it was a reflection it was written in midwinter and i live in a rural fairly remote part of northeastern victoria which is not endowed with lovely cafes and coffee shops it really is very rural and nature goes on like a great drama all around and you can 't control very and it teaches you a big lesson every day and i kind of like that and it 's a lovely perspective through by which to see politicians and society just from the perspective of nature 's vigor and uncompromising qualities so the bed in winter and i haven 't read this just lightly at all since i wrote it really so i might stumble the shortest day of the year has passed it winter deepens and the heavens grow dark and strangely disturbed particularly when you stand alone on a windswept rock in the highlands and project the dilapidated contents of your soul upwards onto the swirling clouds on the hill near the house the granite aches with cold and rain as fierce and bitter as barbed wire lashes through the naked fruit trees which quiver like nerve endings in silhouette where the garden meets the sky behind these dripping black skeletons of summer the valley fills with white mist and the bush there sinks from view leaving you rubbed up alone and floating in a mysterious poetic state a cloud land where the differences between sodom earth cold thorns mortuaries that are scattered and hidden in the bush snakes lie in icy coils as dormancy plummets their deathwoods and down into the misty valleys by the edge of the swamp on a patch of native grass lies the body of the black wallaby_._485.12 our spiritual companion placed there in reverence after being found dead in the front garden his mortal remains now ravaged by crows and foxes no doubt but he is sleeping peacefully in the dream time as the rain beats down its wonderful eulogy upon the land in winter we go to bed and turn out the light the rain hurtles down the iron roof is a musical instrument the wind binds and begins to sing its old primal song to the dark little house at the edge of the forest barry the cat leaps upwards out of the black and finds the shape of human feet where he curls into his sleeping position the quilt of a minion peaceful news feathers is snowing and warm and wise it is much more than bedding on a terrible night like this it is the answer to the problem it has been carefully filled not only with goose down but also with goodness compassion inspiration and healing atmospheres the quilt is the perfect solution to every problem that ever beset the world also it seems as semi-consciousness swirls about the pillow farewell farewell everything will work all shall be well in the dead of night when the breathing is shallowest and the pulse is most faint and we lie dreaming just a heartbeat from heaven 's door there is a pause in the rain and i wake in the blackness of deep exile a million miles from the lights and the laughter of civilization a billion years from art friendship childhood and the sweet warm smell of the earth and its blossoms in spring the heart lies motionless like a disabled submarine down in the blackest mud on the cold ocean floor it is the dreaded 3 am wake up an event that a great polish poet has described as the time when not even the ants are happy barry for god 's sake barry where are you speak to me barry please there is no answer there is wisp of hope outside the moaning of the icy wind begins to grow and the music of the night is about to move into another dimension the drifting semi-conscious mind at night can be a garden of eden a painter 's studio a console a consoling cornucopia of love 's pleasures or as on this bleak and pitiless night it can be an ugly concert hall featuring a brutal and savage new opera called death damnation and despair a performance dedicated to none other than myself the whole thing is sung in english and it 's english and has english subtitles projected above the stage for good measure the soprano begins with an aria about life 's brevity and impossibility including a refrain about the appalling nature of humanity the chorus then sings the great anthem detailing foolishness my personal failures bad choices and regrets and the idiotic position i have now got myself into next two tenors singer frantic duet where all my deadlines and obligations and commitments are listed well the soprano charms in occasionally with mocking laughter and sharp comments about my various ailments and how horribly by grizzly fate we have the mad scene by the entire cast where everyone dies in massive pain exhaustion and torment and is filing his way to an understated finale a haunting violin solo that finishes up quite unexpectedly with an astonishing passage of divine levity delicacy and simplicity barry jumps back on the bed as the curtain comes down and off i go to sleep again in search of the impossible dream in the morning it 's still literally cold and raining even harder but a humble cup of tea to a man who did not die in the night is a sacred and beautiful ceremony life is a bright miracle once more and soon if he holds the cup with suitable gratitude there will be enough warmth and strength in his hands to seize the day and so the man will go forth into life and the 24-hour cycle will start all over again what a magical thing is the bed and what a vulnerable innocent creature is the sleeping human the human who never looks more truthful or pitiful or benign the curled up child-like dreaming soul and can there ever and can there ever be a safer happier head than the weary one as it sinks onto the pillow at the end of another day on earth of all the seasons winter is the most conducive to the great art of dormancy this art requires an appreciation of semi-consciousness the beautiful and necessary prelude to sleep a special pleasure in itself that is all too often neglected undervalued or looked down upon semi-consciousness is the gradual regressive transitional state between attentiveness and sleep neither here and neither there a drifting dumb surrendered angelic state graceful letting go a fading of anxiety and conflict a sweet limp and sometimes fertile visionary stupa in which images words and senses begin to lighten and re-constellate harmonize or merge and float about in blissful array the ability to prolong and enjoy semi-consciousness is one of life 's most valuable skills and winter is most certainly the best season in which to practice sadly setting consciousness along with daydreaming is actively discouraged among children in schools and our society is much poorer and harsher as a consequence the value of liminal rural areas open fire meditation is traditionally used to induce semi-consciousness before bed and gentle reflection reflections upon hot coals in the half are known to cure many troubles herbal teas are excellent sleeping potions and while their popularity is relatively recent their history reaches back to ancient times and wonderful witches wine can also be used as a as a pleasing soporific but caution is advised in the old spanish saying wine makes a bad mattress a good conscience on the other hand is reputed to make a good mattress but there are enough examples of well-slept business tycoons to cast out of policies a democracy is no real democracy if the citizens are prevented from sleeping well it is said that a single motorcyclist with a faulty muffler can wake up upwards of 50 000 parisians if he or she hurtles through the city at 3am and if this is the case then an argument can surely be made for the return of the guillotine the bed is the ultra cradle of health peace and the vision splendid it must be kept so as a child i dreamed hover high over the countryside near my home while snug and secure i look down and wonder at the great carpet of life which seems so perfect to me there lay my world the river the escarpment the swamp the quarries and factories the houses and the horses all at peace and glowing with tranquility the moon rocket or the jet plane may be impressive vehicles but the bed no matter how humble is infinitely more magnificent and important the board the bed we are born in the bed we embrace and pray in the bed we retreat to and healing the bed we grow old in the bed in which we repent and change our minds the bed of dreams of revelations and a fevered coma the bed we whip alone in the bed we sit next to or stand by and see our loved ones die in the bed we die in and of course the dear trusty bed we rise from to meet the dreadful and glorious new day um so that 's been the sort of thing i 've written about my bed because i like like there 's a little bit of a satirical piece here oh i only read it a bit obvious there was a time when i couldn 't pick up a paper without there was a columnist banging on about these terrible wet left lefties and bleeding hearts and liberals and what a terrible bunch of people they were uh we were all the nation was falling apart because and i wanted to confess confess that i was one of these wet lefties who 's it called lefty me i must warn you here right here now that i 'm a wet lefty a leftist and also a member of the bleeding heart liberal left i had no side in whatsoever i woke up one morning and these things were tattooed across my forehead anyway we are a homogenous group all more or less identical and we meet every thursday night in the secret fairy del that lies within a beautiful ferny glade in the old growth forest the moral high ground you might say we practice preaching and the double standards for which we are famous we hug trees and the sublime pleasure of gleefully ignoring the human rights abuses of terrorists and certain fascist regimes we achieve this state of rapture and denial by drinking chardonnay and losing ourselves in reminiscences about the 60s when we were all promiscuous hippies living on social welfare smoking dried banana peel and making snide jokes about vietnam war veterans let me tell you it 's such fun we sway about under the moonlight in our dirty old fantasies and tattered caftans to the sound of the rolling stones it 's a hideous repugnant and deeply disturbing spectacle and i love it well such disgusting immature simplistic and lazy people we have no decent values no sense of duty and are clueless about the complex moral questions being posed of western civilization by the great threat of terror and what 's more we 're getting away with it it 's just effing outrageous i must say as disgraceful as all the sounds it 's been quite a hoot and apart from the sheer hedonistic pleasure of it all i 've managed to carve out a very handsome reputation as a leftist i don i am regarded in some circles as being in the upper echelons of the elite loony left it has come to my notice that there is an impressive number of columnists intellectuals and commentators mostly serious highly educated men who spend much time studying and much energy proclaiming my depraved leftism carefully combing through my words and my drawings of little ducks looking for contradictions and moral tumors with a passion and diligence that would seem beyond the call of duty dare i say they appear to be deeply fascinated with me although i 'm not sure that it 's an entirely healthy interest so feverish and unresolved is their attention this is not a nice thought but sometimes this fixation even reminds me of a morbid and steamy schoolboy crush the signs of obsession jealousy and fetishism are all there in their writings about me and there 's also evidence of some fierce kinky desire to strip me naked and administer humiliation and presumably having escalated themselves to that threshold to then disembowel me and eat pieces of my flesh by way of stealing my secret and magical left-wing ride these days for despite the fantastic drugs and wild sex certain new problems have emerged like normal people leftists now have to get up in the morning and earn a living seeing as the fascists have come down so hard on social welfare and this is the cruel reality the good old days are gone and increasingly leftists are to be found working in ordinary jobs for instance it may surprise you to consider that a leftist appeaser could be feeding your mum tenderly with a little spoon in the dementia ward right at this very moment i 'll stop at that point i don 't think i think you got the idea but most of the pieces are a bit more like the bed at night i 'd say so i would ask you to if you like to want to talk about your writing i 'll ask you a question there is a piece about the duck i got such a i got someone phil mentioned the duck i think at the commonwealth games opening ceremony and for which i was very criticized and i don 't australian newspaper had a small editorial saying that this this nation 's gone crazy what is this duck supposed to mean you know nick is a left-wing pisa or something and um and i thought what is going wrong with this country when people are asking what a duck means it was just a glory holding a duck and there were all these sort of buffers scratching toes i thought oh dear we 're in trouble it 's just a boy cartoons illustration reassures you 're not going to stop drawing now oh no oh no it 's a habit and i can 't give up yes no i i love the duck and the drawings and that thing and to keep on drawing and the hand wants to draw it can 't stop even if how much of yourself you see looking back at uh mr curly how much of myself yeah do i see in this of myself do i see in mr curling not enough i wish i were more like mr curly i think um you 're kind of inclined to draw the world you want absent and that has always been my guiding principle with newspapers since i began i started to draw these odd peculiar things that did seem irrelevant and seemed a bit infantile and simplistic and the editors would invariably say what 's this got to do with the world what 's this got to do with what 's happening in canberra and i said well it 's because it 's not happening in canberra that i want to put it in the paper so it 's this desire to fill the gap it 's a seeing when something 's missing and i keep liking it to cooking and you feel you taste the stew and you think that needs a bit of bay leaf in there or something you know and so you 're doing that and it 's always so you 're drawing a fantastic a little world which expresses human qualities perhaps yearnings and oh i wish there were more people like mr curly you draw the people you the quality human qualities you would love to see more of and they are in the world most certainly and in this room and it is in all so the artist or the poet there 's always drawing it out and saying it 's okay let the curly come out of you you know and so that so i 'm not really putting things into the world i 'm drawing them out of the world that 's the hope in the way that music draws out our tears at times it 's not the artist 's planned intention the composer i think it 's the lovely thing about art you 're not cramming something into someone 's head you 're trying to touch that awakens and releases what lies dormant or semi-conscious or wanting to come forth so if i draw a sticker and i 'm wanting your mr curly to come for or your dark aspect or all these qualities that 's how and i wish i were more like mr curly more delightful and you know we know about our little bad tempers and things don 't_''_1605.52 we mr kirk doesn 't have enough of us how long does it take you to work out the calendar each i 'll tell you the calendar comes mainly from the drawings i have created within the course of the year and i sweep them together a little pile of them that i think are relevant and i hand them over to the designers at the sydney morning herald and they you know prune out the ones they think are a little bit tricky or something they make so they know their people their audience and they make so they make the final selection they do yeah so i offer them you know three dozen and they choose a dozen yeah okay and i 'm always curious about what they choose and this is one is a little bit naughtier than i thought would be impossible maybe i 'm getting more conservative oh every day every day but maybe you 're referring to that more serious state that i 've heard about that people become perhaps frozen or sort of depressed and just give up they can 't move i don 't think i 've ever really had that but i do understand that that thing of the creative process for will come in my head i think oh there 's a good idea for a cartoon or a painting or something and then um in my arrogance and grandiosity i think all i 've got to do is copy it down out of my brain you know onto the thing and that will be what never works never never works so this transcription from the idea to the paper networks and then you 're reminded yet again that it doesn 't work like that you it 's only the beginning that idea this is the door you go through through the door is a whole lot of trouble and it doesn 't work and then well it works but in a kind of a dead ordinary way you 're looking for that little sparkle or that big spot you 're looking for that vitality that 's beyond an idea where it becomes something unto itself not just your idea i don 't know if you know what i mean here but so that 's about the process of it doesn 't work oh i failed oh dear what will i why did i think i could be a cartoonist sense of failure time ticking i 'll never be able to draw another cartoon in my life it 's all finished and so the thoughts progress sort of more or less you know it 's not so dire but sometimes it is dark and then then you get kind of a kind of a disillusionment with your art your abilities your ideas they seem so amateurish so infantile what place are they in this world of learned people and these thoughts no this is the process uh it 's a genuine process so then you start to regress so you regress i regress sorry i 'm talking about you but i 'm talking about me i regret i tend to become more primal or something or more i say i start to regress and so instead of going upwards to the higher ideas i tend to go downwards which is getting lost a bit and all your defenses break down and you 're no longer you know a person who can do it your person who can 't do it you so you come back to this primal level and and that 's my way through it and then when you 're primal you start to play a bit more your hand gets a bit delinquent and does things draw things in a different way and there 's a delinquency happens and then you start to see something happening oh my goodness look at that i 've never drawn a thing like that before and when you 're having fun with a pencil your mind starts to think differently it just does i often notice that i can 't spell at all well when i 'm drawing i just make silly spelling mistakes really absurd spelling mistakes and so that 's how i find the new thing the bit i call the new you know that real creative thing that i love myself i get the delight that little moment of oh yes that 's cheeky that 's odd and i 've done it through a regression to having lost my way and it 's this negative capability i think that keith 's talked about the poet keats that that creativity get lost and not panic to lose all you know and not panic and to be able to hold yourself in that state a kind of emptied out state and not panic and to work in that emptiness when all has fallen apart so to speak and i found that if i 've ever done a cartoon i liked it 's through that real process and therefore i know when i transcribe that idea and i see how flat and dead it is i know i 'm in for a lot of work internal work and what i end up with might be very simple very simple and sublime to me and a dear little thing for me but it 's been a lot of that that process and so that for me has stood the test of time it 's him seems to keep happening like that yes this seems to be a great very profound spirituality um throughout a lot of your work and i wonder if that 's always been a part of your life i profound spirituality through my work has that always been the case going back to childhood i feel that the sort of things that draw my eye and my ear and my attention are much in some ways similar i don 't see any dislocation between my childhood concerns and um i think i knew more as a child than i do now in some ways quite truly i know that sounds like a bit of platitude but there 's something i can 't make sense of it all now and i whereas the child doesn 't need to make sense of the child looks on in wonder they don 't there 's no compulsion to know what it all means i mean look at this financial crisis and this ecological sort of disasters and whatever wars and politics how do we make a kind of comprehensive sense of it well we don 't we make a sense of something else and i think a child doesn 't need to know quite so much so as a child i felt more confident about my knowing in some ways so maybe that 's a spiritual approach to love it 's the spirit spirited as conspirators as a child and to be quiet if you 've got to be feeling spirited a little bit of the fire you know a good happy father or whatever it is oh there 's one down here yes i 'll come back to you guys actually did you always there wouldn 't be many people in this room who did not draw as a child would that be so would you agree yeah i 'm always fascinated by the joy that children and get out and absorption children get from drawing you see them i thought i forget what those ages are when they can pick up a pin and make a mark on paper and they love it and get absorbed and do beautiful things and their parents love to put those drawings on the wall and their lovely thing and they 're very significant collections of child art in big libraries and stuff and all the great painters always adore children 's art and then something happens and what it is that happens i 'm not sure but often if i ask many of you can know some story a little tableau from your life a lot of you will say i can 't draw somehow we are taught that we can 't draw and i don 't know how that happens but it may happen at school might be just a natural thing that happens i don 't know but yes i always drew and loved it and continued to do so but not in the academic sense i i think a good drawing is a drawing you enjoy to do and that somehow you know it seems to live in its own way i i 'm fascinated by the indigenous way of making a picture and the ease and the confidence and the prolific sort of outpouring of mark making which is so natural to so many of those people i 've worked i 've spent considerable times in indigenous communities amongst such people and it 's just a delight to behold particularly very old people can so confidently let their hands make these beautiful marks that seem so right and so gross graceful and there 's some some vitality there and of course american folk painter or naive painter who after having a life on of farming and 10 children and all that that went with it in those times back when she lived picked up a paintbrush at about the age of 72 and continued to paint until she was over a hundred and left a great legacy of beautiful paintings which were adored in america and some of the most beautiful objects in america her paintings and i think president kennedy went and visited her in her sick days on her phone she was much revered and remained much the humble woman and she painted these scenes of her life in her own way not a lesson just painted you know the farming chores and picking the apples or whatever beautiful stuff yeah we should be a nation of painters in our old age um have you ever explored your alter ego like could you see yourself as another james bond can i see myself as a james arnold of course as well doesn 't he i 'll miss that one sorry james bond john 's body what did he like 's when you draw as the alter ego the alter ego becomes and that 's what i 'd like to be a doctor or have all of the black qualities or live the life of a duck you know all that time to dabble about and not have don 't do any deadlines and some of you that 's my alter ego and i 'm this other angel sort of a person just flitting about when i draw an immortal or something yes you said everyone draws as a child but i was a kindergarten teacher and there were many many children who were frightened of drawing even at the age of four and i know myself that i have never been one to draw within words yeah sometimes i wonder if the words get in the way of the drawing if the words come too early in the child 's life or you start to read i read very early that it stops the drawing and the fear is is there even now to actually be able to draw um it 's it 's that i had one grandchild three and it was just a wonder to see whereas the other two boys are again taking a long time to to draw happily and you could could you account for that in the grandchildren why one well the one that drew very well and still can did not learn to read until he was about no oh no really well you know he didn 't like reading whereas the others are very keen on myself i wonder if it 's his left brain right brain thing you know but that is your writing is brilliant therefore you have been able to put them together well i really am interested in the pre-language time in our life when we have no words and yet we have so many sensations and so many emotions in that developmental time and i think it 's hugely it 's fascinating what was that pre-language time all about because i think it still plays upon us and it 's what i mentioned donald winnicott in my book someone who 's writing i 've loved so greatly but donald winnecock was a psychoanalyst a pretty psychologist mother child relationship and what happens in that relationship at the beginning in the formation of personality and i think that pre-language time he calls this this is the time of the primitive agonies so that there are great sensations he said never are we more emotional but we don 't have words for it so it 's really fascinating and i think art is born at that time somehow and and let me say my children my two youngest children have been uh up till this year been home educated so i 've got a boy who 's 13 and a girl who 's 16 and they 've had their education at home on the farm so to speak and following their blessed bit and working finding the lessons in where their interest goes now this is a great risk to take and the parent 's heart is always in its mouth whether this is wise however the boy did not read till he was 11. he wasn 't interested he drew and he drew and he drew and people said oh don 't worry that 's what boys girls will more likely but when they start they 'll never stop for the rest of their life and it 's turned out like that suddenly the boy found the book and started to read and he read and he read and he still reads and he dearly loves his books and goes to bed read whereas he 's a lot of his mates who were kind of was drummed in real early that get him away and read really why he 's child 's reading and it 's only three months old and they sort of not reading anymore so far it seems to be happening like i should um i know i i can 't think of the one i don 't i can 't think of the one i think it was a sort of a war book it was might have been an old something that belonged to another era a children 's book something like beagles or something like this but it was not that it was something that i don 't know but there were little pictures and it drew him in and he a reader no because i was always this kid who used to sit in a meeting and i 'd be dying to ask a question and i 'd say no no this is too stupid though my question is the stupid question but i always usually that 's the best question and every tv interviewer knows uh you know the comment you make just when you think the interview is over is the one they 're looking for but we 'll get back to you please i hope it 's stupid because that means it 'll be really truthful i could ask you what 's the world 's tallest below ground river or something why no in the lobby you talk about the celebration of individual individuality in everybody yes um how 's that possible in the world of work in the world of work a box to fit into well well it 's it 's a contradiction and it 's difficult but we 're talking about i mean we can write ourselves off we 're finished um we are what we are i 'm telling you about in the know surely we aspire to some personal authenticity and individuality and we are aware of of the of the dullness of conformity and i 'm not talking about that natural civic conformity where we act as a group and we accept to you know conform along certain lines to the betterment of each other i 'm talking about the unnecessary rigidity and conformity we don 't like that do we we all believe that we are told unto thy own self be true at school you know be true so be honest the minute you do so they come down on you so this was an obvious hypocrisy i found at school let 's say what you think tell the truth the truth is raging out of control in your head you wouldn 't miss it so yeah how do you do how do you have individuality well you must or else you 'll be very miserable i think eventually eventually people chug their jobs in because it 's killing them because they want to live because they want to come to life we do live in a time of the thing they call depression and what is this lifelessness and this feeling of meaningless life that cripples so many and and it might be something to do with we 're not we 're living alive we 're not being ourselves and from the beginning maybe this i feel there 's a link there and how do we do it what isn 't that what all the religious texts are about how do you become who you are in some ways how do you and that reference to god can be poetically interpreted as that god who is your authenticity maybe you know how do you find that god and it 's not a demon it 's a great thing surely i don 't know i 'm getting airy fairy now but i don 't want to know this to finish out but i do think it 's a really important part of my book is this feeling of of having one 's truth and it does it is compatible with your truth and everyone 's just somewhere there 's a meeting point i think there 's some fear of we be true to ourselves i think the opposite is out of control substantially and i think it 's always and that 's what the artist is always asking of society is the poet the writer is oh it 's like come on let 's be truthful let us be ours i said it 's great there 's mature you know the little acorn knows how to grow up into a big oak humans have a problem with this growing up and being the fully expressed self and i i reckon it 's a lifetime 's work and it 's the only work worth doing in there for the sake of ourselves and our children and each other all right what a way to end the year it 's been a great year and i know looking around here and i see a lot of faces who are here every time we have an event here i 'd just like to thank the library for um supporting these events and you for coming along to them um it 's not a bad job i have um and you know we order next year is susan duncan in february tickets go on sale in in january um i 've got an inkling today that we might get to be able to get alexander mccall smith probably in the orpheum but so keep your eyes out for that one it 's not confirmed yet um michael thank you i have a we have a i have this here is giving you a look at the month um as our gift um but i 've got the opportunity to hear you give you my book of the year it 's a it 's a book called death sentence wonderful english writer david lodge it 's a it 's about a linguistics professor who 's had to retire because he is going deaf and the trouble he gets into because he hasn 't quite heard what people are saying i just have to say that once i got my wife to read this he was much more sympathetic i was born deaf in one ear i 've always had trouble um hearing what people are saying and you 're standing on the wrong side this little funny bit i won 't take much time that was deaf and then this one here when i had some a little funny thing happened in this eye a few years back and uh there 's something a doctor called a vascular event which i really love and it means that all those wobbly lines if i look out of that eye i see you all a bit here it 's not badly hard _"

    "text": "okay i 'm simon guey and I 'm the maker of its exhibition the syndicate that 's mentoring around Australia I want to explain to you that I 'm not normally in this state but a motorcycle accident which makes me look strangely like some of the sculptures that I 've made here but just to make mention of the people of support of this exhibition the exhibition is called The Syndicate because it ended up being organized to have a syndicate of collectors they were art collectors interested in my work previously most of them and they put in a share each to end up with an artwork so there was a great deal of trust involved in that because I told them that they couldn 't expect a particular artwork they didn 't have any creative control I told them that I 've been making life-size works about as the human condition obsessions are previously worked with another work but I really couldn 't promise them anything else so I really appreciate that level of trust and of course that freed me up from trying to get other a full year and a half or nearly two years working i would say obsessively on these works i 'm very proud of the work and i 'm very grateful to those people now that syndicate was primarily organized by an extraordinary man Lloyd horn who has a major collection in Western Australia and supported the whole project and I 'd like to let you know also that the syndicate continues now with another West Australian sculptor of real note Peter daily I think I became a sculptor if that 's where i am now just in a way it was about the the broadest possible job description in a way i really liked making stuff and it seems that most of the other parts of occupation seem pretty narrow to me and and and i was interested in stuff that was quite mysterious I guess art means that I can explore stuff that I don 't know I 'm kind of what I 'm doing even with my students I tell them that it 's almost it 's a profession of being lost all the time it 's one during the wrong spot so for me it was about the love of making and expressing ideas through that to make each of these works roughly talk about I guess two months or so each and sometimes there 's some a lot of dead ends that I went down that were costly timewise the process starts with an idea and often it 's just a simple drawing in my drawing book and then I 'm sort of trying to work out how they connect with the ruminating kind of thoughts that are mum having at the time so after that design development it really comes down to making three-dimensional that idea so as you can see that the works are made of sheet of Steel it 's almost like making a patchwork of it 's kind of like boys patchwork really it 's like little bits of steel welded seams and then sometimes the seams are polished or coated and sometimes they 're left with the the welding marks almost like cigars and the middle that 's used in this exhibition was kind of deliberate but I feel like the of exhibition where metal welding is now a pretty traditional and almost outmoded form it harks back to more like Second World War stuff and sometimes the figures look like and welded holes that kind of stuff I guess one of the examples of how made the works is architect which I think you can see over my shoulder at the moment and that work was made with the sheathing of the steel and it 's also got an etched surface of the spine and nervous system running down from the neck of the figure down to the base of his spine that work was really wanting to make kind like a patriarch and it 's based a bit on growing up with my own father who was a thoroughly decent man who worked as an engineer went to church on Sunday and and had all the expectations of his his society that things would be good and things would get better if you work harder and that technology would deliver solutions to all the problems of the world which it had for many many years and his faith would guess I was wanting to make an image of someone who had done that very same stuff and maybe arrived at a point of doubt or a very reasonable self-inquiry so he was made just by sheeted steel and it was deliberate that he would look a little bit like a I 'm see mine or something something that looks like it 's going to explode he 's kind of doubled over and you can decide whether that 's sort of some kind of angst or or whatever and he 's looking at his hands and to me hands a significance in significant in terms of being the primary tools of the way we manipulate the world so his hands the ones that have done all of the good work and he 's looking at them and inquiring of sort of what they 've been worth and on his head there 's also that geometric kind of framework that you 'd see as a bit of a cage and I guess that clear linear geometry is hoping to evoke an idea of that very rational way of approaching the world twin with the architect that I 've just talked about and as much as it 's the architect was referencing my dad or more so they could do a figure kind of talks a lot about my mum my mum 's family grew up and opened up the town of Carew which is a little way from Perth about 250 Kay 's away and in the span of her life which is about 76 now they cleared the land close to when she was born and now at well you know at the ripe old age of 76 that same land is pretty much toxic and and say line pretty hard to grow anything there so it 's it 's really the story of I guess that extraordinary situation where once again you get thoroughly decent people need miss reading the play environmentally so in that work there 's a a really strong looking figure i like to think and she 's covered with a sand sand that came from around the homestead where my mum was born we went out there on a trip and on the trip that desolate landscape which is kind of referenced in the tweaks and things that come out of the sticks that are holding the figure up and we went through washouts where there hadn 't been any water run through them for years and years and years but there was still those kind of tragic looking depth depth gauges by the side of the road also along the way we found one dead bird and so I picked it up and put it in the back of the youth and they were cast for the for the kind of diesel Prix wins for that figure and the sand as I was saying that was at the base of the the chimney which was the original house where the original House was I used to flock the surface of the figure with a William Morris prints print may well know was someone who really regarded the natural environment is trying to re-engage people sort of after the Industrial Revolution to see beauty in the everyday once again and so that European design is is the design that covers her skin with the sand actually ends up being a bit of a pun on the young artist spring that I used as a model for these which I won 't identify but I 've always thought just how much being a sculptor and a figurative sculptor I 've really loved the figurative sculptures of totalitarian regimes which has let me feel very nervous about my own politics just in terms of how come I love all these fascist and socialist kind of images when they 're associated with so many horrors in this case there 's a beautiful him which is the internationality which is of course the Russian national anthem and I think the Chinese national anthem which is a beautiful him quite separate to politics but just talks about the heroic idea of humanity which I love and I believe in an actual fact so I 've cast I 've an extra debt onto the surface of a large sheet of steel and I printed it and the figure has a wheelchair going through it my guess that was just wanting to twin such a heroic image with a sense of without which i guess is an opinion that I I have when we are in our greatest positions of power it 's often when we 're at our worst I think this is a work called tar boy and I might just take the opportunity to talk about how i use the body obviously very literally in some circumstances but I make changes to it so you can see that the figures got really quite a realistically rendered mouth open mouth and teeth and yet there are no eyes and if you see around the room you won 't find any actual eyes and I guess all of these speakers I see as internalized in a state of inward reflection or it 's really you 're getting a moment of real kind of voyeurism where you 're looking at those people I imagined in a darkened room or with their cognition really moving inward so it 's the case with this figure 2 and the little hands being separated and on hinges for me it 's about there 's a hands for me other things that I controlled or manipulate my that that sense of there being a disconnection got one right now in fact talks about a lack of a lack of ability of the time for making or doing or manipulating the stuff is stopped this is about stillness it 's not about doing and even maybe in this case it 's about a kind of inability to do this is a work based on my son and and also myself at around the same agent about that anxiety that I have for my son in a world that 's got some really serious questions about the future so this figure is some in fact covered with bitumen it 's a petrochemical product and down on the base his shadow is described by the bitumen road surface me when I was growing up I lived at the outskirts of the city I wanted to play in the bush and because we were on the edges of the suburbs it seemed like my culture was about bulldozing the bush and laying bitumen over it and I can remember the first rains in after summer where you have that really pungent petrochemical kind of underpinning of our our whole society and to me a very perverse attitude to landscape say in contrast the aboriginal people who saw that landscape replete with story and mean this is a work called finalist and I guess like many of the works and it sounds dreadfully grim but that sort of trying to find for human meaning through different belief systems has really kind of obsessed me of you and yet the idea of life after death or even a Power greater than yourself as in what happens when we adhere to say a belief system like a religion when it was a kid I saw the huge whale skeleton in the West Australian Museum and I was impressed by how beautiful it was and how tragic it was it was a huge three tongue chunk of dead animal and for me whales somehow in their benign kind of floating around in the ocean became a symbol of mortality and maybe God an idea of something bigger than yourself and of course there 's the idea of Jonah in the whale and I was thinking Jonah biblically is asked to do something that 's counter to what they would do by their own volition Johnny gets stuck in a whale for three days and thereby convinced to do what God wants he wanted to do and it connected up to lots of the ideas around the suicide bombers and and the demonizing of them at that time and I was thinking about well if God has told someone to do something as horrendous and horrific as that is where is their responsibility if there is a belief in something that 's the afterlife and and or a god and it seems that that idea of God 's quite alien to our Western culture so it 's a difficult work I really like the work and I think that lots of the work on make is about the difficulty of being a human being meaning and belief so yeah the finalists really about that final moment and the moment of testing if there is an afterlife or not so this is a work called confinement and people might remember that confinement was used as a term birth or soon after and it was at the time sort of keeping them away although made before except for female members of family and female friends my own experience and my partner 's experience of having a kid was a really strange one in our society where there wasn 't really an obvious place but the kind woman would be pregnant she was no longer a single girl you know getting it up and doing the kind of fun things you might do with other friends and also she didn 't have a child so she wasn 't part of the mothers club and I was just me thinking about how our society deals with that extraordinary transitional time for a woman so in this case I like to think of a figure Eight 's like a satellite floating in space once again there 's bitumen down on the bottom as a the kind of shadow so that might be the earth she 's checkered like they used in the 60s a space hardware and there 's some mobile phone towers and stuff I guess looking like part of our cities are now populated above the roof line with them so many mobile phone towers seemingly yearning for it meaning and just overwhelmed with information so all these things seem incredibly worked out of course those things happen in the process of making them and I get a lot of time in this video doing it so and I 'd like to say that any of the interpretations you have at least as valid and more so in fact because of your own story when you meet the story that I 've turned into a sculpture are particularly I wanted to talk about the work you can see just behind me here and because I guess it 's one of the works i feel that its most successful and emblematic of a lot of the ideas in the overall show it 's called corpus which of course means a body of work you 'll hear that about bodies of music or bodies of literature as opposed and it 's a bit of a pun in terms of this figure being a physical body or an idea of that anyway of the downed m and the American airman in Darfur where is dragged through the streets and a lot of these works reference things of conflict where there 's clashes of religion or philosophy inquiring about how we live in and meaning in this one the figure is articulated so to move it around it 's it 's like a corpse like a big sort of grotesque puppet but at the same time it 's decorative I guess attempting ideas of conventional beauty and inside the figure which of course is a corpse as much as it 's a corpus the skeleton is contained in each of the sections or segments of the body so there 's the skull inside the head and rib bones in the chairs etc on each of the bones I 've etched text from different ideas that people have died from from manifestos to the very young the various religious tracts of the Koran and the Bible Jewish tractors etc but the Communist Manifesto and even cheekier things like my son inscribed some immortal words of Darth Vader but quite seriously it 's really about the idea that if we do past as a physical thing is there something left behind wish I think the show this shows been traveling since tweaked out the end of 2009 and it was supported by out on the move initially in my state where it had about having five different showings there and then it 's been along the east coast Melbourne towns will announce in Sydney as the last showing which is great it 's really glad to see it here really beautiful put together and looking forward to see how people respond to it you _"

    "text": "i like the library i use that a lot yeah and it 's good and anything else you think could be provided um i think it 's pretty good it 's just uh the shop 's too expensive that 's why people aren 't shopping there because they were a bit cheaper shops i never shop in mothman down here as well as i mean around here the clothes shops and stuff and what about on this side yeah i think the problem is there 's no parking along that way so the shop 's there i 'm not going to survive because there 's nowhere to park you know so every shop that opens close within a year the same on a rimba road and stuff every sort of shop opens and then it closes there 's nowhere for anyone to park so it 's the parking that was really stopping people coming shopping okay in some places definitely definitely along that way on military road people aren 't gonna stop and shop hello i 'm a resident of mossman i believe what the muslim council needs to think provide a more cosmopolitan alfresco type dining area open it up give a lot more leeway and freedom to the shop owners i mean instead of trying to curb them and restrict the seating arrangements they have in the walkways and pathways give them more flexibility be like what you see in france where the cosmopolitan type dining out outdoors really introduce a great atmosphere to the area so i think there 's a lot that the mossman council can do to brighten up this area i live just down the road here 's and i 've lived here probably 20 years what i like to see probably more down military road down towards the mossman uh village is more a few more open area restaurants after because after about five or six o 'clock at night there 's nothing there 's only one or two restaurants there too i think two or three yeah that needs to be opened up a bit more to get more people in because after six or seven o 'clock at night there 's no one around yeah other than the pub they 've that 's a plus but yeah that probably doesn 't need a few more restaurants well if you look at the retail around down at military road they come and go yeah if you look at their shops how many we counted how many did you count for 13 empty this week so really i don 't know what the answer is yeah i would think probably more night more quality restaurants cafes are probably seem to be going well and even what is lacking here is even what they 've done in little bay now the wine bars apart from the overpass the bridge i 'm quite effective but if you want to go across the road there 's no has everyone cut to the news agency yeah and i think it should be definitely with trolleys somewhere you can go straight through yeah i think um you know more pedestrian arcades so really encourage you know more of a community environment so something similar to the area you 've worn pink shirts today is it facade i think this is great though it 's really villagey and good eating like we don 't have 45 options now enough we don 't want to work either but like i said with a shopping trolley it 's real fun yeah because i don 't like parking on that side of here and so if i 'm parked here it 's a little new center for shopping what about parking generally do you i don 't know i know you 're obviously great bike riders but do you find you can park relatively easily no not really but if i do i always like because i 'm on this side of my possible the winning vista car park is pretty good if they 're going to strip uh and i reckon that for this area i 'd love to see more open plan kind of so everyone can come out like more cafes kind of happening and also maybe even more nightlife so more restaurants like the fourth village down there it 's really fun it 's kind of great on there gelato and pizza like night and stuff because with my family and so more things like that happening and yeah that 's sometimes yeah but of course we always parked there close to the fitness first in the cafe yeah in the car park yeah which is good that it 's free yeah but you need to you need to know it so if you don 't know it yeah you always go over a military road yeah and then you 're stuck yeah so and then you have to look for parking spots uh and that 's a bit of a hustle for parking on the street yeah yeah yeah and so you really have to know that there 's a parking garage yeah yeah and if you don 't know it then i think uh it 's not software yeah so do you live in boston yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we do now in general quite it 's quite good actually yeah yeah it 's just a parking lot yeah it 's just a parking yeah and what about the range of shops do you find there 's a sort of building leaving yeah yeah um well i think you need to leave like to do yeah we leave the area yeah yeah we do it or in in neutral bay that 's the whole overall investment yeah you see ij that 's the only supermarket and then of course yeah for us it 's a bit too far yep and the iga doesn 't have anything uh well that 's not true it 's limited it 's limited limited range of things so so there 's not really a choice of and and it will be good yeah yeah and for the rest is not so much for variety because it 's all all clothing shops yep which doesn 't really attract me yeah for example yep and you and you really so that 's not really local shopping is it either no and you need to like it as well i think it 's more um it 's more for maybe lovely people so for young people if you want to target us yeah but i know from from colleagues that they are because when we when we came living here they said oh i like your shops in mossman it 's kind of there yeah so yeah some people aren 't quite yeah they want to do sort of designer label type shipping yeah yeah it really drives me mad everybody trying to park their car in hayden street because that 's where i live right it means hey i don 't have people for lunch and uh b i don 't have people for bridge right because it 's parked out in hayden street with people who are too lazy to go under these friends yeah so one of the issues for you is um the high demand for the on-street parking in your street yeah and they can 't they can 't come for lunch because you can 't have lunch within an hour and a half right you have to have it for much longer than that you can 't have bridge for an hour so it 's the two hour time limit on the car parking that 's the issue

the things i look out for on the way which i 'm sad that 's no longer in mosman is one of the buildings it was one of the corner buildings used to have animals heads on it bit like the zoo 's entry

groundnut my choice was usually the merry-go-round but I do remember the little train and there was a little painted fluorescent skull in the tunnel and everyone was obliged to scream at that so I think that was sort of a half hour break out of rushing from enclosure to encode you seeing these amazing animals and I think ride I tried to get a backseat circuit which down it touch it other things the poor old bear pits used to make me sad even as a small child so I 'm glad that they they went other favorites Oh Lions yes I think one of my earliest sound memories is a sound of the meat slapping down on the cement because it used to be thrown over the top and we used to watch it go down the lines and rush at it that sort of splat noise is a very distinctive sound in my sort of childhood memory it wasn 't_''_168.14 till sort of later in life when you started taking other people round and visiting other zoos that what makes turanga that incredibly special place is that stunning view and you come around a corner and you just simply gobsmacked and it can be wet weather it can be dry weather it can be sunny it can be stormy it can be all sorts of things but it 's amazing the first director the LA soothes the LA soups were actually two brothers and Albert masseuse first name escapes me was director of melbourne zoo and albert had been part of the what would have been considered the board of the mall Park Zoo that precursor of turanga and they knew that they had run out of space and they needed to move and it was quite a long period whether I deciding where to move because por amor Park suffered from all the sort of biblical plagues and everything else including bubonic plague plague breaking out the Sydney the head floods they had fires they had you name it they could locals of Paddington complained that though open on a Sunday I had to destroy part of the animal stopped because of the plague for Fears plague would spread through Sydney through the animals and they knew I had to move to build a world-class zoo and he was a very progressive man both low surface which you can see in the design of Melbourne which is slightly older than current turanga but they went on a European studied to it which what we call nowadays went and visited zoos around Europe to see what the example was hagenbeck zoo in germany which based its design on terraces and no baths so hidden moats and a bath but they brought the ideas back from that zoo because it was the you know world-class so at that stage and when they started looking for sites in sydney which they did from about 1910 to 1912 they were looking for the potential to have terraces and obviously that point in Ashton Park was perfect for that it has its other problems for building of being sort of all sandstone and quite hard to build into but it was perfect for the terraces had natural terraces but they looked all over the place I looked down and Sutherland they looked at a parameter they looked up in the northern beaches all over Sydney to find a site for the zoo but the one they finally decided on was the Ashton Park site simply because the ferry already existed in the very wolf data point already existed and the tram line ran down there so I could get people to this lovely new zoo because it 's the year odd years before the harbour bridge was built so people had to get there by water or by train or by public transport so it ended up being fabulous site um and dears redwood hallstrom he was always an honorary director it wasn 't a position at that stage he did so much to keep the zoo going through the 30s and 40s and 50s he did put his stamp on it had a certain look during that period and it reflected I guess the time and philosophy about zoos and need for hygiene need to keep animals scientifically it did leave us a legacy of cement and cages for a long time but fortunately a lot of those could be modified or changed around but he ensured the zoo survived over a period where there was a lot of financial difficulties and things like that I guess it wasn 't_''_413.0 till the sixties and seventies where we started to see a growth of a more progressive and naturalistic zoo the original designs for zoo were very naturalistic there was to be no straight lines there was to be all a little while to get back to I guess that philosophy both strong and we had an American director by the name of throat I think both of them and a few directors during that period really did sort of drag us into the later part of the 20th century at that stage elephant ride it wasn 't it was both a change in philosophy and a public opinion but also at that stage the elephants were quite elderly it takes a lot to train and trust an elephant to do elephant rides and we had one elephant trained who would respond to one keeper both of whom were getting on a little bit so i guess it coincided with a change in public feeling and opinion about elephant rides and the ability of the zoo to provide that service so it almost meshed in quite nicely to sort of say i 'll look we 'll stop now because we don 't have an elephant trained because a lot of the elephants we started getting after that period were ex circus elephants who had had caused difficulties certainly not the they used to so it wasn 't until we got the new ones a few years back that were very young elephants that you could even contemplate allowing them to meet the public no bars no no nothing any any contact where the public can get close or touch an animal or interact with an animal always rates very highly on the sort of memory charts of people you know a visitor appreciation and things like that anywhere where they can touch things make things see things happen I mean a number of times you see baby goats born or sheep lambs born down that friendship farm because you just had to be there at the right time kids there we go oh my god it was fantastic can range from celebrities and Hollywood celebrities or actors and things like that to political figures and all sorts of once I suppose one of my favorite ones was Billy Crystal who is a delightful person very funny but quite shy and took a little while to warm but he did ask me when he first got out of his car and mind he filmed me in his hand ikaw and I said will just warn me about the close-ups and we after that we got on like a house on fire the diplomatic or political or we often get military delegations that are organized through Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra as a sort of feeling of for an afternoon on a weekend when they 're in Sydney and things like that so we usually get them for a couple of hours do some fill in time and let them take photos of sitting near a koala photo or the kangaroo photo things like that but Air Force One Kate was there morning off and things like that and they were absolute hoot they were very very funny particularly when they met one of our e-news who was in a sort of fairly frisky mood who had been hand-raised and thinks humans are Amyas or vice versa and he 's actually frightened of other he news but loves humans so when it 's mating season he gets very friendly one of the interesting groups that came through to the interesting groups September 11 from New York and it wasn 't long after expand month after and part of the debriefing Andy traumatising was a visit to Australia and we had them for a morning the other group that came out were some of the children from Chernobyl not long after the Chernobyl disaster and again I mean they didn 't speak much English whatever but to watch their faces when they sort of koala and things like that that was pretty special interesting that concerts have been there since you want since nineteen sixteen we used to have big concert ball whether the Platypus houses now and the zoo has run concerts virtually through its whole life they really became big time with the Twilight concerts in the sort of later 80s and whatnot I suppose with the more recent ones it 's at a time when the zoo itself is closed so the public coming for the concerts sometimes don 't see all that much of the adults obviously being night time and after hours along the animals it 's their rest periods so they are locked in night houses experience as such or an animal encounter experience the concerts perhaps are all that high but the sounds that people hear the feeling the special venue I think give people a chance to say oh god I haven 't been fitted for a long time I 'll come that in a few weeks and take the kids which is what the zoo hopes for obviously even when it 's not an official opening time for the zoo it does you hear it so often from the visitor must come back and see this properly so that 's nice the zoo itself as a staff is almost a community in itself you have everything from carpenters to accountants to zookeepers to vets to archivists to you name it it 's a whole range of skills and it makes it an interesting place I mean what some of the keeper stories are extraordinary and some of the dedication you see from them to professional zoo keeping I guess a little bit like nursing it can take you anywhere in the world because of skills are transferable so they 're lucky in that think you are amazing people what you do and the hours you give the dedication zoo probably before my time there was a lot of family you know he dad was an elephant keeper so you became an elephant kick there 's a lot of family follow up these days obviously TAFE runs animal care courses and things like that so they have to come up with basic qualifications some small group of volunteers move across but not many it is a highly sought after position these days there 's so many people who want to join the zoo I think a lot of people until they become involved with the zoo don 't realize the complexity of the place just storage of food preparing food for animals and things like that yeah one of our biggest expenditure items is fish for things like seals and a lot of animals eat fish we have agreements with fish markets anyone seasonal varieties we need and we need a lot of varieties of food so many of the animals eat things that people don 't like to think about like maggots and cockroaches and things like that we breed some of those on site obviously it 's not practical for us to have a chicken farmer or things like that to feed our chicken so we did buy those commercially so it 's all those behind the scenes things that the volunteers help to educate the public about well if you consider that ninety-eight percent of Australia 's wildlife is nocturnal there 's a lot of animals living in the zoo that aren 't part of the collection like possums bats all sorts of things a lot of the animals petition in summertime aren 't necessarily locked in the night house they have access to it but come out one of the early stories about the elephants when they arrived was about a month after I arrived the keepers were a little bit concerned because they came in one morning and the elephants seem to be terribly lethargic and tired and we have cct TV to monitor their behavior and whatnot so we understand what they 're doing and keep an eye on them at night and so they played back the night in the mode and had a wonderful time and they were just exhausted loads have come inside to have a bit of a snooze now I mean no one in their right mind would knock down that main entrance it 's just beautiful I know it looks like a demented wedding cake or something like that but it 's a style of the time it 's got all those amazing animal heads on the closer you look at it in all the moldings there are squirrels and koalas and all sorts of amazing things so hopefully that will be more picked out when they finish the renovations of that it 's also iconic it 's amazing how far you can see that dome across Sydney from the ferry things like that the elephant temple that you mentioned it had elephants living in it for 80 years now it has been done upon the outside but we have left the inside is a bit of museum and the damage that rubbing and where and all sorts of things can do to cement by elephants is amazing so it 's fascinating has done one of the areas that we couldn 't keep but people have very fond memories of was the old aquarium we have kept the facade and incorporated into the Great Southern Oceans area but people remember the DRA toes with the sharks and the funny old things down there unfortunately it was sort of very early what we turn mock rock which was cement sprayed over chicken wire and wooden superstructures and whatnot and it finally became too dangerous to keep both the keepers and the animals and for the general public and it made way for her great area but you sometimes think you know people ask fondly about it that 's why we keep the photos and try and acknowledge the historic precincts and the zoo with a bit of bit of history nowadays which is great and you need to move forward but you also need to need to acknowledge your past as well never get rid of the floral clock I don 't think or hope not it 's a favorite meeting place if you ask anyone even these days most certainly was when 't find mummy and daddy go to the floral clock and we 'll meet you there and people still hear them say that coming through the gate the fella um the refreshment rooms I remember them as a very small child they were very fancy in their heyday in the sort of 40s and whatnot they served huge meals and they 're their own bakery and our own kitchen and things like that they had quite a serious fire in the 1950s it was reverted to cafeteria staff food which is what I kind of remember but still being quite good it had a lot of surrendered hallstrom displays in them everything from stuff growing oestrus to birds of paradise and things like that I I don 't remember much about them they were demolished in the 1970s to make way for the turanga center and it wasn 't really until probably 10 years ago where real work on a new big cafeteria area started lots of little small ones but faking the public 's always being a bit of a challenge _"

    "text": "now this is a pork is specifically about telling stories and one of the reasons I wanted to sort of praise the challenge and the use of Storify 18 is because I wanted people to start thinking about how we tell the stories they have use this off the material that we go in different ways because you know in the end I think would be really a terrible waste if all we ended up your elders project through the database another database another set of names I mean I talked a lot about that you can use for example machine-readable making giving machines access to that I 've structuring the database design but the whole point of that of course is to create some space within which we can make human connections it 's all about thinking about the stories of their the emotions that they raise ways we can put these together and tell stories potentially take us somewhere different so I mean what i want to see what i see command is project with really as a platform for telling me all sorts of schools so not year ago now when I gather I talked to the Australian New Zealand society indexes anything like I want let 's do it there were testicles okay what I wanted to do in that talk was to try and start assembling the sorts of fragments that we 've been talking about today and looking at ways that they could be sort of brought together some sort of story which which talks you somewhere make you feel something but also embedded some structures within it so it could be interrogated in movies in different ways so this is the presentation at some work from my daughter this is what the election today so i started off from where we were in that particular room and started looking at some connections and where they might take us i 'm not going to go through the whole thing obvious i will point out that i did use alexander kelly the person reference in their diary framework this morning as an example in this is a hostelry his dead mother 's life after the war it was actually quite close to the venue i as well be if it was used in that hospital is actually in the collection of this young woman i found his deafness in trove and found a photograph well there 's a photographic text was written scrapbooking mapping our NZXT both is memorial plaque which is in the spring of predatory attack not very tough and we in my own that remains of my own records again connections layers and that 's his service record net forces their diary fragment i 'm just going to skip forward a bit because i want to show you another example i used so this is the service record of Charles deli Charles has a very different story Charles at mr. three times and its many please dieter each time I have problem with example if you look at the service record you can find themes like for example he had a tattoo seaboard Gordon water which is a girlfriend and they take his wife you can see that down there this is next to Cuba Charles survived the war obviously didn 't serve overseas and unfortunately wasn 't so lucky in peace now we actually know quite a lot about the early life of chana dal why because Charles 's father was Chinese Charles was therefore considered to be half caste and his activities we were controlled by under the West rifles and there are good initial Archives of Australia many many thousands of people to instruct you in the workings of eventualities that 's Charles in itune life there 's that photo from it 's not a certificate which he needed is going to give back into the country i 'm traveling overseas who traveled with you started to try and apply knowledge in order to be exempted from the dictation testimonies returning needed to add the certificate without it dictation test would be applied and the dictation test was just used to exclude people there are many many thousands of these certificates in the National Archives of Australia they are amongst the most compelling documents whatever sick and twisted yeah they have the photographs on the fat on the backside papers yeah amazing resource and with my partner kept it is it is a historian I trying to say trying got a project called invisible Australians which is able just to do that and I want to introduce this because the sort of questions that are grappling with in terms of your visit Australians are similar to the sorts of except what we do it 's those questions about representation how we how we present people 's lives in a way that they 're not just it 's a garden and that we create some space around so that we know there are people even if we only have a very small information about them we know that they have a life and it 's out there something even if it 's not knowable I think there are questions about design and interface creation that enable us to work on these sorts of questions and interesting ways so thinking about this in effect after my talk to the index is so enthusiastic analysis of Australians and I went away a little bit of an experiment okay with this we 'll just keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling is that seven thousand in just minute at the moment and students forget to air these photos like that photo l come from the certificates gentleman from the patientís they can actually do that context this is a ticket and there 's a link down there which will actually take you to record search the National Archives database if you 're interested look at the context within that kind of going to record the descriptive system itself it 's it 's something which is quite controlling again also quite challenging and quite discomforting in some ways to be confronted by that guy 's challenge one occurrence of those people we were subjected to the restrictions of the White Australia Policy and I 've had people email you say with other kids strolling through the wall places so what this makes me think is that you know when you start to think about how we represent this material how to start to tell these stories online sorts of interfaces we develop we shouldn 't be hung up i 'm making everything these the three sections thumb is a role for complexity and good as we develop these sorts of purposes and it these people all the people who are going to be in doing it the greatest respect we can show them is merely a reading us to use our own brains to actually see beyond what imagine to connect to see know that there is that like there now there are some interesting tools then you develop again which enables to start a couple more subtle and it 's very mental approach to narrative story to the way we do that online a run which was it been just recently released is a thing called neckline neckline is actually built on top of another system called Omega Omega R is a way of managing collections and developing exhibitions online again it 's free open source it 's the Melbourne some people can develop to the terror so you can download it and use it is actually a site where you can set up a free account online to play live in their country music neat line is a plug-in for a mecca one great thing about open source software is and other people committed ways so in this case instead of was very and make out in an ability to advantage collections and I 've got a whole new way of seeing their collection on from these are creating a plugin it 's gonna be hard for me to do just as to what leave one actually enables you to do and I invite you to go but it 's great psyche which just gives you some examples and it 's worth exploring in some detail but what it does it really starts to play around with ideas of time and space and how do you represent them to tell stories this for example takes a letter from a draftsman in the Civil War which he wrote to his daughter and within that literally actually includes a sketch map of a battle and so what we 've got here is the actual data we 've got the sketch map actually overlaid on the geographical features of the time and we 've got various elements within the letters highlighted very talks about particular places or things so if actually you can read it as a story to see if you see those about the whole thing that can actually explore bits of legends you can see the connection between the letter and the place to actually follow the progress of the battle different forms both in here I played our peace map and also on third baseman underneath so you get this really interesting conjunction of the landscape as it was experienced and known by listen in that that 's basically communicating at chili 's portion and give that overlay on the geographic coordinates and there are there are the tools built into neckline which are really interesting like you know in featuring a date for example they have an ambiguity slider so you have a hatful epigenetics you should indicate sort of the ambiguity around it date and as I as you can see here they 're playing with the idea of space and how its represented there is another great example which I 've going to do that itself it 's wonderful which takes a the work of a schoolgirl where she started to develop her naps and various states within the US but they have certain aesthetic and idealized overlaid on the actual geographic representation so you see the connection between this girl why how she was imagining and what was significant to her over later audience so really nice dialogue between again the experience and the geography so and I think there 's some real opportunities for using things like late line there 's a storytelling tool you can actually have the episodes going through Prime 's can have been related both through time and space and you can have those layers of ambiguity which I think the really important so why couldn 't we for example develop a way of feeding data from doing a bit into something like me more there 's no reason I 'm cat it 's all over the source again we should buy that data at such a way so it could be pulled in quite easily so somebody developed I could use it Asajj develop these sorts of complex authorities it 's all possible oh now we 're thinking about this sort of stuff I 'd go back to a quick bite beginning and I 'm going to read out big not life towards did not justice to its victims but we can take something from the past with our home cited clarity that between ache weekend retreat we disempower the people of the past when we robbed them of their prison moments we dehumanize them make them out puppets we are the more it seems to me so while that moves me and it makes me compact me as a historian it is a developer of websites is that we 've got to find better ways of giving the people in the past back their present moment and so that means exploring or making people aware of the contexts of this material so that you know the way we design material why we presented when you 're presenting a document being able to show those rich links in the context of you know it 's part of a story and it 's not just a nice landed at effective it 's so it 's about interfaces it 's about designs it 's about tools and there are things which we should always be thinking about how we actually use them about how we present this material because it 's all up to revs read a really exciting time like I said there are great tools coming out there are all sorts of resources being made available the digital form we can we can you know emergency project like this doing of it and we can see how we can assemble the information so it 's a great time to be thinking about how we can actually go that step further and create these spaces where we can see these lives that imagine these those we want to look beyond reduction data on these fragments and really see the people inside and I just wanted to this point share my own little storify which is about something I created recently I was you saw how i got i didn 't say in terms of the wall or faces that means the what i did there is download all the images of the certificates and then ran a facial detection screwed over which actually look for the faces on their image and i was able to drop them out I was thinking 're not be interesting to go the other way so the instead of pulling the face is out of record search and showing them on the wall if you can actually show the faces inside record search what would that do to a no carbon forming gate so i did it again i created a little looser script and you go it 's actually showing example this is the user script going to attorney for the series is very professional of the name how does that make you think about our class it 's a change your way you view funnier if you look at the once you look at file in detail that 's the contents of that file there are people inside so these are the sorts of things which you can be thinking about it so with that in mind I 'm going to send you off again to your groups now is anybody you 're happy to go back to the group 's who reckon so what 's up to do all you want to if something come up which you would like to have you 's say just over an hour and a half Becky sort of 315 oh ok ok hate it _"

    "text": "this is all wonderfully alive is traffic all the time of course I had some at all but this sense of people moving and you see people walking that I 've only got about two minutes to walk to look down the hill down the Water Street you can see Balmoral now to the head and that 's what I find was fitrah here John if some you 're in the middle of things happening around you you 're not necessarily swamped by them but there are people there and things are going on and you haven 't got far to go to get to anything and thank god there 's a post office a not far away and the shops are closed and it 's it 's not being what so maybe one of the writers show me and cliff one time said it 's better I belong to a village and you 've got that sort of slightly village thing and if you 're bored stiff with yourself on Saturdays or Sundays you stroll down to the Mosman Junction you get one of the little French cap is head in all the places they don 't often buy anything it 's always interesting it 's alive and warm you know your part of it was good there 's some very good musical societies around at the time they 've Rock darkness of some peach shimmer the original ones and the Metropolitan and kagura and and various ones but certainly the only one that I know that ever got to the year was Muslim so he did a little thing called the Geisha which is a very dear little old fashioned thing this is how they 've done it years before when the Mosman first came in and they happened to be a lead Mimoza san and then there was the second one he was lady sounds a lady given or something and there was a soubrette roll-call of them to get traffic and anyway I got it I got that leptin you know which gave me a foot in which was wonderful really and from there on and I sort of went through in there soubrette rolls and second leaves and things like that there would have been in 1949 would have been February 49 everything Asia and then showboat was the next one of course I did Julie and there from Julie is a wonderful rasa I had a way over time with Julie do you rush on and you rush off and you change clothes and you change hairstyles you know boom boom boom boom boom and you 'd finish with one senior three seconds later back more ways to start the next one but wonderful lovely show to do and they had a very nice King and the kids are terrific new moon yes I didn 't really get a new window the good roles and new moon and the Victoria and her huzzah which you don 't hear my job but six wonderful roles are sort of a woman laid a male lead a second male lead to lots of comedians men and women comedians we all have a terrific right got very good reviews from The Herald actually for it as well and that left was terrific a lot of that beautiful music Georgia to show but of course it is sweetheart ooh haven 't_''_168.69 played it for Mossman later on at the time that we were doing the made the mountains very pleasant plainly made everything else we just about finished and John Pierce of course was on jujubee 's staff so he had been to see it I think on the second last night something like that and following morning on the Friday morning or something he they were recording the Gaddis Moncrief show so he said declared if he must have Nev seen the rest anywhere the next thing I know on the phone goes and I pick it up and Johnny saw can you get me a seat for tonight I saw John it you know he 's been getting very well so well he said the lad would like to come I said ah we have empty of the whole but you know were declared it so we rethought and she came over bless her heart and she was lovely and she knew Lynn Godding who directed it of course because he had done a lot of the commitment in her comedy roles in Williams and while she and also funny things she said that 's the only time she has ever seen the made of Mars any other time had been produced professionally she was in it she was she was charming and then later on I suppose because a couple of years later when we did desert song she came over and saw that too which was lovely it was a good stage we couldn 't fly but we could take backdrop you have been 19 backdrop for showboat but it was had great depth which was good in the wings space was lovely and the principal 's dressing room was off to the side on the opie at the back and the men 's one in the women 's one and all the chorus dress downstairs a plenty room but for the moment you know but you had to go if you want to get one at the other and normally unless you could get behind a better office I mean you had to get under the stage not the other side which a lot of them do anyway but there was a lot of thing would have liked was the New Yorkers was on the flat in front of us you know we 'd have liked something Pepsodent I completely could have put him underneath it didn 't need but it had a lovely feel with the audience and they 're responsive and everybody knew everybody else we did three shows a year and round about February and June I think and September of July and September and you sort of went from one for the next of the next we finished one on Alice a Saturday night mostly another Monday night there was a little Paul a second hall my rehearsal hall next to the main hall which is where we used to rehearse and and on the Monday following the show 's closure we 'd have a party there and everybody would dance and do things and then on winter day you started rehearsing for the next one and say you went for one day mm-hmm is it like a family everything could happen in showboat happen in seven July and I think it rained practically every night so I was like wrong powerhouse blew up well I don 't know what it did was something happened these two sort of shut them off it could get up to about 00 it 's 5 o 'clock what happen anyway there was no power so we couldn 't use it anything and the Muslim Musical Society and Mossman Mossman daily were very good to a stage sort of hooked us in they had their own plant or something so we used to hook up with them until about 00 to 00 somebody could make up with the powered camping which wasn 't marvelous but it was you know you could see and then of course that that can 't go off and then van Rijn was sort of clicking about five to eight or whatever it was but people themselves oh you know really think think he 's a poor old old black one so then where 's the sound that was made for Sykes maybe Sykes had the bellows grew up a few years and years and years and everybody knew may mean anybody dance at all in most men you may for all the shows and and sometimes would be sort of some small part and did some pieces I would have as well we had berated College in which being Australian we had a bird that label I 've never seen so many dragon bird Magpies and cockatoos and bungees even little ones all the rest one thing about Mossman stage they could fit them all on road it was quite good we didn 't actually ever have our own leading man very much you know they used to have to borrow them and get them felt that society 's a lot of the societies found that they were difficult but we had Jeff chard and we had Ron Neil who was later on this journey on Oprah and Ellen Faris he was our last red shirt a lovely voice with lovely nice man Jack London of course played quite a lot of our leads towards Ian Oh John main he lovely voice again though they 're all at a premium the good leading men youthful reticent yeah he was comedian and Terry and I work together a lot and the comedy role material very much like Lynn got him bright and full of bounce good dancer good fill in anywhere absolutely but when it 's rise it 's lovely Eileen it 's not right it 's lovely it 's it 's been new to them and have you met communion with them out there they feel you they spawn they respond to you and you you can see it build you know and you can actually end up with sort of terribly extended scenes of ticking with comedy and stuff if it 's going well it 's a lovely sort of sense of this would be had Terry Terry Robbie and I probably had we had a little thing we did i repeating doo dee dum duh doo dee doo da doo dee sort of across this time we came back well that went on and on because it just sort of clicked and it was oh it is lovely it really is lovely they had some good solid girls to some I played lazuli about three times twice here and other societies as well and that of course an impact you can feel it sometimes I mean it 's generally a nice reaction because mostly there with you anyway they 're not going to sort of fight you but if you happen to click with it and it 's cool Electric hmm and then they give it newzik oh and you feed it right to sleep and it gets better and better and bigger long Robbie has me was very inventive and very fresh fresh calmly ideas Lyndsey brown Dave him a couple of very good reviews beautiful more reviews and he did a lot of production himself later on comedy and shows and things how to rock down down at can burn somewhere else comedians were very good sets McKenzie was another comedian we had George Brown of course was their original one from here he did a lot of work for them I mean comedians were good and we stuck and then there was Betty Parsons and Betty she 'll who sort of leaves and second leaders and and Rhonda Baker of course had lovely did some beautiful works which she was a lovely sari in lovely and she was and Jeff Gerard was in it it was like a family really they 've done some lovely work they did a beautiful Jesus Christ Superstar in the Mosman harissa oil room which is very small no but no way and no wing space romantic this one did it beautifully it just worked and they did it very well they do all their own things that they

    "text": "welcome everybody thanks for coming along i hope it 's going to be a fun day hopefully an interesting day an exciting day um i want to start first of all by um have you all do you all know mapping our ancestors like mapping our ancestors okay mapping our anzacs is a sign i worked on the national archives of australia and what it does is it takes the 375 000 world war one service records which are held by the national archives that 's the world one service record um and it geo codes what 's geo coding geocoding is a process where you locate something on a map basically you find its latitude and longitude in this case what we did was we took the places of birth and enlistment of those uh well the one service people and we put them on a map we found their coordinates and we put them on a map then you can actually just dive into mapping our anzacs and you get these little flags you can go through those flags and you get a list of names of people find more information about those people yeah mapping out anz is quite nice but um there 's a a bit of a disappointment really for me in developing it and that was that we can 't show all the places at once we had to actually design it in a way that wouldn 't blow up people 's web browsers and if we tried to show all the places which are like 10 000 or more places that 's what would have happened so we had to sort of compromise and put little clusters of flags there so you only see a few at a time and as you sort of click on one of the blue flags it opens up and you see more of the other planets and i want to show you a different perspective today i want to show you what happens when we do try to look at them all at once and this is using google earth and a data file draw from mapping our anzacs in a format you don 't need kml yeah i don 't know there 's much i need see more and more of those place names resolved more and more of those markers appear it 's actually very powerful i think um and it really gives you a sense that no place was left untouched that every town every community every street every home every family was touched in some way um and it was that uh sense that we wanted to get across with mapping our index originally in the sense that you know it 's all about what 's happening in these towns to forget about the sort of the national mythology for a moment and actually look at what 's happening in those places and to give those records back those real world service service reports back to the places that was what we were hoping to do with our beginning insects and indeed i 'll let you into another secret um the name that the development team wanted to use for this resource was in fact local heroes um but we got overwhelmed by those above us and we ended up being anz now the other exciting aspect of working on mapping our anzacs can go find a world with one service record and then add material to it anything they want basically photographs stories or whatever and they have done so in vast numbers many many thousands of contributions to the scrapbook and you can start just having this is the material that people have been adding through the world one service record so photographs notes stories and uh i 've got to start my timer and the and the thing which was most exciting most gratifying about this was people started to use this in ways we never expected so some people would just say this was my granddad you know thanks we miss you some people were quite quite detailed biographies uh there 's somebody who 's been going around um documenting uh memorial parks and gravestones and have been linking them to the world of one service of course uh so it 's quite fascinating to see the uses that people put to this and the way they give it meaning uh so they really made it their own and that that really is an exciting part of the whole with you one particular fragment okay this is within the scrapbook it was attached to the service recorded alexander as you can see it 's a fragment from a diary which was found in a family bible uh and you can read it there alex arrived from front wet day saw him caulfield obviously this was a very significant day in the life of that family um but we can also lead some more into that little diary program you 'll see that call field which of course is the suburb of melbourne but in this case it 's enclosing inverted commerce and i think that 's because the call field in this case was the crawfield hospital the alexander kelly who returned from the wall was not the same young man who went away to walk he was blinded in both eyes and one of his legs had been amputated he spent the rest of his life in a hostel in brighton so um you can see sort of depth of meaning you can get by encouraging people to contribute this material and how it adds to that archival sort of significance and meaning of digital history and the possibilities of digital history and often i talk about the way it helps us grapple with abundance deal with the voluminous sources which are becoming available online you know how do we make sense of all this material which is becoming available and how do we use it but there 's actually another really exciting and important aspect of digital history where there 's some real potential and real power and that is its ability to connect connect big pictures to individual stories to work from a map of the world to drill right down and find something that is as small and as fragile and yet as devastating as this diary fragment to make those connections to be able to zoom in and out i think this is a really exciting opportunity in terms of digital history because what happens then what happens when you have that ability to make those links between these individual frequencies small stories and these big pictures well the big picture of course gets a lot more depth and meaning and emotion and the them as a whole rather than just as individuals elements i think there is really immense power and potential in the technologies that we have to do this sort of work to make these sort of connections and to give us new ways of thinking about and feeling about and using these sources and that 's why this is such an exciting opportunity and that 's why i 'm so grateful to be here and part of this project what is the doing outbreak project well um it 's about collecting information on local service people people who are associated with monster and we will be developing a website which will enable people to easily contribute information photographs documents stories whatever they want to about those local service people but we 'll also be linking it so it won 't be a standalone resource it 'll be linking out to other resources relating to those people wherever they may be so in various archival collections in other world one projects we 'll be trying to find those bigger contexts as well as telling those small stories so what we 're more than just a list of names much more than just a collection it 's going to be a way of really exploring the meaning of world war one at a local level as it was experienced in mossberg doing what we sort of had to do originally with mapping our anzacs and actually situating that at a local level and understanding what was going on in people 's lives at that time so i 'm so glad you 're all here and that we can make a start on this today um and there 'll be some it 's going to be some really exciting opportunities not just today but for the next few months as we start to develop this project and of course any uh internet presentation nowadays has to have a picture of a cat so i thought we would keep up that standard um as you can see this is a catch from the collection of the australian war memorial it 's a mascot and it was a mascot which was given by the mother of uh captain taylor there who was born in mossman served at the royal flying corps rather than the local flying thing um so we 've got to remember too that people didn 't uh who were associated with muslims didn 't necessarily just serving australian armed forces um as i said he was quite a distinguished pilot he flew with kingston smith he flew with charles ball who also has a muscle in connection and he was eventually knighted and in fact we can even find out more about him because he 's in the australian extreme program so that 's just a little glimpse of the sorts of materials and resources and connections that are out there that we can start to make and pull together and tell these quite detailed and rich stories and we 've got chocolate we have chocolate we have prizes uh sort of spot prizes throughout the day if anybody can find any more cats associated with world war one that 's definitely a candidate for some chocolate and what we 're going to do now is start to think about and talk about what we 're actually going to do during the is a day to actually start developing the project doing some work and we have a program program okay now i 've been posting a few sort of ideas of things that we might do today on the blog and i mean perhaps goes without saying please keep an eye on the blog over the next few months as we start to do more and develop more and we 'll be seeking feedback it 's not just about today it 's about starting a process which is going to be continuing but today we want to think about start doing a bit of work start doing some tasks what they are are up to you what you want to do there is as i said there 's a few things on the blog for example we there 's a post there which talks about looking within the trade newspaper database of course do we all love the trade newspaper database okay and of course this is going to be a fantastic resource both for finding information about specific individuals but also because it actually gives us this little wealth of time within this area um now the aim today is not necessarily just to find a whole lot of stuff make a whole lot of connections it 's also to think about the processes that are involved here as i say this is going to be an ongoing project and i 'm hoping that by actually starting to work with a bit of data today i do a bit of searching to do with them playing around we can start to find some material but also start to identify where issues problems questions may be so as you 're sort of starting to look at stuff and work with material today i also want you to think about the process that you 're going through where you 're seeing opportunities where you 're seeing potential problems where you you know see there 's some possibilities for connecting material up you know it is about documenting the process that we 're going through today as well as about actually just achieving something in terms of collecting material um i also so so in the case of tro for example it 's do is think strategically about what we 're searching for and document that process so that we know what we 'd look for and we can repeat those processes necessarily see what 's going on so you might like to start doing some searches within trove seeing what 's worked seeing what they bring back the sort of articles that they bring back the sorts of information that those articles contain also um i i know this is george thank you everybody and certainly we 're working frog and george has uh produced a record of the people who are um names are on the the mossman war memorial and um and that 's certainly uh one of our important starting points um and we 'll be uh but what we want to do is actually sort of link up for that find other materials as well um and uh i 'm a member of the los monaro cell and a member of the belmont beach club and i 've written a booklet which lists all the names of the dead that i could find up on the wall memorial i 've discovered about 335 names of muslim people who died um i was able to locate the mossman people through a database called the aiff project in which you can search by suburb and i 've found about 1500 names of people who enlisted from washington and then i went through and i found the 335 well it 's a terrible story the list of streets in mossman is just incredible alexander almora award calypso glover mclaren 18 sets of brothers killed so um yeah so we 're we 're dealing with uh as george said i mean he 's identified a lot of the the muslim people who have been killed during the war um we 're also interested in those people who served or not killed during the war and the ai database is certainly one source of that material and what we i 'll go back to what we want to do is actually find the look through these various databases which are available not just to find the details but to also find the references within those databases because remember part of the project here resources wherever they might be to enable us to have those things so they can use the mos material as a way of getting into these various archival sections which are available so there are a number of resources there there 's the world one service records which can be searched by name through the record search database all through uh faced by mapping our anzacs there 's about 80 people who are listed as born in mostly mapping our anzacs there 's the role of on a database the australian law memorial phenomenal role and the embarkation roles at the australian war memorial as well the red cross wounded and missing files which are fascinating there 's also no george 's producers as well because they actually documented that if people had inquiries about what happened to somebody the red cross would uh investigate and there were some amazing sort of exchanges of correspondence and documents relating to those people and there 's also the commonwealth wargraves database um and that records where people are buried and it 's also useful having a commonwealth perspective has again picking up didn 't actually serve in the australian armed forces and there are a number of those if you go there it it it doesn 't have sort of full information about the people but it has for example the addresses of the next of kin so if you search on mossman you pull up the addresses of the the parents of the people the parents who are living in washington so you can then find those connections there so again it 's a matter of looking at the processes involved here working with what we 've got working with the what george has already provided with us us a bit and looking at how we can go further in terms of finding the links in these various databases and pulling it together um looking at what the sorts of information which is it available in each of those databases and how we 're going to extract and use that as again you know talking about the processes involved here and not just the endpoints other possibilities for for things that you might like to think about today we 're building look like how are we going to use it who are going to use it what the sort of audiences that may be using this material and what might they expect how much what they only what they expect to find i 'll be interested if people have perspectives on that and want to talk about that sort of thing as well there 's one sort of really interesting exciting aspect of all of this of course is the dimensions of time and space and how we use those and how we explore those in a project such as this if we think about space for a moment and how we can locate these people we can of course you know if we have address information and the world online service records do tend to have address information um we can locate them within boston um but mapping areas at the moment people are just geolocated to the level of the suburb is that right that 's an actual street that 's right so we have opportunities there for producing such more something which is much more fun rated at you know everybody just chucks everything up on a google map um and um you know thinking historically that might not be the best approach if we can use historic maps for example as a base layer for for an app and put our markers on top of that it could produce something which is much more useful in terms of visualizing the historical experience and understanding the historical experiments when we 're also thinking about place of course we 're also talking about where they went and what they did um so we have you know the battlefields in europe the various staging points that they they went through this sort of material is actually uh tends to be recorded again within their world one service records we have information on embarkation from the war memorial records we have information about where their graves are if they die of course through the commonwealth war graves so we have a range of spatial information which we can start to use and collate and represent but there are issues involved in all of that and that 's the sort of thing use it how we link it up where the issues are going to be where the problems are going to be the um um there 's also the bigger context of all this material of course and there are other projects going on to start to document some of this sort of material in regards to world war one and we can start to link in with that as well and there 's already information out there for example i mean if we 're talking about battles involving battles trying to map those on a timeline for the individual experience of a person there 's information things like wikipedia for example that we can draw on and link to which gives the context of that that battle uh in terms of their uh membership within a particular unit of the armed forces uh there will be contextual information about those units from the australian war memorial again so there 's those sorts of contemporary buildings which we can start to make in regards to again the world of one service records i mean there is actually a rich resource in tend to show the uh not the day-to-day experience but the major events in that individual person 's war experience so their movements their so lots of information that we might sort of think about in terms of mapping them over time their experience over time and place so one question which i have one sort of task which you know if somebody wants to have a look at it is starting to think about how we model that documentation within those files how we think about events events are something which always seem really simple until you start to try and sort of capture them in a structured way because dates are never quite as clear-cut as you think they 're going to be and labels are always a bit fuzzy so a task somebody could do is actually start to look in detail at some world war one service records look at the material that 's in them in terms of the documentation of their war experience and think about how we might capture that and then be able to use that in in a structured way in um now there 's material of course locally held within the local studies collection and donald trump to say something about some of the material that 's here i know that there 's sort of local community groups the uh the rifle club for example which is uh um going to be having a centenary of 1953 so that 's very much associated with the the war effort and that sort of documentation which is developed for that um at this point i want to sort of hand it over to you to anybody if anybody 's got any suggestions about the sorts of things they 're interested in exploring and how they might want to explore it uh if you 've got something you want to start on you know please put up your hand and say what it is the idea is we 've got a few different rooms we 've got some different spaces so that people can get together and work on individual things _"

    "text": "first of all I decide to acknowledge that were gathered on the land wautoma a glimmer of evil people and I respect to their elders past and present and to say thank you to the invitation to be here because mosman library has quite a reputation for using technology and cyber engaging with young people so it was great to have a chance to come on and talk with you I 'm part of the public library services team most of the State Library and that means that I work with all three hundred and seventy four overs around south wales and one of the areas i look at is children 's and youth services but also the social media space and what libraries are doing with it and how they can help families parents who come in and ask for advice key to come into the library and use these tools and trying to help them staff to be really skilled in helping those families but also helping people to understand the risks as well so we 're going to look at risks and some of the rewards as last 20 years a lot has changed and I guess this little Leo really shows how much has changed how quickly for all of us so so he 'll look at that I just think that 's really interesting because they do so late oops nice to play together because it is only funnies it isn 't a long time and I think what we 're actually seeing now is that change is happening in the faster I 'm the kids that we 're talking about the teenagers have already in just their lives life span so much has already changed to keep on changing and I think the rate of change is the real challenge so when you 're talking about social media you 're talking about things like geocities that started in 1994 already gone okay 2009 it closed down on it 's gone and we 're talking about things like Facebook the video about govern in 2006 when I 'm talking about technologies that have been around for years and that 's what I think one of the real challenges that parents and families is you know changing really really quickly and that kids are going to adapt to and start using and before their currency understand the risks that they might be dealing with so I think that 's one of the current challenges for parents what I 've done these presentations are very drawn on the work of three different organizations and individuals Danah Boyd who is a researcher based in the US and she 's just recently been out in Australia she looks particularly at that whole space around social media youth practices this idea of what 's public and what 's private because a lot of parents really worried about you know what they keep putting out there on things like Facebook they 're writing down she 's got quite a bit of research available one who their site as well as being bold as you can see on twitter the second one is began and will probably Research Center which is based out of Melbourne and this is a group of people who have been funded to look at the research around how social media can contribute to help enormous were young know risks and rewards to be invested and I 've also drawn on some work from you our Hillary 's an organization here in New South Wales because we 've done quite a bit of work m at the State Library over the last couple of years and they 've helped us out quite a bit dr. Phil nun in particular wrote some work force around him what is happening with you and with brain development and behavioral stuff so that librarians understand it and some of its need useful for us tonight as well so what I thought we 'd have a look at is teenagers real world and virtual world that is there really a difference easy of pre longing for those of us that are adults course series and we go actually you 're able to say well you know this is my online so and this is my offline so and maybe we don 't even have much or online self but Pitino dissident it gets quite that clear-cut and we 're going to have a look at the social networking tools that we 're talking 's new ones coming all the time we 're also going to have a look at what it a savvy digital citizen needs to know and what someone who 's a parent is going to need to know so that they can help them out and know the right questions to ask in the right conversations to have and I 've also got a phoenix or where you can get help if he needs more resources so but we would just start by remembering what it was like to be a teenager which you know nobody wants to go back in that space so it 's a bit hard but imagine yourself that age 15 can you remember some of your friends where you part of a group pour you a bit of a loner do you remember interactions between your peers was there any name calling perhaps a little bit of character assassination in the playground and were they believe in your classes a high school what 's been watching on 12 doors might not be very friendly did you or some of your friends engage in any risky about were you much more worried about what your friends would think of you and what your parents thought about anything you did and you know not much has changed teenagers are still saying but what they have now is this extra layer of communication and interaction online available to them okay so adolescents are really a mystery to many adults I think especially their parents and it 's a puzzling phenomenon when you consider that we 've all been teenagers you think they would remember what that was like but I think sometimes it 's okay we just get past it you know one remember it 's a time of course about change and three things are happening the ability to reproduce the establishment of an identity and the form of commencement of a logical rational reason thought now I like to stress the portal commencement because it 's not all there and it 's not all happening and that 's part of the trouble when we 're dealing with social media spaces because they 're great for establishing your identity they 're great for communicating with people but fast how with no brakes it 's not really going to work terribly well for you so the research tells us that teenagers don 't differentiate between their online social interactions and in real life interactions in communication with everybody doesn 't make any difference then I mean drawing any artificial lines and soldiers part of one continuum and that social networking relationships can actually be very positive ones for especially for kids who are trying to sort out their own identity trying to work out where they maybe they don 't have a lot of friends at school or maybe they 're friends are you know a little bit further away and they can 't get to see them very easily or maybe they 're struggling just with their sense of who they are where they feel in the world that can often find friends online that they may not one in the world and ninety percent of the 16 to 29 year olds are using the internet daily now thats australian research from 2010 so and ninety percent of them almost every key they spend an average of any other age group and there 's ninety-seven percent of them that are mobile phone and about sixty four percent of those phones the internet capable which means that they 're carrying around their connection with them all the time we 're always on in social media spaces it 's easy it 's constant by the mobile phones and of course if you 're always on it 's really difficult to escape you feel being bullied for example because it 's they 're taking it home with you you were back when we were at school but you were being believed you left school for the day you went home and it was over and you know to face it you 've got back to school the next day but these days if someone 's being bullied online that can carry on seven compiler the home if they 've got a computer individual all the new to their bedroom so that is one of the real challenges for young people to deal with in this space and of course there 's a like brain development stuff going on as well the back to the front which is really good because of the back you know that 's all of the emotions only losing and that sort of thing but it 's not the rational thought which is a bit of a problem is they 're acting and reacting and responding without the getting necessarily to stop and think about it and plan to make better decisions so that I think is something that can cause a little problem when young people are using these sort of tools and making choices that suddenly I visible published out there on the neck and they don 't realize and until they come down maybe that wasn 't the smartest thing that they could have done so this of course making those wires judgments and choosing to be a kind and very inconsiderate person is something that happens later just exactly and could explain things like planking which you know adolescent brain is working progress and some of the things that they have a difficult it with and I know some of you know this stuff is self-control so that those increases in your which can manifest itself in things like filming fights in the playground bring them up on youtube or on Facebook taking planking photographs and clean them up on Saturn I dunno some libraries in New South Wales that were surprised to find planting photos in their libraries kids to come in and taking these photos of hanging between shoals and things and put them on Twitter so I 'm shortsightedness often that failure to think ahead and seeking immediate gratification which can return into posting a photo that seemed funny at the time on Facebook and taking all your friends and some weeds out there abundancia but not just everyone everyone is beyond there because you tagged a photograph and I am your friend I 'll see it but it would end up on my wall everyone else that 's my friend that might not be your friends also going to see that photo so and I 'm going to think about that at all and they 're also very susceptible to influence at this stage of their lives and of course there is complete pressure and use an awful example very hard to ignore them if you know all your friends are putting pressure on in one why do you friendly work why aren 't you part of this this group or why you might wonder stop unfriended or excluded on a group equally can be a bit of a problem as well you may have heard people use that phrase digital natives which is this idea that somehow young people because they 're growing up with technology all around them automatically know how to use it and that 's not quite the case they 're not scared to have a go at using it they don 't fear that the invader so they 'll try it and they literally feel around and view out how to use it but it doesn 't mean that they 're actually automatically knowing how to use it safely and that 's what I actually stormy guidance and help from parents and adults in their lives to help them there are even educators are finding that when students go to university they 've really comfortable with technology they can do lots of wonderful to use it the way they need to use it when learning and manage passional settings I think that probably get struggle at their to social media as well one of the things I think that parents and adults really worried about quite a lot his privacy and is so I guess I 'm astonishment they young people we want to share so much of their lives out in public and when I was putting this talk together I was contacting people that had teenagers and contacting anyone I could think of who I thought we 'd have an opinion about to get a bit of a sense of how people would react and my mum who has a Facebook page but chooses not to put her own photo on her Facebook page said to me well you know it 's just like hanging your washing out in the main street and I thought well we know from hope one of you she 's very private person is no way she would put stuff out there and just probably horrified about the things that others write on your wall from 't avoid that researcher les has been doing has really looked at how young people feel about this idea of privacy and they still care very much about their privacy and I saw something really stupid on facebook on the way over here tonight and I thought I could show you that would be great example it 's a young guy know who 's lost his mobile phone and so is put up on facebook I 've lost my mobile phone I 've lost all your numbers here 's one you number just send me send me your text you know something look you know if you 're going to steal someone 's identity you know its name state the girls in promotion I was giving you his mobile phone number as well and never given his bank account details so of course I can 't show you that because we 've got to respect his privacy even if we don 't respect his intelligence particularly this evening and I think that that 's something that Dennis what really draws out that young people still feel violated if they 're to their facebook page and I 've heard people talking about young people starting to migrate off facebook on to Twitter because I think it 's more private no it 's mainly there 's too many parents and things that are printing them talk about peer pressure to be your friend on Facebook man wants to be your friend what you gonna do we say yes if they know so there is a tremendous amount of social pressure there and a lot of the Latino just sort of saying what we know is pretty you can choose to follow someone or not to be followed by someone much more easily and then come people can 't really do that much about it completely wanted that kind of pressure but Dennis work and also reveals that sometimes tengo just feel like the place where they have the least privacy is at home like you and I would think that perhaps the most private place we have in our lives easier home where we can do what we like Tresckow we 're like behave the way we want you but CN I more money come in my room she came for my staff or you know over my shoulder one watching something on the engineer or talking to my friends and that kind of thing so in her research over and over this idea that they feel like they 've actually got more privacy online than they do sometimes in their personal wives is a bit of attention and what they don 't seem to have is the power to protect their privacy and sing out of what she calls agency to actually control that and manage it so this is a quote from dinner and malice Malik 's work when I said that you know team teams are a little more visible but they 're actually helping the process is growing process of developing the skills how to manage that privacy and when i read that is that this is really like learning to drive you 've got to learn the theory but then at some point you gotta be out on the road and you are going to make some mistakes but what of you on the road to learn think it 's probably the same when we 're talking about social networking that actually got to be in that space they 've got to make a few mistakes to find out about what the consequences are and i think the last hope is quote is really important because the world that these young people are growing up in and the world they 're going to be working in socializing and living in is going to be and it worked well so this gives their learning that the etiquette if you like what the risks and rewards are is something that they actually need to know both for the work and their social was bored so talked a lot about 10 meters and if we knew were thinking else going to talk about social networking so we better get on to it so when we 're talking about social networking i have in my mind a big long list of websites I 'd like to know what you 're thinking about when I say a social networking what websites what tools are you eaten or anything facebook yeah Facebook LinkedIn asked ipod yes so yes I 'm is really interesting various because I think she eats select I saw what I think it is trust I not only traceable people can actually record a skype conversation or interview so I know it 's really quite popular with a lot of the young girls I like to have a chat to their friends through that kind of things they can see each other yeah that sort of thing and because you can record a session you know there 's falling out with a friend they could also probably at a decision use it in some way that she might not like but you know that 's about being smart i guess about not saying he was inscribed to be willing to say you know the classroom the school am only human but sort of you if I told my girl always being so you can but she still does so you make sense which is remaining yeah I don 't know how to stop it I don 't know they are set to develop their skills you taught me well so foot because you 're having those conversations fish is where it is wearable starts here on it 's the same as the other conversations you have about choosing your friends wisely and you know making your choices when you go out with your friends and you know do stupid things and that kind of stuff it 's just all part of growing up this century there 's quite a lot of these sort of sites and anything basically that you can interact with you can 't add something if you can comment on if you can share it and send it on to somebody through a network anywhere where you can publish your own content so that might be roadblocks and things like that early on people getting to tumblr or using noticeable you too or something like Pinterest which is the latest thing where everybody 's collecting all their websites into a visual kind of keyboard and then you can have all of us you can follow other people you can share you kings and this kind of thing i have heard people say that cuz we were popular popular voice you believe in a gender bias there seems to be a little bit of one near priced hablar tumblr it 's just another blogging platform so it 's a little bit like wordpress or blogger and someone might if they wanted to keep pets a diary online amazingly my sister did this someone so much sister and keep kept a diary online rotor source of emotion and about family through and they 've got very very upset we want to stumble on it and because it 's private it was out that we weren 't supposed to see it was alright for anyone else on the planet but we weren 't supposed to see it and that 's that amazing asian of privacy and what is public these faces yeah i think it 's an easy platform if you want to use and video clips and requires okay so there 's quite a range of social networking tools and I would hesitate to give you a definitive list because something would be turned off in a week or two and something new will come along and suddenly be other people I think are going to start learning away from facebook I think that 's just automatically going to happen because it 's so popular with so many adults that suddenly it 's not really very cool space hang out in if you 're a teenager anymore they can go looking for something else and I 'm amazed to see things like myspace and having writ a resurgence in popularity I would uh with what the teenagers would be interested in Twitter because it 's you know so you said you know 40 characters just like sending a text message but maybe that 's what they 'd like to see if they 're trying each from any info you can send messages that people can understand scary is there you go to see you on twitter i miss that critical about you know it 's been around or five years which is you know getting pretty long in the tooth in social media fighters um okay so what about the risks what are the kinds of things that what I mean you better than yesterday so it 's convenient think about these are mind early that 's always the first thing that kind of comes to mind but when I was doing a research for this presentation I found this amazing article about how William young people are to share their passwords and that 's got I think really quite serious ramifications if they don 't understand that sharing the password is basically giving away their identity and that someone can pretend to be you the other thing that really surprised me when I was doing the research was a power of some of the location services so some of the smart phones where you turn the location services on it suddenly the phone knows where you are and so your photos come up with the location and your tweets and you may be using Foursquare and marking you know hero at this restaurant or whatever and I think that 's also obviously I 'm feeling poorly done even imagine impact on their lives so the son William has quickly talk about cyber bullying and Denver words or search again looks at this area because she was interested in and she feels very strongly that cyberbullying is so apparent only because it 's written down because it 's recorded online it 's discoverable and that verbal in person being is probably much greater and it 's just not visible to parents you don 't see it because happening at the bus stop what 's happening on the way to school it 's happening playground or and something 's another way so when she really feels that cyber bullying is just one part of a bigger picture and unfortunately you know it is a reality and I mentioned earlier beside II that if you 've got your phone with you all the time it 's always on it 's always yet so if you are experiencing some bling and unless you 've smart enough to save your parents know I 'm being hassled and you know this month when you 're soaked into the phone take it away and give you some time out because you know what is what the phone keeps chirping away in your bag or you 've got an individual things like that it just target and of course other wing has such a large audience instead of it just being the small circle of people around the bus stop you might hear what has been said is that one who sees it out there on some social media space happy look people yes you can look people and that 's one of the strategies to teach in stews absolutely I think there 's probably a number of strategies actually when we get to those in a sec there 's a whole lot of different things that can happen with me there 's a whole range of awful things that human beings do to one another and it seems like they can do almost all of them in the online spaces with multimedia help things like flaming where people just you know stereo whites and insult and need to threaten one another that can happen or mean the obvious ones of harassing someone sitting with messages over and over that kind people saying terrible things about someone online it 's ideally person so I mean our public figures have that have little time I saw a and set up a linkedin account for her and situated her in Adelaide you she 's got no connections and their friends I don 't mean it 's kind of funny that 's also often because someone 's just pretended to be her and now created this account so and young people can do that as well I 'm outing people 's secrets sharing embarrassing stories and things I wouldn 't want out there tricking people into revealing secrets or information online excluding them from a group or stalking them repeated harassment sex thing which is a particularly nasty one where keeps us sending one another or threatening one another and making them send photographs that are partially nude or demeaning through cyberspace and of course those photos end up in those weird and bullying by proxy which is really quite peculiar where they convince someone else to send message some other person to put something awful up on someone 's page or send them some kind of threatening message Pauline so voting on what you do or don 't like about somebody I 'm sure you remember this from this person and the kind of thing only know you can do it polymetal some online you know gossiping about people taking the Barisan photos and that people this particular image is one just shows you how a mobile phone can be used for something negative where they 're filming the fight and that 's going to end up probably a photo on someone 's facebook page or a video on youtube or worse avielle usually gets picked up on kind of feel everyone and I think it is easy to focus on the negative because that 's what we see and that 's what we hear about Romania quite a lot because they are stories catch with his attention but it can also be used for really good purposes so there 's lots of good opportunities for them to use these tools and it 's about teaching kids the difference in case you hadn 't give her a smile about it one of the things that shocked the heck over me was about all the different kinds of motivations that you can leave the cyber bullying and it made your child 's going to be victim of cyberbullying but that without realizing it they might actually be a perpetrator because and some of these things just they just sound like you are going to high school and the vengeful angels you know they might be angry at something that 's been done and feel like the revenge the attacking is warranted now they might feel like they 're protecting another friend has been bullied or something and generally this person would be doing it on their own not necessarily working with other people that feel like it you know in their own breast doing somebody else and the Revenge of the Nerds which is someone wanted to exert some Authority or show that they actually powerful enough to control other people and perhaps with fear and these kind people want an audience so they didn 't do it in a way that other people are going to see you can brag about their actions and want a reaction and maybe escalate their activities if they get one and the inadvertent cyber for me I think that 's probably the don 't realize that there might be pretending to be really tough online they might be making really you know smart comments back to people or playing a role or well they 're not actually reacting to some negative stuff that 's been happening to them and then what we just respond without thinking through the consequences and directions they might say something that you could say you know back to you your brother really quickly in her how to be funny that we put there it might not be funny in cyberspace they might be doing it just because they can for the fun of it or joking around with their friends and it gets a bit out of hand and they tend to do it when they were alone and mostly surprise then when someone accuses them being a cyberbully I just didn 't realize that they 'd have it could be interpreted that way and then I I 'm sure I remember that some of you they 're bored looking for entertainment and unfortunately they are typically female and they 're mostly bully other girls not necessarily be doing it at a sleepover and you know will be gathered round the computer and please step up or new sending messages and being quite competitive about it you know sending something worse than the other one they want other people to know who they are and crave attention so some pretty horrible stuff going on out there camping in the playground as well it 's just more peaceable minutes online so what do you do what do you teach a kid to do in this situation if they 're targeted by a cyber believe in the first thing is to stop do not do anything calm down save the evidence and don 't respond one of the people who sent me a story to include tonight had a son he was 16 who actually got suspended from school because it was an exchange but we both had a facebook in the stuff that was not not they shouldn 't be speaking to each other that way but the person you complain deleted what they said and just brought in a printout of what he 'd seen so it number of response to things that have been said ticking so save any evidence there is an incident me and don 't respond just cut it deep because it doesn 't work in response block which is the one you mentioned block them all in at all communications just to those that are on a list of trusted friends and buddies until that 's the most important thing get kids comfortable about telling someone at either a parent or another trusted out on in their life make sure they understand that this is one of those times it 's like stranger danger I just come and tell you about it and you deal with it together don 't let them feel like they 've got to deal with it on your own otherwise it gets worse and the police get more powerful I mentioned to those of exchanging passwords and I had no idea that it was relatively common for couples like young teenage couples to exchange their passwords of some sort of form of trust and romantic exchange and apparently it is and even if your close friends you relationship goes falls apart then you know somebody 's got password procedures and can put it stuff up on the page even while they 're angry then won 't have done it when they 've had time to calm down but while they 're angry and they can play havoc with your account they can change settings they can change your passwords you come to back into your own account all that sort of stuff so one of the other things is to make sure that there 's passwords on smartphones because if you leave a smartphone going around you don 't have a password on it the first person who picks it up can get straight into if I found all your Twitter account or if your Venture count if you 've got it in that way as well and never give our passwords to anyone and this advice set to accept parents but I think there might even be times when you wouldn 't give your password to your parents either depending on the kind of relationship that you might be having now so mentioning the one about of them do it they ask it before at once you set it up a new cell yes you can have my location but then it just keeps on using it so things like Facebook so you can check in the first time you check in somewhere if you don 't think I would turn the location serves off it 's still operating and it 's still indicating we flicker or square and Twitter all of those funds and it it 's tied in some ways your identity and it 's just a whole lot of information about young people out there someone who might be looking for it so the best advice is to tell them to just turn the location services off I even have heard about an extreme situation of a young workers having problems with Facebook and felt like the safest place you could use it is to actually disable her account and she go on should use it and then she disabled it it 's hard to cancel an account this easy to disable it and then just go in and reactivated again the next hurt away control of her little world I 'm not sure it 's the most practical way that it was working for her have some kind of policy in your family of a location services make it a bit of a a guideline that they can control if I can turn it off and that 's the way we do it don 't you it 's not all negative and there are quite a few rewards around social media in social networking family and the research from the youth enormous group down in Melbourne this finding really positive things around mental health around identity our own friendships and of course this says essential skills that we picking up and learning for life in the workplace and quite generally social interaction and that quantity and I do think that at analogy I used earlier it 's very much like being on the road it 's about knowing you have car safely and you know just got to be on the road to learn it do it any other way so we 're in the business of raising savage digital citizens people keep themselves safe and basically it 's being smart and strong and kind I think in this space in the same way that real life is like that the time things you 're trying to achieve so so many digital citizens don 't share private information they understand that that 's theirs keep private they check their security settings regularly when ice put this presentation together I thought make up going to Facebook and I could show you of security settings our own economy except that it changes about every three or six months so what if I show you all the out-of-date very quickly so the best rule of thumb is actually the check as safety settings security settings regularly and just be sure that you know who see what you 're putting out there I 've got caught myself I thought that since I was putting up on my wall were only being seen by friends but there was a change and I just happened one day to discover that some things were showing up on a mobile version that weren 't showing up in one computer that version is working in the same way as a computer version just check both and stop block and tell so the next encounter police online that 's what they do keep the evidence and just make sure that they know that 's just how to respond and we can tell your friends that as well and the young dudes start telling kids to do that the better Toby digital citizens don 't share their passwords and they turn off their location services and then watch out for fishing links because of course social media means it is so many links so many tweets so many messages so much stuff going around and if you get a link sent to you you need to know to check do i click on that link code is that the cloak maybe I don 't know that person maybe someones just scamming me and Sammy link and they getting getting into something to make you feel so kids need to know a bit smart about what links they click on and they also need to be overly tougher than the trolls because trolls are up on their website and on your Facebook page on various other social media spaces and they need to be tougher than that another spawned no need to block those people would just not not engage because if they get suckered into it then there 's always a risk that this pattern you can go back and forth and make it kind of the worse or so they need to know to be tough and savvy deal or parents who know suddenly have to catch up with what 's going on need to go to explain to babysit nothing 's really private if you 're putting it out there on a website it is really private even if using gmail account that 's not really private if you don 't believe me and have a look our targeted the advertising is and they know exactly how old you are exactly what you 're doing teach kids to keep that personal information private teach them how to use their privacy settings or better still sit down with them and say what our privacy settings on these can you show me how you and set it up the way that it will be safest remind them to protect their friends privacy as well they might really good at looking after themselves and it won 't be tagging their friends in photos and all sorts of things that are revealing more about their friends and where their friends are then perhaps is really wise so get them to think about their friends as well and had some hard and fast rules about posting about what it 's okay to post the suggestion was no noodles photos would be the fastest up ho videos like that not online or via mobile phone and maybe no pictures of doing drugs drinking or nuts like that that 's going to be a problem later on you keep for a job or trying to portray yourself as a model citizen and remind kids that the golden rule applies at what goes around comes around if they spread rumors if they put up mean the comments and that kind of thing they are going to come back to hug you in some way or another and help them leading some kind of digital footprint I don 't personally believe that this stuff is going to be around a courtesan to wear in our old age because I don 't people are going to pay for the service to store it off but I do know if the example that the library of congress is keeping every tweet so there are going to be some our clothes are going to be some records that will hang around for a long time so help kids just think long term help them to think that what they make and create online does isn 't going to go away if they don 't want it to be there in the future they don 't want to see it tomorrow they 've been an operative up there today and then where can you get more help what other resources are out there if you need them I 've only listed or here there are quite a lot more things out there f MA have got some really good resources on there 's cyber-snack website and they 've got them arranged by ages so might be talking to it 's stuck the teenagers they 're stuck the other kids as well and one of the things they 've got their pitino just is a video called tagged and it 's this idea that what you do online is getting maybe tagged you for life and it 's got some discussion questions and things like that so there might be a place in your life where you can use that with a group of teenagers the alone or Medellin foundation is really interesting because they take a love interest income cyberbullying hello a believe general in the community so they 've got some good resources at on the website as well and lost up have got some good information around cyber safety because kids don 't always realized that the stuff they 're putting up there is actually in the real world and that the same laws about libel and slander and all those sorts of things still apply and you know stealing someone 's identity or pretending to be someone else it 's probably actually going to get them into grown-up kind of trouble these things alone so Phoenix having trouble seeing them like that we can do that thanks very much more effective thank you _"

    "text": "ladies and gentlemen please welcome our speaker here excellency the governor of new south wales professor murray thank you councilman connor miracle boston for that very and generous introduction and certainly it 's wonderful to be here surrounded by so many friends counsellors of muslim council past and present mr barry o 'keefe foreign skinner the honorable jillian skinner minister for health and minister for medical research and the member for north shore mr vivian may general manager of our splendid council mr cheeseman director of the boston art gallery and members of the muslim public art trust so many many distinguished citizens of muslim and beyond and many friends well yes thank you for the warmth of your reception that i 've received here tonight it is always somewhat anxiety producing to be amongst us family and friends but i feel very much at home with you all and it is an enormous pleasure to be sharing some historical reflections relating to this region of exceptional beauty and indeed beyond a land in which we are privileged to reside and to appreciate at close hand the legacy of this of our indebtedness to those who laid the foundations those who contributed significantly to the history of modern australia and tonight i shall refer to the early colonial governors including any associations but perhaps beyond that the legacy of the fifth governor lachlan macquarie whose influence has been firmly embedded i believe in the australian character and spirit of which we are so proud and finally if this time or in christian time i 'm happy to share some reflections on the role of the governor today well at the outset however i wish to record my very deep respect for the traditional custodians of this land upon which we gather the borrow gaga tribe their ancestors and their descendants indeed for all australia 's indigenous people who have nurtured this land for tens of thousands of years certainly one member of the borough tribe has been immortalized in the history of modern australia within its early colonial history his name is no doubt familiar to all bungaree age socially at the time of the arrival of the first fleet in 1788 bunbury was read in a traditional way amongst declared to be the healthiest people whom he had encountered in any of his travels around the world however within a few years after european settlement substantial numbers had died of small blocks philip from the outset displayed a genuine attitude of respect for the indigenous people on first encounter and it is recorded that he stated soon after his arrival we must do all that we can to reconcile them to have us living amongst them well the mossman region features in several significant ways in the history of early colonial sydney and of course facing the danger of starvation in the colony before farming had become adequately productive governor phillip in 1789 the year following the arrival of the first week had sent his ship hms sirius to cape town by the cape hope to purchase vital food however on the return voyage sirius was severely damaged storms and icebergs on arrival in sydney she was taken to be careened and repaired at elbow cove later be named kareeminko then sirius code that safe haven known today as mossman bay documents relate and i quote from those documents some saw piece down and a piece of ground was level to make to make working easier it seems that the sirius was somewhat accident pro for under the command of lieutenant john hunter who was later to become the second governor of new south wales the syria suffered a mishap again navigating the rough waters into norfolk island it is noteworthy that the serious crew was so loyal to john hunter that in the later inquiry none would give evidence passing judgment on the leader 's navigational mistake although it may seem an extraordinarily bizarre ambition on contemplation today napoleon bonaparte in the first years the 19th century is said to have had an intention to invade australia and ensure that any french explorers in these parts returning home were to be interrogated about the advantages they that they had noted in their explorations in these regions hence military security and vigilance were critical issues and because of its strategic location has always played a role in the planning of security for our great harbour from 1801 on the initiative philip ghibli king who governed from 1800 to 1805 his instruction a battery of fortifications was established in george 's head and this site proved to be an ideal vantage point from which to identify promptly any french ship or other hostile intruder sailing into the harbour governor king was also responsible for the first underground tunnel which was created on this headland to be used for the storage of ammunition and other vital needs for the military personnel there the main arterial road of mossman which leads towards these defenses was indeed appropriately named however evidence of any association with this region by the fourth governor william lie is difficult to locate indeed the unfortunate blind having survived the new community a term brought to an abrupt end after only 17 months in office it must be noted to his credit however that this much maligned fourth governor directed his attention more to encouraging food production rather than maritime exploration because of these efforts bly engendered much support and loyalty from the early farming community of the hawkesbury who kept loyal to him even during the insurrection appointed as the fifth governor subsequent to the blight crisis lockland sworn in as the fifth governor on the 1st of january 1810 a search through the journals macquarie which i have describing his tours as governor is rewarded with a mention of george 's head i shall present his exact words as he was setting off for tasmania in 1821 and these are his works monday the 9th of april last night have nearly proved fatal to us the ship having drove and dragged her anchor for nearly a month from the spot where she first sank it near the stout 's shore towards george 's head on the north shore before she brought up which she did not until she was within 20 yards of the breakers and rocks immediately under those high clips of george 's macquarie with the support of his splendid wife elizabeth campbell was determined to make a positive difference to the chaotic disintegrating and unhappy colony which he was now destined to lead contributing significantly to the australian identity which defines us today as we look back on macquarie 's life and character it is striking to note how much of this remains relevant of the nation 's indigenous people including access of their children to education the health of the people including mental health investment in architectural quality aspects of his legacy however it is doubtful whether macquarie himself would or even could have envisaged the high regard in which he is held today it has been remarked before that an aura of failure frustration and rejection has too often been the reward of many of australia 's early leaders it was certainly true of many of the best-known colonial governors and sadly it must be acknowledged that lachlan macquarie was another victim of such a misfortune and later following the commission of inquiry called in 1819 by the british government because of his humanitarian policies and civic development they were the reasons he was discredited unjustly in official circles yet he stands today as one of the greatest of australia 's leaders certainly one of our greatest governors a true pioneer of the nation unmatched her vision magnanimity indeed he was the first governor to officially refer to australia by that name in 1817 endorsing the name first years by the young continent in 1802 he was the first to give official recognition to australia day in 1818 he decreed that this date january the 26th which he entitled anniversary day would be a public holiday for government workers like so much of his legacy that observance has endured certainly no governor came to office with a richer fund of experience you are a deeper apprehension of life 's trials and hardships he was born on january 31st 1762 in modest circumstances in scotland on the isla in the hebrews where he later worked on the family farm his father was a cousin of the last chieftain of the clan whom dr samuel johnson and james boswell had visited in 1773. some years later those travelers recorded that the family had fallen on hard times that 's the macquarie family requiring them to sell the island which had been in the family 's possession for 900 years macquarie 's father had died when lachlan was only 14 years of age but his maternal uncle miller dog maclaine baron of moye had ensured that the boy received some formal education in edinburgh however brought an end to his schooling and the following year he received an enzyme 's commission to serve with his cousins regiment in north america at war 's end he returned to the family farm at mull before leaving three years later to return to the army scholars researching macquarie 's character are convinced also as i am that ideas the ideas and the values of the scottish enlightenment were influential in his maturation of character his humanitarian attitude to comics and to the marginalized and it was also influential in his commitment to civic planning these australian researchers have sought to identify the pathways whereby such qualities have developed in the young man those qualities which resonated with the values of the scottish enlightenment for macquarie 's years of military service had not allowed time for reflective studies it is noteworthy however that association by macquarie with certain individuals imbued these ideals and values in particular mentions should be made of sir james mcintosh who had spent seven years in bombay india serving as recorder that is the senior judgment macquarie had encountered sir james during his second period to the british government as a brilliant and scholarly schoolboy of inverness young jamie macintosh had been described as i quote a prodigy of learning and talent mcintosh went on to study medicine at edinburgh no better place in the world in those days practicing as a doctor for a few years subsequently realizing that little could be done to help those who have tuberculosis or infectious illnesses or pneumonia he then changed and directed his studies to law a profession through which he believed he could help in those science more individuals macintosh distinguished himself in academia in philosophy as an author and through his involvement in a number of celebrated cases as well as serving later as a member of the british parliament macintosh 's friendship with macquarie endured over their lifetime and he steadfastly remains supportive after macquarie 's return to great britain from australia to confront the criticism of the british parliament after commissioner league 's inquiry in 1807 whilst in india and contemplating new horizons macintosh had written of his desire to be and i quote him if i could be he said the law the children of the convicts from brutality and barbarism by education with a store of school masters from lancaster with some good irish priests for their countrymen and good methodists for the rest of this church i should most joyfully endeavour to introduce law and morality into that wretched country and give it the big constitution for a fetal colony which would grow into a great and prosperous community so this was a man who was talking to the young impressionable macquaries macquarie was 15 when he joined the army as a volunteer and served in the american war in appearance in new york and charleston and uh in the 75th region and also in canada and jamaica later he served in egypt in 1801 against nathalian 's armies after having accompanied his regiment on his first posting to india in 1788 then he had married his first wife jane davis whom he had met in bombay but with the deterioration of her health from the tuberculosis they journeyed to macau in the hope that the change of fire would bring about improvement sadly her deterioration continued and jane dolly traveller hardened by war very much a man of the world and well-known influential circles in london returning to britain in april april 1807 after a further period of service in india he narrowly escaped drowning when a freak wave capsized the small ship into which he had transferred in the persian gulf he was saved by being washed ashore extraordinarily at a place called bashir unable to travel through the mediterranean because of the war with france macquarie journeyed overland via baghdad through persia and the north to simply where he called upon the tsar alexander the first then by denmark and sweden to london clearly he was a man of high resilience and an exceptional immune system after such adventures a mere six-month journey to new south wales would have seemed almost routine yet for all his outstanding qualifications he was not the british governor 's first choice for the job the man chosen as bly 's successor was major general miles nightingale who had resigned his appointment no doubt when he heard about the story of the new south wales corps before his departure for new south lieutenant governor offered himself as government was subsequently appointed he was now 48 years old and in november 1807 he had married his second wife campbell who would prove to be an ideal partner nevertheless they were to be met with a considerable challenge a challenge to test their splendid characters to the full in macquarie 's own somewhat dismissive words the colony was and i 'm quoting barely emerging from an infantile in facility ellis one of macquarie 's biologists has written the country was divided by faction as a result of above by rebellion and was almost starving its morals were in the lowest state of the basement public buildings were in ruins roads and bridges were impassable there was no public credit or private confidence macquarie 's first step towards mending these depressing conditions was to bring together the warring sections of the colony through the institution of official gatherings and community functions among which the colony 's first horse races and agricultural fears were notable and the first two centuries ago reflected still i believe in the australian preference for conciliation and consensus for negotiation discussion deeply depressing conditions however existed in the colony he had inherited which he immediately said about transforming in the years that followed he led the colony into a period of unprecedented progress and in many ways he set the pattern and defined the priorities of enlightened public administration for the modern era he built schools hospitals roads and a beautiful lighthouse of the entrance to sydney it was he who instituted a system of public and private education and his influence can be seen today in the continuing emphasis given to education by all australian governments indeed 200 years ago he saw the critical role of education in building a nation and made it one of his first priorities at the end of his period as governor and by now the rule industry was thriving in other parts of the rural economy one fifth of the colony 's revenue was being spent on education it is so appropriate that a fine and progressive university in australia now bears his name to a large extent macquarie established the nation 's economy encouraging free enterprise and creating an environment in which commerce introduced coinage he arranged a purchase of 40 000 spanish silver dollars valued at 10 000 pounds cutting out the center two new coins were created a holy dollar and a dump with a value of 15 pairs in 1817 the colony 's first bank the bank of new south wales opened its doors and the highly successful macquarie bank now the macquarie group established in 1985 creatively has adopted macquarie 's holy dollar as its defining emblem under the quarry the colony acquired its first courthouses its first magistrate some or emancipated congress its first place of public worship its first independent newspaper and when he left office in 1821 he could point to 265 public works carried out during his term many designed by francis greenway the former convict appointed civil architect a great architect who incidentally had been given a letter of recommendation significant buildings still standing from macquarie 's time include hyde park barracks the governor 's stable now the sydney conservatory of music the lighthouse near the entrance to sydney harbour the female factory at parramatta and more roads to parameter into the blue mountains town castle rain wilberforce and windsor all built beyond the reach of the flood waters from the hawk street and wilberforce he named up to the great reformist whom he admired so much for his anti-slavery campaigns campbelltown now a satellite city 50 kilometers beyond sydney was established and named after his wife certainly i 'm looking around the city of sydney one sees evidence of his creativity and zeal so many of the streets bear the names he shows including the final thoroughfare named after himself certainly macquarie 's vision extended far beyond sydney he encouraged exploration to explain expand the supply of bathroom land famine being an ever-present threat in a colony still relying on shipments of food following several failed earlier attempts but with continuing encouragement the successful crossing of the blue mounds had been achieved in 1813 by blackstone lawson and wentworth so we 'll have some wonderful celebrations the road was commissioned the following year and built in an extraordinary six months the broader blue mountains on the road there today virtually follows that same road so that was a gateway to the pasture landslide park flourish and it can be claimed that the inland city of baptist was essentially macquarie 's creation macquarie 's journal recording his first view of this region his indication of his delight as he rode with elizabeth under the blue mountains and looked down upon the plains and this is what he said expanding for many miles on both sides of the river and surrounded with a distance by verdant hills is truly great beautiful and interesting forming one of the finest landscapes in any country i have used an artist including former convict joseph lyson and he certainly was the only governor in history to appoint the power glory that was michael massey robinson whose stipend was the welcome annual gift of two cows in regard to an association of macquarie with new zealand and adjacent pacific islands as implied in the word australasia macquarie 's domain of responsibility as captain general and governor in chief of new south wales included the whole western australia van diemen 's land tasmania the adjacent pacific colony of norfolk island and new zealand indeed it may be claimed that macquarie had dairy industry in 1814 the reverend samuel marsden with mission brazil traveled again to new zealand to meet with maori tribes he took with him the first dairy cows introduced into that country these were short hauls known at the time as durham 's and were taken from the new south wales a gift from governor macquarie for many decades afterwards this was the most popular breed in new zealand and a precursor of new zealand 's rich dairy industry another with macquarie 's priorities another link with the australia of today was his emphasis on public health he showed a concern for the sick the poor the neglected and the marginalized beyond anything required by the duties of office with the inspirational support of elizabeth he took a particular interest in the welfare of children especially the destitute and the abandoned these children represented all groups within the wider community the children of convicts children whose parents had died on route to australia even aboriginal children referred by colombian clergymen a beautiful sight for the female orphan school was chosen with views sweeping down to the river a scene books pattern books of edward given which elizabeth had brought with her to australia a gracious building was chosen which stands today restored to its original beauty proudly part of the campus of the university of western sydney and the hand-painted freeze around the wall painted in macquarie 's sky was still there this female orphans school was the fledgling colony 's first building created for a charitable purpose it is said that elizabeth and lachlan even designed the pineapples for those orphaned children there can be no doubt macquarie and his wife were aware of the links between poverty disadvantage sickness and crime elizabeth 's intellectual independence and acumen prove major strengths in the implementation of mccrory 's reforms his undisguised admiration for his wife 's abilities was evidence i believe of the value he placed on women as equal partners in both marriage and in society at large for a contemporary government especially one with a professional and personal interest in mental illness and the plight of the traumatized macquarie 's example continues to be an inspiration in 1810 he established the colony 's first psychiatric hospital the parramatta general it is remarkable that over 200 years ago australia had a governor with an insightful and sympathetic understanding of the needs of the medley and the not infrequent association of mental illness with imprisonment macquarie 's attitude to aboriginal people was similarly enlightened though it is important that this not be exaggerated he established the first school for aboriginal children and made the first official attempts that are unsuccessful to several native people in agriculture john ritchie another of macquarie 's biographers has given a touching account of mcquarrie 's father passing just prior to leaving australia he 's parting from the aboriginal troops whom he had grown for know and to respect in the last days of his governorship he went with elizabeth to say goodbye to the clans gathered at parramatta richie his biographer wrote as the aborigines feasted on roast beef washed out with copious rafts of beer he examined the children of the native institution which he had established he knew that the rapid increase in british population and the progress of british agriculture had driven these people from their ancient habitations and in townships have degraded the blacks it was how about macquarie 's treatment of the convicts in this charge that earns continuing respect and admiration today this was more than humanitarianism it was nation building based on merit the colony was in need of a workforce the larger the better and macquarie believed that when a prisoner had discharged his debt to society he should be and these two are his words eligible for any situation which he has by a long term of upright conduct proved himself worthy of filling this policy of emancipation was the child of macquarie 's heart more instinctual and theoretical in his softer moments which he actually wrote he viewed the convicts as children of misfortune believing in the intrinsic worse of individuals he offered them hope he aimed to encourage redemption to promote self-respect and ultimately a social regeneration he nurtured a dream of what the new country might become in raising people to be positions of trust and authority he drew another distinction between the free and the freed his objection was to eliminate faction and to introduce harmony in macquarie 's example the beginnings of the australian tradition of the fair go the spirit of egalitarianism the sense of fair play that many regards our defining characteristic as a people he believed that everyone deserved a second chance whatever his past is or reputation however to a large extent that belief was his undoing and destructive repercussions his reputation and visionary leadership would emanate from an unexpected source for despite the relief and the jubilation in great britain engendered by the victories over napoleon by 1815 and the end of years of war with france there were significant negative social consequences for the victorious nation hundreds of men who had been pressed into army and naval service to counter napoleon 's aggression now found themselves without employment without income without food and consequently vulnerable to criminal behavior for survival the british government expected and hoped that the specter of transportation to a cruel and punitive economic colony would act as a harsh deterrent to criminality they could not countless that their penal colony offering emancipation and humane opportunity would represent an attractive alternative and methods and messages are coming back that it government was so continuing complaints were being sent to london by the exclusives that 's a word with the capital e you know now the free settlers from the reverend samuel master known justifiably as a flogging person and an implacable enemy of macquarie together with affluent landholders including john mccarthy father of australia 's fully distributed but described by some as a dedicated troublemaker indeed a list of macquarie 's from the governor 's dispatchers of 1870 is held in the archives of the state library of new south wales and includes the names of many of these seditious individuals eventually a combination of many factors led to the appointment in 1819 of jt big biwge big street liverpool you may know to conduct an inquiry into the forest colonial administration big had been given explicit instructions by the british secretary for the colonies earl bathurst that and i quote these very words from the parliamentary document transportation should be made an object of real terror and any weakness of this by ill-considered compassion of convicts in the humanitarian policies of governor lachlan macquarie should be reported biggs damning about the governor being too compassionate and spending on building construction was deeply wounding to macquarie 's pride and reputation but never did he abandoned his faith in human decency and the principles of fairness for which he saw throughout his turn one aspect of macquarie 's legacy which he then frequently described was his ecumenical spirit and particularly his attitude to dissenters and the catholic citizens of the colony for whom the exclusives showed neither acceptance nor respect of historical documents revealed that macquarie provided land at parramatta for the first wesleyan chapel and as early as 1810 the first year of his governorship macquarie had already acknowledged the importance of saint patrick 's day to the irish immigrants in exile and had instituted an annual celebratory dinner indeed it is reported at the request of the leader of a gang of around 50 irish convicts engaged in work at government house elizabeth granted permission for a short break for them to observe saint patrick 's day on their return later they were greeted with a table of traditional irish fair of stew molasses pudding and wheatgrog a touching quarry 's term focus this was march 17 and they 've been sworn in on the first of january and further on the 3rd of may 1820 fathers john ferry and philip conley arrived in sydney to celebrate mass officially for the first time following the rebellion of the irish convicts many years earlier and the battle of vinegar hill on the outskirts of sydney later macquarie gave land for their chapel in sydney the site of today 's saint mary 's and donated 20 units to the building and laid his foundation stone on the 21st of october 1821 promising to support the religious liberty of father ferry 's which was met with spontaneous applause and i should tell you too that the priest handed governor macquarie a trowel and said this might help your governor and he said don 't you worry about me father i 'm a mason i know how he had a stroke sense of humor as well as that wonderful overall embracing spirit perhaps the true granter and pathos of macquarie 's story are best summed up in his own words all that he of charity and love that underlay all his actions were poured out from the submission he wrote to commissioner and i own the reports of those big and macquarie in response here i present part of what he wrote to me he said that my first entry into this colony i felt as you must do that some of the most meritorious men most willing to exert themselves in the public service were men who had been convicts do you not know that above nine tenths of the population of this convict are this colony are have been convicts or the children of convicts you have yet perhaps to learn that these are the people who have quietly submitted to the laws and regulations of the colony although informed by some of the three settlers and office of the government that they were illegal these are the men who have tilled the ground who have built houses and ships who have made wonderful efforts in agriculture in maritime speculations and in manufactures these are the men who placed in the balance in the opposite scale to those free settlers you macquarie 's words would have little influence on bigg 's decision vic had been influenced by the male contents and the disgruntled increasingly dispirited macquarie tended his resignation on three occasions and this finally took effect in 1821 but there is a pleasing irony in the thought that we 're not for the conflict of those men new south wales might haven 't waited much longer for the rudiments our parliamentary democratic system big recommended that no future governor should be allowed to rule as an autocrat so a legislative council was appointed to advise the next government there is no doubt that in so many ways macquarie was ahead of his time he had committed himself throughout his years of office to a vision of what australia could become and in so doing he laid the foundation for the harmony and the prosperity which would follow at the inauguration of his successor governor thomas brisbane on december the 1st 1821 macquarie farewelled the colony which he had come to love beginning with the words fellow citizens of australia and predicted that australia would in less than 50 years become appendages of the british empire further he declared i shall not fail when i return to england to recommend in the strongest manner i am able to my sovereign and to his majesty 's government their early attention to the amelioration of this valuable rising colony and to extend to it their paternal support and fostering protection by 1880 that was actually just a few years beyond his prediction of 50 years it was estimated that australia had the fastest growing economy and the highest per capita income in the world and at almost 40 of australia 's borrowed capital was coming from scottish banks on the eve of his departure trip with the 11th 1822 thousands gathered in the streets described by the governor himself in those moving words a most effective sling and could not be viewed by mrs macquarie or myself without the deepest emotion after a residence of upward of 12 years amongst these poor attached people today as i travel the length and breadth of the state of new south wales in my official duties i see the legacy of our early governors and especially i see it in the courage of our farmers the men and women on the land as they contend with drought and other tribes who never give up i see it in the spirit of our service men and women police keepers abroad who like macquarie serve their country with respect for others with dedication and professionalism i see it in the character of our people the awards lack of pretensions the absence of artificial social boundaries marston hated him because he invited former convicts to government house their rejection of vainglory and superficial status their pragmatism the belief of most in the fair go the australia of today whatever the challenges would have been a source of great satisfaction indeed a pride to lachlan mcquarrie sadly however with elizabeth and young he returned to england a brokenhearted man and died exactly two years later in london on the 1st of july 1824 the news of macquarie 's death received some weeks later in sydney produced great outpourings of status and four days of official warning were announced and on the same day and this is extraordinary news was also to emancipation had been given the royal asset and in the australian newspaper of the 11th of november 1824 the newspaper established during macquarie 's term william wentworth who is often referred to as australia 's greatest native son quoted these lines of alexander pope in homage to the late governor statesmen yet friend to truth our soul sincere inaction faithful and in honor who broke no promise served no private end who gained no title and who lost no freedom indeed an eloquent and fitting tribute to a man whose legacy i believe we all share today thank you with well i guess they did their best and they didn 't have computers and calculated them but that was made largely i suspect um between your situation today oh yes indeed i think the role of the government today well i think idealistically uh wanting to uh uncertainly governors will bring people together widen the door you know contribute to the harmonious community that we enjoy nevertheless they don 't have the autocratic power although it 's very interesting not many people i guess other the honourable jillian skinner powers you cannot say i cannot sacrifice the government said the government despite the fact that the hundreds thousands of people thought so a couple of years ago and to the same extent i was getting sackfuls and mail they needed me to do so and this was this was this was not only um reported in the newspaper but it was the subject of an extraordinary cartoon in uh one of the daily telegraphs which i mean but i i knew i couldn 't because i 'm not robert mcgowan you know we 're living a wonderful democratic uh you know governed by a wonderful democratic constitution with these to seek more research on something that the government may want to pass into law you can get your own research as well but you cannot refuse to sign well you can you can refuse to sign it and resign but you can 't refuse to sign up and stay there and this is how our nation our states are protected from dictatorial dangers but when i was getting it was no secret because then i was able to write but the daily telegraph had a most wonderful cartoon it was around christmas time and there was the portico government house with which you 're all familiar and the butter we don 't have butter but the butter was at the door and a lady with dark hair and a slightly long nose near the garden with santa claus and the other five reindeers and the cartoons said this was the reigning speaking santa wants to know why she 's getting more male than his they are social commentators as i tell the captains and vice captains who come to government housing the gallery is the servant of our people that 's a gathering and that 's a very lovely growling plan which is do you think that current generations are taught enough about uh well i truly believe that then i do have i 've always had a there is so much in it that sets an example for goodness and decency when you look through our it is very difficult to find many rogues and i think this is why we 're all born and killed so much think about it when i come down i 'd like you to tell me who you think the bad people are in in australia 's history from philip onwards also if you realize um lies diaries would happen if he wasn 't selling the credit he was in a very small the bounty was not much larger than one of the reasonable yields your excellency thank you for a really enjoyable address tonight um lochman was quite amazing um it 's great to hear such a wonderful speech from you and we live in australia this wonderful multicultural society where we have people that have come from almost every corner and in our office what makes this defining characteristic of a nozzle that we 're also enormously there 's a our nation what is a defining characteristic that makes an aussie and will continue to blind us together as we come from every nation in the world that 's a very complex um question did you hear what mr cool had asked me yes it 's complex and i mean i 'll be um responding as a child who 's area to a wonderful family in halcyon days with guns and the muramity river and so forth and you know it 's our landscape it 's our spirit it 's don 't like it 's the cockatoos and the glass the way they are not frightening to the legacy of the way the indigenous people are looked after this compliment we can prove for 40 000 years in the south to 60 000 in the north carbon dating i mean there 's an incredible spirit in this country the fact that our land is good by the sea we have no borders with others we don 't we haven 't had invasions we haven 't suffered the terrible experiences that even north south america little one europe and africa um when you see modern australia 's only 224 years old and i think a standard was set by the essex of phillip and those who followed you know i mean it wasn 't just that he was a captain in the royal navy he had the benefit of being the child of an older mother who was the widow of time of the german enlightenment who was a teacher who came to england to teach so you can imagine this little boy growing up in a family where mother was a bit older and had suffered and therefore had a maturity and the father was a man who came from the most enlightened country in europe other than scotland but the germany now let 's face it look in the history books about the german enlightenment and the scottish enlightenment they were the literate people who were who israel saw those countries around them and so there was that they i think they were ethical men how many as i say how many roads have we got if you look into the documents only about three weeks ago i managed to come across the 1792 edition second edition of of hunter and king who were the second and third respectively leaders on the first flight from gordon house or treasurer but reading reading the account of those naval officers you can see and feel the respect in their journals for the indigenous people when they went up for example broken they were coming home and they found a girl very ill an aboriginal girl very all feverish with evidence of smallpox so you know they settled it down and got you know there 's there 's somehow a quality of decency that comes to our early history you look at the number of massacres there was happen but by and large when you think of other countries there were attempts to ensure harmonious interaction with the indigenous people look at philip said at the very beginning we must australians so i think there are many blessings you know and the climate the bounty of the seed the sweeping the healthy that was the total trouble that 's why they said commissioner bigger the convicts were writing home and saying it 's marvelous we 're healthy we 're happy and the food 's good and the government thank you very much just a question um i think probably the journey in the last couple hundred years has been how we 've come from a society where the governors were the autocratic rulers to democracy and gained elected governments how do you we protect the viceroyal position versus the political system and how do we uh bridge the short-termism it comes from our democratic principles today do you have a view about where it might be 100 years from now well i can 't predict but from the young people who come to government house i 'm very fortunate one of our lovely loveliest tasks for roles to take on and this was begun in the time of sir and vice captains of all the high schools in new south wales come to government house over the period of the year of education and it includes private and public spirits catholic protestant jewish islamic a lot eventually come and they get a talk from me on the constitution of the three tiers of government and what the role of the government is and then i add them to questions and invariably one question usually the very last and the ginger important is what do you think about the possibility of a republic or how things will change and so forth and i 'll turn the question around immediately to link what do in terms of our style of democracy our controls our lack of control of those things and their answers are wonderful but invariably they come back inside now we wouldn 't want a public like the united states we wouldn 't like one like italy or france they come back you know and someone always says if it ain 't broke why fix it but i mean there will be evolutionary changes depending on the population i guess say but again people come here people are risking their lives to get here illegally because what they know about the place seems to appear there are other places in which they can go i think that i think and i don 't want to get into trouble completed areas here but i think that gatekeeping has served this country well in the past and i think that to some extent that must continue um is especially because i think australia 's australia 's acknowledging its responsibility there are young australians looking at ways in which we can be of more use to our small and struggling neighbourhood in the pacific islands go to west street and see what australia and australians are doing there is amazing it really is and this is known as getting better at helping now so they 've gone through a terrible period of treatment resistant tuberculosis and treatment resistant malaria and i met a doctor yesterday who said they 've got a new growth that they think will work and i 'm a sydney sydney researcher those who need us that will be terrible you _"

Healy thought I think we called him the rod for some reason and he told the teacher that the teacher should get back to his charges and he would look after this a turning point in my life because he I thought he was going to whack me I never been whacked and you know I was going to be reprimanded for doing these drawings of nudes you see I 'd lot of these and he looked at them he said you know they 're very good but you don 't know anything about anatomy and I 've got an anatomy book here and we 'll take it down and he showed it he opened it up he said see this knee see there 's a structure for I didn 't realize he what a monthly faceted man he was my headmaster at Sydney grammar and he said now i 'm going to give you permission to draw in all your classes but that 's something that 's going to be just between you and me he 's dead now so I can tell this it 's only between you and me and I will instruct the staff at the next comic con a common meeting common pulmonary meeting the Thera let you all but you will not never tell that don life through grammar I used to draw all the time I don 't know whether the current headmaster would approve of that sort of behavior there i went to the mosman daily the mosman daily in Great Northern proprietary limited and it was it i think it was office at the town hall vice to go over to council meetings and ice to do drawings and I you know it was very small little firm run by the Walker family and in fact one of the walkers have been a year ahead of me at grammar and I think that 's one of the reasons why I got the job and there was a great boss press in the back rumbling away and they had Linotype operators there was miss Foley who had glasses that thick from looking at copy used to recite Shakespeare and it was just a hive of activity it was an old-fashioned country press in the middle of mossman and of course it 's all gone now it was in my agar road and I was there for a year then i joined the julian ashton Azaria Brett Whiteley adjust left and he was somewhat legendary in the school Nigel Thompson was there who course very eminent mosman painter became the vramen at mosman planter sabbath was a friar who you 've got a painting of his own your foyer of out of the gallery and she he was a he and I were very close and did portraits of each other and there were many artists at that time who since made graduate potations in the school and then I eventually after a year at the daily I went and started started full-time at the school with aunt mr. henry gibbons and mr. henry gibbons was one of the most extraordinary people in the art world he had taken over from Julian afternoon 1942 when he died and he ran the school right here up to the 60s and amongst his students it 's like a who 's who of Australian art doe bill passed more Eric Wilson dad 's well you know it just goes on and on and then later on John Olsen and Brett white in Michael Johnson and the thing about is that it 's not only the people that went there and became great names it 's the others who went there when then went to other institutions to create them and for instance Freeman and Badham and all of those people went to what became the national art school so in fact for a while the national art school was really the jury an extension of the Julian Ashton art school and of course eventually now they 've producing that changed after a while and we they went more become a more modernist school than we were we remained more classical but both great schools I was very lucky because I was showing it to burn arson gallery Kimber Nathan a great Kimber Nathan who you know was the great art dealer of Australia he was the Lorenzo the Magnificent he 's still alive god bless you Kim and Kim I 've shown with Kim just started sharing with Kim and he rang me up and he said Paul as a man here that wants to meet you and his name was Michael Powell and he was the English you remember the red shoes the lovely more ashira and he also did there a weird mob and the battle of the real plate anyhow he was there in the in the gallery and he said I 'm going to make a film about mr. lin 's one of mr. Lindsay 's novels and I 've been recommended to you that you should do this by mr. Lindsay himself and now i find that Mr benét theme is recommending you so would you like to take the job and I said yes I would be delighted and so I went to dunk island with Helen Mirren and James Mason and Jack McGowan was a wonderful cast and we were there on the island for three months and made that lovely little film and I did all the title I had a naked Columbia in the titles that all the actors naked and so on that was all cut out by columbia pictures they decided they were a bit naughty least all these drawings i did but they 've just brought out a director 's cut they put them all back quite a lovely it 's a visually beautiful film and an orally beautiful film and Helen did drawings of a dry upon a drawing here of me that she did when I was drawing her nude and of course later on I can probably say that I 'm the only person in the world to have painted the Queen in the nude because after all she later on she went on to play the Queen and she was a damn good Queen to with sirens a lovely elle mcpherson of course and Portia de Rossi and oh they were lovely and of course sam neill played the role of Norman Lindsay himself in that and one of them amusing moments in that was when the ladies were posing nude they had what that was called a closed set which meant that nobody could actually look except the person of course he was looking through the lens the cameraman but as the artist of course I mean I was seen by the ladies has been quite O 'Kane quite innocuous really and so when that scene was being shot everyone turned I think maybe the director was allowed to look and then that 's what I was I was able to stand there look because I was the artist after all and the girls said it was most peculiar one of the ladies said it was most peculiar looking out there to the vault of the you know the camera set and so on and there was nobody there that all turned their backs or they were looking inside except you they said they were rather glad to see me because then they could smile at someone but it was it was a lot of fun and lovely filmmaking is a great art of course it 's an enormous art and I wonder with a Rembrandt would have been a filmmaker I wonder in another age with a you know some of those Rubens I 'm sure would have made films you know it just got everything hasn 't it I mean some of the greatest works of art in our time our films are motion pictures aren 't they and so when they come to the art school to learn just look and become learn to coordinate your hand and your eye to actually put something down accurately and observe it that 's what we 've been doing at that school for a hundred years you know I think that 's the key to it all keep it simple just draw and after while your own style emerges anyhow you know you you whatever you are will come through and it 's a journey where the language you invent yourself and the freest people in our society are our artists if you think of all the arts a producer needs a crew for a film a musician needs backing and orchestra an artist all artists needs is that blank canvas but I think that 's why we value art because it is the soliloquy is the personal journey I 'm the patron of the society and that was a very curious way that came about because i was here in balmoral in my studio minding my own business and this lady rang up and she said she was very assertive and she said we want to form a mas of want a place to paint together i said i don 't like painting with other people and she said well we want you to be our patron we were told by somebody in mosman council that if you became our patron they would give us somewhere to paint and I said I find that most unlikely but I thought to myself hey you know there was an a there 's an angle in this I said have you got a manifesto and she said what 's that she said no we don 't want a manifesto and I said yes you do I will become your patron if you let me write your manifesto or at least the first point of your manifesto you should I of course it 's okay so we drove a manifesto the first point of that manifesto was we will work with mosman council to help create a regional gallery mosman gallery as part of the regional gallery association and I got a call from k-clark about a year after this was society had been running in been hanging the council and the counselors had group I 've got a phone call saying we 've done at Paul we 've just voted the money and we 've just got the grants and we 're going to have a gallery good good and of course the artist must the most Bernard society still don 't have anywhere to paint but we 're on the track it is we talk about Aboriginal sacred sites and of course all all honor all respect to the aboriginals and all compassion to what happened to them as a result of our coming here but we are a society to and it is appropriate that we should have our sacred sites and i think that the rocks for instance where we that the first settlement was made is a sacred site for the way for white people to and there and that there was this wonderful exhibition for instance that 's showing on the early art of the rocks with Julia Nationals paintings and Howard Ashton 's and said Sid long and all of those early people who who were there at the time very important that of course mosman has the most burn art prize for to one year I was brought Jackson press put a lot of work by various artists into the mossman art prize it was a wonderful work in the in there Tim stories and Charlie Blackmon 's and I i saw this wonderful lithograph by lloyd and i thought but i 'll have to give it to the grand old man you know he was a hero of art at the time still he is and he to my astonishment he turned up at the council chambers at sea for the opening Barry O 'Keefe I think was the mayor at the time or could have been Dom Lopez another wonderful mayor of Muslim and he said to me you know he said when he received the thing he said I am unique in Australian artist wonderful quavering voice I am unique kid Australian art because I am the only artist in Australia who has received an art prize from a great grandfather and a great-grandson because when I was a boy came down from Queensland and your great grandfather said to me you are but draw light and you know he was right that 's what I 've done and I have any advice to pass on to any all of you young artists see all of you artists here you know learn to draw learn to draw and remember art is long life is short and never get too full of yourself it was wonderful I 'd ever forget that never forget that dear old Lloyd absolutely i mean Kevin Connor lived up there in meru banro did glorious paintings Brett Brett Whiteley was painting here so many artists I can you know I could just go on and on and on and of course contemporary artists now and cape and Sue flu and God so many wonderful wonderful painters you know you 'd probably never have to go outside of mossman to have to fill that gallery continually el morro bay these are very good and and of course up at George 's Heights we have a gallery there now too and we have nine to five exhibitions there which are echoes of the street and Roberts shows that they he 'll have come full circle we 're up there we 've got a studio overlooking the greatest harbour in the world we have a festival of Sun and skies every Christmas time at school the others of the art school we 're in the company there of many other wonderful artists guide for Orton who 's teachers with us and it 's it 's it 's a place that it 's been painted I 'm sure when will the call goes back to the carvings of the aboriginals on the edge of the rocks and they would have done paintings too of course what they 're lost it paintings are much less less permanent than sculptures but no it 's it 's a great place to grow up and it 's been a great place to live integration be in a great place to paint my little principalities of why which is my wife too of course and a children 's it 's the family 's principality we are and our rabbits of course they 're able to involved two rabbits five people and things were pretty bad before we set know and we tried to get access to our property but things kept on going wrong and mistakes were being made which have subsequently been admitted by the council and you know we thought well what have we got to you know we really felt as though we needed to make create a playing field of our own and so on the night that we were as it were cast into the wilderness because we didn 't have access to our property which we had a right to and it was only an error in the writing of the of the document the LEP that caused us not to be able to have that access so we thought what can we do and we rang up an old friend and or alpha and ring on the night and we were discussing so and sue said Paul thinks we should secede from mossman and he you know he 's got this character called the Prince of Y and you know he painted him in the 60s and so on and you know perhaps we create the principality of why and she we drew up the manifesto and contacted the council and the mayor who was a really ugly lady said I 'll accept your unilateral declaration of independence and she put on a regalia and the press came and the journalists and the television and everything like that and we presented her with udi and she gave us a document and we were seceded as far as I know with the only principality in Australia it 's actually received recognition from the other side so there we were and we proceeded to start making regalia and doing all that sort of thing and we 've had a hell of a lot of fun with it since and we have a wide a every year to which lots of people come and they sing so moms and show pictures and generally you know behave in a bohemian fashion I suppose you would call the Principality of Y and mossman Council a poem for mossman council what does y personify if gorgeous mosman is a whale why a dolphin with a golden tail just as lovely on a smaller scale _"

    "text": "first I reckon Sydney and and as you said I want to confer graduate that fish in 2008 and I 'm just being pretty much as just painting too since since the genie is working towards a professional career in imaging and and it 's been quite a journey so far I mean yeah so since this is 5 19 units which idea about value year ago I I work with a local phone us and that 's very able subject strong just just from all four of us that I either find in my parents albums at home wrong I am finding op shops or online and I bought black like massive bulk anonymous all for us just online and and so it 's against the subjects that they 're in for a soda machine like them and and i think that 's that 's quite interesting and how intriguing i mean i really started to develop a relationship with the person you know our group and then only and possibly deceased and you know and have you lived a long time ago and yeah but just just starting them and and just finding out you know how i calculated a person that I don 't know who has also walked on this earth and done probably a lot of similar things to me and you know this particular photograph and algae Rivera comes from a little dinner this is I 've actually bought a copy of the original photo rakesh if you want to look into oh my gosh passed around it 's just I was taking a small data from from the original photograph of the woman kid and the reason I called her new tricks is because she 's actually making down towards small doll fearing and I 'd like to be ever given out around my paintings and so and you try to see where I combines in the photograph and give it obvious that a bit of that story away through through the titles yeah so it 's a soda wrath comes from laughing where my grandmother grew up and and I went back there my family and I know that he 's gonna I like back there and one of my mother 's old photographs from the area and I just thought was really interesting that I I don 't write this woman but she looked in my limited really tiny tiny village outside of munich and you know it couldn 't possibly be a great homage or it probably is a great honor a great Armada that I 'm not living her but I 'm but yeah so so the yeah he 's a lot of old friend of us and i also i like the way they 're just in the process of painting them there 's our small small images and they really they 're quite a stretch just just in looking at them when you blow them up as I have done here if you look at that that um that in each other month that 's either a larger version of what the actual images it 's very small and so it 's quite a simple how yeah it 's quite a simple image but in blowing it up because players chat and so I used to put um I use a bit of a pellet rifle rush take some time in sketching out the UM the Energon and then surly and build some legs up and slowly you know fill in the gaps anything sometimes it can be quite a quick process to make to make that final the final unfinished that sometimes you know I can work that into with him I mean yeah so but I absolutely like using the part life because i think this I 've seen your way that it really creates the plains of the face and end of the features of her face and that this is something you can 't really see in that tiny niche and so you look creating the human again out of that tiny age yeah then anything out of it paint which is in style that I use I just really enjoyed the fact that the panther takes on a life zone and there 's all these unexpected things that happen in you know in using a lot of paint it just kind of you know great fruits all the way just kind of Tears for another part of the painting by accident yes an improbably to see some of the influences from other artists that i have just from this particular artwork I mean I 'm a big fan of difficulties is yeah he he really unhappy in finding our style and things like that I have a lot of it if else as well mean watch over since since engineer I am I went through a little bit for three or four years I was going through so many art movements and so many you know different artists that I really liked miss trying to find my own particular style and but you know really crap quite obviously copying a lot of other artists like van Gogh David Hockney on are just a little so very and also different but I enjoy so because it 's mainly the competent painter that I am now because you know like so much in injury in doing that and yeah so yes i was i was looking at sample back until this weekend i 'm assuming out this weekend that is me but I was the Istanbul Park for four years and seven each evening part of 31 now because I 've gotta leave I think that time really helped me in in finding out what color to paint and how long you to hate it because I finish you know I really struggled with finding an identity in in what obviously that I wanted to paint and you know I also show how I wanted to go about that so describe through so many different size yeah I think it 's a really important journey and so this is an awesome a prize is kind of really rocking a point in time for me now this is kind of big turning point in in in my life at the random it 's just kind of similar to the fact that I think that I can do and brownies is right and yeah this is honestly I 'm honest so yeah it 's just a small part of you Jeremy I think being as I think are present in the art prizes especially this one hour prior to the immersion high school is so important for young artists because it really well if it 's the album is a big role that Bostonians and just hung out of the Union and you know not really don 't really know where to start and have it at happy hour prices and working towards a goal and you know it 's how you do the deadline it was to give it a kick up the mountain to get yourself going this is a really good thing so so they 've had a big role in where I am today yeah so but in terms of being energized and on my career and he 's turning point of the Roman um yes I 've recently been being represented by one or case me and it 's been really really nice and beautiful these last of the month just being really eat and then the yeah it 's very exciting ya got any questions could you repeat the question when you are on it um I 'm dating who is asking about the color and if I do it was an intuitive or was it more convivial and I mean yeah I mean generally i will start with I my engines are quite muted yeah but I mean generally I 'll start with an idea of two base colors and then to see how they 're both so it is a lot of introversion that then yeah just yeah i was so i can ask you like my sword big booties winning redlands westpac on price in yesterday and he said he painted a picture of his father and it was almost a matter of hours you know in u.s. object obviously very well i was wondering how long it would take you to do comes oh yes how a while ago sec huh I think it was there were a couple of days but I do of sketches before hand so in a tree house until you even Alice honey we are so similar but but yeah the whole process isn 't feed processing kind of society one over to kill photograph finding that photograph and and how many execute execute it 's not just my painting yeah quite a long process but I 've kept saying I 'm putting the paint down that Nick being quite good the great movements you know a lot comes out of the nation yeah I 'm not sure I see that I feel like it 's time to I University and me cuz I as I think that eating away from the sea was really important to our creative writing just just fill up 80 miles and really just concentrate amazing not be distracted by anything else but now that you have really found a style that I really believe in it that why can identify me but yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks yeah I do a lot of painting of Simon my boyfriend result of that it 's kind of before you secretly hating him with an argument but you know I do life hazing and and for getting painting of people who are alive as well not people in all photographs but on yeah i mean i do work a lot of portraits as well yeah and the way I do that is kind of I 'll work on lots of different ones and then and then slowly work my way up to the final piece so yeah that the last evening um just consider yourself in this be honest suit yourself I think and say to yourself honey myself a shame but yeah _"

    "text": "where they 'll be weathers a black line our stitch at the stream and I do that because all my early work was call out and I used to find things and stitch them onto the canvas and stitch works and it came from that and so now I do it because I want the work to suck you in the face bounce out and it makes it sort of very three-dimensional it also gives me a break because I work every single day and it sort of gives me a break between my paintings so I can sit down and sew and it 's it 's basically really a sculptural approach it 's nothing to do with sewing it 's to break the surface of the canvas before I start so other way to started doing the painting while I was teaching it and then I stretch it and paint it so it 's already happening and the surface is broken and it sort of takes away that fear of facing a white canvas so most of all my work is ordered by graphic all this stories that people 't if I sort of remark about bird my Dorian correct images and and I thought storm in my brain and when I go to do a painting I will with reference probably three or four places that I 've been to and just put the holiday images together I walk I walk with my dog during the water so this is typical of walking in the afternoon like with the water the light shimmering on the water and bullet branches made birds and it 's just it 's just a story that there are pink things that are familiar to us so it 's everything that people have seen before and places that most of us have been and being so be comfortable be everyone was asked why Simon and you know in backwards it 's because about five things that just have rising that 's right and it 's really uncomfortable having nail sticking up in the middle of the canvas and so it detracted from the rising so I started I should start at art school sorry in the corner as well now sort of balances the painting to over-exaggerate will understand because I think in Australia we have an exaggerated life and if you travel overseas and you come back to Australia all our colors are incredibly much brighter and and like so bright and so by exaggerated colors and decorate the subject matter and I exaggerate what the painting is about by writing the title of it so exception in the facts because I may have about three or four or usually about five actually layers of color because nice transparent and say get all that up under colors coming through so I never actually have one it 's never one color and so I need some cooking time like that yeah Polly trottenberg so now mrs. stream you can 't must people come until it 's pitch if I do paintings without stitching it doesn 't want the same so I was tend to go back they mainly do it because it breaks it 's it 's sculptural that breaks the painting and I 'm already doing the painting when it 's right I checked my work everywhere I go with sneakers went totally on the wall and I 'm like mr. squiggle I just sort of see something you will attract all the crinkles move on I 'm in the door drawing what I 'm going to do don 't start out with my hand so I just things about saying you know things that people have told me and and then I draw it and then I carry on this piece of material everywhere I go into each of them and then I stretcher yeah and when I first ate my baby color that 's why has so many layers of coloring and then I worked at we worked up till 00 I 'm trying out things from East Campus but I 've just don 't mix addition we just finished two weeks ago and I change to meet them for the first time the great go back because the difference in stitching women it 's easier so yeah and it 's beautiful the plants beautiful participating sexually la montaña which I 've always used within actually been exhibiting for nothing I prefer more than a rainy day in my studio music weeks so I do that a few years probably when I come back I have been doing a few things but not that the rack or not the many right there are deep for my traditional no it 's like to do it shorts just messy I had thrown four pieces in that 's my work and I do a lot of sculptures and stuff as well I like everything into anything Tic Tac toy making things I have districts and all of the sculptures in my show as well but that 's why I think it 's a more sculptural approach to the work then necessarily a painterly approach how do you feel about winning in the prize amazing you know it was a very sad way because we lost three people in the art world and especially with the death of Wally he always encouraged me so much and she was always telling me to kick their own in the actual prize and so it 's the better of us which all in one way it wasn 't absolutely mind-blowing I never expected to win it 's just walk into the art supply and buy the 250 cheap impact of the post to the now I mean you know like it gives me the freedom to keep doing you know so maybe first I 'll just start by telling you how this painting came to be here I can ask you to stay closer to me I think my studio and Alfred Jones who 's the painter of this incredible painting right here yet I rang me up and said done I 've decided van I 'm driving across the studio I 've got my Mossman ArtPrize entry join me to pick yours up and pretty on the back of the van and I said oh well why not cause oh oh I didn 't know that was on I said when 20 entries close and used to have done three hours and I said well I haven 't got anything but you know come and have a look around so this was hanging on the wall and I was considering it whether it was finished gone off and that 's the one so thanks to out choosing I 'll buy you a toasted sandwich yeah so it was it was a lucky I think the best thing about that is that we all know that anxiety attached to painting a painting specifically for something for a prize or it 's sort of like before you even start yeah you 're a bit screwed up about it because there 's too much pressure I guess so it 's nice to have something that you know just painted that for not a reason or not it just sort of came came about I guess so it was nice it 's got that freshness about it I guess it 's unlaid that now I 'm finished it 's a painting of views with my friends around during in Robertson and it 's I guess the most one of the most of literal landscape paintings I 've I 've done more and more these days I 'm sort of honing in on I 'm just you know really learning to paint from something as any I guess and trouble summers as the landscape so I feel like I 'm a student about in the in the countryside roaring and just getting right back to basics again and so it 's interesting after all those years of ten years of painting solidly you know I really feel like I 'm back at the beginning again so anyway that 's all sort of brief observations of the landscape in a real challenge but anyway this was one that Alan thought was good enough thanks out what else can I say questions Christie 's always he will be speaking soon will you be speaking very quietly any other any other questions yeah my last shower before you know a couple of years ago was very different it was called Google Earth and it was really basically all the images were sourced from the internet and was a bit of a conglomeration of them the images that I basically put together as a narrative and positive view of the world I guess that was distant exercising in bringing together those visuals to tell a story yes but soon after that and that were very tight works you know it was very young again it was way of working and so I was very refined you know it was something that was I guess if I feel like I 'm struggling or learning something I 've got that enthusiasm to to keep young so I better at the end of that kind of time of just heading out into the world China for three months and on a residency and when I got home I 'm so excited behind as as you said before when you go to Sydney come home everything particularly somewhere like China it 's very polluted everything in Australia is so incredibly crisp and bright clean and so I just immediately spent a lot of time at landscape and so just drawing and realizing what it was to sit in front of the you know any particular view and trying to deal with all the information said yeah so and it was sort of going back to basics really and yeah I always did think of the landscape as something you did for as an exercise but more and more you know I feel that something it 's got a lot of one mountain for years dealing with it in you know the changing seasons and light and all the rest of it so yeah I sort of feel like I 've got there 's a lot of longevity in now just sitting in car any particular thing and learning that was before I mean actually so they look paintings again you know most of my paintings before that had been it based on certain observations of the landscape not so much landscape sort of paintings but so I don 't do a lot of drawings and then they were all just I just throw them all of the canvas and so what we so yeah there 's a southern boy but narrative in our gifts about what I 've seen in terms of our into a lot of drought affected areas places like that so yeah that actually came before going to China yeah but it wasn 't really but I guess it was more it was quite liberated because you can make a lot of observations and then be very free to just feel what you do with it in more strictly controlled in like you know trying to replicate something so I guess yeah again a different way wouldn 't be but you know my show so a user always change them from show to show you know I feel like I 've worked something out or you know spend enough time with something I always move on so who knows what I 'll be back next year well with a bunch of artists and six Australian artists and you know we had such enormous nerves have been to China it 's an incredible education we saw so much that was so different confronting and you know we always want to be responded to any very different ways and we created a very different work of what we normally would just dealing with all the things we have seen and learned about an unbelievable country so you know we sort of influenced heavily what we did when we 're in China but as soon as I came home and I brought a lot of work back from China thinking that I 'll continue on with that work that once felt a sense of belonging really embrace just getting back out you 're out so it didn 't make sense to really make much work about those experiences once I got home so I 've got some sort of weird strange I would start producing what I 'll today which I 'll probably never show anyone but yeah so you know that working in those different ways obviously influences what you do ever after so that probably for the first time in China I did a lot of drawings you know down the Yangtze River and places like that so that was probably the first moment of getting back to just drawing was it in front of me so it didn 't indeed it 's this painting part of you being home this is painting part of you yeah well yeah I did I 've done a lot of painting that particular view and it 's it changes so dramatically that as I said you could see kind of the same you thought four years and yeah it was just again you know it 's not a really tightly specific of captures more of what you a sense of the place that you know well so you know they are and they are based on a lot of people said afterwards I had the last show that was similar that really captured that sort of what the feeling of that particular place even though they weren 't very specific you know really specific seeing like yes but this particular life is something I 've been looking at so often that time I mean I 've worked from actually I work from a photo that my mate who just sent me on his iPhone and so you know you never know where an image is gonna come from but that 's a reference and then the rest of it there 's there 's a certain amount of sort of subliminal action that goes into something that I guess that you know well so yeah just paint painting from life and from your experience well you know as Terry said we like we have we live you know one day we package the money and then we realize we 've got a sometimes you know it 's hard to sort of mediate the whole income pinion and prize prizes that are out there important in two ways I guess because they 're a way of getting your work seen and one thing I always liked about them is that you get to exhibit next to your you know fantastic roots you know your friends your peers pick with your with my iron so it 's really nice to be part of things like this because when else what I get to hang you know these guys I admire their work and all that sort of thing so yeah there 's a community thing that 's nice to be involved with and also yeah obviously exposure well blue house with a blue sky and some bright green so I 'm just doing this artist thing of trying to save a picture just for this for some color I think it goes back to think about dumb that guy and appearing there saying about the Australian Australian light you can travel overseas and if you see all sorts of different things with the wire back to Australia and you do tend to paint your or what 's familiar to do with your own environment so I tend to paint a lot of houses Australian houses seems to be my comfort zone of doing this architectural sort of subject I don 't just exclusively do this sort of thing but um I just see these houses as being a nice sort of vehicle for working on composition and tone and color and putting up just making it paint the challenges that all those things those elements provide was just you know basically just sort of sorting it out I 'm trying to make a competition out of it in some ways on I 'm also I 'm taking it a bit like guidances from a photograph this is Paula baptism story on that on the south coast a Victorian and where the Otway mountains run the other Poquoson that it had been raining in the rain stop is a Victorian weather for you they stopped raining and then the Sun came out and so they 're all washed really clean only some beautiful beach houses an hour before training and that 's what people live in Victoria but a pistol beautifulest of the house we 're just sitting on the mound of grass that I 've just looks at them about or really for the painting of the got to stop and get into photographing back so I pretty much brought that photograph home just dropped it took the animal thing so a lot of my paintings to do with really just deleting all the extraneous amount of detail out and making it as simple as possible really oh it 's just been I don 't give myself too many challenges and the more bits and pieces and you can have you know you have more on balustrade I could have more details and windows and append there 's telegraph poles and wires and all the stuff is more trees and shrubs so I probably just kicked on a delinking thing or motor painting more of that stump in at the beginning and then I just took out more and more it 's about just deleting and subtracting and simplifying and originally it was but little country town every suburbs gotten the weather board has of the fire break houses I doubt if Donald Richmond in Windsor yesterday effect around and I just keep on seeing I 'm telling my little camera with me sorry constable those little houses or everybody it wasn 't sale you know this is a lot of retro subjective the past that 's lost algae yeah and it does have that element to it but this their theory they 're all over the place people are still living in them so they 're very to me very contemporary as well in fact that I actually grew up in those funky houses also I think mr. Maxton wolfenberg even personal my father was a carpenter an Australian late 60s so we 're always moving to a new block of land my mother design a house full of sort of plans he 'd be getting council plans that are so she would get them and and they lost he also did this kind of violent shouldn 't be moving and staying for about two years in the house and then let 's somewhere south of Auckland to the north of Auckland to the middle of Auckland within over to Sydney and the normal features of everyone and then Curl Curl they ended up moving up to incentivise for tomorrow so they just never stop never stop moving there in fact my dad was from Ireland my mother was from England so very apparent protect people but I suppose being the bank the mentals for 22 years we used to tour constantly tour inside I got to see that the Australian you know the small towns of Australia over twenty two solid years of just you know we 're always waiting always moving you 'd play one town to another town so these houses were in my DNA as presidents almost any questions do a single plane hum I hum turret to the chagrin of my son Otis he shuts me down Chris Matthews in the house close the door we have a bit of separation of that studio is in the sunroom that they also it 's not exactly separate from the rest of the house of his bedroom couple a couple 's he 's he 's almost pretty one now so he 's probably sick of my honeymoon city 's already big you ask well I didn 't go to a school roll around but I 've had a son now please she was obviously Lindsay fries or something but no I 'm self-taught Mandarin and it 's just one of those things I think you just keep on learning it for every painting is a new challenge and that 's what also keeps you going is it you won 't you never really feel like you 've got a hanging but ugly just always you know working on a new one another one another one you finish what I started on what was a couple long ago I just swing through from beginning to end otherwise if you don 't finish it it 's interesting with yours God that you didn 't quite finish it oh no it 's the best one there you go so I finished it too much yeah can you tell us a bit about the the knife you know and focus sort of fuzzy effect away from the begin anyway mistaken for a photographic stylist in any way at all it 's all about just the painting and that I think the soft edge is just something I 've developed over the over the year so it becomes like a sort of a signature spa that you would everything 's so different and there is like a signature the way people draw or paint will make artists it 's that 's what makes it interesting is that they 're all a little bit different you can have a bunch of artists do the same suffix stand in front of that same so you know that same sound around it for instance that guy was standing on and that all they have their own local you 're something completely different something similar but but that 's the interesting thing about playing is us you know you just were making something out of nothing which is just beautiful but from that what change the ground I do sometimes completely change because it 's you know so again it 's just really just it 's sort of a 's probably fairly faithful to the house why did things whatever this little pattern on the maybe just it goes to the TV RIANZ though we 're just having a little bit of extra sort of movement and happening a little bit more detail again you 've got that as far as the echo of this crisscross thing the diagonals here and the flavour the door and then you 've got sort of gloss on the diagonals here sir it 's a geometric but many more most some of them I think if they 're they 're really working you can just turn them upside down that 's what my stocking abstractors you 're losing the literal well essentially it 's just a mound of grass that sort of rising up another you know but again in a way that 's what good they 've got not too sure what that is but it 's it 's getting away from their being or that 's obviously just you know picture of the Sunday it 's not just an illustration that 's well hopefully more than that so in a way only in my head though oh well that 's wrong so I 'm a look I made all the windows people thank you to tell the truth I think I 'm not often change what 's that going on with windows anyway that is just sort of this becomes part of the patterning ruler sort of it 's you know getting into more the abstraction of it but I do like that feeling of somebody not being at home above being vacated and some of these houses are businesses down one that coastally of the UM the great ocean road so the little house that some of them are lived in some of them are just holiday house so they probably are just like sitting able to with all the blinds shut for weeks at the time will muster the time some of them so well I think that when probably we have all the blinds down and it is all in the curtains pulled over so the Sun was just reflecting off the backs of the curtains and blinds in those two windows but yeah I think just sitting going on inside their house now so interesting things visit Iran there 's those systemic and stoic because I sit here in the weather and just don 't do much but they just change in people that live inside that if you can just be conscious of the time and there 's space for these discussions as well and I just like to think this is a very high percent manganese way you have a sort of ID here in the process and you sort of apply and see where you can detect where that sort of develops that 's something I came up with thirty degree not school and developed its aromas and interesting my first show and this part of this last year the processes of his like sheet to canvas and then and living that drive I hadn 't grown ink letting that go there so go back about three or four pieces on the cold months and just saw something usually get a picture so that 's something that Specter painting that around being able to go outside and look at the sky at the answer matron stuff that inspire me you know on a drive you know flaking it 's to me it 's my sort of mental event another country I go back back up because I 've written a playing it off thing girls go and it went the top of the mountain with a little cannelloni with the apples and sit down I told the council that Vietnam ground so 300 times pronounce it down so for me this is my little attempt trying to capture all the you know and the power to make sure that seems yeah especially on the news just try and get my vision across these really look like that just in Berlin and so I really like that so there 's a month of ever think of me I said oh I could take that I 'll give it to mom and seguido actually stretched it up for up and it hasn 't sold yet not so bad to accentuate means to recap what I 've seen them personally which is fish markets involving politicals spending which routinely and remembers verbs which is I 'm Jennifer real-time or sort of feel just the last bits of the grid with these sort of crying paintings of sky sort of coming in at the last and when I was in Germany yet we got windows like your uncle and about winter in Melbourne nothing compared to Berlin it was insane one day walking down the streets and like this and I knew that I can 't light up just around at the end there 's winter I want me to here but the extremes of weather they really appeal to me and all this work is and the variety of seasons and all their forests and beautiful and the fact that we have our own version here which I 'm really getting into it now whole completely different sellouts but both over the landscapes but you just walking around and all the monsters I think every week the national high school and before that like the fact that like you can 't get a little bitty title you know this removes it mentally or oh god is there should be they all this bit I still wanted to more about this premeditated sort of that where I didn 't like have to switch it up or you know Cynthia store up or something I just wanted something that organically evolved and yeah so I try to get far away that I could use the materials instead of life trying to control them to let them go free and they might follow their yes like it and the way it loses canvas cries and sweet little edges of trees away moving looks like you 're lying on your back in a parking did you apply when you said it clearly is that how the pavements or it 's cameras so there 's no if I deep oils of that which is pre-disaster with you very iconic also water and then _"

and i found painting actually quite problematic because it was very difficult to get a sense of the sound that you had ownership on and when i was at art school in the late 70s it 's kind of interesting i actually buy our article very problematic because often you 're pampering to a few teachers in the art school and in those days it was very much a minimalist period when i was there so was all sort of shaped canvases or stripes or you know constructivist sort of sculptural pieces and so i got called up as a young artist in that aesthetic so most of you probably know people like that american artists who that i was actually particularly interested in was about michael moon who was um in the 70s in the uk so i spent a lot of time on the floor making very elaborate uh constructed shaped forms and then spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to put canvas around these shapes so i actually have to go out and get seamstresses so i actually got more occupied in the making of objects but curiously enough that to the constructor this thing i think has actually stayed with me all through my whole career because once i left art school i think one of the central problems is you can be quite a good student in an art school and do quite well but i actually had very little emotional connection with what i was doing so you actually go out and go into a studio situation on your own i mean half of what you do might well i mean life to me always seems to be about having meaning or not having meaning you know so in one sense it 's meaningless so i 've look at it has to mean something to me so i 'm actually going to sit in the studio for days on end and i have to find meaning in what i 'm doing and i 've actually discovered realized that making shaped canvases was not really where was that and it 's still interesting i i i think there 's a lady called louise nevilson who was an american sculptor in the 70s who used to make the comment to young artists that it quite good to transpire so you might transplant you know i actually sort of translated from uk to australia and i think that complete change of culture and environment was the catholics in which when i landed in sydney i could actually make myself a patient decide and i actually went back to what i enjoyed before i went to art school which was to to draw i used to do a lot of drawing before i went to art school so over six or seven years at england art school i ended up never going into a life room and it 's kind of and draw a live room because we were modern artists and temporary artists moving forward so you know drawing in enough rooms eventually you know you have to be honest with yourself and so when i came out here i actually just picked up a mirror and started drawing myself and it was quite beneficial that i met sue just mentioned within three weeks of being in sydney so the whole kind of destiny thing i just think i was destined to actually stay here because i actually wanted to spend some time in america as well but obviously he didn 't need the right lady to stay anything so when it could happen it would have been america i ended up with somebody of course is that my dear wife actually was born in guilford which is about five miles away from when i went to art school and i actually went back to even discovered her brother of parents just outside canterbury where i actually went to school so when i actually went back to visit the folks you know her girls as a young married couple i my old art classroom my prep school just outside category so it 's a very odd kind of journey and a kind of full circle thing but anyway as i say uh i when i came here i started to draw and started to work with subjects and paint uh a lot of the works in in the 80s i used to sort of stack the canvas onto boards and it sort of ended up being a combination of sort of collage paint and pastel just just that kind of thing of mixed media just seemed to to stay with me but i actually found that probably most of the time i was in the studio i probably spent 80 percent of my time making drawings for paintings so around about 1995 i just sort of bit the bullet and said well really i am a drastic i should really just go for what i was really comfortable with and if you interesting enough the develop drawing prize is they 're doing a tour of this um show about 20 years ago now and if you actually go back and 1999 it was actually mostly in itching with some drawing and pastel top and was clearly a very graphic word um but from that point on all the way through to the large works if you do actually go down psa you can see a much larger word that my wife actually in that show and it 's clearly a progression from a very edited sort of you know clearly a drawing right through to the later works that start with a lot of paint and then it really it 's like any kind of art making you never know it 's a kind of conversation between all those materials so sometimes the dry material might actually dominate all the wet material and you never actually one or the other and i 'll let you guys have a look at these they 're just a quick series of sequences here and you can see that at the early stages i paint out the image i think paint is if anyone uses a lot of brush work it 's a much faster quicker way of getting an image down and i of use the acrylic and the brush and wet material to establish an image and then i might actually work back into that with pastel and charcoal with other materials and then it kind of moves between the two but sometimes the image doesn 't stick so yeah it 's a lot easier to paint out the image and start process again rather than trying to rub something out or you know take it out it 's just just much faster i think that process of moving between having a conversation between the two materials it 's just i think actually created an identity for my work you know people then associate that you know with that process with the way that i might function but yeah there 's a lot of precedence if you think of jack i think most artists would be comfortable with the idea that some of us actually draw in paint you know like it 's you you can 't really go past the jack mehdi and not think about it in terms of drawing as well as paint so i think it actually becomes the end of the day it 's the validity of the image of the masses so you 're going to kind of pick cares about whether it 's one thing or another i think you 're actually missing the point you know it takes what it takes to make the image and that 's the way that 's my process if you want to challenge my process and say well i shouldn 't do that because i 'm cheating or something i mean it 's ludicrous really you know the image stands up but doesn 't and it has a combination of two materials and that 's the way it 's you know it 's been for the last 1500 years um do you want to hear that meter handling yeah um just before i send this out is james here he disappeared on me james i 've actually asked james who 's my sister come james is a painter who lives in glee and he very kindly sat for me for about eight months this is actually just one work of a whole body of work that i worked one this work here is actually um there 's a couple of progress shots of the work there i 've also got on the next page some of you might have seen the archibald prize i don 't know if you 've seen that but we 've actually got a much bigger work of james in thatcher which is now traveling to victoria i think or i think presently up at newcastle so you might actually like to see the way that that work also um progress and that 's another one of jane so there 's three big works there that you know you might just like to have a quick look at how make sure those photos actually stay i do take funny enough i do take a lot of photos of my sisters because it 's always a way of just you know it 's it 's part of that conversation that you have you can 't hear me a close relationship with all the sisters that come through my studio and it 's quite important that those sisters have something about them that is compelling and just want to try and quickly just get across because it 's interesting francis bacon there 's a show that tony barnes is going to put on at the art gallery nation this year five decades you may well know that that 's coming along and actually they 've asked me if i 'd like to go and choose a couple of paintings down there and talk about it because clearly i 've got a fairly good sort of sense of bacon in my own work as well as other artists but the thing about bacon it 's actually historically quite also quite out somebody can always talk about configuration from a point of view of a sensation so you 're never actually trying to illustrate the subject you 're trying to translate trying to find an equivalent in terms of paint or hassle or whatever and so i think you know when bacon so through paint of the canvas and then try to sort of make something from that there 's that sort of alchemy where where ultimately the image that you you end up making on on your has no reference in terms of look put it 's always about a mark that 's an equivalent does that make sense maybe not anyway but the the sensation is actually quite important so you 're never actually you know working from a photographic position you 're working really outside that um i think that 's one of the big challenges of actually working from subject is it 's not to copy it 's actually defined find that sensation you can actually talk you know go back and look at he actually talked about the same thing so it 's almost so interesting is that they 'll actually talk a lot about building an image and actually totally destroying it or dismembering it and rebuilding it there 's a constant reconstructing of that image to find what you think is an authentic position and i think that 's basically you know in essence what i 'm trying to do with the sensation of having a sister in in the studio day after day having those conversations and so as james with a test i actually then record or write out the kind of dialogue that one has with the sitter and somebody might like to there 's a book by a guy called martin gainesville who we write a thing called the the man with the blue scarf which is actually when he sat the museum freud and the martian is actually the critic of the guardian in london so the book is really quite anecdotal and it goes on lots of different pages and it 's very interesting because you know he talks about that relationship with the artist and you know it 's quite compelling reading there 's another one james lord did on jack and etti which is another good book to get hold of if you 're interested in that artist subject relationship um am i still here is well it 's quite interesting because a lot of people think you know the work is quite psychotic and generally seems quite busy in fact when you actually look at most of my images they 're actually quite quiet and meditative and i think that flamingo actually picked up on that same kind of quality and i that i just work with the sitter and maybe it 's probably to do with resolution you know how you spend a lot of time on work but there 's no resolution you 're just constantly moving stuff around trying to make it stick and once it starts to have resolution maybe that slowing down process that happens to it gets a bit tighter perhaps a little bit more still so maybe it 's just in in that particular sort of process well for me you 're right because i live in weber which is out south west not actually very far from where you are in stanley tops where we 're actually further down near darks forest on the other side here in bulai so it 's pretty rugged country down there and when i moved out with sue in 1987 we 've got a five-acre block there and studios and what have you i actually tried to paint the landscape for probably the first four or five years and actually built a platform down here about 15 minutes of gorge and but it just looked a bit like own thing but the interesting thing was all that kind of calligraphic marking in that environment i think it 's actually impacted quite strongly on my work and then i kind of hit on the idea if i actually scaled the work right up and of course the notion of actually using and this is slightly more unusual it 's just a progression from you know spent ten years on the head i might as well start trying to deal with the rest of the body and do one thing at the time so that idea of the scale is actually quite landscape-oriented you actually scan all across an image and i would say most of my images are about the ability to get the wow factor from across the room but also to be able to go up quite close and actually walk across the image and have that intimacy so i think i quite enjoy that you know those two different sorts of decisions i should come back to this stuff i was interested in the highlight in using red why couldn 't you view i mean one and used through a range of different scales different moods the red for me on an orange ground is always you know kind of i think one thing that probably needs to be established here is that my conversation with history of art is probably really from a modernist position i 'm actually more interested in the 20th century because you know artists like bacon and brucing freud and kossoff and you know and so on so um when when people talk about what 's a contemporary artist and a modernist i tend to i mean i 'm contemporary in the sense that i work and operate in the 21st century but my actual dialogue is actually with artists from that past period and um whereas probably a lot of contemporary younger artists would would neces you know often be looking sideways they 'd actually be looking at phenomena that 's actually happening around them whereas i 'm not actually that sort of obviously like i look at shadows and i 'm interested in that but my own work is actually quite rooted in that you know i 'm more looking at francis bacon and actually having a conversation going back to meditation rembrandt um is it difficult to know when you 've finished there 's an interesting situation here because if you think of someone like chuck closes another portrait painter or artist by tangram and he actually brings the work up and he 'll start in one square and move through so by the time he 's got to number eight clearly he 's the process is finished whereas if you ask the clooney when his painting 's finished what we know sometimes it went on for two years it can never figure it out so it 's a kind of temperamental thing i think some artists need the certainty of a system and you know you see that quite often in contemporary art you know people set up projects or set up pieces and actually make the work and so it 's a clearly defined process but certainly with work like this it 's very hard to know exactly when you 're going to finish it but i think over this experience i think you know we with me the whole time and clearly when you 're working on equivalence sometimes the the audience might not actually see the relationship and there 's a guy called euro another english painter who who actually made the comment it 's not like the right you know it 's not the likeness that 's necessarily the crucial thing it 's the rightness so you look at this that 's why i call them by initials because i 'm not that interested in you saying oh that looks like james but i actually wanted to kind of challenge you on that and say well actually while that 's not my my intention i 'd rather you look to the word got something from it emotionally and not say well that so he looks like james okay he must know how to make this image that 's not what i 'm interested in but i still maintain there is a connection and yeah i mean you you know i think when you 're working on on a series of works it 's it 's you 've got a lot of work on with each other so you start to get a sense of the ones that are further ahead in terms of resolution very hard to just do one work and actually get a sense of whether that 's a finished work i have to work and that 's why in some cases with one or two sisters i 'd work for anything out to two years on like i 'm persuaded i feed them well i think giving good lunches especially wine you know the whole day is enjoyable and it 's a lovely environment an occasion when things get slightly dodgy then i have to go to sydney and sit with you know in their studios or spaces yes congratulations uh i think i can say one thing which is just part of a general um idea i mean with clara it 's quite interesting when you 're using these these slabs of paint there 's clearly a kind of abstraction so it 's actually not that different you see when i work a lot with the linear thing like lion is actually quite abstract in the sense if you just a skeletal structure and the air can actually move through the the object uh as soon as you start to clad and building it starts to become quite representational so i 'm actually quite the reason i 'm there a lot in my work is to keep that air and oxygen in the work and to keep it abstract and keep it not forming up into some sort of representation makes sense so i think the same thing happens with with your work you know when you 're actually using slabs of material you 're very conscious of the physicality of the slabs of paint that then kind of if you like metamorphosize into the image so then it becomes quite clear that the relationships between those abstractions actually coalesce into an image so i think we 're just different kinds of painters processes are different but at the end of the day conceptual framework isn 't that far apart that makes sense i mean in my case i prefer to be able to scan and and find lots of things that that then relates to the association with upfront and quite confrontational matters and being cruelty 's work so if i was to make an opinion and if this becomes a matter of choice and temperament i prefer to be able to kind of get in behind the skin but you know it 's it 's it 's it 's like saying like yeah sure i could have made a yellow painting but i chose that yeah a lot of printmaking and the printmaking side of it is is a newer thing because it 's just taking me about 10 years to actually get on top of it it 's the same thing you know when you go into a new medium the actual process of printmaking is not that difficult to put in an acid bar and make a print what have you but to sort of claim ownership of that process is much harder and i found that i 've actually worked with master printers over the years and other printers or other printmakers have said oh i much prefer your prints because they 're more feral they 're less certain you 're not actually sure in there like you with your major works what are you all scrubbing and scratching and rebuilding and what have you but it just took a long time to to to get to a point where you know the works started to uh have their own identity and i 've actually just got an australian premium commission so i sort of feel like you know i feel like you know not part of the printmaking fraternity but i 've got my own press in my own setup because i actually decided that i wanted to have that as a as a parallel process i think the thing about sculpture or printmaking is the time i mean it 's clearly a lot quicker to just get out of your brush and go for it and i could do 10 works in a week well i 'm really cool what um but basically you know i got to a point after my survey show that i actually wanted to to do some prints on the same size of my my drawings and paintings or hybrids whatever you want to call it and involved in you know so i was always about back to these works and the issues um it 's kind of nice having shared i work on a lot of you know a lot of things got all the big works i 've got the etchings small studies i do a lot of pen ink and gouache studies and things as well so like the sculpture i just haven 't got my head around sculpture play but clearly i could but it 's it 's this priority how much i mean i think my own temperament is actually more like a hedgehog you know deep down into one marrow and hopefully strike a bit of water whereas someone like my wife sue she 's more like a fox you know so i mentioned she 's into a lot of different orifices but she works sculpture you know printmaking painting she 's extraordinarily diverse but of course it 's also can in some cases be fragmented um so i tend to want certain things i just keep plugging away and hopefully something it 's like anything isn 't it i mean move past that first impression and the it either becomes a deeper thing or you suddenly realize they 're artists and you start to realize that they haven 't got the substance so this whole facade that we run around with needs to be broken down you can only do that over time i think it 's the same with our new artwork too he hit the deck running i think jesus she looks great and then after a couple of weeks you start to realize just what a trivial actually get some authenticity so there 's all these kind of things that are going on in your work as well as with your people you 're meeting to get past all that front so it 's yeah it 's an interesting journey okay thank you david thank you very much you _"

    "text": "there were two places that were possible one was mosman the other was Hunters Hill I chose mosman clifton gardens because the first ferry ran at six o 'clock the first ferry from hunters hill didn 't run until about seven which meant that you lost an hours working time wide across the bridge well it was that we couldn 't afford to live in the eastern suburbs then once we had moved to mossman we moved to clifton gardens and stayed there in the same house for just on 37 years and there 'd be no way that I 'd ever go back to the eastern suburbs you haven 't_''_45.729 got the open space you haven 't got the bush land you didn 't have then the community sense that you have now or did have less i think these days than it was back in nineteen sixty-five when we came to mossman but economics dictated it initially and then the quality of the environment kept us here I came into the council in December 1968 the elections used to be in December they 're now in September the moved to tifton gardens in January 65 I met up with Bradley sisters become involved in bushland regeneration which was close to my heart and then in 67 68 there was a building erected by a man called earl cameron down at 17 Ragland street it was almost on the point a quite fine house had been demolished well that was not good but it wasn 't all bad but the building that was erected there was very high very prominent it started off three stories higher than it is now when find that it exceeded what was allowed under schedule 7 of the local government act but what really got me into the council was going on the ferry each morning I would see the spoil that had been just tipped down the four short massacring the trees and turning it into really rubble them and I kept railing against this and saying they shouldn 't allow this to happen and some people on the ferry said well why don 't you do something about it so I thought about it discussed it with my wife and decided to being because of that building and what i thought was slackness on the part of the council and a policy decision to ensure that we had proper planning that didn 't permit that sort of thing to happen so i ran for the council and popped the pole which became a habit thereafter and i was independent of all the others the Bradley 's lived in a Luca road Joan and Eileen they are both spinsters joan was a science graduate Arlene was arts graduate they were very different characters joan was very mannish whenever you saw her in the bush she would have her shorts on and a knife and a cigarette in her mouth and she was absolutely fearless when it came to protecting the bushland and she had a whole group of us who were working weeding rell around and very places like that to get rid of the Lantana and she and Eileen had been concerned about the habitat for the blue wren that 's how they became interested in bushland and then they devised a method for restoring bushland not going in and raising it norm but rather working from the good to the bad so that you allowed the good to expand gradually it was slow but it was very effective and she got me interested in that then I thought well we should try and get the national trust involved I wasn 't present to the National Trust at that time this was back in the sixties early seventies and I didn 't become president of the National Trust until nineteen ninety one but their method had been adopted by the National Trust recognizing that it was a long term thing not a year-by-year thing and the association between the National Trust and mosman had always been good there 's a high percentage of mossman people who are members of the National Trust so Joan and Eileen worthy the funds that are a go of that the National Trust then came in and of course when I became president of the National Trust I made sure that the association between mosman and the National Trust remained there was a very strong push to turn the Bradley bushland reserve into tennis courts that was for an election I could see that there was going to be a change in the composition of the council and that unless the Bradley bushland or wasn 't call Brandi bushland then unless that parcel of bushland was protected in some way it would become tennis courts which I thought would be an abomination so I devised a scheme whereby we named it as the Bradley bushland reserve after to pioneer women of mosman that would make it more difficult to turn it into tennis courts and you 'll find the plaque talks about that dedication taking place in September 1983 it took place just before the election now the election did change the nature of the council but by that time the fact that it was a named reserve after two pioneers of Bush regeneration and who are residents of mosman protected the land as we came further down the track however by 1986-87 there was a resurgence of people who wanted to turn it into at least part of it into an expansion of the tennis courts so Lloyd Edwards and I then devised a secondary scheme the bicentenary and put it into the Bradley bushland reserve so that now if you were going to change its nature you would have to consult for the common law so we got thirty five thousand dollars it was very interesting it was to be presented by somebody from the Commonwealth and I as the mayor in would have been late 87 early I thing was to get the check I was in court and it was a difficult case and my opponent just kept droning on and on so it was getting closer and closer to the time around three thirty i think it was when would you to get the money I didn 't finish in court until about three so I 'd raced out my clock had ordered a taxi which was on the opposite side of Philip Street to my chambers I raced out getting dressed putting my tie on as I raced out onto the road and I was struck by a truck as I crossed the road and the near side mirror of the truck hit me in the chest and it smashed and tore it I didn 't realize this I got into the taxi and the taxi driver said to me would I lean forward please I said why said because you 're dripping blood on the seat so I laid for that blood everywhere and I got out here to the Bradley bushland reserve called his crown waiting including the then deputy mayor I think it was mrs. Lee Leila hotly he suggested Hadleys wife and my shirt was all stained and I was worried that was going to spoil my suit which was very expensive it so Lee Hadley took my coat from me it was a bitter cold day I remember and there is a photograph taken with this big stain blood stain all over my shirt and down into my trousers and the headline on the daily was the mere shed blood for mossman but I got the 35,000 now the repeater Clyde was that fit our owners pt5 was the deputy mayor and Lee Hadley took my coat when it was over ceremony was over we were to have a reception well by that time I 'd weak so I had to go to hospital so Peter Clive conducted the reception I went off the hospital be stitched up and it was quite a dramatic time but it meant that the Bradley bushland reserved now was twice dedicated Commonwealth money safe there are really two episodes one was in the early 80s when the Commonwealth was proposing to sell off for development the area of bushland and trees between what is now the walk way down to Balmoral from the extension of middle head road and the hospital at HMAS penguin I can 't remember how many acres there are but there was a big protest about that down at Balmoral and that 's when I first met Tommy Wren Tommy Wren who was strong left-wing labour came down there and he and I stood on the same platform and addressed a very big crowd and the net result of that was the conjunction between the council and Tommy rain with his strong Labour Party connections meant that that didn 't happen Tom still reminds me quite frequently about the time we were we first met and of these very tall me in six foot plus and I 'm five foot plus not very many inches and the long and the short of it on this platform must have been quite amusing for people to see but it was very effective and so we repulsed that the second one was when the counts the Commonwealth was shifting the military from middle head and George 's Heights to hold worthy or wherever they were going to send Townsville as well and there was a thing called the preferred solution that would have involved many hundreds of houses on middle head the council agreed with it I think because it felt it didn 't have any alternative but a number of us Phil Jenkin of the harbor defenders Don good sir of what is now the headland Preservation Society all clubbed together to oppose this and I was strongly opposed to it and worked pretty hard then just before an election in i think it was probably 1998 the then Prime Minister John Howard was convinced that all the defense lands around sydney harbour should go into one trust access and not developed for private purposes that was a genius decision it meant that vast tracts of land around sydney harbour including North Head middle head George 's Heights will etch cockatoo dock and later the lighthouse at north at South head and the former Biological Station at watsons bay all went into this Sydney Harbour Federation trust for mosman it 's been fantastic for Sydney it 's been fantastic the 52 time rock down at mosman Bay which was great serious cave it was where hm as serious was careened in 1789 after it had done it 's round-the-world trip of twelve thousand eight hundred and something miles to the Cape of Good Hope down through the Roaring Forties and around the world to get provisions to keep the starving colony alive so it came back and it was careened there so I thought would be very nice to have some monument that recorded those events so we got a sculptor called caller she think Hungarian in origin interesting man and we got him to do this bar relief so David Martin was the governor so he got by barge at the wharf in full naval uniform looked absolutely splendid now he came up to unveil all he had to do was pull a cord Brian Leckie was the engineer and I said to Brian Brian for God 's sake make sure that splittin thing works he said to me mr. Muir it 'll work we 've done it 12 times and it worked every time sousa David comes up and he pulls the cord and nothing happens so he pulls the cord again and nothing happens so he pulls it a third time and still nothing happened so then he draws his sword and is about to slash the cord and there are photographs they 'll be in the library here of Sir David Martin with sword drawn a great picture just then a man whose name was not KN 0 TT which I thought was rather amused raced out with a ladder put it around the back of the rock and loosen the rope down it fell and it was opened so it 's very dramatic was but was it 's a great story for an the time the library was opened the governor was late he was worried max was worried it was close to Christmas everything was happening wouldn 't be ready TC I said to him it will all work out and it did the library itself was an interesting building to get the council to agree to it was not easy you had to have you had these disparate interests in the council but this was going to be a building that if it was properly done would endure as a monument to all the alderman who saw it as an important feature in mosman so there was a committee fault and I chaired this committee and we would meet and we had a very very good architect design it in fact I thought the building would get a prize then I was a country where I was and I saw this building that was sheared in copper and I thought what a wonderful finish this would give as it aged it would get the green ver degree on it it would color up and it would be a beautiful looking building thousand dollars to do it we couldn 't afford that so I went and saw crane copper and aluminium and convinced them to do it for cost in return for which they could use it in their advertising end submitted for a prize so that they get publicity and when it was open that I 'm surprised it didn 't win a prize actually because it was very highly thought of and it 's an excellent space and then it needed some decoration so I knew John Coburn the artist now dead of course and he had this great tapestry and I saw it and I thought oh this would be great but I couldn 't afford it so i did a whip-around and I think we got it maybe 12 or so people and cleaning a couple of the automatic palmisano was one I remember I was another it 's a twisting antico I think Ron Luke if I remember correctly and we all put money in and bought the tapestry which has been really won one of the prides and joys of the library and it gives a great thing to have been mayor of mosman it 's a it 's an office that interesting people have occupied over the years George Ferris was another man who was mayor here for some years he was very high in local government he became press into the Local Government Association as did Ron Luke who also became chairman of the Sydney County the V I 'm sorry Cumberland County that 's that there is a plaque coat of arms in the Ottomans room or the counselors room is it in areas with that which Ron donated to us and high later became president of local government association and say mayors of mossman have been in the forefront of local government for many years in mosman has been a trailblazer in many ways particularly in financial ways and particularly under our the present general manager used to beat and clog them a very astute man very good with finance and this council has done things that councils many times its size have not been able to do and remain solvent why do I like living in mosman its environment it it city yet there are places where you could be hundreds of miles from a city you go to charter head you walk through the bush land there the birds are singing there are trees around you you can see glimpses of water then you walk out on to a little rocky promontory and spread ahead of you is the high rise of Sydney so you move from Bush to city in an instant so it 's that environment that is so wonderful in mosman _"

    "text": "Thank You Phil um I haven 't talked for a while and then I thought we should all talk and have questions and answers and take the conversation where you might like it to go one afternoon in May of 2008 I was quietly trying to avoid work Sydney Morning Herald which is sunken be altered their history and somebody came by my desk and said and talkback radio has gone completely berserk this afternoon about bill henson exhibition which is opening at night at the gallery the commercial going in sydney in rosslyn Oxley gallery that morning our paper had had had a blinder of a colleague blinder of a colleague by a blinder of a column by my colleague granted divine which had a brochure soaping about the ghastly dangers of allowing children to be adults too soon blasting the handsome exhibition and it was not the first time the Miranda had spoken on the subject of adults about children being adults too soon children can be adults too soon by doing remarkable things in Miranda 's is like wearing dark glasses apparently there are lots of fun talkback radio was just wild with the subject of bill henson now if you 've been reading newspapers for the last twenty is you know that billion sins were it 's comfortably surely the controversies about his representations of children have been argued back and forth in the papers for a very very long time and was being often quite heated but nevertheless those conversations have been part of the sort of the intellectual muscle of the country but on this particular afternoon those conversations have jumped the tracks thanks to radio 2 GB and things as it turned out to some politicians of both sides of public New South Wales Parliament and that mount the police from rose bay police station went in and closed that exhibition down subsequently discovered they closed that exhibition down having been informed by their legal advisers that there was no legal basis on which to do it they never be as close to town and next morning of course the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd simply sent the issue into orbit and by condemning photographs condemning Hansen on the early morning television I soon pieces about it for the Sydney Morning Herald and that I was approached by text publishing and asked what about doing a short sharp book on this even as the issue is breaking even as the story is breaking even as it is emerging so so I plunge team absolutely plunged in and I was having a an enormously enjoyable time with this issue while just beating my head against the wall about it but nevertheless professionally and enormously stimulating time and finally at the great age of 60 something I 've tweed to the fact that I 've been reporting panics all my life this is a panicked this was a classic panic was beaten up by the press it was taken up by politicians it was getting it was sent into overdrive by my prime minister then it was just pursued it was a classic panic I came to me at that time of image of the bonfire I talked about the bonfire the bonfires of panic the way that the kindling heaps up and the way that people find where the ways people find you know putting the extra the extra bucket of Cara to get the thing really blazing and here with the Henson matter was an absolutely classic panic and I thought to myself know when this is all over and done with I 'm going to have to have a think about panic and I 'm going to have to have a look again at my worker years to see where I 've written about panic so when it was all done and my publishers are going to talked about the possibility of me reordering a decade or so as works taking taking essays and reports that I 've written reworking them amalgamating them etc etc etc and looking at the subject panic and I was quite chilled I what I discovered because this country of all countries has so little reason to panic and yet we are swept by pairings and the curious thing about political panics is that we forget them once they 're gone for instance who now really remembers the great panic about Native Title that swept this country from the time of Marlborough in 1992 until about a year was in a stew in a frenzy of fear about the entitlement of Aborigines to land because of those Native Title decisions they power politics of the country they had they 've had a part of the Pauline Hanson sheep was it was a hugely important game of the appeal of Pauline Hanson and to my mind it was also beaten up deliberately and with great skill by jon hamm and this my decision to shape a book about panic in australia i thought i want i will start with native title because i will shock people to remind them and the extent to which this country was seething about the dangers of native title and when I reread the stuff I wrote then and I was you know worked on fresh material and putting stuff together I thought it was I was glad to remind people once again of three of three conservative front benches each of them with a law degree who knew what they were doing when they went into public and lied that out origines could claim back yards they simply lied their names are Eric they had no excuse whatever for promoting the false claim that freehold backyards might be vulnerable to Native Title claim I 'm not the only person who says that of course the High Court has said it again and again and again and again and at that time a wonderful bunch of q seas and senior barristers in this city about 40 or 50 of them put their names to the shortest puntius best letter ever published by The Sydney Morning Herald to claim that backyards can be seized under native title is a lie full stop followed by the names of water skis it was time to and look whenever I mentioned the name Eric Abetz I have to make something very very clear no one is responsible for the bad behavior or the political opinions of their uncles the fact that Eric 's uncle ran Paris for the Nazis is not his fault auto Yvette 's was a very civilized Nazi and he did a great deal to preserve paths in those long i were a famed area the peppers cheap allegation is that he is somehow smeared a leading nancy during the war and the governor of paris for all those years it 's simply not fair eric has only to answer for what he 's done in Tasmania hun Liam and Gladstone he put her name to that lie and Nick mean she no doubt without a flicker of regret put his name to that lie so this book begins with native title and now disappeared panic people say to me what damage to panik 's do and as I will look think of it this way let 's have a look at the panics that have disappeared and the way in which they 've transformed Australian society many of us in this room grew up in the midst of an old old panic about Roman Catholics and this was a society divided bitterly between Protestants and Catholics that was appalling I was a panic about the Papists went back a very long way and it 's entirely disappeared and the disappearance of that panic has transformed this country to a better place I myself and the happy beneficiary of the disappearance accepted some religious circles homosexuals that has essentially disappeared from this country except the Cardinal Pell Bishop Jensen Brigadier General retired whatever his name is Vince Trayon Christian movement a range of Imams and one or two Jewish leaders apart from them this country is trans has transformed itself in the last 30 years on its attitude to Aborigines the panic of effort the other the panic has disappeared certainly made my life a lot better it 's made a lot of people 's lives a lot better is good too but but I nevertheless due honor the efforts of people I Cardinal Pell in here who has maintained another strange panic in Australia which is a panic about human rights protections a panic which is which is which is now only being only being promoted by news limited newspapers some church leaders and some Liberal Party politicians in the last 50 years Australia Australia is now as you know the only democracy in the world that has no national system of rights protections no no rights protections that you and I as citizens can actually go to court and enforce that unique position at the moment I 'm in the principal the principal the principal enemy of those rights and keeping a bit of a panic I mean how many judges be trusted with these issues um that 's principally being promoted by some church leaders the principal one of Bertha 's Cardinal Pell principal purpose is to make sure that the secularist mindset as he calls it is not there to decide questions of life liberty etcetera etc and it is the outer defense to the absolutely absolutely in their mind crucial business of maintaining their privileged exceptions to anti-discrimination laws which allow the churches not to hire people like me or to fire them if they find where gardens in their hospitals because those anti-discrimination provisions which are available in the Commonwealth and in all states except Tasmania are absolutely globally defended by church leaders even though most Australians think the notion of it is come is bizarre and they 're supported by federal labor party and it 's not just to keep us from being gardeners in hospitals but it 's also to make sure that adulterers people living in _''_733.5 employed by or can be fired by church bodies churches are the largest actually the largest private employers in Australia so this is not a boutique issue and I 'm always Amenas to see that provide party supporting things these arguments which they do absolutely supported by the Labour Party because what this saying is that a woman like the Prime Minister cannot be employed say as a receptionist in a Catholic old people 's home because she 's living in a de facto relationship now you find you know those are their little arse floors that really really enjoys of people like me gay marriage is society she compared to these laws as practical issues they are heavily defended by the churches in a society which no longer panics about homosexuality or people living in seen or people getting divorces and the outer rim of Defense of those privileges is to undermine the campaigns for bills of rights in this country so that 's the source of people of Rights padding anyway and so how that is looking at panic dip them across a number of things that interested interested in the buzz panics that died out as I say those paddocks that blaze up like bonfires and then and then go and and we 're left rather like the morning-after cracker night wandering wandering around the great white circle of ash that the bonfire is left behind and looking in at me hmm that really happened last night you know what the work you know to wonder what 's left in the ashes and kind of quickly for getting it but then there are also the enduring panics and as many as you probably may know a subject very dear to me in the last 10 or 12 years has been the enduring panic in Australia about refugees who have the temerity to come here as they do to very many countries in the world by bud and while their particular where their arrival by boat or plane that doesn 't probably anybody in this country but their arrival by both the panics people in this country I think it 's an issue I think it 's a profoundly interesting issue I think it goes deeply into the business that we have in this country with white Australia and deeply into the willingness post the willingness since the since John Howard 's time the willingness on all sides of politics actually to bring back into domestic politics the very to bring back into domestic politics the deliberate provocation of fears about race the deliberate beating up a brace panics this is something that many of us have thought had disappeared from national politics and in the 1980s when John Howard made some very mild remarks about slowing down chinese immigration they nearly destroyed him thurs remarks but a decade later he brought back international politics things much subtler and nastier than there and one of those was the response that he revved up to vote people that I wrote a book with my colleague and dear friend marian Robinson many years ago about the 2001 boat people panic and I had not really revisited I haven 't revisited the tamper in this edition but I have ended the the collection with a long reflection about the attitude of Australians to both people and the ways in which those when a little boat called the pain game with five Vietnamese on board reach darwin harbour with the aid of the school atlas small compass and turn themselves in to immigration authorities that was the first refugee boat to arrive in australia and that set off that 's it off what 's essentially been the panic about birds that is an enduring defining panic in Australia one that is being ruthlessly promoted at the moment bye bye bye well in particular by the conservative side of politics you cannot believe I cannot actually believe that two Christians Tony Abbott and Morrison were two Christians can say the things they do about about refugees and and I have tried with both men and I try in here to remind them that the the Christian listen that counts in the Christian listen that counts with refugees is not the Good Samaritan both of those men talk about the Good Samaritan the Christian lesson that really matters is that Christ was a refugee and he would not have survived to do his good work on earth but for the generous refugee policies of their donkey in and Shelton so that they could escape the bloodlust of Herod never mind I 've got nowhere with Tony Abbott on that he says o GD you so there 's a personal technology here as well but the other enduring the other enduring panic and the one in the shadow of which we all live in this country is the enduring panika that drugs and this is a fantastically interesting pattern that the history of this panic is so wonderful this is one of America 's purity panics in 1898 the Americans courtesy of their little war with Spain found themselves the occupying power in the Philippines and they found in the Philippines large numbers of Chinese opium smokers now the United States were familiar a bit with the habits of Chinese and opium because they had seen a lot of opium smoked on the gold fields of California they didn 't like either p.m. that didn 't like Chinese and absolutely lower for combination of the two they decided that they were going to rent it not only their own possessions but the world the world this now slight problem at the time was the British government is one of the keenest promoters of opium on earth and they were actually the course of fighting a war with the Chinese to keep the opium market in china open very successful war but when the Liberals came to power in Britain under asketh they join the American mission against opium now the Americas at the end and it was a great meeting of powers and share Heinz thing called the Shanghai tree that is over a century old its aim was to rid the world of opiates what a spectacular failure lett has been that whole effort has been and in a chapter here called my love of drugs I talk about I talk about the continuing Australian paralysis the drug policy we are we are drug pigs in this country we are heavy consumers of drugs this week a million Australians over the age of 14 will be having an illicit drug or let me put it this way this week a million Australians over the age of 14 would 've questioned admit they were having higher those figures are taken from official Health Department surveys we are a very enthusiastic consumer of drugs in this country buffe in the most blissfully Australian Way actually bristles not quite the word but in we we live in the country we have we are we live in a country of the most subtle and interesting contradictions as interesting contradictions of my life 's work I suppose exploring them and the interesting contradiction here is that we have both a huge appetite for consuming drugs and an absolute determination to punish those who do the fact that we are keen on these substances has not in any way softened our determination to make sure we punish those who report doing sir and that and that is a that is the continuing the continuing panic in Australia the panic about drugs which a few weeks ago you may have seen I hope you did the work of Australia 21 this is a print out of their wonderful report and this is a report by some absolute nobodies who tend to who were arguing that who are arguing that the war makes things worse for everybody except criminals and that it needs to be radically we thought those these are people like Jeff gallop performer creamier twist mystery it 's essentially another buddy isn 't Alex were that quality mother Kate Carnell former chief minister of the SCT well what would she know Nick caring for the director of public prosecutions and he 's got beard basically just a parade of noble who else to put their names to it all Nick Palmer well I suppose he was the former commissioner of the Australian Federal Police for years universally admired what would he know that this is an astonishing report Bob Carr before he became foreign minister anybody 's name to Michael woolrich used to be federal health ministries metric this is a absolutely terrific report this is a bunch of key figures in this country saying what this country has known for a long time more on drug drugs is a complete complete failure and makes everything about the drug situation worse and yet as I say in here in the panic book except for a brief period between 2001 had the platform of radically rethinking the drug situation the green is in 2001 in the most whimsical really actually quite ridiculous language but in but with their hearts in the right place and the time has twisted around their vows the Greens adopted a policy of quite radical drug reform and if you 'll excuse the expression they had the kicked out of there before five years for it principally by news limited by it but just but also by the Labour Party also by the Liberal Party national party everybody that somebody should actually be arguing in the political arena that we have to rethink radically situation with drugs earned derision abuse it was phenomenal for normal and there was a great battle inside greens a great battle inside greens and it was dumped because the greens are very pragmatic party indeed and they couldn 't take the heat now that means there 's no there is no there is no political party in this country at all at all it 's actually promoting the notion of rethinking drug policy and the point of Australia 21 was to do this we actually have to do this but we can 't of course unless we do something about the panic about drugs that makes it impossible to discuss this Saturday calmly and usefully in our community it gets back to panic my love of drugs is it is is one of the key chapters of this book where I try to write about when I try to write about that issue and i have with the help of a large team of researchers I think done a very useful task here you will be able to find on page on pages 207 and 208 a complete list of all of the Australian political leaders who have had to concede a use of least of marijuana when they did it and the terms in which they did and there they all are and there 's Bob Brown Bob Brown had by this time come out his own rather bare confession when I was in London back in nineteen seventy I did sit in a circle with some Eritrean students and part of an seng marijuana and i did inhale but that 's that answer let me answer some questions and go where and go where this is I should have just one other thing so what 's the panic now what 's the panic that we 're experiencing in politics right now it isn 't I have to say panic which I 've had any close look at in the book but it is the panic about Australian economy we have the best no economy is ever perfect for everybody all the time no economy is without dangers facing it ever but right now Australia has essentially the best economy in the world and yet by extraordinarily skilled and I don 't mock him for its extraordinary skill political footwork the opposition has managed to convince Australians that this economy is on the brink of collapse and the figures show the poll after poll after poll that the opposition is infinitely more trusted to handle the economy of the government and yet we are in a kind of economic paradise now that is done through skillful manipulation of panic it 's not done by rational argument it 's not done done by fear and panic the fear of what the carbon tax will do the fear of what the future holds the fear of the mining companies might take all of that I 'll or and go and mine it somewhere else that 's the fear in this country at the moment there 's also squalor which makes you a just invisible the squalor story in this country at the moment is amazing as well but this is the fear via merit that this country is around the economy around carbon tax and around that the absolute destructon the structure all we hold dear any minute now because of these things and it took me back and I went and searched about it took me back to nineteen seventy five the great first panic of my career as a politician panic over Whitlam and it was the need so urgent to get rid of Whitlam who is inevitably going to be defeated at the next election but to get rid of him now that panic that saw what I still think was a coup d 'etat in this country and mean much more conservative and even and it is now had a editorial on its front page calling for the overthrow of an elected government it is in the plainest interest of national self-preservation to get rid of a management which has reduced to reach and fortunate country to the verge of economic and social disintegration sounds like today doesn 't here we are once again on the verge at once again urge entri needing to get rid of a government so having still does its work and and I 've hoped to explain a little bit um in this ball thank you now let 's have some questions let 's let 's talk about this and take it where you would like yes you smoked it first of that to lots of padding that seemed to clear the air and being improve I think Emma sexuality in any Catholicism there 's another one as well which is communism we 're not actually we are no longer grid by that huge national panic aconitum sorry I 'm wondering then have you left the difference between those it disappeared like a the fear of Catholics of the fear of quarters is that 's all about religion and it 's all about the standing of religion in the society there 's also a kind of a solidarity in Australia when I mean when you 've got so much worse to worry about than catholics you can almost you can always find some common cause with them and then they started marrying your cousins and it 's a subject you know everything just started to break down and then they took have to be quite nice and this kind of thing and and also crucial for crucial for that were two things one was state aid to schools that huge that huge political debate around giving state money to schools which because of something the United States will never do and as I understand the United Kingdom almost never does this country pauses because we don 't have billions of dollars into church schools that decision are very expensive did do a lot to close that gap and the other thing of course was the fact that politics ceased to be so naked is a deal here I mean the easiest thing to understand about Tony Abbott is that he represents the conservative social conscience views of the deal vs great deal to admire about the dlp and and their first people left labor and they 've all moved across to the Liberal Party power and John Howard 's cabinet contained a you know a number of a number of prominent Catholic figures who would once never have been anywhere but the labor party so all of those helped to break down that that bread that Great Divide and science did a lot sexuality on the Panik thing it took didn 't do that I thought you might have been suggesting that the cleansing thing sometimes no I don 't think panics are cleansing at all I don 't think they 're cleansing all they leave behind victims confusion ridiculous laws I mean obviously one of the things I look out look out in this book I 'm is that is the panic of terrorism in the middle of the night middle of the last decade the wreckage they leave behind is terrible about to annex though they never really work unless there 's something there you 've got to have something there you can 't you can 't_''_1885.59 be cover panic out of absolutely nothing and clearly the panic of the terrorism had its heart something that mattered a great deal but panic is to be completely out of proportion and then to manipulate those fears usually for power I mean nearly every panic is about power its outcome that the underlying argument of panic is if the goodies more power to deal with this but it 's not cleansing fire no just it 's a wrecker it 's a wrecker not you need to this country because i 'm not from moment saying as you need to this country when you were talking about the both people that that might have tapped into our past of the Europe the Yellow Peril of course that sort of comes into it yeah of course at the expense of going on for the next three hours that you say really briefly if just look at the timeline Australian notionally cooperative of white Australia under of white Australia but it was under Fraser only kind of months afterwards that that first boat arrived that talked about and Australia had to face for the first time the possibility that all of its old fears of colored people in little boats would come true and and at that point at that point the Australian politicians made an impossible pledge to the Australian people which they are still trying to fulfill at that point they said we will stop all the boats now that 's not a claim a promise that 's not honest ever made in Italy or Greece or Spain or England or America there is no country that I know of no democracy I know on earth that makes that promise to its people that we will stop all the refugee boats they don 't they understand that that 's what wives Mike that 's what the world 's like but the expectation that we can stop em all is up is to my mind the surviving expression of the fears that growth White Australia but made is a federation we wouldn 't be a that made us a country do you think New South Wales and Victoria and Queensland Western Australia would have settled their differences sufficiently to become a single nation but for the fact that they wanted an absolutely coherent immigration policy that 's what Federation was very largely about because previously New South Wales couldn 't keep out people who landed in Adelaide and came over land that was the problem that was the problem you can have you could have really tough laws in New South Wales but unless everyone had laws just as tough you couldn 't close your borders and that 's very largely federal about so an absolutely wonderful outcome came out of dark fears and that can happen sometimes um but the sort of child of that grandchild great grandchild there is the continuing fears and the way in which they are addressed politically over the boats that 's what it 's what happens if they were full of Scottish crafters they would not be held on Christmas Island if they were full of Scottish crafters the people who having mental breakdowns would get medical treatment be in mandatory detention it 's race yes I 'm just proposed to you two different scenario two little just described yeah because the yellow yellow peril fear was always there it 's true but the drivers for Federation were also sourced from other vehicles of course like Jonathan was the concern by the British government for the rise of Japan and the need to bring together its qualities and can formulate Australia so that be the ball back to the rise of Japan and pay for a bit of that defense that 's my other and the other one was the depression of the 1890s which was hugely punishing cause great suffering in Australia and then galvanize the creation of the Labour Party and also galvanized the creation of protect the jobs in on from there came things like exporting were deeply deporting sorry the kanakas and things like that so it is true that good racism has always been with us and probably will be with us to the image man come but there are other drivers that feed into this and then on that point I I with people but i think that the risk in it which is more risk for you than for us there 's no risk to draw to narrow the historical parallel because a lot of these panics are based upon some very serious unresolved issues as you better you say for example it suggests to you that the Henry soccer and I read you ready man some pemmican DSS sorry a regular book on that I thought it was wonderful but that but that reflects in large part the fact that Australian society maybe throughout the world has not addressed fully issues involving pedophilia I mean at the moment dessert there 's an uproar in Victoria over the swimming of the value of government in creating a commission instead of a Royal Commission do you look into the most they are establishing a commission unlike the new south wales Yavin it it 's true but I just think that they 're showing a lot more bravery down here than is remotely possible in severe well you know threat construction there are papers in this library on thread construction and it 's back to the Roman times and find politicians with using thread construction all I don 't think we different there yeah I don 't think we differ there others are and I mean that 's I think most of those kinds of issues are covered here and it 's a very ancient thing and by the way after I published is this essay on this new essay on on on the boats in the way in which public opinion has been instructed on the boats and there 's something in there about you know this goes back to the gold rushes and the Chinese the gold rushes and I was contacted by this academic who opened my eyes to the most fantastic thing in the 1830s there was a wall boom as you all know in Australia casting all burn identificate bastard 1840 but it was a group there was a great home birth of educating 30 and at this stage the supply of convicts was growing up and convicts were useless as Shepherds anyway and so the question was where it could Australia get from Labour it needed for big land birds in Australia was Bengal and that we would have here an indentured labor system of a kind that eventually evolved to service the Fiji sugar industry in the partner natal sugar industry in South Africa and people started to bring down indentured labor from Calcutta to Australia to be to be to the shepherds and they were indentured which meant that if you ran away from your employer the cops went and got you and they threw you in jail now the colony divided on what was called the question well we have coolies in Australia or not at the debates about whether we would or not you 'll be glad to know that Sydney Morning Herald was for coolies come but William Charles Wentworth and the Australian newspaper were antique early and this was a this was I 've now read some of the debates about the question and rich week you here today about other races and the rhetoric you heard at that you can read about a federation the rhetoric you heard in those the great court cases of the 1880s and the rhetoric a piece that the rhetoric of the cooling question and of course it goes back in you know it goes back infinitely into the history of the human race but I love discovering enough cooling question and it 's so I 'd like to do some more study sometime cooling question and immensely really short the Sydney Morning Herald said the Essex you bring in slave labor some of the employees we know that today yes the role of behavior and your colleagues in publishing these statements that aren 't true I 'll be honest after for amplifying this penny how 's that run with a TV talk back radio is that in a significant factor it 's a very significant factor even I think in the last decade since i work for a time at media watch i think there is a new claim out there in the media in some sections of the media that you have a right you actually have a right to be wrong you got a right to be wrong because its freedom you know you 'll be free to be wrong and it to be abusive on the basis of a complete error or indifference to fact i found this is a very very important freedom and it was most recently scandalously taken away from my friend andrew bolt who wanting to pursue what is in fact a very interesting and difficult issue how do we determine and indeed how to Aborigines determine who is Aboriginal who is not how do we how do we settle the issue of Aboriginality now there 's a lot there are many interesting issues turn on this Andrews problem was that he kicked the out of at least nine people for cynically late in life adopting an indigenous identity when in fact all nine of them had been raised from childhood as Aboriginal now that 's not me saying he got it wrong and it 's not the judge saying he got it wrong it was his own lawyers the lawyers for the herald-sun admitted as an admitted of fact of the court proceedings that involve bowled before those court proceedings even began that he was entirely wrong to accuse those nine people of adopting in late-life he was entirely wrong and on the basis of that error about those nine people was appallingly abusive of them in two columns in the herald-sun_,_2589.8 now I don 't like that the terms for the Racial Discrimination Act I don 't like the way in which it bears on public discussion I think there are much better ways of drafting and limiting the impact of that act but there has never been a tradition in this country of honoring the freedom to publish abusive and that 's what 's going on with the bottle issue at the moment and he 's continuing to promote that is continuing to say that his liberty have been absolutely Crowley limited by this and I think that this is not just bold this is an American thing it comes out of the United States of America it comes out of the ruthlessly abusive and highly financed Republican meat machine in the United States of America which has to my mind only one essential purpose which is to keep tax low at whatever price um p blacks to keep tax love rich whatever price the streets doesn 't matter any of those things you fight wars you don 't pay for them all those kinds of things that 's the Republican thing and it is supported by outfits like like Fox News which blatantly lies invents something like thirty one percent of americans believe that that the president obama was born in kenya that is secretly a Muslim now that is another night after night after night on american television there are news commentators saying that and the fact that he 's produced his long-form birth certificate from hawaii it just hasn 't stopped anybody i think there is an I so I know that I 'm in danger of sounding like a you know a wild old fuddy-duddy and perhaps even panicking a little about this but are you but there is loose in the public sphere at the moment a quite extraordinary claim that you have a right to be completely and utterly wrong as an expression of some sort of freedom and I bet I mean people can be as wrong as they like but but but there is also another that is growing up in this country which is based on complete rubbish now I had sort of saying that because I 'm also as a journalist very very concerned about the limits on useful public discussion brought by the defamation laws and they those can that but still you know that still continues I wish we could publish some of the things we know they 're all it would be terrific or we can to depression so very interesting tricky area but there is there is at the moment this completely bizarre notion that you 've got an absolute right to speak rubbish and indeed that you shouldn 't even be couldn 't even be pointed out that you 're speaking rubbish the fact that there are colonists in the Australian that that every now and again right one of my favorite kinds of column which is that it the to criticize them to point out their errors is actually anti free speech because it 's trying to silence them so this the arguments are all of this thing and all this kind of thing is shifting in the and I should be following them with great interest over the next few years subject I want to do a lot more about one more okay little bit I promise to be quicker in my room I make it big question but so far you 've been talking about things that have been panics and I think you know what you 've been saying is that they shouldn 't have been panics do you think that there 's maybe things that should be panicked which haven 't really been now I think your things like I may be the sort of blowing warming is that something that should be a panic button for you we should never panic about anything the problem about panic is that we do the wrong things we reach the wrong decisions that 's the problem with panic I think we should be deeply concerned about global warming warming and we should be reaching some calm rational decisions about it but we should never panic about none the way that our prime minister has been treated those make sort of demonstrations and all those banners and part of that it 's again it 's part of that the bleed into Australia of American habits of political life and I don 't think in our lifetimes we 've ever heard such abuse even the abuse of Whitlam which was pretty colorful I 'm am not entirely without foundation ah I admire hugely but the abuse of gila hard with that special edge that it has of abusing a woman that special pleasure you feel that the speakers are getting because it is the licensed public abusable one um that 's new but it 's American it 's it 's I feel my parents my parents deep suspicion of the United States of America everything from from you know television to desert boots is what sort of available coming up in the end but that isn 't who they are they by other habits of American politics bleeding over into Australia yes look there are some extremely beautiful chapters in here and on the subject of the laws the laws the laws that were enacted are following following the Terrorism thing my argument about Australia is that we we do not care much for abstract argument an abstract argument has very little traction in heretics and so when most of the lawyers in the nation say warning warning warning these laws that we 're passing about to deal with terrorism go much much too far no traction but once something goes wrong once they demonstrated to it 's gone tremendously wrong as they did in the case of mum muhammad hanif the doctor from the Gold Coast Australians know exactly that that is wrong difficulty with these kinds of laws is getting them off the books there are still some terrible wars in the Commonwealth Crimes Act that go back to the time of the Wobblies in the 1920s it bloody hard to get off the books once they 're there but they will be really used that remain as a threat but but I call them the scar tissue of panics past very hard to do no no we 'll go to one more quick question I 'm getting a commotion about the right to be wrong how much do you think that is associated with with choice bringing the ultimate res on dere chop everything always trumping equity for instance no no I don 't think it 's about that at all i think it 's about it 's about abusive speech it is about making up things about people and setting out to destroy them on the basis of on the basis of fictions that 's very much a part of the political life of the united states it 's become a bit of a part of the political life of this country don 't care for it very much i think we need to keep a clear eye on talkback radio some political leaders are into it in a big way we just need to keep an eye I think Australians are actually not bad judges on I don 't think Australians like this abuse automatical leaders at all and surveys indicate that we are really really unhappy with the current state of national politics of the bickering and the nastiness and the pettiness of upsets Australians but they 'll nevertheless be shortly given an opportunity to make a choice on the basis and are Australia is not enjoying politics at the moment one bit we are not enjoying it we tell us that ok 11 I 'm just when we started whether you think Australians have a different way of doing with the panic panic maybes for example with the tamperer fair and the children overboard it was found out that it was very much something that was what was made and was constructed but you 're lying me I 'll know it was a mistake yeah children are the what began as a mistake and then a decision was made not to correct it and that decision then involved a series of Lies disgraceful business yeah but it was it was blown to the proportion that it was but yet nothing happened there was no oh no no no no no no no children overboard didn 't help the Labour Party over 2,000 won election so going to lose anyway um I did not help that party um but children overboard was a stain on John Howard 's reputation that he carried to the rest of his time as prime minister and panic is that it wears out the reputation of panic mongers it 's all very well for me to argue as I do that we forget about panics but but the people that drive panics do not rise in our estimation at the time we tend to find them a bloody and we tend at a certain point to discard them for what they 've done they don 't panic 's addicts are very very good in the short term for a politician and really bad and long term for a politician so don 't think that there without sanction they are but those sanctions can take time yep yep stop there you _"

good news story these are good stories and I guess we don 't it 's not until we see what got you happiness in the life of someone and a situation and there and that there is a way out and they are able to work the way out we can see it as a positive thing so firstly having International Women 's Day 2012 its international women 's day has been celebrated for the last five hundred and five years the last year 's is this big ears celebrate but I think in Australia I just want to really stop and recognize how far we 've come and even just in my adult life I can 't believe how far women have come in Australia it 's amazing you 'd be aware that we have a female governor general we have female Prime Minister we have email miss out wales government we have many female ministers when we have a local female heir so we can be very proud of the influence that we have in our society Andrew rich with him and the voice dirty hair and the choices we have I mean I think now 2000 ago I look at my daughter imagens age you know she 's 19 almost 20 and I just think about the choices in her life choices he hasn 't been averse ative that work there and I just think we really have a kind we 've come such a long way so i think really today for us here it 's it 's about thanksgiving it 's about actually saying hey you know what if we 've got we have to be thankful for what we 've got in fact you know i don 't think we have a sit back picture well we 're very much an elite and not because we live north side or a Muslim or whatever if we have a fridge or washing machine or a bit where an elite because really there 's a lot of you know the majority of people today we just you know is celebrating being women in 2012 in this amazing country and we 're also looking outside last weekend good journalism a series of talks on feminism and when she came home my scepter who knows what really stood out it 's really interested to know what what what that was about she said well I her down we wolf and I really enjoy hearing what she had to say was what was that what she said one of the things that stood out is that we 've done incredible things in Western feminism and really because he 's such a focus on touch such challenge but we really haven 't finished the job the job 's not done and that really resonated with me because I know there 's so many of assistance just not sharing in the freedom we have so I thought I just do a little snapshot of where most of the bottom women in the world are today if we say this approximately two billion people in the world living on less me to old age seventy percent of those have two gossiping with the women we 're still doing two-thirds of the work producing fifty percent of the food we attend Persephone income one percent of the property is iron Harriman so on that score card we 're not looking so good son I heard the expression a mini of met her is that women hold up half the sky and there 's a Booker 's yes seller will have skype a lot of a lot of people have been reading recently and actually I clearly saw that expression came from China now after a very brutal revolution and I didn 't know that and one of the outcomes of that the audition first that women were not spared but I actually think the Chairman Mao got it completely wrong because I think when you look at the figures that I 've just told you we hold up three-quarters of the sky as given we live in a world where there are countries for girls just aren 't want any more so in anywhere last year 325 nothin female you live in a world where the rate of women and that they 're employing and there 's a group of us here at big rusev working northern Uganda with the war brides and it is very a very real weapon warm and the results are just devastating so it 's not so different to when I was growing you know this wars were going on this abuse is going on it was all going on the difference is that you can get security now we it 's instant you know this is joseph kony email that 's going around and in the space of two days is it 4.7 million people have muted they said we 're going to send this round and we want half a million people to see it so we can go to the US government and lobby them catch this guy Joseph people in Uganda and for quite 7 million people of similar to see in color face and that 's the but when I was growing up in the 70s it was under that there was in the Gulf with junior and that was a time that I mean there are quite a few and human university but at that time there was big push to build tires with none mavens Indonesia and so here I was growing up and benadryl father Walker and my parents decided because i was learning in the nation that we should all have off to indonesia as 12 and not prevent and and it was a little bit shocked for a twelve-year-old coming from country new south wales and to see to meet these kids you 're younger than me and were on the beach of selling things or they sent an IM home and seem not to be in school and then you shouldn 't have shoes where are their parents and this was a bit of an eye-opener to me and I guess I forgot guilty about what I had actually appreciated I had a lot more of that trip so here Josh forward to 96 when we went that as a family again he had the facial cleaner for 79 at that point and by this time we had some connection of opportunity and we had an understanding that it wasn 't poverty wasn 't in North those people we went with opportunity into communities in well this wasn 't dentists are actually which you know you see those parts of bowling you go down as a tourist i can tell you but we went in to denpasar movement into the hands of the clients and we 've got to see them just sitting on the concrete chopping that chicken to make their surveys that they were taking out this family received a small loan and they 've made a car there was selling 1200 of this site is rather strict every day they 'll actually have second like the third line they will bringing family members in and they had quite an enterprise going and so my passion at that time was wow this isn 't about charity it 's not as grand handouts it 's about enterprise it 's about bringing out the best in people and just giving them something to work with and so that was a real turning point in my life and really other life hasn 't been the same since that point if you can have an epiphany solve the question of poverty but I can come alongside amazing people difference like it 's just helping them so we have a great fortune than sort of learning and being mentored largest political David soul who through the 70s was experimenting you know he was a businessman an entrepreneur himself and he moved to ballet and started working with local people and you know helping them think our ideas for businesses financing light and so we were able to actually start to think to look at poverty differently solutions Superman he was very strong on using the marketplace and using what people had and finding local solutions and and everything I saw that David I think engine adventure really saw someone who was willing to make huge risks on behalf of other people we hadn 't you know we hadn 't encountered someone mentioned those kind of risks necessarily for the poor and so he removed given this business who decided with his whole life is going to be about this work and so that was a great example to us I mean I can 't_''_591.06 say that we amazing role model to ask you twice now i 've had this incredible privilege of being in india for international men 's day and i can tell you it 's just my character and smiling she was there that is that you can relate to this as well because it was just it 's just an enduring image you can imagine 8,000 leave India and German pouring into a stadium in their beautiful saris of oranges and blues and in little groups of color because that very little community group that they come together on a bus something that was so excited chattering and they were just so happy to be there and we were so happy with them as an extraordinary then and each of those women have received a small body you know and each of them you know Madame only been a fifty dollar loan but they 've actually had their own little business in their community so they were just like this beautiful flock helper birds universal anyway think about the stationmaster color and but it wasn 't really totally deserted their wives the next time was such a big deal why this day is so important to one that they could come to learn other skills and make other women and when we talked to them a lot of them were young there might have been 14 year old girls who being married for two years and like for them was just working in the home or working in the business or I was just looking at people 's often many years you know the mother-in-law way of herself interviews so possible someone comes along very one that gets abused and so that 's why for one day they felt that they can come them on and it was and it was exciting for us because we could see that they were overcoming those statistics that 's what they were doing overcoming it 's a very exciting time so that 's international women 's day in my memory from earlier so this the cycle opportunity we 're working around the share of power woman coronation which is I guess another way of saying inspiring girls as well it 's very much what we 've done together through an awful lot there are some misconceptions about people in poverty just like to touch on briefly minus you know I 've heard all these across the years you know that somehow we deserve but the reality is that most commonly caused by corruption and greed and natural disasters because people in poverty don 't have the best spots if there 's going to be a landslide sure that it 's the poorest poor who are under that in that position and they 're always the workshop another is that that that are they 're lazy and I could that funk you know people in our country tell me that well it 's not you know it 's not what I 've seen I I 've seen women getting up at three and one you 're going to markets came back sitting for 12 hours of their children we have their feet and when you coffee store closes and they 're sitting in the rain no it 's the laziness it 's not the cause of poverty and the other the other thing sometimes heard is of interference are there 's a perception and sometimes but certainly our failures of offenders and lower expectation I think that women in dire situations have an affable patient but they love their children as much as we do it 's just that they don 't have choice and own capture us so what does opportunity see people we see amazing entrepreneurs we 've seen very clever people see people who are generous and community mind with justice in mosman you know I see well this incredible community you 're going to hear and they build that sir than they love that and there is also I 've even got a community of people in the Philippines in Manila who built all the houses in a great lunch because that 's where they had to be the only land they could get some of these wonderful and the fingers are small and the frame with businesses in these situations what 's happened is they 've just been a lot that people locked out financial services that we just take for granted and we use every day and there 's no fallback and GOC and for some people it 's been very tough and you know sometimes we could fall back on grandparents for school fees or to help out we 'll just help us along but most of these people there 's no fallback the parents are probably more than they are so having access to loans and saving insurance as a big one feathers they lose of have a member of this life insurance it was there there 's their props the power having insurance it 's just totally life-changing for them we we can access all of those things that can change their lives it 's incredible and technology that it 's very exciting for people in parking technology to be able to get on robot prices of markets of middleman can 't_``_939.22 rip you off or the secure sale via mobile phone to transfer money around go to an ATM we will now little payback or something like that is just extraordinary and to be able to use pink print technology to secure finance as well so I 'd say about it one cotton each other in 99 you going to just really stand out Anita I remember we were filming in quezon city and our there two weeks in this community phone and it 's done Anita was around she was radiant smile mornin I just have never faced I well even though it 's not good at years ago and so we had time to talk about these two weeks and we talked about business and her life and her kid said she had a sewing business and she punishes I 'm very well she worked very hard and that 's what I 'm asking about kids and kids she said well I up but one who 's the professor of American University I 've got once the professor in a filipino university and the other two were gods of professionals and she had done that business she didn 't have to put those poor kids treacherous things right through and so I support you think you you know and you 're going on from family how things were going they 're very comfortable initiative I are no no finished here and she was setting up all I think six young girls there that she was actually sitting up in their own business as well and just as such a great example of the generosity of people themselves for they just had this extraordinary generosity and also the confidence yes she could just go she could take risks and other people now it 's just one other looking at a story that I heard that I really love is about a loan officer talking to this person was got she was loan officers stand there with a woman going you know aberration cream and sugar standing us added their smile of his face newsperson several why were you why you standing smiling ensure pretty name here and sit like an odd reaction and he said oh look when I 'm with her if she were going to look my you know she was like that she would only look at her feet and I watched her demeanor change over the time that we 've been working together and now fact that she can stand and point a finger at me look me in the eye and tell i think is working on a small scale but that as a woman I because women were just such change agents who can actually change the fabric of our society we 've set up mine to step out and take a risk I 've been reading about one called Ellen Johnson Sirleaf from Liberia she 's the first elected president like the area she 's a very impressive woman she 's just want to know well press peace prize with two other women for leading a non-violent struggle for women 's rights so she is the sort of woman that they are we offers you know learning to we haven 't got the job done yet but there are women out there doing the big nation-building structural stuff and there are women like a leader during the community based in there with her own people so I 'm not one of those fearless people have backgrounds in journalism and I choice financial journalism so I didn 't have to chase ambulances essentially so did you think I started rotating so I 'm not one of those fearless people raises off in my 17 years junio sometimes been asked to do things that oh this doesn 't feel really comfortable but I knew I had to do it so just just straight up to the icons they asked me to go to battle just with all the coroner 's and the coffins and things are going in on the plains and out there and also after our change after the tsunami there 's a girl and my mother was brilliantly colored at all but I guess that 's one of the things I 've come to realize that actually it 's not until you step out and you take those kind of risks that you really can achieve the potential and done for me that was actually finding that I could be a voice on behalf of those people didn 't have the was that there was a place for me as a as a journalist as a bridge and that was a purpose to go but in that place that 's when I just learned so much about my own capabilities and talents i didn 't know i had and done you know i think probably the bigger risk is not stepping out the bigger risk is not stepping into those places it doesn 't have to be doing enormous things like hasn 't like area but it can just be small things so i guess that 's the point of it when you look today Mary is the net you know just to get out there and take take those risk if an opportunity comes up we did something that may be all i wanted to do that but that just to do it you know because about we 've opportunity haven 't taken this one meter negative and taking that risk to become to set up a little business that she probably didn 't have confidence to set up then she wouldn 't have been able to go to children through school and then she wouldn 't have been able to cheat to help these other women and so that 's what happens when you take a risk with them so i 'm taking a risk this millions millions of people in poverty but with not a half the message i 'm allowed to leave with you today and i guess i 'd like to challenge you today very kindly and I reckon sponsor them today we can be of course it changes the group of women I think there 's a hundred of us here it 's a hundred dollars to make a loan to take a long enough poverty and if we all decided that ok I 'll put what I would have spent on breakfast towards opportunity then we could probably take families at least and so I just encourage you to do that if you feel that you 'd like to do that would be a great support and also just uh but also encourage you to get involved there 's if you 're out there they 've got lots of energy just thinking I really want to get back about a stage of life work it 's pretty much independent feeling a lot to give then please come and talk to us and talk to sorry this is tara marino our commission of interest and she 's juicing the opportunity international and you mom 's there if you like to to fill those anything like to watch I just go on to our website which is also on there but really just not to thank you for coming today and thank you for your support of options _"

growing magazines frankie marik also writes for television and co-created the av series laid which has just finished filming and produced in band production of its second series can you please welcome ray carty um your book is very personal and very honest as well as being extremely funny what made you decide to open yourself up so much for your first book um firstly someone 's just whispering something i 'm not actually i 'm not gonna like point you out but you know when you sit down and someone 's going oh she 's a lot more than you think on television and i couldn 't be i was trying to listen to the words like she 's very warm but i don 't know what it was and i don 't know who was saying it but tell me afterwards i 'm not going to be upset if you 're like she television um why did i decide to be so honest in the book um i don 't know i don 't know how to write any other way i don 't think and i think that there 's an element of personal that goes through all my writing whether it be a political piece or an opinion piece and i know that can be really irritating for lot of people and i guess i gravitate towards writers who do the same thing and i know i write nothing like helen garner but someone you know you read joe cinque 's consolation or the first stone and her character permeates the book she 's she is a part of the book and people that don 't like helen garner don 't like reading about her in the books but i always like a writer then you get a sense of the writer throw that although i haven 't just said that i just read edmond dewill 's the hair without variety for the book show ah yes well i don 't know if that 's going to divide you as much that 's not giving anything away but he we shot it last friday and um and i didn 't like edmond dewile 's voice in that sorry if any of you like that so sometimes you do have to like the protagonist to go to go through that anyway i yeah i think the personal thing is something to me when you get a sense of a writer through what they 're writing about so you get a sense of the story as well as a portrait of them i you know i find that a really lovely way to write and to read you talk about a lot of your your friends and boyfriends and explore friends and things did you give anyone pre-warning or did you kind of publish it and just kind of gave them a you better watch how this book 's coming out what are you taking me for you better watch out yeah don 't call me back you know i 'm not that sinister a little bit um no no well the thing about this book is that i kind of came up of humorous essays memoir basically i just obsessed with david sedaris so i think when you grow up reading something like that you know i had this aspiration to sort of remewingly follow his career um and i have always thought what 's the thread that 's going to make this book a bit different to every other person going here 's a funny thing that i think about me you know and i and i came up with the idea of giving people in the essays a right of reply because because i read someone like david sidaris and feel like i know him and i interviewed him and pretty much marched into the interview thinking were going to be best health because i had read so much of his work and i knew him so well and um and he you know rebuffed me called for security no he didn 't at all but um but i always read his essays and go what is your partner who you think about surely that they must balk at you occasionally doing that of your father or and i know siddhara 's family who go they 'll see him getting his pen and paper out so you can you can 't_''_242.959 use that so i wanted to yeah my mother has used that a couple of times as well um but this is off the record you don 't pay attention it 's your parents they have to love you anyway that 's what i found out that 's really good um but yeah i guess i wanted to give some of the people in the stories a voice and and that seemed like a really good idea until i started writing things that i didn 't necessarily want everyone to see and that 's when you sort of lose control a bit of um of telling the story your way which is the strength you have as a writer you just go i get to tell them my way because i have the pen and then they you give them a voice and they annoyingly tell it a different way um so for that i gave people the stories it was born from an ex-boyfriend that i 'd written i 'd written about him and felt a bit um not portrayed as the wrong word but exposed i suppose and he 's a writer too and i think in the end he acknowledged that i had the right to write the same stories our shared stories my way but he was just annoying because he wrote about them on his blog which 80 people read and my story was in the age um but he i wrote a story with him in it and i wrote him an email saying listen i 'm running this book there 's a story about you in it i know you 're upset about the age piece you can read this and whatever you say about it i 'll print in the book i won 't change a word um so there wasn 't any kind of i 'll just you know to hell with you guys i 'll publish what i want there was one person who i sent the story to to do write a reply who said can you take me out of the story and i did and it into it i 'm like couldn 't we just i couldn 't change your name or you know but i didn 't change i didn 't want to actually change his name because there are no fake names in the book and i think i 'd feel like a real phony if every other story was true and then this one bit had a bit of fictional and then john you know i just feel a bit strange about that so i was i talked to jane and alan and unwin about it and said you know he wants to be taken out and she said well you 're not bob ellis you don 't you don 't publish and be damned and i think that is the choice that you make you can either tell the story how you want it to be told and know that you might never see that person again or leave it you know leave it the way that they want it what was the hardest piece of the book to write but the one about having my heart broken and that 's what yourself it 's been really interesting to me the reaction of people after this book everyone is brave i 'm so proud very brave of you to tell those stories and you can see them looking but i don 't want to be in your life but you 're very brave aren 't you praying you 'll be like that 's what i want to be brave um and so there are stories that seem salacious in nature i i think or other people would think i would never tell that story about myself and they to me don 't seem salacious at all they seem like funny human awkward odd stories that i wanted to tell because they were funny human awkward and odd um but because i guess when you write comedically as well you don 't often write about yourself as a vulnerable person or if you do it 's in a very and then i tripped over something or i 'm very goofy or i 'm very gauche and i said the wrong thing at the wrong time but i think when you 're writing about and uh it 's a lot harder to make jokes about it at that point so i actually found that and because it was quite fresh as well when i was writing it i found that the hardest because it felt like the more emotionally honest out of everything and was there an element of the book that was the easiest part was there a bit that you felt like you could have kept writing more on because you just kind of got you know was it did every story kind of have its place that fit within the book without rather than going on longer than it could in the format yeah i mean the format was new to me anyway because i was used to writing in i kind of broke myself a bit running columns for so long you know 850 words and then you get to this story which is really long and so it seems like it seems endless and that 's good in a way because it makes you it does force you to delve emotionally i showed one of the stories in the and he edited judith lucy 's book who and i had lunch with judy judith not long after she put her book out she talked about meeting them for the first time and she 'd given him the manuscript of um the tutor the lucy family alphabet that 's what it was called yet and um she said she showed it to him and he said stop telling jokes every second line you don 't have i know you 're a stand-up comedian i know that 's what you do but just trust at the emotional heart of the stories i guess when you 're used to being a bit defensive or keeping people at arm 's length through humor you do tend to put and he when i gave him the first draft of my story he said exactly the same thing to me and that came from me for writing a television column for the age for a very long time where you thought i 've got this much time everyone 's drinking their coffee i 've got to make them go haha and then they can forget letting the pros stretch on for a little while without putting something funny in there but um having ben say that and having then judith said the same thing was was very helpful in that regard so yeah i don 't know if any piece i wanted to write but any longer none of them suggested an extended period of time but i guess that 's because i 'm still learning how to be a long-form writer i suppose were you nervous the first time your parents read the book yes and i did this terrible thing i really drip sorry you 're looking at my back how terribly rude i 'll turn around to that um i said they taught me manners they don 't like the book but they didn 't remember um no they did they 're fine with the book um but i drip fed it to them i did this really i just went hey look at this funny story on scrapbooking and i sort of emailed them that so i emailed it to them in increments so that i knew the good funny bits house one day when i wasn 't there and my mum called me up and said oh there 's a copy of the book here should we just we 'll just take it should we just take it and i went yes yes you should just take it you should say and they did say i mean i kept kind of hinting that there would be things in it they might not want to read and they said they wanted to read it before it came out so they knew what you know the press were writing about or what people would talk to them about people coming up with going things um so i think that they were very good and i mean my father 's spent his whole i mean he spent the first 20 years of his life he says being introduced as frank hardy 's son and then the last 20 years being introduced as marie cut his father and so he 's sandwiched between these two people who have this compulsion to write about themselves and the family so in frank 's so he 's was about the court case after power without glory and my dad 's in that book is like little little allen came to the court with his little shorts and you know the poor guy he 's really suffered um so it 's not like they 're not used to it but then they 're really i i did think it would be hard for them i think the sexual aspects of it i 'm an only child you know i i never felt comfortable with them reading that but they wanted to read it and they 've been absolutely about if you see them say something nice to them because they 're really they 're really they troopers that 's the word for it isn 't oh god i 'm brave they 're troopers well you talked about your grandfather frank what did he inspire you to become a writer or was it really intimidating having someone who has you know held in such high regard for for his novel to power that glory and everything around that is that is that pressure or was that inspiring um i to be inspiring certainly while he was alive i didn 't you know oh it 's 17 when he dies i was sort of just emerging from a cocoon of self-absorbed teenagehood um blinking into the sunlight of realising other people were in the world and i think he had a stroke a couple of years before he died so that gives you a sense that you know your grandparents are not immortal and i think i would empower that glory before he died which i was very glad to have done um but i i don 't know i feel that pressure comes from other people more than me i felt like my writing is so different i 've been a humorist i 've been you know that any political writing that i do is comedic um so i 've always thought well he 's a great novelist but our writing is so different in terms of being inspired uh not necessarily i mean i didn 't even realize i mean i wrote short stories i was a prolific short story writer as a child but i didn 't i was about 19. so and by that stage probably my parents and books were the biggest influences tell us about the two bob alices which ones you want to hear about first doggle man man okay yeah um bob ellis man okay um i know who 's read the story in it oh you 're here i don 't know what 's that say treat i wouldn 't say that actually um so bob ellis i 've reviewed bob ella 's his writing for many many years and i think it 's no small coincidence that you talk about him after you talk about frank because i think as i became more politically aware and astute i certainly gravitated towards bob because frank was dead and in bob there were so many shared characteristics so these prickly brilliant cantankerous vaguely misogynistic at times womanizing beautiful minds you know um shambolic men and i think i really i was subconsciously seeking out frank 's approval and bob this is a very good thing i should lie down um but i love bob 's writing did set me a flame as aware he gets it wrong maybe many times i am aware of that we all win that drum piece we all banish that around memory um he does get it wrong a lot and he occasionally says very contentious and idiotic things about ladies um but when he gets it right oh god that pen is just beautiful he just sometimes his turn of phrase has such vitriol and poison and passion behind it you can just feel the blood and the sweat on the page which i just you know i just adored that and i oh true i was drawn towards that and i think and then i have my i found a staffy and her name she 's a she her name 's bob ellis and uh she turned she turned 10 about a month ago so she it 's been a while this hero where she has been for a while and i 'm quite they 're quite separate entities to me so i 'm i feel i don 't feel self-conscious at the party bobby ellis no i 'll be alice bob ellis and you they just said she 's bob ellis the dog he 's bob ella 's the man and i uh i guess the story in my book is about um should you ever meet your heroes because i was always aware that bob is a very human hero i guess that 's very kind way of putting it um and i always i just i never want to i don 't know i 'm allowed to ruin a bit of it for you but what what really was the peak of mine and bob 's relationship is he did i do this event called women of letters which is we 've done a couple up here and we do it mostly in melbourne it 's like this beautiful literary salon and we get people to write letters and we did a mail event last year and we got 10 minutes of matt preston and tim rogers and paul kelly and it 's amazing eddie perfect did it and we got them to write i led it to the woman who changed my life and i talked to my co-curator michaela into formulas i 'm like that they both do it let 's talk to so we go he wouldn 't he we have to bring him down from sydney on the train because he doesn 't fly he 's not here is he oh god i was like halfway through if anyone is like in the corner just tell me give me a signal um uh yeah we got him on the train because he doesn 't fly because he needs oxygen advance when he flies which just seems so fitting and uh and and he came down for this event in thornbury in melbourne and he did this letter to his wife on her fictional death bed and it was just beautiful it was so beautiful it was passionate and sad and human and strange and he talked about what their children and the love affairs that they 've had and the 12 miscarriages that they 'd had and it was just this and his speaking voice is just so wonderful that david mark calls it uh the king james cadence the cadence of the king james bible and it ovation that we 've ever had at one of our events everyone was crying it was just amazing and afterwards i went up to him and i was quite overcome i said bob that was that was so beautiful thank you so much and he swept me up into this big sweaty toxic embrace and he whispered into my ear if that 's not worth a nothing oh there we go and i kind of you know it was going to happen eventually he was going to say something he couldn 't spend more and more time with him so i do still i do still love bob and i do still love his brain i think for that hero worship of his writing i do need to keep a kind of a safe distance but he 's read i was really panicking about what he would feel about the story he 's okay about it he said my children will be appalled i thought i bet that 's not the first time um tell us more about women of letters how how did it start why did it start book coming out for christmas as well with a collection of the letters in there as well yeah um yeah i 'm really i 'm very proud of women of letters and that that 's the logo on my arm that 's tattooed in my arm another thing for my mother to be thrilled about so it 's uh it 's a smoking smoking biro our friend tara designed that and um it 's it started in march last year um i knew i wanted to do a literary event and i talked to my friend michaela who 's a writer it 's a fundraiser so it raises uh all the money goes to this animal rescue shelter outside victoria outside in country victoria and it 's just it 's been i 've i can 't remember feeling so intensely proud and moved by something and that you know and i do the front of house michaela does the emceeing and so we usually get five five letter readers so the next one we 're doing one um in sunday on sunday in melbourne and our readers are celia piccola who 's a playwright who just had a plan at the belvoir monica ducks who 's a feminist writer maxine mchugh and i to buttrose that was the score we got either um and they 're doing we give them a letter topic so they 're doing a letter to the life i could have lived so we give them a topic a letter topic a month in advance and they write it and they read it aloud in the day and i still get really stunned by how open people have been on the stage missy higgins did a letter to her depression that that she 'd struggled with through school and and um we had do you know do you wanna know ben law have you read the family law that 's a very good book you should read it um his uh his sister michelle we did an event in brisbane and we got people to write a love letter we thought oh no sorry it was a letter to my most treasured possession and she is very funny she 's a writer herself and she did week because she said all her hair had fallen out when she was 15. and she was really really funny letter and she was talking about how she was a teenager she was asian she had acne she was bored and she was living on the sunshine coast so she said you know teenager was pretty awesome for me and so she bought the wig along that she called chief wiggum and you know showed it around and you know the room was just roaring and then she said that at night you know my family would come in and they 'd kiss my bald head and they didn 't treat me any differently i 'm gonna get emotional i 'll talk about this at which point she just completely broke down there wasn 't even you know when people are talking and their voice gets a bit wobbly and they 're about to cry there was she just stopped from being funny dry woman to just sobbing and everyone froze because no one you know there was no bridge there wasn 't a respectful silence when you know someone after a moment ben came out and stood out the audience on one side and her mother came out and stood on the other side and she finished a letter and i just i can 't even think about it without just getting really it was this moment of complete beautiful honesty and people talk to us a lot about podcasting them and you know because we get some helen garner 's done one and we get some amazing people and people want to put them on the radio or video them but we kind of like that they exist in the moment when you 're there or on the page so they 're either in written form or you 're there for these people to to tell it the way they want or you see it in the written words so the book 's the collection of the first year and yeah i 'm i 'm very proud of it as i mentioned in the introduction you also write for frankie magazine which seems to be one of the only magazines in australia that 's that 's growing and sets it apart from everything else can you put your finger on it was it just one of those i don 't know i started writing for frankie magazine i don 't know this is frankie 's demographic not entirely um i wrote frankie magazine because i was a big fan of them and they wrote a piece about blogs that they like to read and they wrote about my blog so i wrote to them saying well i love you can i write for you and that was about seven years ago and i 've written for them ever since i haven 't done i don 't think i 'm the demographic anymore i think it 's an 18 to 25 girls 18 to 25 girls i think is the pitch but they really set themselves yeah i think for what they had the only growth out of every any magazine and so everyone sort of leapt on them it 's just it 's a it 's a beautiful magazine for i guess crafty alternative younger girls but it 's got so i mean ben law writes for them it 's got some good writers and we all sort of met at the same time and anna cream put out that great into the woods book um so yeah that 's fine writing but it 's it 's very bite-sized so a couple of the stories in in my book started out in frankie in 650 words and i certainly knew that i wanted to make more of them so it 's just this very supportive nurturing little magazine it 's a little engine that could it 's really amazing and you also kind of write politically for um abc 's the drum um how did it feel in the abc took down your article on christopher pine um and apologized do you think it was an overreaction or um i don 't know i felt very confused by that whole thing because and jonathan green who 's the really nice man who edits that kept apologizing apologizing to me saying i should have seen that that was going to cause trouble i shouldn 't have put it up there and i 've just felt bewildered by the whole just felt like something to me that i would always write and i think particularly in that first year of the drum there was a bit of i mean that said they 've got so many amazing contributors now and they 're really good at sourcing things from blogs and putting them up there that first year it was that big we have to get the balance so we have to someone says this we 've got to and i think i was hired to write the way that i do which is you know vaguely humorous or irreverent and then jonathan felt like he 'd done me a disservice by not sort of going no in front of the article and stopping it being published so um were you asking me if i regret is that what you were saying no no gosh no and you know what it 's very hard to regret writing something like that when within 10 months the good weekend has him on the cover saying is this the most hated man in australia oh just because they 're all sophisticated in the age so yeah i guess i felt uh i mean i felt like i didn 't want to let jonathan down i didn 't want to tarnish the brand of the drum i didn 't want to get them in trouble i never want to get anyone in trouble and you always do trust i mean i don 't put any limits on my writing i just trust that my editor will help me or stop things happening so i probably wasn 't rewarded in that regard so i didn 't want to i didn 't want him to get in trouble for it or him to lose his job and he didn 't so that could you um you talk about in the book how you kind of started out as a child actor and um progress from that to to writing for television um the the television you write is very apart from late which i think is probably more what we 're used to from your writing but some of the other writing you do like um neighbors in the past and back to the rafters doesn 't kind of work the kind of the writing for those kind of really different audiences why did you say practice were you embarrassed to say it might be embarrassing it 's a very popular show for the since it started i don 't know i mean i 've written um television for you know 15 years free and when you freelance writer in australia you 're right for everyone i 've written for blue heelers and uh well i wrote one blue heel script i wrote a very very bad one i can 't write i can 't write police dramas or hospital dramas because my police drugs are all like oh my god i 'm slow now i don 't know everyone 's always rolling around and doing that and that no one does that and so and i wrote a really bad mcleod 's daughter 's episode and i pretty i didn 't get sacked off it but i kind of they go we 're going to bring it to you when you know you 've got you 're in trouble is when you have to get a written so much of it so my mclaren 's daughter 's script in the at the first commercial break someone rolled under a tractor and then he spent the whole rest of the episode going tell john the farm here i wrote the script and everyone sounds a bit silly it is silly like why is that my fault so i couldn 't fix that and then i got in trouble for it so i know some australian television i write very badly and cop shows i stay well away from but um yeah i i mean there are some shows i get very fond of i wrote for always greener and something in the air and they 're always going under the same people that make back to the rafters and it 's just you know i don 't want to say it 's bread and butter because i enjoy writing it and i feel really lucky that other work i do that 's not my own work is still writing i mean i feel intensely lucky in that regard so um yeah even though after this isn 't you know i think i feel lucky that i can write something that 's a bit different you know because clearly cop shows i 'm just gonna be the death of me having said that about cop shows i actually wanna say something else cause you know how you keep thinking there 'll be no more cop shows there are the suns do you know the new lisa mccune reef cops they 're doing reef cops it 's like on the great barrier reef and they 're cops there 's another show i 'm not going to be able to write don 't put that coral down oh you 're in it just a bridge from sea patrol sir did you want to read to us from your book oh sure i don 't read the book i find reading is very strange they 're very i 'm very new to that to this and um i was trying to find bits that weren 't really disgusting there 's enough there 's a few my mom got very upset because the first story is quite rude and um and that one first there 's so many other delightful stories so there you go you 're taking it from my mom there are delightful stories in this book and what was bad is that i went on the circle that wasn 't bad but i felt bad for them because you know when you 're doing a show like that you don 't get time to do you know you just have to quickly know what your next guest does and so that old just read the first chapter so i was brought on there like some sort of harlot and colin that nice colin lane was there he couldn 't look me in the eye he was like that 's a hell of a first chapter hardy and i was like the rest of it 's delightful colin it 's fine um so i 'll read you a bit about uh you did talk about me being a child actor um before so i 'll read a bit from a story about that uh it 's nobody 's fault specifically that i was a child actor my parents were against by saying educational nurturing things like it 's not that we don 't want you to be an actor it 's just that we prefer you to do something more productive and fulfilling with your life like ingesting peyote and running naked onto a busy highway they had both been actors themselves and knew the emotional tumult creative humiliation and crippling self-doubt that came hand-in-hand with consistently prostituting oneself out for auditions in front of unimpressed directors named jp or kotzo it was a difficult world a lonely one it was a world that destroyed upstanding human beings like winona ryder and john barrymore and gary busey they were naturally afraid for my long-term well-being before i was born my father 's stint as the australia post guy had involved adorning pamphlets at post offices nationwide that provided people who may not have known any better those awakening from a deep coma perhaps or hairdresser to the stars lillian frank is she up here do you know lillian frank with information and helpful hints on how to send parcels and aerograms the how to send airmail one was a particular jacket and flying goggles while standing inside a cardboard box scarf flying out at an angle implying great gusts i used to study these pamphlets with intense concentration digging them out of shoe boxes he 'd stuffed them in two years earlier for getting them along with his unfulfilled dreams of ever being the next henry sheps did i pronounce that please skip thank you thanks abc audiences my father is on a pamphlet i would marvel i am without question the luckiest kid alive the best of my father 's commercials was for bristol paints he played an over-eager junior salesman wearing a velour v-neck sweater over a white skivvy and flared trousers so tight it 's a miracle he was eventually able to work up enough semen to create a child sorry that wasn 't rude i 'm sorry i knew it was going to be in there somewhere his long-suffering manager was if memory serves a man with the all-purpose boss name mr wetherby or some such and whose sole job was to look ham fistedly fed up while my father comically knocked over precariously stacked pyramids a popular 70s wine label that involved him pacing a bottle shop wondering how to match the foods he was serving his fussy girlfriend with a vast and confusing array of alcohol on offer i grew up telling people my father 's an actor which ironically set off the same sort of pitying discs and frowns of disapproval he 'd experienced 30 years previous when informing passerby that my father 's a communist i didn 't know that theater folk were to be looked down upon and treated as tiresome jesters who had never grown up gypsy spirits with a lacks attitude to finance and sexual morality one teacher at school weighed me compulsively as i possessed with a secret knowledge that my parents were blowing precious grocery money on frivolous purchases like glittery costumes and trapezes you 've lost 0.3 of a kilo she would say accusingly picturing the delight on my father 's face as he selfishly took delivery of a shiny new pair of maracas while i wasted away in my bedroom the other children in my class looked on without comprehension i was weighed more than times when i was born my father was working in the script department on a popular war soap called the sullivans a show since described as like neighbours but with bombs and hitler unable to rid himself completely of the acting bug that infested him as a teenager he shamelessly wrote himself a modest part in the series this was to be a common occurrence with my father and if one day you 're short of amusing things to do you can search his name as a writer or producer or script editor on on imdb and find almost without exception that whatever shows he worked on in a behind-the-scenes role somewhere his name will also appear in the cast list this is completely true it 's hard not to admire his admire his naked ambition i imagine him sitting in productions production meetings script in hand broad smile across his face you know who would be perfect for this role i picture him saying in a hopeful sing-song voice while his colleagues shifted uncomfortably and wondered just how long it would take before management grew wide and wise and a priest in riverboat series all the rivers run and someone known memorably as customer one in homicide in overly overacted police drama cop shop he either played a character called streaker or an actual streaker i 've been too afraid to ascertain which exactly coincidentally the first acting job i ever had involved me getting naked which set the low brow tone for the remainder of my drawn out and tawdry career in front of the camera to my internal shame i allowed myself to be stripped down and placed on a rubber bathmat appearing alongside my smiling mother who at the time was sporting the haircut of the day a sharp glossy bulb and fringe made popular by daffy hey hey saturday co-host jackie mcdonald my job was to look inherently delighted by the fact that with the assistance of scientifically proven grip tests i was enjoying bath time without all the bothersome business of slipping over and knocking myself unconscious on the soap dish i believe i have quizzed myself with a plum i was i think 15 months old thank you marie um does anyone have has just asked me why martin amos was such a douchebag i mean he didn 't use that word and he said you like my name he doesn 't seem very nice that 's not a question i don 't know why does anyone want to say anything about mark namaste you look like you 're about to put your hand up were you yeah there 's a great chapter in which you talk about the complaint letters you used to write and not always come back is there anything lately that 's really made you feel the need to write another letter i 'm trying to think um i 've i 've got a lot of pen pals but i can 't remember i get paranoid that people are going to trace it back to me now because i used a really bad student in some of those some of those letters yeah i look i get the pip all the time with things but off honest you can usually tweet it because it 's usually on q a and i 'm usually like shut up you idiot and yeah i look i do get the pip with things a lot but more more often than not these days they 're they 're praising letters like the people who make the uncle toby 's who made the um porridge the instant oats i wrote them a cup i made them a card i was like it 's so great there are four different flavors and every day you put your hand in you don 't know what you 're gonna get they never wrote back or they wrote back something like please don 't contact us anymore which is terrible so no i mean i do get the people a lot so i i 've still got the drive to do it and i i write a lot of letters i 've this year 's been a bit full up but i 'm just about to take a lot of time off so you can be sure that people at white wings are probably like shutting down the hatches at the moment she 's coming again i 'm kind of curious how you managed to write a second series the characters in the first season yeah just do you wait um i know that will worry us a bit at first as well but uh yeah we finished filming that last friday and the premise is this doesn 't give anything away because the obviously put it up in a press release but the very very basic premise is that she meets someone who who is her exact opposite and everyone who he has sex with gets healed so he heals like people 's tinier and stuff like that and are the more serious diseases but tinier you know is a curse as well um so that 's the the basic premise is you know the two of them together and we 've cast this amazing guy called damon harriman who was in the sullivans i just realised there you go and he and my father i don 't tell it don 't tell my dad i 'm telling you this but he and my father saw each other for the first time a long time at my book launch and my father was obviously a bit nervous because and knew what they were picturing him with my pants on every time i saw him say hello to him and um he 's put that that 's not oh it 's not yet he 's put the garbage out without pants on so there 's nothing sexy about him in there anyway so he saw damon and he said damon you used to have such a big head as a child and you don 't say that to an actor david 's for the whole night going but i 've grown into my head haven 't i i haven 't i i 've filled it out the car was quite little there but now i 'm large um but he is an amazing he 's amazing he 's in like csi one of them csi insert playstation and he 's in an episode of breaking bad and he always plays sort of you know he always kidnaps people and stuff so he 's the guy who 's the the sex healer so that 's the basic premise but i can 't tell you anything else i thought it 'll this funny no weird my name is he 's fine um no no none at all i do not because like when i get nervous i talk a lot and i also swear a lot and a really nice lady from westminster don 't swear because he 's going on a webcast and i said i 'm going to find it have i sworn i haven 't had i 've done really well and she said you can say bugger or bloody and that was it so i think i 've done really well because at shearers i was like a sailor on surely and it was just so dreadful so i feel like i 've kept i 've done us all proud tonight thank you john ah yeah i just like it and now i feel a bit self-conscious about it because it 's something that i always loved and then people go that 's your thing and you 're like well it 's not a thing that 's like it you know and you just so i 've started sticking feathers in there as well no no i sticking them in my hair because as a vegan you can 't pluck birds people people don 't like it and the birds don 't like it um but i fear that i 'm going to end up like keith richards with like fishing lures and you know if i like keep picking things up when you 're just sitting on first user club with rocks and stuff hanging out so i you know i just love it i love flowers that 's why i got the tattoo of the lily and you know i like flowers and color and and um but yeah it does it gets sad when people go oh that 's your funny thing that you do and you no you don 't that 's exactly yeah but there will be some feathers i 'm sorry i 'm warning you in advance but no rocks i 'll stop now with your tuesday book club i know it 's live supposedly but do you have a little meeting beforehand look i love the book i 'm just going to give you a warning where i hated it what happens is brendan the producer calls us all up separately and then he tells jennifer so jennifer knows what we all think of the book so she knows how to to view the discussion but we get told not to talk about them in the green room beforehand because you find yourself having this impassioned discussion in the green room and then you get out there thinking i just said that to that person i don 't want to say that anymore but i saw kate morton is on the the one that we 're doing that 's coming up and we ran into each other at the prison writers festival and because i knew thomas connealy would really love the hair with amber eyes and i thought i don 't want to argue with community there are people you just go i don 't want to argue with jermaine greer i had to she did confederacy of dances and that was terrifying um there was and and howard jacobson who bought on dh lawrence which i i you know you just think oh yeah i want to tussle um but i ran into katie in a lift and i said we 're not allowed to talk about the books but what did you think of it and she said i thought it was a bit cold it went great fine i know i 've got someone on my side now that 's fine but that was very much against the rules and i 'm a real stickler for the rules so even when people come in for the first time going they start talking about oh we 're not to talk and i like to talk about it it 's the rules jennifer will get angry don 't make jennifer angry um so yeah she 's the one she 's got all the information she knows it all she 's amazing so she knows how to veer you into what did you think of it and try and set up a fight between you and peter simon this is more a comment than a question i can 't but you recommended a book a couple of years ago it was just a blog days oh yeah and i it was the uh the adult book in which the guy can stop time oh yeah nick nicholson back in the format they 're for martial it 's very rude maybe i didn 't mention i think you said it 's an excellent adult book or something and everyone kept like coming to our brewery like can i borrow apparently he 's got a new book and it 's called the house of holes and apparently that 's really cool oh yeah he 's phil he 's a filth merchant he 's a film peddler nicholson baker and he did was a box the other one and again this is with jennifer bernard having just opposite taste she always even if we like the same writers she 'll like the crack one well she like the one that i don 't like so all the paul oster books it 's now got to the point where it 's so i mean i love sonia hartnett who 's amazing and butterfly is just such an incredible book and she said oh i love i can 't remember the one she recommended was my least favorite and then she read my book and she wrote this really lovely card saying i read your book i thought it was great i went that 's like oh my book must be said i hope she was just being nice and she doesn 't actually like it so don 't mean i 'm sorry that i made you you probably got arrested on your way home through the airport carrying my cousin baker as well in trouble for giving this way i 'm sure i i didn 't dislike it i thought it was a bit cold and i thought i i thought it was a book that was hard to say cross that because just when i thought it was too cold for long time you 'd do something amazing and i for once i wasn 't a bleating voice a soul voice you know i had kate on side and jennifer was i don 't want to give too much away but it was it was a very interesting discussion it was really a robust discussion and the other book we do on movie they 've been trying to do that for a long time and i 'm so glad they haven 't they were trying to do that steve martin was looking was going to be ignatius in the 70s and then more recently will ferrell and drew barrymore did you just want to kill yourself it 's just like when they did ask the dust with colin farrell and selma hyatt i was going to throw myself off a bridge but um yeah they they keep trying because it 's such a great movie and you know they keep failing which is good but they might do it you just have to choose i just it just exists so perfectly on the page why would you need to you know i 'm not completely against people making books into films and i 've seen there are some great there are some great ones but when it 's one of your favorites just you just it 's like my when my mother was reading um magic faraway tree to me when i was a kid she was really she hated that there looks like and that 's not what silky looks like she had you know when you 've got the pictures in your head you don 't need anyone to present them to you i don 't need willful ruining my favorite book at all so hopefully they won 't do it if they do i 'll just politely walk past me great gusty why are they redoing that why don 't i give that to besleman he 's going to make a hash of it when the slack came out i started to read it and but the most important part was probably within the quest to chapters and then to me there was just a lot of foul language and i start to get really disinterested i love that we 're all just talking about books now having our own you didn 't finish it no oh that 's scandalous i can 't i can 't even have not finished a book no matter how bad it is i mean i finished iron rand i mean for god 's sake i 'm a trooper i 'm a trooper my the did anyone say have they added the jennifer burn christos conversation yeah because jennifer did it in conversation you know how she does that jennifer burns presents the specials she shot one with christos during the writers festival which was we shot just before we did uh our melbourne writer 's festival show and it 's amazing it 's really interesting he 's a fascinating guy he 's i mean he 's a he used to be a communist and he 's a real fringe of society i mean have you read head-on or dead europe i mean they 're pretty aggressive books um and i think jennifer was saying to him i 'm sure i 'm gonna get this quote wrong but uh he she said that he always liked that jean-janae never allowed him himself to be a pet of the bourgeoisie and she said and how do you feel now christus that your book is being made into an abcc and he he feels very uncomfortable but i don 't think he knows how to put himself on the fringe of society because he 's been series a lot of complain i mean it does divide people i love the book but i mean i grew up in the area the people are also just a tiny bit older than me i found it very accessible a lot of people the main complaint is that they don 't they the characters are very unlikable and i think he says that each of you who do you meet in real life that you like everybody you know but it 's it 's it 's a really he 's a fascinating guy i think he 's finding this whole process very unnerving how 'd everyone else feel about this life hands up if you liked it there you guys see you 've got people you can talk to about the snap this is great i don 't know and i 'm not much of a classics reader and that 's what 's been amazing about the book show of me i don 't think i would have gone near anna caretta and my life is infinitely better because i 've read it but i think it 's i just you know male male writers and certain bukowski i 'm just sort of once you get first in that genre then you start trying to find out who influenced them and then you you know you sort of get stuck in but the book show has sort of rashed me out to that in that regard but i don 't test me on books i just you know it 's a it 's an instinctive reaction

    "text": "I was born here mm-hmm yes my parents came up from Melbourne just after the war father was transferred found a little place in mosman to rent and being fairly impoverished having come out of the army and they look to how could they enjoy a weekend mineral expense and balmoral was the obvious choice and you may remember a little kiosk next to where the beach club is which would sell hot water I 'm sure that 'll be in the council 's records hot water for opinion whatever to make you tea so they 'd pick up their sandwiches and then somebody said well why don 't you join the beach club right next door with picnic facilities and a place to change they were not keen races but that was where I grew up summer weekends were picnics at the beach hub there 's a key part Billy Street upon them or belmont heights I suppose it 's called and wasn 't called that those days it was just bad moral is able to scrape up enough money in the 50s and bought the house so that wish that the house was close to the beach that long walk up stanton Rhoda and a hot summer 's day as if a little kids it seems an eternity but no that 's great exercise and a wonderful upbringing I remember the chairs running vaguely remembering on and once or twice but I can remember the chairs running down to their terminus we still called the champion the bustle around there are still refer to as the tram shed its it 's interesting how it sticks in the mind because I started school down upper moreland from school when I think the chance would have still been running in 55 that dates one a bit because I think only finished a couple years later than the club is about formation was early nineteen fourteen and they went bought some land and Mick Featherston I think we sold them the parcel of land so it is actually freehold title and big Featherston was Featherston 's haul down the southern in down here with the infant school has been nothing and they built the building which was finished by the end one you see on the front cover of the beach cubs history at that time and there are a couple of trams in there as well not quite sure whether the trams predated that but we see joke that the chancellor for the women out the back that though that building would have lasted until about the 1930s obviously with additions and then the club was rebuilt significantly with a two-story building in addition since some of the foundation members have had links all way down to the present one of them was here marath and he had three young lads whose picture appears in the picture of the opening of the beach club building in 1915 Clem Lou and VIN breath and lose some Diggy breath is still very keen competitor and his daughters and now their daughters are there still members said what 's that flower generations one of those brothers was Clem wrath Clem never had any kids himself but nevertheless he took such a keen interest in getting kids how to swim that the club 's record to show that he trained out of 3,000 or and that was at the back lawn this was over a period of 30 or 40 years before learn to swim classes came along from the government that 's very recent only in the 70s late seventies and on those learn to swim classes they 're pictures of us lying out on back lawn and that 's where I learned to swim I still can 't_''_234.43 kick some of the heavens that I learnt there they were relying out on the back lawn without no no tells kicking up and down as little kids and then taking the big old wooden hollow surf kicking boards down to the rock pool before it silted up and showing up and down there and there 's a story which they may have heard that Clem apparently was keen for many years and writing to the council even to say could we have a proper swimming pool at Balmoral up in the northern end of the beach because he thought that the rock pool was not up to the scratch and the story goes that probably it would have been blasting holes out of today to have us like a or a surf swimming pool but in 1989 i think it was when Barry O 'Keefe was the mayor he asked me to go down said that they wanted to want to claim the council wanted on a claim this contribution and named the clem wrath pool named at the claim wrath pool and there was a little black I don 't know if it 's still there commemorating that with features etc as a recognition of what he had done and others working with him after Clem had dropped it and I remember coaching little kids for many years as club captain doing that it appears that the regular shark watch probably any or the only records that are in the shark me in the club 's history 75th history was of the shark watch set up after the war after the second war with young men up in the amphitheater the star amphitheater issued with binoculars to search out for the Sharks and then they would use a signal down to the beach club which were then ring the shark alarm bell sunny day that everyone was focused on the sax rumor has it that some of the young words with their binoculars may have been watching more activity on the beach but that would be an all and that I don 't know if we haven 't got records of shark alarms being sounded presumably they were from time to time but it was a real threat and I remember as a kid my parents were very adamant that you did not swim outside the net anyway dusk or any near the dawn or dusk and that went back to you that Young led being taken off while gene point and that would have been when I was about five so it was very clear in our memories and even now we think twice about swimming around the island down to the baths the old-timers do others you see swimming up the middle of the banding I 've been me doing it there is a shock bill it 's been restored it 's up in the club now it 's it was there in my youth I did record haven 't_''_393.55 done when I wasn 't there and then it disappeared it years and is now just a bit of a historical artifact being polished up and sits inside the club room one of the things that we keep emphasizing to people coming into the club and I think some of the existing members could be reminded that it 's a beach club not a swimming club and that was always the origin with those smugglers they didn 't go down that had suing racers they were to have a place to change on the weekend to socialize to be able to enjoy each other 's company and that 's really what we 've sought to preserve within the beach club that sense that it is I went so home away from home but it certainly has been for a number of people over the years and we had a least have a lot of social activities that ebbs and flows depending on social attitudes balls and dinner dances and smokers were very popular back the past there 's not the same demand for that these days so tends to be swim or meals after a swim which is a great meeting place and so for acquainting where local cafes who tend to continue to camera artery upstairs and chat on but they 've also more recently been introduced bridge yoga storytellers clubs with people come down and spin their yarns and I think there are the things under consideration perhaps some on the menu side and we have a special activities from time to time but with a club of 2,000 members not all of those going to be swimming if we get 100 swimmers on a race it 's getting crowded and so overall you 'd be lucky to get 300 members of the club actually participating events so that 's what fifteen percent twenty percent it 's it 's so a lot of people individually but that 's not what the club 's of primary aim is so that is where the camera artery from people using it all the time often comes from we introduced the nipper spray again all about 10 years ago 15 years ago I can 't be sure my daughters were in the some of the young boys a little rough on the sum of the beach events but it 's really taken off and as always happens here it 's when a club member says well I 've got a young kid or this particular just motivates them to take some leadership on it and peter mccormick was very keen in those early days of setting that up with his wife and that 's been passed on several times several baton changes and now it 's growing through i think there 's about six hundred registrations are you so it 's huge split up with age groups each age group has a parent who administers that a rule is that if you want your kid to be involved you become involved so it 's it really is a an all-in activity and all thurs and there 's a priority given to club members reregister abut it 's still it 's open to the public so it 's part if you like of that extended community spirit as well after the rush of the early morning swimmers has gone and as you probably every day the year through winter so they 'd hate daylight saving because they lose that time with different groups coming through every cell half hour or hour until seven thirty eight o 'clock but round about nine o 'clock 930 when the mob had gone some of the retired older group would come down and make themselves a cup of tea over the Jefferson first think I mean dry off make themselves a cup of tea and then sit around sort out the world 's problems in their dick she 's soaking up the Sun and so why you don 't need to get dressed if there 's nobody else around at that time so they were quality called the bear asked parliament members included pet Morton who is a former their local member patron of the beach club Minister for local government I think at the time to old Frank Mason whose son became the chief justice at the High Court and that 's white who is the chief engineer water board a whole raft of people and others who chuckles Maggie Dawson OD Dawson who would have connection Haven to war because it didn 't matter what your status was in the beach crab you even know business no titles in respect of the club 's formation certainly the first the meeting the public meeting that was held two forms beach club based on the smugglers suggestion why don 't we form a club out of this was chaired by the local mayor at the time they figured and certainly members of the council and the club were interchangeable in those early years taking an active interest both ways and I think from my reading before that one of the original beach club councillors and beach club member Psalm the committee was in fact the Chief Justice of New South Wales at the time so we 'll in curand there but yes there was a close link with Jack Carroll and others with the council and that we 're sought to preserve that we see ourselves very much as a member of the community and even when we rebuilt the club few years ago we consciously stepped away from designs that would make the crime appear that modest and less conspicuous with that in mind and we sought to preserve that and it was through activities we used to contribute to local fund activities through the council the reader book and other matters I think some of that mad fallen by the wayside drug all them hospital etc because being a club that is not a trading club we don 't make a profit and we don 't think that we should be steering members charitable contributions according to what we think so this was only if the cuddliest generating funds and we organized the cancer swim each year data per mole or at least the beach club members do certain major activity on it but that link with the council one of them thinks is me one of it was epitomised when dom lopez was in the chair many years ago at council and I caught up with him on a weekend known as door knocking other servers and he said we 'd like we the council would like to recognize what the beach club does with its involvement with young people we 'd like to covers the mayor 's youth award and we invite the near each year to come down presented to the junior member who 's made most contribution to the activities of the beach club as far as I 'm concerned I will make every effort to keep it but I call accessible and affordable it 's very keen to avoid it becoming elitist in any way or just a professional persons Club something that anybody could join it 's it 's harder and harder these days with funds etc but I like to quote when I 'm introducing new members to the club in a little historical spiel along the lines of what we 've been talking about here that it was Pat Morton as the patron he said to us you 've got something special going for you the beach club make sure you don 't lose it and that 's what we certainly seek to do to keep it open to anybody they don 't have to be wealthy they 're naturally professional and to be able so that both affordability and accessibility yes that our goal and will strive to maintain it _"

    "text": "we were living at eleonora Heights and we had an electric electrical contracting company and we were looking for premises to run that from because all the work that we were doing was in north sydney and round the lower north shore and going back and forwards to eleonora all the time was proving to be a little bit difficult and jim saw this the boat shed for sale and thought that was a good idea so instead of just finding a premises we ended up living in a boat shed and running it it was an existing business it was his name was George Smith and he had owned it for quite some time for me about the nineteen fifty or no 40 s 1940s and he was getting on in years and he wanted to retire but it was his son that we went into business with his son eventually sold out and left and there was just too man i but yeah they had he used to sell he was real character he used to sell boats and motors all sorts of fishing tackle and they had slipway but he was one of the old school he could tell her how much people could afford it and he never had a price on a boat and he 'd looked at the person who didn 't say how much the boat was I couldn 't do it today but back then he could when we went there there were several businesses that had changed over because opposite us there was originally there was lines and there was a guest house and they had a fire and the guest house burned down and the councilman and the maritime wouldn 't let them rebuild the guest house and so they built what we now know as dal bora it wasn 't quite as big as it is now but they built dal bora and then they put a marina in and that was about the year we moved there 1967 was when they rejuvenated and rebuilt that and along the other end I mean we had Ferguson 's Bobby Ferguson was next door to us he was closest to the spit bridge and he had taken over from his father there was the volunteer coastal patrol and when we went there the volunteer coastal child was only a single storey building and then they built and you build the second story on top of that cooks probably about the 1990s when had happened and then there was the skiff club next door there 's always been this gift club there and then further along there was but a Jimmy O 'Rourke and Jimmy O 'Rourke had the Bochy in a slipway and he built he was a ship right and at the side of his building or part of his building was a lady 's restaurant and everybody knew ladies and the next door to that there was a the endeavor but the endeavor had only been there I don 't know how long when we got there but not that many years because prior to that it was Adams boat shed and it was about yet also and then there 's the car park and then there 's the middle harbor yacht club and then you go along to the amateur sailing club but that was where the law in the early early days yeah well most most of them were still boat sheds for a while and with a restaurant sort of attached to it but I guess the main reason was that was for that that was what the people wanted was to come to such a beautiful area and to eat and relax not everybody wanted to go boating and also the the authorities that ie the lands department in the marriage they made it very very expensive to be there because they charge their much for the water and for the land that the building 's sat on that you had to charge a lot of money to hire boats and then looks like that people adapted their building and put in what they felt they would be make maintain their lifestyle I think the weekends away started earlier because we had a lot of high boats and outboard motors and people came to use them and the fishermen used to come very early and it would be nothing for the doorbell to start being at five o 'clock in the morning and then the a full day sometimes people just take them for hours and then they would come back and then they 'd go out again so all day the boats are be coming and going and people well as far as mossman goes I felt it was neglected not for any other reason I knew because whenever anything there was any festival any celebration any special occasion the spit was never included and I used to feel we were always the bridesmaid never the bride and and it is such a beautiful area that I couldn 't understand why it wasn 't part of the community all the all the proprietors Bobby Ferguson had gone at that stage in Brett McMullin was in Ferguson 's and and we felt that we needed some advertising and some public publishing of that area and so we got together with dal bora and the yacht clubs and the skiff clubs and we all got together and we ran a program on the sunday saturday and sunday and we had done the yacht club had a sailing so that people could actually come down and try and the kayaks and the canoes they also let people try them so it was to get people to come to the area to use it and to see what we had facilities all the restaurants put on little things they in the on the western side where the park was the they had little lot of tents and little is where the restaurants were selling some of their wares so that they could taste the matter you know small just small containers and things and it was good it was good we had bands down there and it was a great day we 're very lucky with the weather it was really good you could go there and there would be 50 to 70 fishermen on a Saturday and Sunday evening friday saturday really and they used to come there and the problem with fishermen the same as on the wharf and it 's not all fishermen there are some you know very good fisherman but a lot of them leaves to come and then have their knife and their bait and they cut it up and then they cut them up and then you 've got the mess to clean up and also on the wharf we had to stop them from fishing because they would throw the lines out and we have boats moored and if they got the line caught in the Rope they 'd cut it and then leave the cook in and then somebody had pulled the rope and then you 'd end up with somebody with under fingers but yeah the point was to go across there and there was also a ferry that used to take a tram they had a tram on it that used to go across there as well but and when there ellery went there which was a long time before we were there well over 100 years because he was there eighteen nineteen forty nine he had three acres over at c4 and then he used to roll little boat and used to ferry people across by boat and then went to a punt after that but that bridge is of course is the second bridge and there was the other one which was pretty horrible too of times that the police got word to say there was a bomb on it and they had to close the roads and we 'd have the bomb squad and things down there what they can actually do about it I don 't know because the geography of the of the area it 's that 's where the bridge probably would have to go if it wasn 't a a high-rise like an elevated bridge from from ridged orig it would have to go down there and the water the it 's very deep very deep and it 's very soft at the bottom and that 's what they say about their the soundings when you put the things down if they 'd have to go a long way down before you could actually build a bridge but I 'm sure if you can put a man on the moon you can build a bridge well it was a nice time I think the nice thing is you meet nice people you mean a lot of lovely people and and and that 's the class that was the plus on sporting groups and getting to know them you know a lot because you live in the area children go to school in the area you 're involved in so many things anyway but you know it was nice we minded our grandchildren and I used to take them for walks because that was what my kids love to do they love to go round to the park or whatever because see I love this bed it 's just so much there to see and do you learn about the the starfish and all the fishes and all the little creatures down there as well as all the things in the tree and you go around to pearl Bay and there 's a cook borrowing the tree I mean you six what seven eight hundred how many miles from Sydney and you 've got on this absolutely Wonderland and so we we enjoyed doing it again with our grandchildren and Andy 's take Alex up to powerpoint we 'd sit on the seat up there and watch the world go past all the cars and all the boats and and yeah do whatever it was is yeah there 's a part of you that just doesn 't want to go and just because I think it 's beautiful it 's just just such a beautiful place and I 'd like more people to enjoy it at all my life at this bit is I look back on it and we 've with delight and it was hard and we worked hard but it was a lovely place to live when somebody said we 're going to move Jim 's that I 'll have to take it to seven acres or something because she 's not used to neighbors it 's probably right but it if you had to live somewhere it was a beautiful place to live the times I didn 't like it were two o 'clock in the morning when the storm came and we were down there roping up folks and things like that and that happened many times those days I don 't miss I don 't miss going out in weather 220 to tie up everything we had two massive storms and one where manly baths Raglan Street up raglan Street it lost its mooring or we lost part of our roof in that that night and the water came right through downstairs in the boat shed came from her back through to the street and then came up the side and out onto the street that was when all the damage was caused done it man leaned down balmoral down at this bit yeah all of us but if you bring any visitors down to the spirit you turn around beauty point and as soon as you turn around a beauty point they go ah oh it 's not beautiful and it is just so stunning and I just can 't understand why mossman doesn 't use that more than they do and then if you go up across the bridge and drop battle Boulevard up to the top of seaforth and then look down and see that is the entrance to mossman it is just beautiful _"

    "text": "well the the situation was that he was absolutely amazed that you could open a business going to the city buy fresh fruit and vegetables with the owl markets and come back and sell it and that people appreciated you giving them advice in those days you used to serve them none of this self service nonsense and he he and mum built up a lot of goodwill by serving the people we even had customers that came into this that never came into this shop and we 'd deliver an order of Friday to them and I can remember when I was old enough to drive the truck I 'd take orders around there was like one big happy family actually mum ran the shop when dad was interned during the war if it wasn 't_''_49.5 for the good nature of a lot of the the customers that stood by for was Italians were being terribly vilified by by certain people for an hour fourth of our Ireland dad was in turds I interned and mum had to operate the business and only through the the goodness of a her work to do and they come and pick up their orders themselves so they 're able to keep the shop going so mum really had a battle during the war and even in the history of Massa that Gavin Souter wrote he wrote about you know dad was worried about mums he wasn 't too well so to get lived from the from the internment camp Atari he put cost he cut his leg and put caustic soda in it and the doctor said you 're a bloody fool you could have gone down anyway okay you had to come down and see her but it was just you know a real pioneering spirit it was just wonderful well after the war it took off after the war it took off everybody was happy and it was wonderful I mean the the fact that the community it embrace the attachment there was a prisoner of war camp but at middle head and the prisoners of war dressed in their red dungarees were led the freedom of Mossman and I just couldn 't feel them came back and settled won his nineties now he 's also quoted in Gavin 's book but it you know the business boomed after the war it really boomed daddy come today said right oh the war 's over let 's get on with it and I start a schooling about 1944 or something with a nun 's and and my brother started after that but yeah it was just just a wonderful thing ah well the displays in the shop were absolutely you know he prided himself on displays and later on they brought out the apple and pear festival and he got a runners-up when he said listen son I want to win this and I took it in my hand because I you know you will never find a better display of fruit than me because I had the best teachers in the world my father uncle Stephen Arkell Tony they were brilliant and and we bolted in we bid Woolworths Carl 's a lot our only started coming to fruit and vegetables but dad was so tickled think about it and then the Chamber of Commerce used to have a Christmas there was that sense of feeling and and it was a lovely village and I 'm I 'm terribly protective of that village down there I don 't want to see any big chain stores come in it 's just a nice little area that that I remember with a great deal of affection sure we had eight or nine fruit shops eight or nine butcher shops we even had two or three shoe shops chemists were quite a few gross we had the five different grocery stores there plus your little corner stores and that and and of course that 's all choked now the shops are still evidence now alfresco dining which of course has a great Italian flavor to it because there were no cool rooms he had to buy virtually daily the fruit was alright because the fruit would would keep in that but bearing in mind you only had apples for about nine months of the year because there were no cool room so your apples used to cut out and that 's when the stone fruit came in he had you stoned for it that was a tricky part of it you know you brought it fresh fruit and vegetables available you know Tony Lopez see we go to the market every day and buy the the vegetables and the oddly odd fruit that he needed but we never threw anything out he knew exactly how many bushels of beans to buy peas lettuce when he carrots and potatoes it 'd keep but just stuff like is spinach and that and he would go in every day and you were exactly what he wanted our big day the weekends were big of course and we used to deliver on Saturday so our Thursday was a big market because you needed to get this stuff ready and I just could never get out of and I love going in the markets with him it was just just fabulous I used to stand on the back of the truck to make sure that nobody pinched anything off it then when I got a bit older and stronger I was allowed to pull a barrow and I 'll tell you what when he got 20 fruit case it was an absolute art form without and what what you know when the cool room came in a completely revolutionized whose you only got to go to the market twice a week and you can keep stuff in cool room forever oh no he loved the shop I mean he would come there every day even even when he was more or less retired he 'd come every day and it was he was like an institution it sit on that CD at the front the school kids it 's Iowa to him and being on council II take messages for me people coming to you Dom around now you tell me what you want you write it down and I 'll fix it up for you there 's a great a great man all the music well he loved the music I mean he just couldn 't think that in a shop you couldn 't have music in those days you you know your ideas weren 't terribly interesting I mean right he added I was brilliant a music star somebody nice days so we had the Al stack aid records this is before the the 33 and 45 he would stack the records I only put a speaker in the shop and purple you still love to hear the speaker you love to hear their music and I remember on one particular day mrs. Adams came he lovely customer from from Ruby Street your lovely person they were see the people in snogs in those days they were very affluent people and dad just picked up my dancing the wolf 's in the shop customers are standing around watching them and that 's what it was like you see fit Junction used to be the busy place and Mossman junction you know it was like the back end of Mossman but to mossman junctions credit he built up a tremendous amount of goodwill with the people I mean Sunnis butcher shop was just outstanding Bruce is now formally retired but his father ran a chop shop there mr. pistola down the other end of town he ran a butcher shop and they and it was like comparing doubled Bay to to new town see the bottom in there was new town you want any cheaper you go to you go to spec Junction oh that would have been why was still a skilled the 40s and 50s because when they widened speech Junction it totally you know it totally changed the the the outlook of the shops were cut back and and they lost a lot of parking the traffic has to had a lot to do wispy Junction yet it 's come back bigger and better than ever split Junction has with those lovely big shops there and of course Bridge Point has been an absolute when absolute find for their brilliant our Bob divers of marvelous customer I remember the time when he he bought this big big churn whatever it was and stopped the traffic and Military Road delivered it to Mum and he wanted some of my famous spaghetti and meatballs because when he came to this shop we 'd come in and sit down our spaghetti and meatballs over this particular time mum made this fabulous dish for him and we delivered it down when he got his order but now Bob people stopped the traffic that day and lost when he had this beautiful convertible and he used to take us for rides and then of course he left bow Marlon around to Bay Street because he had a mooring for the Tennessee there was his boat hmm I 'm Bob Dom we used to get free tickets to go and say pick a box you pick a box that was good well the other customs were howard craven was a customer in this shop who else doctor ever did come in occasionally there are some big shots lived in Austin in those days yeah when our shop had to go seven days a week was unbelievable nothing worse than being in the shop on a Sunday but I made I made good weather out of it because I had Benny working with me he was a bloke that was a casual that reduced help on a on a Sunday and he was a great chef and when my turn came every other Sunday I 'd be there and I had Benny with me we would put on the best Italian aroma what 's that coming side and join us which set him at the back a glass of wine and a plate of spaghetti and they 're into it I 'll be back again but it was like that and then course on Sunday night when he came to close the shop they 're virtually blotto you know my ID but I got em all right that was just and listening to music all day of course the music was on because then then we had day they bought in the tapes and I would put tapes on with this big ghetto blaster I had but I put on the good stuff Perry Como Dean Martin Frank Sinatra Doris Day people he can understand people I grew up with yeah I used to work in the shop when I was at school help on Saturday mornings you know I 'd play cricket and baseball but it was just was it was a lovely wider you know and kids it you 're lucky get your fruit for nothing gee you 're lucky a ride on the main road you know the and you 'd have kids around your mom 's a good cook I like a wife she does a spaghetti you know that was it now it was it was it was a great life it was a tremendous life and I 'm still here you know it 's still here in Mossman now while getting that there 's no while I will the beautiful pearl of the Pacific Mossman is the pearl of the Pacific the people the shops the heritage and last but not least this wonderful Council of which I 've put a hell of a lot into yeah I thought about meeting Xena that was you know it had to happen we used to frequent the Montano milk bar the most famous that used to frequent apart from me was can 't avoid and the montana milk bar

    "text": "in-wall duro door before I remember in Raglan street before when we moved in 1937 and I went to moscone kindergarten the next year early 38 then we moved every year we moved to cast an avenue for probably a year than somerset street for a year than cows road for a year then in 225 vulgar road and would have been noted 41 i think because in 1942 I remember being huddled up in the corridor area of the house worldly Japanese subs came into the harbor and the whatever was going on in the harbor noise son remember we were huddled up there and I remember going with my mother too mossman primary school and watching her put cellophane on the windows because they thought perhaps a tax or imminent never happened of course but but all the windows of the school were cellophane dup yes well we lived in 25 vulgar road and when I got married we moved in with my parents for a couple of years and my mother died and the landlady under the law apparently had to give first offer to the tenants bought that house in 1957 for 2,300 pounds and resold in 1961 for 4,500 pounds went around two ranges Avenue and bought that for 8500 pounds which nearly sent me bro I 'm still a mosman boy yeah definitely I don 't follow manly Cricket Club I follow mossman creaky club well we always used to walk down elmora street and down the steps to get to the beach but it was a bit hairy to come back that way so easily the tram back up to mossman Junction and then walk home from there they were back in those days are three types of tram the the old jumping jacks which were too short sort of trams coupled together they used to mainly run on the line from athol Wharf to Balmoral beach and bake again and through a cutting through Gordon Street beaconsfield road and a cutting down to the beach then there was the toast wreck trams which were open had two compartments either end completely open to the weather I had a hood over the top on the sides of our open and then about four used to walk along a running board collecting the fares and he had a strap to pull to stop the tram and to start it again to tell the driver to get moving the newer trams had a corridor down the middle so the conductor was inside the tram they 're a bit of they went off don 't remember the day at the end of the 50s they were scrapped progressively through Sydney I was quite pleased to see them go i thought they 're a nuisance to the traffic you couldn 't get past them because they stopped at every stop the cars had to stop behind them and wait and well other people had different opinions were that was my opinion but there were lines down to the spit the junction at spit junction you as i said a line down to the spit and the other one went down to the zoo a branch at the buena vista hotel down to Balmoral and a branch of mosman Junction down to Osman wharf well we used to go down to memory park after school and have a along to home there was the Scots along the road and Winslow 's the other side and a few others we formed a little cricket team one stage cool memory park we had a turf wicket because of the bumpy are weeds where wicket which was a pride and joy and better than anybody else who only had a concrete we get down at the spit or something which is much better in fact we 're still within Graham Winslow along the road his father used to go to the states on business and he brought back a baseball kit bag full of bats and gloves and so on so we used to get out of memory park again and throw a baseball around but then we went to Balmoral couldn 't be playing a game but we must have been just practicing if you like and Jack Ahern from the club found us and he talked us into coming to Mossman eyval forget if it was baseball first or cricket first but we went to the cricket nets and we joined the bossman juvenile baseball association which played every we found well it just continued years right up till now if you low 52 weeks of the year 52 Saturday 's of the year unless Christmas Day fell on a salver suffer no mas padova was for the kids nets and for the juvenile baseball but as a good old ohm Ross navel was used for senior cricket and baseball and balmoral was also used for senior cricket and baseball but the the grades went down the 1st grade was basically mosman oval rawson was the second ground and balmoral Zathura first one was Stan McCabe but I never saw him back that I did know him through being treasurer of the club and hear the sports stories to biola gear from him he that he was a great cricketer pre-war in Craig became captain of Australia and reason he was only a short-term captain really was he got hepatitis and was out of cricket for 12 months or more but enough to because he never played test cricket again it took a while to rehabilitate get him back on his feet we played state cricket again that would great batsman he went Don Bradman took him to South Australia he played with South Australia then in England Australia Gordon rock one of the fastest bowlers Australia 's ever had Dave colleague wait to England in 1972 third opening vana then next one would have been Alan I think and currently brettly even though Brett 's injured Bill Bassett oh I found this person Bill Bassett who I didn 't know of before who was a great leg spin bowler back in the 1920s got a poultice of wickets but never got picked in the state signs in his scrapbook in the library there 's lots of cuttings of editorials if your local reports are headed up why isn 't Bassett playing for New South Wales his average is better than Arthur mainly and things like that but he never made it well ken really took over from Bill Bassett he he started in first grade at the very end of the 20s just as Bill Bassett was fading out and then Ken played continuously with the war sort of interrupting things but continuously throughout the early 60s 62 playing down in the minor grades not second or third grade he went down to the teach the kids in the northern suburbs competition he played till he was probably 70 Keith cavity commonly known as bendy because I thought he won the bend he I remember him taking us as kids from the nets up to Tantallon oval at Lane Cove to play a game of cricket up there but and he was a coach when he was a player and coached but then he was in the war came a prisoner of war shot down while flying an airplane somewhere and anyway he got out after war came back here and played about two seasons I think and then went to West Australia to captain West Australia 's first ever sheffield shield so and they wanted him the first year they they play after a period there he came back here was club coach for a year or two days I used to seem reasonably regularly to to international captains as probably only about what other club that can match that of MP in Melbourne well crickets an view probably is from players point of your team a council point of view you 've got to have a wicket prepared it must have a fence the fence also there for other sports but you must have offense Cyke screens maybe bit else and then you 've got three ovals to do all that for dressing rooms pavilion but we always want a bit more and we weren 't getting satisfaction in the earlier days from council we didn 't think we were and so three of us were nattering away one day ever a beer john john sykes myself and dami lopez and we said one of us ought to get on to Counsell and see if we can smarten things up a bit for sport and John who was an insurance broker civil I 've got a surance business to worry about her i said i 'm in accounting firm i got to worry about that Saddam he said okay I 'll stand for Council and he did and you know the history of da me so but we couldn 't learn sundays i can 't recall he did have quite a bit to say about it i remember that as we had the other counsel to the town hall and put our case finally won the the pavilion pavilion was opened in 1939 and it was an open not the bottom part but that the seating area was eleven in the mid 80s we convinced council to close off the back path glasser didn 't make a bit of a room out of it mainly not really a club room but four scorers to get out of the weather and that sort of thing so the soccer club and the creme Club both put in thirty five thousand dollars payable over ten years plus interest to class sat in and make a bit of a cubby house for us and when we played in Fresno the umpire who wasn 't American turned up in his car the number plate how 's that and let tickle my fancy so I thought of the system ever comes to New South Wales I 'll grab that number plate well the 1981 it did so I applied for and got and put it on the mosman oval in front of the scoreboard for the 75th well it was ready to make a label to put on a wine bottle for our 75th anniversary of the club as you 've gotta dance card out there which is quite fascinating we used to have balls yes at mosman town hall and they were with like the Trocadero there 's a big area to ballroom dance you don 't get that these days it 's a little square of rock and rolling which is and I don 't know the atmosphere seems to have gone from that nobody ballroom dances anymore that scenes got a nicer they have something called a ball every year but I think it 's more of a drink app I don 't go so it was voluntary labor to get an oval built and probably ovals a bad word a ground would be better word it wasn 't up to first grade standard so when we were allowed into the competition we were only allowed placed 2nd grade because of the state of the oval the players of middle harbour eventually with more work on the ground we 're admitted to first grade status of 1921-22 and I think we might have even come second that you it doesn 't matter but mossman oval was the first grade I will all the way Apple 1939 started off in 1908 with a little dressing shed which was really the ground keepers room for his machinery rollers or whatever and the players had to go in and change one team at a time because I was so small and not in 12 they built another grandstand wouldn 't be a pavilion but a grandstand wooden structure which suffice until 1939 when the present pavilion was built but in the meantime and not in 27 28 rawson oval was opened with a new pavilion so the first grade moved up to Ross Noble and played there as the first grade ground until 1939 when the new pavilion was put on mosman oval so it must been over then continued as the first grade ground it was renamed in the early 90s allan border oval and respect to Alan I think there lived the Crescent which goes around the the oval to Alan bought a present but the locals didn 't like that so instead of the street the oval became his name in later years we 've swapped a little bit between mossman and Ross navel depending on the state of the ground I 've got to say that soccer does destroy the wicked area and we hadn 't in recent years been able to grow grass on the center wicked home which led us to go back to Ross and ogle as our first great ground but last year we re turfed cost us ten thousand dollars but weary turf the wicked and move back to mossman oval and hopefully that 's going to last us for a while well the scoreboard used to be in the southwest corner as just a just a blackboard if you like with a platform that kids stood on and put up numbers and people 's names that was probably moved over to the other side of the oval in the early 70s I would think I can 't really put a year on while but now it 's hard to get people to come and use to actually do the scoring for us we used to have lots of kids come and do that we 've still got 300 kids playing cricket in the area but we can 't get them up to do the scoreboard no no the stand stand hasn 't moved well well earlier on in my early days in the 50s it was more of an egg shape and the funny looking over but the council did expand it and made it into a really true oval and so a new fence was put around at last year beginning at last season instead of the old picket fence which used to rot out and when cricketers or even other sports would kick balls against the palings they 'd fall out so now we have a the latest hued aluminium fits which hopefully allows forever _"

    "text": "my wife and I moved to Boston in 1965 and we lived in mad long road that down there and alma number 28 used to be quite a long while ago cannons dancehall there was no trace of it left in our back garden but we knew that it had been there and that sort of interested my wife in naari in Muslims early history which she had lived in Boston since the age of three and soon after we arrived in man long road has started doing articles for the mossman daily about the streets of mossman and that that ran in 1966 and 1967 there are a lot of them and that was quite a good introduction for me as well to history of Norsemen I didn 't really get involved in doing hospin history for quite a few years after that I regard mossman is really the richest of Sydney suburbs with historical material it 's quite amazing the things that have happened in this place starting with governor phillip being there three days before the first fleet arrived at Sydney Cove which was a pretty early had been living in mossman for at least six thousand years I guess Muslims history started after Philip the serious when it came back from the flagship of the first fleet it went to Cape Town in 1789 to bring back food because the colony was starving at Sydney Cove and it had a very rough voyage back and was damaged on the rocks of Van Diemen 's land and needed repairing and refitting and to do that we 'd over to mosman Bay and the crew of the series were living there for best part of six months so that was they were the first European settlers or residents of Norsemen I tend to think of mop mossman and as a peninsula and first glance looks like a pretty big Peninsula but if you regarded as this spreading east from cremorne it fairly widely to start with and then tapering off to get to middle head it 's very symmetrical you 've got something up on the north side and something on the south side all the way along Quakers had a on the north side mosman bay on 's head on the south side balmoral on the north side and chowder bay on the south side and cobblers beach on the north side as you get almost two middle head and middle head and obelisk beach on the south side makes me think about a peninsula as a place that a lot of things have happened for some reason tended to associate it with the peninsular war which was going on in mossman 's that early period and it 's odd that this peninsula should have such a military association also it became middle head very early became Sydney Cove first out of Defense with a battery on middle head for an enemy that never arrived but was expected to arrive any tick of the clock George 's Heights had a battery later and more batteries were put in on middle head after the first one in 1801 this military association of mossman 's finds expression in military road of course which was put in to bring artillery to those sites of defense middle head and Bradley 's head and George 's hearts and a lot of the in the Crimean War and so that 's one of the things that give the texture that I mentioned took two mossman the peninsula was of course all all all trees to start with but because of the military connection and the reservations from the military purpose that were there originally but no longer are that military presence really preserved the bush in a a much larger area than would otherwise have happened so today you 've got the marvelous combination of almost virgin bush all around the four shores and of course the foreshores being almost all around the peninsula starting at mosman by and it 's all going anti-clockwise it 's all either rocks cliffs or beach and then behind that trees until you get around middle head past Balmoral pass speech or past the spit but almost all all the way to a Quakers had Bay and then there 's just a straight line across to mosman Bay which is now mclarssen street and Bothwell street another another point in Muslims history is and the Theosophists Assad that theosophy society which in the 1920s became very interested the purpose of it was to be as a site from which it 's difficult to explain actually the Theosophists who had a strong presence in sydney by that time the movement had been founded by a russian woman called madame blavatsky the local authority it was a bishop leadbeater and this this movement believed that hey one of the Masters of the Universe called Lord Maitreya who periodically manifested himself in such vehicles has Pythagoras Confucius Jesus Christ Sophocles was about to manifest himself again in a young Indian boy or now by that time he was seventeen called Krishnamurti who had been found by Bishop Ledbetter and brought to Sydney and it was living in the theosophist community at clifton gardens in a house called the manner that used to belong to the bakewell family he was built by the back walls and he was to add be in in the amphitheater which was that it costs 19,000 pounds to build it was a white painted concrete series of tears rising search semi-circular tears with the proscenium and pillars in front and it could see 2,000 people with to be there for the whatever it was going to happen the way they saw it krishnamurthy was smart enough to buy the by the due date he decided that he wasn 't going to be it at that and he resigned fraught from the movement and the movement later collapsed in Sydney and the amphitheater was sold to the Catholic Church and eventually demolished and there 's now red brick series of home units on the site which is just past going northeast from why arjun point to pity in a way the amphitheatre isn 't still there as a ruin it really really be something something to add to Balmoral more more perhaps from the home units half _"

    "text": "I first moved to mosman in 1986 I was in my early 20s but I had a passionate love affair with it well before then ice to visit mosman about the age of nine or ten with my favorite aunt Kelly we 'd crumb across on the ferry from circular care we 'd have lunch with cliff and Lillian dome so I knew from about the age of 10 that I would one day live in this community I just fell in love with it I just thought what a great place to grow up I was determined now it 's just so determined to live here and I can remember what I bought my house in 1986 we paid 281,000 for it and the interest rates for twenty one percent you can imagine the horror my parents experienced at the thought of their daughter committing to that in early 20s but that 's how determined we were we live there still I 'm grateful for that opportunity how to raise my three children here it 's been a wonderful experience and so giving something back pays a bit of you are I 'm very grateful for being living here for me was a combination of things it was the knowledge that it was all had me covered the birthplace of scouting in Australia that really inspired me to move forward and do it because I could see I had a great interest in and have a great interest in youth development and leadership and i thought i could if i was able to bring this home i could not only restore the last remaining piece of early colonial maritime architecture in sydney from the whaling period but i could dust off the birthplace of scouting and bring it back into the light so for me it was more than just the building no commissioned a archaeological investigation of the site and we found no evidence of Aboriginality but still remains for me a part of the project that is incomplete because we 've never pursued and we 'd like to pursue the interpretation of place to include the aboriginal story of the last camera girl person from that region unfortunately his European nickname was tar pot and we don I don 't know that we will ever really know anything about him but I think there 's going to come a time in the very near future where we commissioned an interpretation and we erect storyboards at that site so that the early colonialism is is displayed alongside the original inhabitants at a respect because so many of our local students visit this as a part of their local studies guide our their program in their local schools and they 're not seeing the full picture and I 'd like them to see the full picture but the last sighting of tar pot was in 1888 and the Metro are a little unsure as to how much time he spent there because of the location of the original cave being very high up with cliff I think the bun is the heart of Muslim because if you consider back in those days how we were living in sort of semi rural conditions the barn was a meeting place it was one of those few facilities where everyone could come together and meet it was before the local council and gather and discuss important issues of the day so that meaning was in December 1891 and then two years later on the sixth of June 1893 it was used as the first polling booth in the Muslim community so yeah I think I think it is the heart of Muslim in 1925 the last official photograph was commissioned by counsel before the demolition it went into the paper and it was a huge public outcry the community was not ready to let this go even though it was in such poor repair the local Scouts launched a campaign save the oldest building for the oldest troop and what about fundraising the money required now from my research I 've discovered that a number of families from the first mosman 1908 scout group mortgage their homes signed had signed bills loans to buy this property so for me became once I understood that it became a personal challenge to honor that legacy the original gift so it about three years after that before they fund raise the money required to restore her and and it 's still the Scout her birthplace place to be on a saturday night and those dances were actually hosted by that local Scout Group as a fundraising activity and people would come from all over Sydney in fact it was famous amongst us personnel as being the only Dixieland venue for music in Sydney and many of the musicians in their 80s and 90s now tell me that if you hadn 't played the barn you hadn 't played the scouts the old scouts tell me stories about when they were young cubs and the way of polishing the Parker tray flooring was to put oil on a hessian sack and then sit a little scout on it and then drag them around by the legs so sorry that they used to polish the floors before the Saturday night dances but yet even even before that sort of the 1920s late 20s it was used as a ballroom it was a way of promoting most men as a community for people to consider settling in and attracting visitors it was used as a ballroom on Saturday night so it 's had a great history for entertainment of the barn I must confess for more than 10 years before I move forward like many locals I saw it as being really significant about somebody else 's problem I couldn 't imagine that a building so historic would be allowed to be to continue in such disrepair without somebody like the National Trust or the New South Wales heritage office or council stepping forward and then one night after being in the city and catching the ferry home late at night I it was torrential rain i do remember going into the barn just to check that everything was ok and being ankle deep in water and it was about midnight and i just made a i made a promise to the building at that point that i would do whatever it took to protect it and restore it and that in fact it wasn 't somebody else 's problem it was our problem and it was about time we all got together and did something about it so that was really for me the turning point in about the year 2000 to start doing something about it wider community in full knowledge that in identifying its risk that we were putting ourselves in danger because when you identify the amount of damage and risk to the property you make it very you make it more vulnerable and in fact developers formed us at that time and I really have to give credit and thanks to this to the New South Wales scout association for trusting me to bring it home because at any time they could have sold it and gotten rid of it and made a lot of money on it because even at its worst it was worth millions but they didn 't they they trusted me to bring it home and it took it took five years of fundraising to bring it home so it was there was blood in the water down at mosman Bay when we announced the true condition of the site and as the deeper into the investigative works we went the greater the problem became because it was in the geotechnical reports that we realized that the slope behind the building was was as high risk as thredbo and off the site of the premises and it really had to come to that in order to bring it forward so after that it was just a journey of lobbying the Prime Minister engaging Tony Abbott and Jillian Skinner who did a lot of good for us during that time and really just interacting with the community and running and hosting fundraising events to bring it forward I had a I had a lot of opposition in fact I had a lot of people criticize my actions in trying to do this restoration project because I was seriously out of my league I was told on several several occasions because I don 't come from a an architectural background under an engineering background which is probably a good thing because ignorance is bliss and when you don 't know what you 're faced with and you really you 're unaware of the risk you just you just jump in because you know it 's the right thing so for me it was all about passion and you know a lot of people said that we should give it up that if the scouting movement couldn 't fund it then they should be made to give it up but what you 're saying when you say that is that youth and development and heritage in this country one cannot prop up the other that in fact if you allow that to happen you 're sending a very clear message that you don 't value either so it was about valuing both and and moving forward so and you know having said that about that little bit of criticism overwhelming community support I made friends on that project that I consider to be family now and you know and I would have been lost without them because there were moments when in the process of discovery we realized that the the work on the slope from behind the building for example was going to cost seven hundred and forty eight thousand dollars that there are times when it felt like the air was sucked out of the room you know where was that money going to come from where was that help going to come from but you know having committed to were very hard times during the course of that in the beginning I persuaded everyone that I could bring this home in a year and very quickly I realized that that wasn 't going to happen so was really for me about the personal commitment to bringing it home and when you really commit to something that is as problematic as that restoration project was you have to accept that it 's a process of pacing yourself of knowing that you will have small victories along the way but ultimately it 's committing to whatever it takes to bring it home not to a time frame because you cannot predict how the public will respond you cannot predict how the scope of works will progress if there is help where that help will come from because really it 's about on a day-to-day basis just inching forward day by day it 's important to acknowledge the contribution of muslin councils through this process from the very beginning they are on board for this project the fact that we have a conservation management plan in place is thanks to Muslim Council contributed 20,000 to that and also 5,000 to the investigative works at that time I was funding myself and but more importantly the staff came on board planning and development and heritage gave countless hours of consultation to me personally and support through the process of this long restoration you know I can imagine even after donor fatigue setting the council staff was still engaged and still concerned and still could see what I could see that this was worth bringing home this is the last official photograph commissioned by mosman Council prior to the demolition of the barn in 1925 and it 's the actual photograph that caused the public outcry to save the bone it spurred the local Scout Group first mossman into action and they launched an appeal titled save the oldest building for the oldest troop and raised the 443 pound that was required to purchase the building from mossman council and begin the restoration project even way back then you know they they were looking for a new clubhouse it just seemed to be such a terrible waste and I think a lot of the and dances here in the 1930s 40s and 50s so it was I think it was that grassroots movement that actually did save the building from demolition well yes we were very fortunate enough in our project to come across the author eleanor Whitcomb Eleanor Whitcomb wrote the first was commissioned to write the first piece of children 's literature in this country specifically designed for Australian children the prime minister of the day ben chifley had had was a little grand little tired of all the fairies and goblins of English literature and he wanted something that reflected the early colonial beginnings of this country so he commissioned Eleanor to write a play or something that would encapsulate those early humble beginnings and Eleanor wrote pirates at the barn Smuggler 's be where it has a shared-use actually the bond Scouts meet once a week and we hold various events on weekends but it also is home to a number of local community groups we have ballet children 's ballet Dutch school on a friday ladies Pilates yoga the mosman evening college runs salsa dancing classes here and it well bones that used to be at the front of the building they were authenticated by a member of the Australian Museum they 're actually the jaw bones of a humpback whale that they believe was harvested in this local area and during the restoration project about 1927-28 the scouts erected them and they sort of arched over the front doorway and many of the local residents remember them from that period and time and certainly some of the paintings from that era show them in the actual painting so one of the projects would like to do in the future is to somehow restore them with fiberglass or something they 're protective coating and put them back on the outside of the building again but I think if you celebrate the greatest challenge for the barn in the restoration was choosing a period in time to restore it to when you when you decide that colleen lock on i said i think that 's a really big decision you know i guess for me i 'll have to dedicate it to the movement because it 's here because of dedicate it to the movement of that time so that hence the be prepared and the promise and whatever so when kids come here they get a sense of place _"

    "text": "thank you very much Phil and thank you very much all of you for coming out tonight and in doing so showing your concern and interest in the state of public life in Australia but that 's really what 's driven lead to write this book and the election campaign last year which i had a marginal role in i think is a very good starting point for the concerns that i think we all had about the state of public life in this country i started gathering material for this book before we won government in 2007 so it 's been a long time in the making the reason I couldn 't write the book as a minister apart from 19 and time was the obvious point that it would have been discounted as player complaining about the umpire if I hadn 't produced something this kind while I still a serving politician but he gets a really important theme at something I feel very passionate strongly about the sense that I feel like the world that I signed up to be part of literally 20 years ago in when I have a blue got the opportunity to understand for preselection for the Labour Party for the seat of Melbourne I feel like that world has almost disappeared and been supplanted by a very different world a much more infantile childish and less serious world that I think is a travesty of governing a serious more in the country and we all need to be concerned about that last year 's election campaign is a good starting point because I think there is widespread concern about spin about robotic politicians avoiding answering serious questions scripts announcer balls that infamous knew now that I discovered a few years ago we used to get asked literally the Prime Minister 's Office can bring up every now and then inside you only announced aboard something the Sunday papers to which when my staff asked me this I would kind of curse and yell and say the finance minister it 's my job to stop an ounce of all because announcements by definition an hour a waste of money usually and typically don 't have much impact on the problem but the purpose beyond whinging about spending and politicians and to ask well why are these things happening a good technique for understanding any current phenomenon or indeed any historical phenomenon is to ask yourself the question why now if something is happening something different or discernible is occurring that you are interested in more concerned about wasn 't having now not ten years ago 100 years ago why did the french revolution happened in 1789 and not 62 and 89 that use a good way of getting to the heart no matter so asking myself why there seems happening now led me straight to the media the answer is that these things which politicians are widely derided by are essentially a set of defensive responses reactive responses to changes in the way the media treat politics in this country more and more two things are happening one the content of politics is treated as trivia to be portrayed through a lens of entertainment celebrity and miscellaneous nonsense for the general titillation and entertainment of people not to convey information or to stimulate serious public debate about important issues and secondly for similar manipulation through the media lens in order to make it an appealing product not necessarily to make it politically biased although there 's plenty of that but just to make it a marketable product that people will want to read listen to or watch and therefore will I be able to have advertising attached to it so increasingly politics more than ever before is reported as a sporting contest as entertainment and where the vast bulk of the focus is on the peculiarities and the behavior of the key individuals and little attention is actually paid to the content of what they are ostensibly arguing about and so more and more what passes for political commentary political reporting is in fact just a kind of giant never-ending soap opera about a range of individuals and the actual substance of what is supposedly in play should we have a response to climate change should it be an emissions trading scheme should it be attacks any lever that serious substance is more and more getting pushed to the side particularly in the commercial media and particularly obviously in the tabloid media no messenger there are a range of standard media responses to my critique and I 'll get to some of the examples of what I 'm talking about the second but the state of many responses are we 're just the messenger we just reported all the silly things that politicians do that is totally disingenuous because the media decide what the message is and this is something that I think 's really widely understood in the community is that if I as a politician decide to take a particular position to say something to motor particular cause I have only one way typically of getting that message through to a large audience and that is the mass media otherwise people do not know I exist unless I am a squid in there and I can afford to take ads out on TV and so forth only way that message is going to get through is through the media and a simple rhetorical question who decides what goes in the Sydney Morning Herald is it the politician who decides what goes on the six o 'clock channel 9 news politicians decide and that editors and producers and journalists and proprietors they actually determine what goes on and because those politicians desperately need that coverage they need coverage almost no matter what its content even if it makes them more silly they still need that coverage so people know they exist so guess what happens when the signals go out from those journalists and proprietors and editors and producers if you want coverage you have to put on a silly hat guess what they do but we all silly have icons have we had many times it 's just the way the game works and so the media in effect are determining the content of the message they are not a filter they are not just a dumb pipe that politicians feed content into a running and in the murders of the other to the general public they decide what the message is and because politicians need the media to be even remotely competitive to actually apply their trade then they ultimately captain to that situation now on a site a few examples just to illustrate this point and there are many few to Australia the first is the aftermath of the Queensland floods there was a great deal of media kuffel about the fact that Anna Bligh in a press conference cried and Julia Gillard didn 't pry Julia Gillard was marked down seriously Anna Bligh was marked up had a big recovery and in fact the Australian published an almost full page feature article saying that Anna Bligh had set a new world gold standard in disaster response for politician now was this about the rescue of people who trapped by the floods was it about the rebuilding and infrastructure that have been damaged was it about compensating families who lost was it about the rebuilding of Queensland 's economy coastal floods melvins about none of us thinks it was about the fact that she 'd set a new gold standard in political empathy by crying and clearly showing she cared now that is a classic illustration of how that kind of virtual reality world that the Australian politics is now conducted in has taken over without us realising and so the things that actually matter like how our community things become secondary and the political game the theatre becomes the primary point of interest and we don 't sort of notice it but and the end result is that we have big decisions being influenced by the cries or who doesn 't cry not by whether they do their jobs will now when my dentist is filling my teeth I don 't care if he feels my pain I want to make sure I don 't have any pain I 'm not his emotional state is of no interest whatsoever on the old-fashioned but I have the same view about leadership politics actually what leaders who make good decisions they 're going to be serious intermittently I really don 't care very much about their emotional state well the trouble is that the way of politics have now conducted that is inverted a second example slightly closer to home you may recall what Barnaby Joyce was shadow Finance Minister for a brief period early last year people by the way was one of five shadow finance ministers or i fronted up against ny1 parliamentary turbines finance booster which I had five different shadow ministers in one term I 'm open to being corrected on that yeah we were doing Q&A and aren 't be an i and our respective advisors and all sorts of other people were in the green room at the ABC but off mode before hand and the a journalist from Fairfax who was doing a profile of Barnaby for the good weekend magazine which many of you would know and read approach my media advisor and told her I only found out about some time afterwards told her out wit I 'm doing this big profile of them gossip etc as you expect and notre g battle office and fairly predictable things and then she said very loyally why don 't you do a profile of lindsay and the answer was lindsay 's to normal now when i heard it a lot sure whether to be insulted it was kind of like thanks but those three words really tell you one we need to know about the modern media 's attitude politics and this is from fairfax the allegedly serious conveyor of sort of strong words the message is put on a freak show if you want to get coverage that sure explains Barnaby Joyce by the way but nonetheless that 's that 's what it says there 's a good illustration of how these dynamics now actually work in practice and I had to go away and think of ways to be less normal which is challenging have another example you may recall when Kim Beazley hospital the Labour leadership one of the seminal events in beforehand was a press conference he did where he commiserated with a popular entertainer on the loss of his partner who recently died and unfortunately he called this popular entertainer karl rove who was blushes guru rather than road with malice which was his correct name and of course everybody left on in the North assassins was it showed how ever touching was away nobody asked the question why the hell was he talking about private McManus and Belinda remet in the first place right neither off we had anything to do with Australian politics or with the sort of issues associated the future of the country what were in the news and in order this is no criticism kindersley offers to it in order to try and insert himself into the news frame then it makes sense for him to say something about this particular news worthy of anything that 's got absolutely nothing to do with Australian politics the future of the country the government etc and more and more that 's what politicians do they go to sporting events and try and become commentators they do no I didn 't go on The Footy Show they go on are you smarter than a 5th grader again watch usually I put on a trail of the 22 on talking about my generation they danced a Mac arena on carrying Kennelly and subtle discuss up they do that to be where the publicity is so in a sense they 're kind of giving up and so will the serious stuff that we deal with nobody 's interested in reporting much these days so if we want to know anybody know they actually exist we 've actually got to go out to where the cameras are and if to put on a fisherman circle now the final example on a site is a little bit more serious just to illustrate the spectrum of things and how literally the desperate search for content that is marketable that is appealable everybody involves literally outright gross character except assassination totally unfair calendar or genuinely decent individuals who are doing nothing I wouldn 't seem to serve their political party in their country do a good job Senator Nick sherry goodnight a mind very good minister somebody who has developed serious expertise in particular areas and made a major contribution would be beyond some time last year lead article in this age section and I suspect probably in The Herald as well Minister guides with macquarie bank just before back guarantee decisions are made the minister nick cherry the story laid with innuendo laden with inferences basically saying well chakra a week before the government announces decisions on the two bank guarantee initiatives the assistant treasurer nick sharing dine with senior macquarie bank executives and by the way by pouring bank benefited a great deal from the bank guarantees aha something crooked article it fails point out a few things it fell point out that basically all financial institutions in varying degrees benefited from the bank guarantees it failed the point out that McSherry was not at the time nor subsequently a member of cabinet it fell to point out that the decisions on the bank guarantees were made by four people whom i was one and nick cherry found out about those decisions around that same time all the rest of you need as well at the rest of the country Nelson so you have no involvement in decisions we further point out that it is quite routine for senior economic ministers and indeed show ministers to have lunches dinners all kinds of contact with the heads and key figures in major financial institutions mage businesses just part of their job so here we have a newspaper in effect implying corrupt malpractice corrupt behavior by a minister who I regard as pretty much the real McCoy in terms of integrity and dedication of his job absolutely no evidence and ignoring clear evidence to suggest this is complete nonsense now that 's 've just sended in the age in the last couple of days where there 's an agricultural company that got some government funding that has got three former members of parliament involved in it one of them has been out of parliament for ten years the other permit let out of parliament for four years and there is no evidence at all of any kind of wrongdoing but the mere fact that they come involved in this company which has received some government grant along with I suspect numerous other companies that is a justification for a front-page article laden with innuendo of wrongdoing and misbehavior so that kind of stuff ultimately breeds extreme cynicism and it is basically unfair but apparently it sells newspapers now before I get too carried away with my own discussed with the media I think it is important to point to qualification and that is that innocence the key players in the media are also reacting and responding to external pressures just as politicians in the way they 're behaving are reacting to Lydia pressures and media intern are reacting to commercial pressures particularly pressure on Frida where to agree so what is happening is that the lead way that they used to have to be vaguely principled and high tone and serious has just got squeezed more and more and that that is a key explanation and I sort of started get over my anchor on this front and get a bit more philosophical about it a while ago when I had a chat with the guy who 's the head of using the current affairs at channel 9 who when I was sort of having a go at him about the quality of the current affair which used to be serious TV program which is now a formulaic recycling of about six standard stories of the lieutenant from hell we even bureaucratic and local council with American view of cancer the new weight loss treatment etc no doubt those of you to repent current fear will recognize the genre I was having a go at him about all this and he responded by saying well every time we put a politician on a Current Affair 100,000 people change the channel and I stuff I kind of hmm that 's right channel nine 's commercial organization exists advertising which in turn is connected to the number of people watch the shows hmm good point a simple illustration of another line reality but what we 're dealing with here is a problem there is not just politicians not just the media but also reflects wider patterns in the society technology and I think of complacency in our community that is a reflection of 20 years of no serious recessions and a period of time and unemployment has been very low so there 's a whole lot of things coming together here so I think it is important to exercise I am NOT in the sort of blame business here on try to explain and illuminate now I shouldn 't i 'm delighted but i 'm kind of what you what the correct herb is but correctly adjective rather but I 'm interested to see that the news limited organization in the UK has done the best to in recent times to kind of underline the merit of my thesis because there is a common I performed about Australian importance in media and the events in the UK that is this what I have grown up with and I 'm sure many of the people here tonight have grown up with in our minds as a sense of newspapers and people in the news business as somehow having a higher calling a sense of public interest and a mystique of if not objectivity at least seriousness that frankly is increasingly an antiquated notion that reflects the world the person we never existed that certainly no longer exists what we are now dealing with is a group with commercial enterprises that are in the business of manufacturing and retailing appealing content and if that appealing content is gathered legally well if it happens to bear some passing resemblance to the truth or if it can be presented without totally destroying people 's lives or Syria ously hurting understanding that 's a happy accident that 's nice but don 't let those things get in the way of a cutthroat commercial business but I think that is ultimately the core message here is that we are dealing business and they will cut corners in whatever way is necessary in order to manufacture and retail that appealing content if that means massively distorting it if it means taking something and somebody said out of context turning on its head and making it mean the opposite because that 's more appealing Soviet and that happens of all time now I 'll conclude just by quick references to the media reaction to my book which has been someone interesting one of the things that 's been clear is that people who are in the business of criticizing others aren 't very good at coping with being criticized to put it mildly politicians are used to intense scrutiny and criticism all the time that 's as it should be that 's good God some of the media reactions are being quite entertaining it began with articles by San maiden in the news limited tabloids which very cleverly extracted a couple of references to some key figures in fact clearly what happened was as I predicted in the introduction of the book she skimmed through the book looking for key phrases like out of context turn them on the head and turned them into criticisms of Kevin and Julie when in fact they were in a sense innocent bystanders in content that was critical of the media so that the whole meaning of these references is changed in order to be able to present articles with headings like Tanner savages colleagues or Tanner savages give our etc now fortunately I predicted in the introduction book this is precisely what recur so this caused a certain amount of mirth and various quarters including some journals we had people in the Australian criticizing me for not attacking my colleagues enough right all this stuff about the millions big party but really why don 't you still like the government so another worked or who cares if the media is massively distorting or trivializing Australian politics that 's not the issue we want the dirt given drug we had one columnist suggesting that the reason I left politics was because of the fact that I was protesting about Kevin Rudd 's decision to abandon the carbon pollution reductions game now he didn 't point out probably the first person in the history of Australian politics to resign in protest at something and not tell anybody was protesting about could quite work that running up there were various interesting things there were references to my appearance the school I went to my performances finance minister my life after politics all of which of course are entirely irrelevant to the merits of my book to the to the argument bull them probably interesting with something i don 't know but they 've got nothing to do with whether or not i right or wrong in what I 'm saying and that was the really interesting thing of course was that nobody yet has seriously confronted the core argument said no this is not true you 've got it all wrong there 's been a little bit of well not at all politicians fault or you know we 're just the messenger like on the stuff that none of these actually said well no this is rubbish and here 's why what you 're saying is not correct and the the final sort of thing that really attracted penberthy who used to edit the Daily Telegraph said that actually I was the problem it 's not familiar I was the problem that I was against fun and fifty going on 75 my immediate response was I had to God Rupert Murdoch 's not reading this because he probably regard his sense of fun as being somewhat of a threat are you given that he 's almost well that 's that I don 't turn in a he and somehow or other the proposition being put by Kenneth E is that in fact well but of course the the role of political reporting is to make fun of politicians and to turn them all in a bit of a joke why what else is there so to me the message from that was that the this sense of drift away from serious political content as something that is fundamental to a functioning democracy is now so extreme that you have serious and pretty soon to journalists who actually sort of don 't even get get the argument it 's called what are you talking about of course of course about Julia Gillard shoes or whatever and that 's the key thing that 's the key thing is that where we are heading if this trend continues is a world where the question of who governs Australia and what policies govern our lives is going to be determined on such fundamental questions is what Tony Abbott looks like in speedos or who cried after the Queen 's names right that 's not a world that I want to have it but that is where we are gradually heat thank you very much looks like I 'm not firing questions Tillman front of the book because here you think the recent scandal involving the New York family and I think doing to hopefully involve the whole of the Empire do you think that the examination on this if there is a writ ever use a proper examination will cause the media in general to mend their ways and improve the behavior look it 's an interesting dynamic because this is happening in the UK here so all these things are happening in a separate country but is in separate country that influential still in our cultural patterns I suppose I think there 's clearly going to be substantial wider fallout from these events and although I don 't owe a great deal about it I expect that the inquiries that are emerging in the UK will be serious and will have an effect the UK has I think the best and the worst meteor in the world it is astonishing the array of things there and some of their tabloid media just has to be seen to be believed it is like frankly with a half-decent competition authority they be prosecuted for calling themselves newspapers because but nonetheless by the site look I think it will have a significant effect of ripple effect because it 's turning the focus on the media 's behavior and so they have been able to get away with for many years this kind of nonsense about we 're just the messenger we are above criticism and all we do is report things have you ever noticed that you 've always gung ho in favor of freedom and information their eyes gung-ho in favor of things favor of disclosure or 11 out of it because they want more content took nothing to do with the public interest it 's because what they 're saying is we want more stuff but we can turn it into articles on page three that might help you sell a few more copies and we 'd a few more advertisers but nothing to do with high moral ground principles if they parade in these clothes off great responsibility and always be office nonsense they are businesses selling products so I think the great benefit irrespective of the specific issue is there in play which obviously will take some from the player the great benefit of this is turning the focus globally onto the behavior of media organizations it 's sorry i 'll try make sure on even haley alcohol you know that your hood off and rescue and october ethanol thank you sorry yeah what was the trigger for you that aren 't even that you 're so passionate about the state of our country well unfortunately that 's very kind of you but unfortunately the reason I gave is one some dubious characters but in my case it was true it 's family reasons I 'm you know I 'm in a position like quite a lot of other people in the society but not that many people in the political world of having two teenaged kids from a previous marriage and two little girls from my current marriage and I 've been in Parliament for nearly 18 years and it takes a top and you get to a point where particularly if you 've been married three times like I have where how that too many more risks that 's that was the reason I do in meeting the book and not embarrass them is that the stuff i described in the book made it easier to live so you know I 'm in a sense of creature of the 1980s when right across the political spectrum Australian politics was dominated by big arguments big players big contests about serious issues and that 's my kind of natural habitat and in some respects where politics has got to something I feel like I don 't really belong anymore so reason world take one from the right have to get the hard question to repeat worried that they 're becoming too left-wing on economic issues but Joe hockey 's out there machine Bates and all that kind of stuff if you can 't have the shadow treasurer from the Conservative Party as the upholder of conservative economic orthodoxy who will watch right sorry I 'm being foot look the on the personal responsibility front and you 're leading politicians do have a role players and I 'm certainly not trying to say look let politicians off the wall they 're just innocent victims of always they but you should also group them all together either some better than others and partly why I 'm hoping with my efforts is that in a small way that will just need all the way of people in politics and in the media and be a sort of a reminder sitting up in the shoulder saying well before you put on that funny hat and go on MasterChef or whatever you know remember that his people watching you think this is ridiculous or journalist of 22 since from a politician dress it up turn it on its head and make it learn the opposite or Daily Telegraph before you run a big thing about julia gillard shoes and how many how much carbon emissions are embedded in those shoes there 's actually people out there laughing at you and thinking you 're a joke and you do that kind of stuff so yes politicians do have a responsibility on the wider personal responsibility front that there 's an interesting crossover between the two political traditions here so although if you look back over say a hundred years or so then that that kind of personal responsibility which is is really married to a in a sense of more collective or tribal sense of society has and a hierarchical sense of society has had a tone in Liberal Party and the Labour Party 's tended to be an individual rights for a party but on economic issues it 's been the reverse so it 's actually quite murky those bad new things and so part of my message then was to say you know when poor Creed we didn 't and it 's not central to Labour 's values on certain themes certain issues the right to the individual are important but we are not a party that places individualism above all other things and hence personal responsibilities got an important sort of role to play in our configuration thing so the classic example of this where is this argument they use the nation euthanasia debate where you know I felt that this notion of United just saying we 're all pure individuals and therefore they can make have freedom to do whatever we like is is a misconceived kind of idea that has to be limited by other considerations sorry I 'll stop because it 's 1 over 2 going way off topic to the back I just step 3 by night with the current weight of the Opposition I 've sort of particular away from the Liberals are the Howard and then came back to the month they had Nelson and turnbull just question is how do you see the current leader of the Opposition going next couple of years and clingy I 'll be a long journey I 'm pretty that nicely there that the crest may become a bit more serious and actually start asking in the hard questions and find out of that East look at I think there is in part because they 'll get bored and again the they need novelty and so labor in poor polling position is a pretty boring story after about six months you know so they need something new to happen and one of the you know you mentioned brendan nelson is a good example of one of the things that I think is a complete joke in 10 years literally in 10 years we have had eight federal leaders of the Opposition in this country now the only thing that automatically creates a change of leader of the Opposition course is a federal election sorry a change of government that 's happened what 's in that time we 've had eight complete is the opposition why does that happen because by and large most the title is the opposition are up against it and most of the time they 're not going because the lady are so desperate to report anything other than issues this whole sporting contest thing means that leader of the Opposition who 's not traveling well immediately put under siege the inevitable array of dissidents in their party or people who want to knock them off and replace them they in effect collaborate with the media to intensify that seeds next thing you know their polling numbers go down and the end result inevitable and brendan nelson to me is the classic example now I wasn 't a huge fan of Brendan 's what I think he 's all that great but he never had a chance like they 've been turfed out of office after 12 years of they had an incumbent government that was literally less than a year old very popular and with a very popular leader and it hadn 't at that point made serious mistakes and so Brendan Nelson 's polling badly well guess what you know what anybody would have yet what happens he 's under siege you know all the usual palava goes on mixing no he 's not gone that to look I don 't want to give you my views on Tony Abbott but anyway they are not fit for company but your point I think valid that there is every possibility of the wheel turning because I 've gotta write about something new there 's got to be something something different and the slightest fear produces that oh look I 've got you to comment on two issues one opinion polls I think their affection I mean how can someone bring out 1,200 people then come outside the country 's swinging on your position whatever or the Prime Minister 's I 've sent their rubbish number two I think that politicians about get back to old values and find ways to go out and talk to people and ditch the video but all these press they 're all in your part in the minister 's offices and so on that have just come straight out from University let 's say that the old part sorry game would be on the opinion polls there 's in a sense two different kinds of holes holes on issues which are complete manipulation of the content of the question and typically they last things like would you be prepared to pay higher taxes to get better government services and amazingly typically about two-thirds of the country say yes to that the problem is that a big slab of them are actually reading a different question that says should somebody else pay lower taxes so I get that helmet amazingly enough they answer yes to that question so opinion polls and issues are complete rubbish and a lot of them are paid for my interest groups peddling a particular cause and they 're literally just used for they just follow up to get in the papers and so you know two-thirds of people with children in childcare would take their kids out of care if the price went up you know a dollar a month or whatever opinion polls on voting intention not totally rubbish but you 're right that they need to be heavily discounted they do overtime give you some sense of trend you know so the factor like it will be foolish to deny that the popularity of the current and you 've had an extended period time where the following is very bad but the key thing is not to get hung up individual pause the things that really matter Reserve is a trend over time that 's that 's when you can actually draw some conclusion pramod your second point about people getting out about I agree with that absolutely and it 's something that I always tried to do as much as I could but the physical limitations are obvious and the so it 's a partial antidote to the problem but the reality is that you know you can only communicate with millions of people through the media and one of the factors he play here is that in the old days they used to be a range of institutions in our society like churches union service clubs non-government organizations that had a very close and powerful leak with huge numbers of people and they acted also as political intermediaries so what it meant was that if you 're an individual voter you might be getting a certain message from the media that you 'd also we work hard or that you 're dealing with all the time the role of those organizations has shrunk dramatically that 's meant that there 's a vacuum that it 's more more filled by the media that 's just a reality secondly last question Lindsey you 've talked to note about all the noise on the surface that we will see just with your 18 years in government beneath that sits the bureaucracy and the wheels of government and policy development how do you compare that to 18 years ago compared to now with all the distractions that again but one of the interesting things that I worked out in government and I was frankly had no view on this when I we can I don 't know strong preconceptions is that certainly in the department I represented the quality in the public sir was sensation like the hours that are worked the notion that you 're dealing here with fat cats and budges is ludicrously particularly in the sort of two or three months before the budget but for a lot of the year some of the bureaucrats they 're instances are people working through the night and just they let their guts it and they are very very skilled committed people by and large inevitably you 'll get the odd hopeless one and so that 's any groups going to be like that but I was very pleasantly surprised at just the top quality in people they wrote really well there was a rare brief that I got on any you shouldn 't any more than a couple of pages though really that the stuff though is specifically in charge or maybe you vacuumed so I think that 's one very positive message I can convey tonight is that certainly the federal level ferb and certainly the key potential departments the people you 're dealing with there are committed and got very strong values and very skilled and able people and one thing I 'm very conscious of now is the great merit of having a public service that he 's kept at arm 's length from the political process so that my former department he D and what there 's now hit a defense he was department head john howard and the interesting thing was that after we won Nick mentioned it was then finance minister rang me up to congratulate me and said by the way I hope you keep Ian what these are fantastic top-class public servant and I said look at won 't willingly my decision but you know let 's see what happens I agree with Nick mentioned in what is a fantastic top class servant and Australia I think is very fortunate but certainly at the federal level in those big central departments we have got a group of really top class public service and I don 't get that the recognition they open the wider public domain that they deserve and yes sometimes they make mistakes you sometimes are examples of individual departments and public servants doing the wrong thing by and large we are very well suited what is your view of international rating agencies yeah the there are essentially three major international rating agent raisings agencies Moody 's Standard Poor 's and Fitch by Moody 's and Standard Poor 's tend to be a bit more substantial bigger there is kind of no solution to and that is who foots the bill so if you 're issuing a security so you 're in effect asking people to invest their money and their trust in you and you then high ratings agency to give that a rating there is an obvious kind of tension there because the person who 's been rated is actually paying the agency to the rating that is a concern but equally if you ask the person particularly smaller investor to foot the bill when you 're potentially going to get other distortions as well so there is a current or problem here to which there is no solution I think the ratings agencies got caught up in one of those kind of popular moves that takes over from time to time in the US and it happens in this area in other countries where it takes a brave person to push back and go against the tide so every time you get a bubble every time you get one of these huge asset price booms and money 's flowing freely it takes real courage my self-interest but this is mad and I 'm going to try for a stop to it that 's one only does so that 's why so few people do because the momentum of what 's happening is so powerful and the pressure to just go along with it and this applies to regulators politicians media commentators the pressure to go along with it is overwhelming because maybe notice you can kind of look at those things in so-called there 's a there 's disaster waiting to happen here but people for example been saying that about the level of house prices in Australia now for the best part of a decade you know the economist 's kept writing all this stuff about you know our housing markets massively other values and there 's going to be a crashing whatever they 've been doing that for six or seven years hasn 't happened so the natural human instinct is just to go with the flow I think it 's too early to say whether the ratings agencies who picked up their game and there is a there is a serious in life and this is a whole separate discussion but in my kind of list of major criminals in the criminals in the inverted commas in the global financial crisis they 're fairly well down at least they deserve a mention but they 're they 're not the primary cause by any means they were probably contributors up to but certainly I 'd caution people against focusing too much on the ratings agencies and so what he 's the real culprit so they 're not going to a conference they didn 't help they they probably deserve a bit of the blame but there are other players _"

or a you think most faculty if they coming from narrow I quite look forward to going to New Guinea because I didn 't think anything could be quite as bad as narrow but I came here when I was 17 to train for two years in Muslim as a teacher the only time I 've been here before was to go to the zoo but not my orphaned by tram and of course that was almost as bigger than the venture to a ten year old was going from you getting us to a lady yeah and it was Trent and about moral to every way that was a tram as a heart a kazoo obviously the beach well the biggest highlight was just being amongst people of your own age from all over Australia who were in one place training together to gather somewhere very exotic and in Muslim getting increasingly excited about this wonderful journey a very splendid place and you used tell me more did you vote Neely are knowing Cremorne which I now doesn 't qualify me the universe have to come back tomorrow and then it goes muscle play a big role in your life as well you mentioned I even remember moderate boarding house overly well they used to slap some of us in the ER when we arrived from the country until we were that was probably after my time whatever the times are fairly cheap boarding else okay four pounds five a week bed and dinner find your own lunch I 've always just a few years apart when you was very different well the main difference was there were it was not a co-educational school there were no for two things that I always remember that there were no girls and there were no our teachers girls you can only see in the class and it 's a terrific article now and have absolutely fantastic art teachers but for some reason they didn 't think of this it wasn glad to say that really make you even more of them welcome all the really annoying thing is that I condition that I can at least go to the library and look at books about our but I had to make a choice of either doing that or or doing sport which is really boring because I really love to do sports I wanted to drop algebra because I can 't still understand where else refutes in the world and I 'm very very much better for me to have done sport well I left Mossman I got a especially exemption to leave school when I was four and a half to go to art school because that 's really all I was have a very good at and all I ever wanted to do and you you you have a special love obviously at middle half you 've painted mental health what what is it about Muslim that makes it so special for you look oh but you know I 've had the opportunity to travel extensively around the world this year would travel a lot we 're in I have never found a place to live that is as complete as possible and one of my fondest memories was the Mosman CCC was the Mosman children 's Cinema Club and have grown on a Saturday morning from 9 o 'clock till about 00 and we used to see a future movie every third week was a Shirley Temple movie and we you just have a special Saturday morning when they put on 20 cartoons unbelief Donald Duck Mickey Mouse the Tom and Jerry and every time you intended there you 've got a stand when you got 10 stamps you 've got a batch and you know we 're running around with these babies and thought we were absolutely fantastic but it gave us an appreciation of what the movies was all about the theater manager was Ken somebody or he was noticed uncle Ken but and halftime or irritable they put on a show where Marikina must be aware that famous for an RS Club is now oh my god you know the fighters lost when our result but it was there absolutely wonderful but is one build up a great friendship amongst all the kids here it was unbelievable on one particular Sunday I think also gone Winslow or John now John Wayne movie we got this issue with army helmets and you couldn 't drag those off our heads book was work we 've put them on one day and we thought we were the big shots I would have been just after the war and we prayed with this thing we had makeshift are made out of broom handles or bits of you know pineapple boxwood and we might stall out to middle head the black led us through and we stood on on get middle head and we started throwing rocks in we reckoned we absolutely blew up twenty submarines food now I still remember that down with greater throw Mossberg cheered by everyone but you know drying up in Mossman in the forties was absolutely fantastic I 'll always cherish it and I have some of you can remember those they 're wonderful columns you _"

far in certain short movements route long very events the first column person on doing it you might think I 'll be used or people would go like why I have always been receiving massive amount of information originally from official sources like australian bureau of statistics that more recently from all of the private providers of survey information and over till it 's also this information used famous names news television reporting saturated with their special radio television program devoted to it to worldwide phenomena you turn on the television set and hotel the US Europe or Asia is

or s TS Eliot said brother more eloquently where is the life we 've lost of living where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge where is the knowledge where you 're posting information control first one I think the letter to pre-clear another reason why we should question the value of frequent information that is that it subject to a distortion understand mountain policy this is the need to be able to tell a story as the wild movement in an economic bit of curve even if it is a very shortly every day Australia changes be told by chance I won cause right or even and went up by beauties do we

precursor oil business farmers who always do it looks like a spike lee movie although in many places and paypal you something possibly investors that the Chinese you simply percent so we right now I turn the question of whether more frequent information inaudible has become better decision makers a particular where the remains of better or worse message Magnus 's regulation some depression told me that elastic clients so they 've spent the most time tracking daily loons and therefore worse for those physical so yes I mean sound human it has been sent from a lot of experimental research that most people exhibit loss aversion then they experience more unhappiness of illusionary dollars then they gain happiness from a more approximate cost us according to get so the more on there and aware of the loss if the stock market rises by six percent per annum that us evidence is a reasonable return argue and should not be ignored by happiest but given the variability of daily movements on athletes about 40 is the sock line for fifty-three percent it will rise and since we experienced so much more unhappiness to the falls the average from the rise result and therefore I 've got Jacqueline series and we 've reviewed back upon a mother Isis there will be a small losses to the last of guys so we 'll protect what this shows is that more free information axis is happening but it does not necessarily mean we become words the bestest in behavioral violence conducted by experimental psychologists that showed that most women information also makes us Felicity Festus this is because we tend to suffer from I over here which or subscribers reading too much in a very short and loss aversion yell or subscriber and this research concluded that quote investments we 've got the most frequent feedback that 's the most information properly risk and the stern of this money and it 's in very serious research economist like many usually don 't like being elected by cyclists but the two who conducted this research can and diversity with the only to economist ever lunabelle of promise for advice received at least experiments done with real people who really I 'll give a brief example of how that work in the experiment the subjects are able to invest into asset classes one whose roommate will increase which has a higher average return a lot more of the others were bombs which is the lower return the investors in the exponent who receive daily information avoid their losses by buying more bombs and the Cyclades and those who received to avoid the sauces a similar mining results the subjects are only over this agrees those who receive daily information I reply to act on it over track the result of increasing transaction costs blowers their return so I mean we can conclude that too much information or authoring Lee to frequent receipt of the same information reducing recipients happiness and leaves them to make inferior and better decisions that brings me

current for the set of companies that that sounds better for the ones below the ocean 's made and I enjoyed your dress and I like to ask a question about the government structure of the central bank of australia like when we were company that was started by the Senate making you can make of England and contemporary corporate governments would sign it useful to roll cheering and the CEO you independent Jim executive managing director what 's the government structure at the Reserve Bank our suspect that the government is both the changes to take you and would you still say that that 's the right model a ton of this account even tried it must have been the pension lord of the UK certainly the top 100 in here and to what extent does a supplemental questions footage to what extent is the main course by the opposite on the first time everything if you have logs and shareholders as normals campaign and then share how is pulling parable about themselves within the framework of a top ten anesthesia I think people would want to do is sleep I wasn 't_''_1765.64 all that work by side with Reserve x1 which is Israel yo so I drew the top of a distant company on the other hand if it 's not listed companies anyone general smooth rocks are the other issue of the influence of the government reserve where for most of the post-war period in Australia monetary policy was sort of a picnic without a camera and it was made as part of the process and this end effect of actually mean that it was preempted governments terrified with irrevocably and enterprise said doing tomm professional Realtors actually overwhelming gang in 1996 which but actually research was already in yet that the Reserve has new parents to conduct a proposal does have independence is do anything else everything else it doesn 't call price on the government but the actual decision monetary policy decision what nothing is done by preserving and treasures of my body and I just admire a he understood and in fact deep down the government 's deep down thank you that have never helped at all because much then they 'll go ability to the systems work so much services that response here one of the concerns you talked about boo boo family resource space but one of the concerns with a federal structure Australia is that we are potentially facing situation when it got two or three CT economies and very limited tools at a federal level such as interest rate to be able to deal with the pressures of different speeds difficulty across the country do you share a concern that maybe we will face a somewhat a bottling or a trainer coming out of line where yes the resources boom may be driving success for some months Australia but we don 't have the tools to a natal the whole country to be able to respond and adapt as to what is a pressure that he can 't respond well all countries have fastest favorite regions in the u.s. is no reason why California Mississippi River going right ever on while Canada 's there are passionate love you is inevitable not just in the Federation like Australia Canada and us believe in a unity actually fragile of you can that peaceful be growing fast and others nothing balancing pose you know the one month of our country it 's possible devised Alyssa go the other sites there are currency which I can do I because so if the situation needs regressing has 200 district policy Australia has addressed this over the decades we have a system of pistol polarization so the poor pass the country didn 't be share of the tax revenues of the rich part of the country and I think we have this about as well mr. can be handled but there was nothing it very business is not a lot more to be done although i think i 've decided buggy if we have an amorphous form of taxing the a conference the mineral producers that would repeal i think thatís basanta politically economically nice allowances to do it he knew petroleum production resource friend extract the politics was that we had something which is that would help but of see don 't I perish to say that the child is well inform our a good would you take our budget of the other things is inserted is Greece not protecting their particular agency does yeah well my Greece 's of class exam what lots of goods so it 's worth looking out for that reason but I can financial markets approach them every breeze it 's a target price is Sun and the fact that their lives in the newspapers for about three miles non-stop but it is about us it 's a nice phone Oh hiya mister policy people in Greece that pay taxes and you make the government to provide all the services so massive budget deficit and borrowing of the deficit and if they ever had to borrow in track a little bit up to do but because I borrowed Europe in running these huge budget deficits which name of the new situation where is how I am other than default but local restructuring it would but incest all simple things in truth bad things happen to be countries we common why happens coming presumable the target of brisket kiribati selfish as a journalism take you back to me the original speech those amazing 31 those changes the I 'm a little psychology that easy because China we are as a nation probably every node results portal we do on my parchment two characters of the art or do you see any other recent relations to regular onyx that 's sidewalk capitals no I don 't think so because of every case the viewers with their core than us I think the basic power cord is what I say pretty please with lesser things work really well be that at least you know even dream of course events happening but we have a very good ill depressed over there and that 's what I thought about now this is one cycle as well as an outside the anxieties that the average Australian is actually quite economical iterative ball Sanders they do all this awesome stuff about better deficits and engine train the people of solvent and I decided that probably actually had to defend in the media and the pimp can understand why you can and so again that we exit of the diff fiscal policy in the OECD we years of service we legitimately financial processes and ready to do according the budget we can prevent into service again in trees and is just unbelievably group compared to emotionally any other OECD the other have no way of disloyalty yes but when we look at the the countries it is the priesthoods did you carry with us germany they perform on this cause i don 't grow a monetary policy is not sufficient respected are you can turn to now that we were actually able to take some tough decisions a lot more easy than european countries for the analysis means timing it 's not the frequency of Culpeper fact that there is a lot of discussion every small ever then makes immediately do have quite an accomplishment population and that is my little easier regardless of both X Y Z technologies in one in anything is likely to be is the long-term effect on the standard of living of Australian people of embracing foreign ownership of arable land results another day I thought our superannuation we are every owners of equities around and all sunny leone 's of infrastructure ports airports roads things like that so my inclination is to say that it will come out the wash they buy some of us up we buy some and it folks we don 't buy the roster oh brother and I think you know I had to say that this has she looked at that I think we will focus on people that this sort of internationalization of the ownership of absorptions probably n is everyone at what point so we become deliriously happy in rosslyn pinky ban vs the Financial Review The Economist allows resort use of any modification well I think what I 'm saying economic analysis to you I like what I like you get is making too much about daily movements of weekly movements in various in their self is that hasn 't proved your art out of this full moon _"

    "text": "rats they come with an unsavory reputation often thought of as disease-carrying city-dwelling vermin indeed Sydney has four species of rat but what you might be surprised to learn is that two of those species aren 't vermin at all their native and they 're very important to Sydney 's ecology there 's the black rat or ship rat there 's the brown rat or sewer rat but then there 's also the recall E or water rat and last but not least the Bogle or Bush rat let 's have a look at the differences so that you know how to help out the good guys and make life just that little bit harder for the bad guys I 'm catching up with peter banks who is an associate professor and dr. gronic Larry who is a postdoctoral researcher here at the University of Sydney hi guys now you 've done extensive research on rats on Sydney can you share some of your knowledge with us today yeah Peter maybe you could start by telling us about the most familiar face the black rat yeah the black rat is world they originated in India spread across to Europe and then came to Australia probably with the first fleet you 're also called the ship rat and so they probably have been here as long as as European settlement yeah they 're associated with human settlements they get into the bush occasionally you know the places everything much worse they 're very distinctive rat they 're not always black no does that they take okay it 's like that one no you 're not that 's right what makes of what how you can tell is their long tail yes longer than the body yeah it 's quite like it Yeah right I 've got be years yeah a long sleek body but they can be sort of a gray color they can be a porn color as well okay and they live in around humans so what do they eat every thank ya like like a lot of invasive speed hear anything so okay real Jam garbage they scavenge le insects plant seeds Bungie gia small vertebrates go climb trees after Birds schemes everything really that the wrapkin get good climbers yeah very less right that 's really what makes them quite distinct in here oval in the Sydney environment at least they climb trees that 's why they 've got the long tail for the violence but I 'll climb up into trees and rape birds nests they 'll get into hollows after bats as well so microbots here that 's right so that 's really a behavioral characteristic makes indistinct it sounds like they 've had quite an impact on Sydney 's ecology we suspect so yeah because elsewhere in the world there during the 100 worst in bossier pieces they 've had impacts on birds particularly on the islands yeah and that 's what we think they 're doing here possibly one reason why we don 't see quite as many birds is because of predation by black rats on nest but they also carry the lungworm yes Witcher it has a life cycle which goes through snails and then through the rat so that the infected rat there 's a poo who now comes across that poo encounters the lungworm goes into the snail than like somebody falling out yeah okay nail for example it can potentially die yeah Chuck small children are at risk as well dogs are react so the black route carries is lungworm which is not a good thing for australia 's a lot of life no not at all so it 's safe to say that the black rat is the body and our story if you like they 're no good for the environment no good for a native animals and certainly no good for the human population what about the brown rat you see a baddie too yeah definitely it also came on ships now about the same time as the black back probably but it 's a really it 's a dangerous species in terms of its impact on wildlife around the world yes its associated with human it 's also called the sewer rat of the Norway rat in Australia really seems to be associated with humans and hasn 't gotten into the bush so much around us just a couple of spots they 're also generalists they 'll also eat anything but what 's different size of a big rafter yet and okay quite a greater access yeah they actually aggressive towards black rats as well but for some reason which we don 't really understand they haven 't really gotten into the Australian bush all that much which is a good thing because for example in New Zealand all the South Pacific a lot of species are at risk because there 's a predation by brown rats mm-hmm so we 've got two bad guys in our story the black rat and the brown rat kronia Peter there 's got to be some good guys in this story guys tell me about the native water rat yeah well the native water route is one of a whole range of species native species of rats we have in Australia in fact rats makeup native rats make up 25 in about native mammal fauna the water rat is the largest of the rats it 's a semi-aquatic rat it 's probably about three of three or four times the size and just sort of classic black rat yeah very distinctive in Ben jet black in color that ok wait is white yeah you 'll see people will see it it 's active during the daytime it runs along the shore edge around sydney harbour at least when the tide goes out yeah charging for things that it can scavenge on it forges on again it is anything yeah but it does go into the sea and foraging they 're looking for um marine invertebrates that it can forage on and brings them back to the shore to eat yeah it 's a good guy because it probably attacks black rats yeah where you 've got a big rat and a small rat the beer everything went okay that they don 't like to live together cozily yeah it 's a good guy because it probably does chase away black or black rats which is a good thing you 'll see water rats around sydney lots of places anywhere on the beaches that are they in freshwater sometimes yeah they 're actually more typical in freshwater okay in the middle of incentives for Cyril off the coast that 's where you find them but around sydney you water right yeah be there and it 's a behavior that we 're looking for when we want to identify a water rat they need a foot prints actually yeah that 's the thing you like because they go into the sea and forage there if you go on a walk along a beach and you see these funny-looking prints mm-hm they 're quite distinctive because I 've got webbed feet yeah because they feel the same niche as an author so they 're right yeah they 're doing the same sort of thing as and also does in Europe for example we don 't have authors we 've got water adds yeah so they 're doing the same sort of thing and they leave you very distinctive footprints that people might see all that white tip to the tip hell yeah okay long whiskers and an orange belly they 're lovely lovely lovely lovely rights of you and they 're living in harmony with our native flora and fauna yeah ik the cobalt so it 's quite whatever predation they do when you see this is quite okay because if the brown rat and the black rat are Abadis then surely this beautiful water rat is going to be our hero there 's another brush out there another good guy we haven 't talked about the bush read the bush rathi not found in Sydney unfortunately and we did he was here but he 's no locally extinct around the bush land of the harbor but you do find him in Korean guy and Gehrig all in the Royal and in Lane Cove so he 's all around the area just absent from the harbor Bush nice right yeah I 'm he 's a good guy because he 's a wealthy is a native species he 's also generous yeah also preying upon a whole range of different things distinctly different look yes yes what characterized is a tail that 's shorter than the body yes I tell ya I 've gotta work around it knows yes as well that they 're less ratty-looking yeah the cuter they like either of course they happen there 's their brownie color sometimes I 've got a bit of a white Billy a black rat they don 't climb which means that birds nests safe a safe from them that they don 't carry lungworm they carry a different species which seems not to be dangerous to wildlife so that 's a that 's a Gary and they 're good to have around because quite possibly they will fight off black rat yeah we 've done some research that shows that when two species generally don 't like to coexist that means they don 't like to live together and the black the bush rats can certainly hold their own if they can give me an advantage yeah so in many places where the black crowd hasn 't been able to invade it 's probably been cause they 're a bush past there yeah how do we know if we 've got a bush rat in our backyard is there a behavior that we 're looking at you don 't have to meet you back yard okay black rats yeah right i like to live in backyard so much higher like Russ okay if they 're not out during the day that live around wit where he lived up yeah even the bush it 's all trash so people won 't are unlikely to have something their backyards they can or what I want to see everything no I never say never but they it 's unlikely that there there it 'll be different because they won 't show those same behaviors of climbing yeah it won 't have the big long tail one has a big long ears but they won 't be climbing up the moving people 's so we know that being responsible for our rubbish for reducing it not leaving it around is a great way of discouraging those pesky introduced rats but we want to help the good guys what can a Sydneysider like myself do to give these native rats a chance well if you live on the sort of northern part of Sydney I need a bush keeping your cabin yeah going to do is probably the best scene so that doesn 't go wandering in the bush but yeah those these native rates are going to be vulnerable to ya around the harbor again vulnerable yeah the pets as well there 's no Bush right there yet but keeping your cat in again it 's really going to be probably the main thing that people can do so these rats these native rats live in the bush yeah within people 's houses so just stopping your animals getting into the bushes yeah the best thing that people can do grown yo Peter thank you so much for sharing your knowledge on sydney 's rats and helping us understand what kind of impact they have on our environment and our native wildlife _"

Esplanade just facing the bell mobile pavilion and either just park wasn 't over straight if you Italian families coming down there but it wasn 't treated as the holy squad as it is now I 'm quite astounded I mean sometimes I have gone down there to drive and driven a lot of the astronaut round up at six o 'clock in the morning and it 's that 's as busy as anything the only shops were there were little shops static sandwiches was a post office we had down there and most of the shops used to sell hot water because people used to brew up their own tea and that was that was a way it was people were much more frugal there and they did much more things to themselves I think in our street I 'm probably the only person who still knows he 's our Lord in nature strip you have the dog wash people coming around eyeshadow to think what next service as we might we might get the streets in the morning at seven o 'clock i clogged up with trades but fans so that 's the way bastards got over the over were the blow ins a lot of the people the original had people who built their houses were there and they were some quite a few were veterans in the First World War our next door neighbor was a major who rated man I think he went in as a as a corporal and he was promoted in the field and given a commission actually he 's mentioned incest means history of the this mystery vers carried on and where did actually mystery was dying about 78 mph and the recently and that was one of the last lynx you know the he was one of the last to go from that the first people because these were all about in a water street where were the houses will build around about 1920 26 after it was a mall originally and quarrying around there because all the sandstone for for the local big houses and properly for city as well recorded we are very fortunate we live right on the edge of one of these old quarries which gives us a very elevated position and we took right over to our impossible exchange and as I 've said before we we now treat mossman as a village we don 't have to go so far afield love most of our shopping can be done here mosman a neutral bay and I think as you get older you don 't feel like you want to move around so much and also we find that our interests lie within losman as i 've previously said both myself and breeder are very involved in a local community with the community services and with this gallery that we 're sitting in now and we were with his gutters in section 10 years ago and we helped februari through the opening nights and we enjoy you know it 's actually you get a cyclic benefit from bigger sort of a local identity we 're very lucky 2001 breeding myself and made jointly citizens of the year so we feel with part of mossman and it 's funny that oath in a born in England but mosman is the place I 've lived most of the most of my life even though I didn 't come of mosman I think it 's a matter of the facilities that are provided for the people unfortunately i 'm in a rotary in other organizations and it 's very very hard to get young people into more interested to involve themselves because quite rightly making a living and teaming at the you know bread on the table is not easy these days so and the other thing as well is that mosman itself does not present any much in the way of employment opportunities and so most people have to go into the city or work elsewhere or travel elsewhere and these days the hours are much longer and when the time they get out of their room they 're not that 's it they 've done their dash they want to sit down and take it easy but I think all these facilities have always been there it 's just a matter of making people aware of them and to use them now one of the things with this art gallery is it 's been here but there 's a tremendous amount of people but if you talked even know it 's there one of my initiatives was I got this short street change to art gallery way because we wanted to get the awareness for the gallery but people like that and they 're so self preoccupied with themselves they have to be that they don 't they don 't avail themselves of the facilities but they 've always been there I mean just around the corner from us there 's a mosman Tennis Club and it 's well over a hundred years old now now that is have always been a very very social sort of enterprise but they are finding it hard to get members one time I mean you know if you wanted to go along there you 'd have to be great it would be a very very good player because before they take me there you know that 's they still want you to be you know capable with this the the what you have to do is gone down so all social things change and a custom with with these or everyone homes theaters all these things and the thing is not to remove its chain and _"

David McClane distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen as I said as an old mossman boy it 's a privilege and an honor to join you today the rededication but what is an important memorial to mossman 's contribution for this nation 's pursuit day with some about 3,000 of our sailors soldiers airmen and women putting their lives on the line on the other side of the world in places like Afghanistan and the Middle East I was surprised to find that over 17,000 Australian men and women for example have fought in Iraq it 's something that we sometimes tend to forget as we go about our normal business in our relatively short history history Australians have fought and died in no fewer than twelve wars with our first conflict being a dispatch of some two and a half thousand men to fight against the Maori uprisings in New Zealand in 1860 thankfully our wars with those across the ditch today are confined to the rugby field and the cricket pitch we can only wish that that might be the case for all conflicts since the Mallory was including the Great War which the original memorial of the site recognized Australians have fought in the Sudan the Boer War the Boxer Rebellion in China in addition to the Second World War we have fought in Korea Malaya Indonesia Vietnam the Gulf Iraq and the Solomons Australians were also amongst the very first group of United Nations peacekeepers to Indonesia in 1947 and since then we have deployed on close to 100 United Nations missions overseas from about relatively small population Australians have always answered the call but I know that one of the original inscriptions on this Memorial behind me is they harken the rallying cry for freedom said in the language of the day in a constant search for peace over 100,000 Australians have died defending freedom and a quarter of a million of us but being wounded with many lamed for life how many of those have come from this wonderful harborside suburb of mossman adding to mossman 's proud history from the time of the borage a halt and the camera angle people and other tribes to more recent history when her majesty 's ships serious the flagship of the first fleet was Kareem here in mosman bay where wailing once flourished a mossman hosted her own first defence establishments in 1801 with a battery of cannon being established at George 's head as Graham mentioned I grew up the leafy Balmoral side and I 'm all enough to remember the submarines gentlemen being based at HMAS penguin as well as the old trams that used to run down to Sam Herefords spit bars where Marie Rose is the train throughout our 200 years plus of recent history Muslim citizens people like nobody who spoke here two years ago and who flew and flew more than 30 bombing missions over Europe earning the Distinguished Flying Cross in the process and many hundreds like him and willingly answered the numerous calls to fight for their country sadly too many have their names etched in gold in this memorial behind me over 1200 mosman I 'd sporting will or one and some 200 of them never returned in researching a background to the rededication of this fine memorial I came across an article written by Kate Crawford of the mosman daily it was at the time the australian author peter fitzsimons threw his support behind this project and Kate interviewed Michael Crosby another mosman boy and a past president of the mossman ourselves one who fought in Vietnam and I 'll she wrote mr. Crosby was only 20 in 1966 when he volunteered to serve with the Australian Army in Vietnam he was spurred on by an older man who declared it would be one of the greatest experiences of your life instead what mr. Crosby found was hell on earth including days lying in red mud and caught in ambushes and I was struck by the similarities of my own experience with that particular war when I left the water street for the Royal Military College it was where the boys own an annual expectation of adventure but the day I arrived at NUI death is a very young platoon commander in the 6th battalion I was told that my best mate had been killed in a ferocious ambush that a before the route reality of war struck home it is a dirty brutal ugly business that said yes there is a wonderful Colorado the best and most enduring friendships are forged in adversity Rome kills one of the many who worked tirelessly on this beer memorial I haven 't seen Graham for years but having served together we can I are not alone amongst the great majority of those who have seen the brutality of war at close quarters who conclude the hard way but there has to be a better way Australian servicemen and women have rightly gained great respect amongst both our allies and our enemies in all the wars that we fought I can only speak from my own experience in Vietnam where I know that Australians were perhaps most feared by the North Vietnamese and local guerrilla forces that is a tribute particularly to the professionalism of the private soldier it is the soldiers and the NCOs who make the Australian Army what it is today and I know the same can be said for the Navy and the Air Force and the supporting services well led Australians can achieve almost anything and they are the equal of any sailor soldier a man or woman in the world looking back on my own 37 years experience in service in the military I can say that I learn most from the soldiers and NCOs with whom I served soldiers and NCOs like those who have acquitted Great War to Vietnam and are now serving with equal distinction in Afghanistan and other theaters today is not a day for political statements but the occasion should nevertheless cause us to reflect on the supreme sacrifice but so many Muslim citizens and over 100,000 other Australians have made in the search for peace a few years ago in 2006 on the 40th anniversary of the Vietnam battle of Long Tan a 60 minutes program showed two of the long tan veterans lieutenant David seven and Sergeant Bob Buick revisiting the long tan rubber plantation the program concluded with seven and Buick walking off arm-in-arm with their former enemies who had fought them at Long Tan laughing and joking together that is as it should be but it gives a poignant underscore to the futility of war for me also years ago they sought to kill each other at the first opportunity it would have seemed impossible back then but today former enemies can share a bar b bar together a popular Vietnamese be yeah and reflect but as the former enemies in Vietnam might reflect together in friendship today for peace amongst humankind appears more elusive than ever it seems equally impossible that we might ever at some time in the future sit down and share understanding with those who oppose the West today the differences are once again it seems too great to start although I can remember the domino theory and those who thought he unified Vietnam wash usher in a communism that would sweep all before it and back then the differences seemed equally great equally stock with humankind 's differences in ideology being highlighted by leaders in various countries thousands of young men and women are once again paying with their lives in Iraq and in Afghanistan and now as Iran gets closer to a nuclear weapon each side is fervently of the view that theirs is the one true part in recent years leaders of various persuasions have increasingly expressed their faith in God Allah or Yahweh convinced that they are guided to war by a higher authority and with God Allah or Yahweh on their side they will prevail and win ironically all three of the great monotheistic faiths traith trace their roots and the same the single source of the Abrahamic tradition today the Israeli Palestine conflict is seemingly more intractable than ever following the decision by the United Nations in 1947 to partition Palestine the Israeli Prime Minister David ben-gurion declared the independence of the State of Israel on the fourteenth of May nineteen forty eight and a day later the Arabic armies invaded that conflict is now entering its eighth decade we have failed to grasp that to defeat an urban guerilla or terrorist insurgency we must deal with the cause and negotiation lot war should be the first resort as long as the cause remains the jungle or urban guerilla or terrorists will melt back into the shadows to strike again where humanity least expects it and so often it is the local population as we 've seen so tragically in recent years in Lebanon and northern Israel for example who suffer most in a conflict but you do not win hearts and minds by rocketing innocent Israeli civilians in northern Israeli towns or by destroying Palestinian schools hospitals and roads and villages in the Gaza as a soldier insurgency in Vietnam unless you address the underlying cause you cannot defeat an urban insurgency or terrorist insurgency by taking it head-on you will we could weaken it but you will never defeat it and in the case of the israeli-palestinian conflict it is the innocent Israelis Lebanese and Palestinians especially the women and children who will suffer most and in many cases their lives will never recover today 's wars are increasingly driven by religion but those who are quick to engage in conflict confident that their God is on their particular side might also reflect that a person 's religion is largely a result of birthplace and culture by design or accident there is more than one part unless we who remain philos who 've given their lives on so many in so many countless battles on the seas in the air and on the land we must all work not towards tolerance but towards acceptance of different cultures and different faiths today more than ever as we remember those who fought so gallantly in the search for peace and especially those who paid the ultimate price in 60 minute images of former enemies walking off arm in arm together laughing and joking their seemingly intractable differences resolved like their sets successes today those who fought and died that we might enjoy freedom had no say in their country 's decision to wage war they simply did their duty but I suspect that if any of them were here today to acknowledge our heartfelt admiration and quite inadequate thanks they might suggest that today we as a species need to move to water greater respect for human life and human dignity humankind suffers a deep and permanent loss every time we go to war and we as a species continuously fail to heed the lessons of war in a sense we who remain fail those who fought and died we fought and died from the mud holes of the psalm to the deserts of Tobruk to the rugged terrain of the 38th parallel in Korea to the stinking jungles of Vietnam and now to the icy wastes of the Hindu Kush war should be a lost rather than as it increasingly is today the first resort will the cap young long tan and our Afghanistan have been hard one and it behaves we who remain to reflect reflect on them for they are just a few of our most bloodiest of battles battles that have been fought in the finest traditions of the Australian Navy Army and Air Force the raw range and spirit of those young men and women whose names are etched on this memorial are also etched in our military history and we will be forever grateful Thank you Thank You agent they shall grow not old as we then a left grow old age shall not weary them nor the years condemn that they 're going down of the Sun and in the morning we will remember them and my money receipt ah party wait Oh you _"

    "text": "Thank You councillor comer and thank you all for your very warm welcome it 's wonderful to be here with you all miss Maris 's past and present of our neighboring capsules as well as not sman so many wonderful counselors have served their communities that i would say perhaps everyone in this hall for serve their communities with great love care and distinction not always noted but certainly it 's why these areas in which we live are so harmonious and wonderful so distinguished there 's so many friends it 's truly a great pleasure to join you all today as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of International Women 's Day and I too would like to pay my deep respect to the traditional custodians of this land upon which we gather indeed all Australia 's indigenous people who have nurtured our great continent for tens of thousands of years and the last function that I attended this afternoon was a reception at Government House for some of the aboriginal young boys from Redfern unglued and the police who are working together to keep them fit running at six the sorts of things that make them feel good about themselves and not needing to Eddington mich mischief and into the more courts or being bored and as you heard an interest of mine was juvenile justice is to make sure we could return those children to our communities because we need them as I say often our greatest resource in this country beyond the minerals are our children we need every single one of them to take our country nation to even higher levels them prison well it 's very uplifting to see the continuing expansion of interest and support which International Women 's Day is receiving in Australia and of course a gathering such as this reminds us how far Australian women women of modern Australia and I mean it not indigenous but in the last 20 years indigenous has have of well have achieved in that short period of 223 years including the right of suffrage across Australia which began as early as 1900 and two just after Federation automatically we didn 't have to chain ourselves defenses or go to prison as some of our dear didn 't give women the vote uncle 1919 and of course South Australia had lived away by having the vote in for women in 1896 South Australia and New Zealand were the forerunners but a day such as this also makes us pause to sink without just patting ourselves on the back about our sisters across the earth women who may be struggling to survive in appalling or terrifying circumstance as women with aspirations to achieve their dreams and for whom it might be impossible and so what is happening also in Australia is so many of our women and institutions are reaching out to women in developing countries to assist them of course now we can see across our own landscape women taking leading roles in government the judiciary academia the arts science that 's where it thrills me to see an Australian woman Nobel Prize and the incredible cutting edge research that 's going on across our nation and of course sports Commerce and Industry and they are leading or have led the nation the state 's Parliament territories and the political parties so it 's certainly been been born enough in the rural area in the southwest riverina are not just deriving these visions through my own wonderful extended family which was full of strong women I will observe the powerful very powerful wonderful influence and strength which comes from women helping women and that transcends age class color religion and educational levels and again you see it across our country towns across the nation we 're not indigenous women are helping indigenous women and families and the number of youngsters because of this and it 's very often you don 't hear the good news are gaining entrance to very good schools and going on to university graduating in medicine and now engineering too there 's something called engineering aid which was started a few years ago by a group of engineers who moved on the upper North Shore that bring interested young people from remote areas across Australia including alice springs and tenant group down to workshops a two-week summer school in sydney and they 're hosted by one of the universities actually it began with newcastle university and you South Wales University of host next few it will be it will be University of Sydney so these young people are exposed to the great things that engineering can do and the enormous smooth that this nation and the we 'll have for engineers at the moment there 's an incredible our degree of encouragement to young women students so this fires their their interest and encouragement and they given scholarships and supported and mentoring so again these are some of the wonderful things that quietly if you want to put it under the heading of the women 's movement that are reaching reaching out across our land yes so we 're needed not only locally and nationally but also internationally because I finally discovered what it is that makes us dragon women and Australian people generally so popular around the world I went to meet as I will in three weeks time after the swearing in of the next government my tube your friends in Germany we meet somewhere I cheer for two weeks and we 've just like and just like you 'd be if you were in Grom Grom or Sydney or for a few days see Simone young by the way they are another Rothstein so these two did German girl Prince said to me when they we just love Australians and I said why unless I said you know in a non-committal well I knew you we 're not different to other people I suggest you are and I said well what is it that had you so laid back I said no well I said Australians really a terribly serious what is it you mean and they said the way you talk to people Australians never talk down they never make you feel uncomfortable they 're approachable and what they say you feel you can believe those are you talking about communication they said yes the expression on their face their friendliness it doesn 't matter where you are this is the so it 's the way Australians communicate which is very interesting its body language as well as verbal language which is so important and something as subtle of that builds bridges for us well years so women above all are endowed with that quality are they not the this is extraordinary where international women 's day was initiated it was initiated by the Socialist Party of the United States almost done with years ago it began as an idea in 1909 and then it spread to Scandinavia and the Scandinavian women and women in other European countries marched to support the basic human rights of women so the Scandinavians and other European countries followed it within a year or two and then it was enshrined as an official day on March the 8th but that 's rather an interesting little fact and the power of women acting in solidarity was dramatically demonstrated in Russia in 1917 following the appalling statistics of 2 million Russian soldiers dead in the war so the women chose to strike you know because they were all workers strike on International Women 's Day marching for bread and cookies so again the power of women was in four days desire at abdicated a provisional government was appointed and subsequently the women were then given the right to vote and of course in more recent years the United Nations Charter is held by the mobilizing public opinion an international action as well as mobilizing support for and delivering it to disadvantaged groups and despite the substantial gains that women have made the main beneficiary still have been women in prosperous countries like Australia so that it is a very overwhelming sort you know when I go to graduation ceremonies and kindergartens all over our state and I 'd see their wonderful wonderful games that our youngsters are made the opposite side to that is the sadness I feel when I think of the millions of youngsters who will be a being denied very basic access to education literacy and so forth and of course who live with violence and lack of subsistence only yesterday at a function of parliament house to do with Caritas day the group that there were so since charitable support into very difficult and often extreme communities in Africa and the rest of the world and there was a representative from the Congo an African man and I was absolutely staggered and distressed to learn that the number of rapes per month amounted to the thousands you know in just terrible situation that that is going on within a day 's flying from here so unifem Australia is to undertake a very significant role in assisting many women in those countries to move towards and gained human basic human rights and political empowerment and equality and of course the terrible thing is poverty there 's still so much for us to do because statistics state that 1.3 billion people in the world live in poverty and that seventy percent of these are women so that means they 're hungry too and their children are hungry and you you know some of the refugees we 've taken him from places like the Sudan and Somalia I some have been women with little children and I know some of the teachers our our teachers who teach English as a special language and who gives support to those women I 've talking about Ozzie women and as the trust builds up bit by bit some of the women have revealed their secret that these aren 't the children they were the children of their sister who were violently treated in the most extreme unbelievable and almost beyond being published they 're so terrible so education health freedom protection from violence are so many fundamentally essential things that Australia can spear here and suggested I talk to speak a little about my own pathway I was AB little child I supposed like and bought into a loving family but told from the very earliest days as a child in Miranda that I was to do things good views you can do medicine expensive noted studies you did what you were told my grandfather and his brother had been medical sterile doctors in fact graduates of the American University in Beirut and my father was a medical student there who came on a trip to Australia briefly in 1919 and measure Sydney family to whom it been given an introduction and fell in love with Victoria the gentle middle child and of course when we go home and finish medicine just wouldn 't bleed her he was romantic lovely man gentlemen and where we dicated so grandfather in sydney said he wasn 't handing victoria over his favorite child until there was a brick house him ends being menswear men 's business I 'm openly loving around on the morrow media river and so settle there and that 's where my mother went as a bride and where I was born many decades ago so I said to my sister has also adopted my two younger brothers recently do you think we had an ideal idyllic childhood you know sleeping on the lawn on the hot summer nights going out to watch the sunset you know no television you could hardly get the radio in fact it was so much static but they did say hopping chickens in the car and go and watch the sunset over the golf course that would and they looked at me as if I was crazy when I said do you think we had no I deal with child him let him yes come to think of it we did you know we had a big garden and so long as we behaved and did our lessons so then we came to Sydney to school before others to high school and you know doing medicine was sort of pre-ordained wondering what I do at night and I thought what could I do that would mean I always want to get up and be doing it the next day and the other thought I had was journalism you know getting the truth in that and the news to people but that 's what that might be too hard with medicine was would Pat speed not quite say complex so work hard passed the exams and then in those days they published the allocation of the hospital he would go to in the Sydney Morning Herald and much to my shock when I am open the newspaper on that faithful day I saw that I had been allocated to a teaching hospital and the one in those days that was very desirable because of the high level of training in surgery all the boys wanted that one and that was some Vincent 's Hospital but lo and behold they didn 't know they would accept many women in my here they would you know at least fifteen to twenty percent I was the only girl amongst a whole batch of boys so familiar so I rang up a made appointment to see the general superintendent and went over there you know in a decorous way and this is where faith all right into these as I arrived I looked up at the inscription over the door you know and this doesn 't have religious connotations at all but I studied Latin our honors as well as chemistry honors at school and I looked up and said Caritas Christy forgiveness the loving-kindness of Christ inspires us and being able to read that I said how can you now go in and have the audacity to say you wouldn 't want to work in a place of kindness and compassion so when feel shaking and the superintendent that were worried here for did you don 't start for another week you know and I said officer I 've just come to say how grateful I so it suited you not to jump to conclusions but my fears were right you can imagine at five o 'clock the boys in Russia for footy training and I 'd have lots of transfusions and groups to and and the nurses will now because of course I didn 't stay in the residence court as I stated with the nurses and the nineteen Sydney so a lot was very interesting because it was the nurses any nurses in this room yes superb human being it was the nurses who taught me good medicine now when the registrar 's would say put the needle in there for a spinal tap sister would say put it half an inch lower I 'm sure that it would work here free time so this is no less who are in this room know that they 're the ones that run the place and still do they like the teachers are the healers and the movers of our society and civilization but yes so doing medicine I were dead and i went into general practice and had three little children all together adding a wet out of western suburbs of Sydney which was gorgeous because you learn to listen to your patients and it 's your patients who teach you so much by with me and then I realized that those who properly they had plenty of tablets and medication that had been given to them by psychiatrists and others and then one day when the beautiful girl who used to do my hair had an if car accident thank God she would save because she was on tablets that have been prescribed I thought well there must be something at an alternate way to this so I then went to study psychiatry and and became a psychiatrist intending to go back to primary health care and general practice but at that my husband gave me an ultimatum like many husbands there you got a passive the minimum time I 'm sick of your working nights and we get so at the end of those three years when i got my postgraduate degree the government asked me to start a young adolescent unit a unit for young people so they weren 't being put into wards without occupations in days when there was psychosis and schizophrenia and not the good management that we know about today so that was an incredible experience because at that point it was lord mayor of sydney Opera House and also we had a very important visitor to Sydney called mr. promise love and mr. promise love was number five in the Soviet Union and very very influential in Russia we got a few more minutes because this is the funny story so mr. we had we had a day planned for him Saturday where we were going to take him by boat maritime services launched up the power under the Harbour Bridge first of all see the 18-foot sailing races on the harbour then go up under the Harbour Bridge and disembark at ride and taking to the Lord miss Cabot rosehill races so I was thrilled to bits that we could put our best foot forward for those who were regarded as you know communist not good people or what sort of me and the Russian ambassador and his wife came down and the Consul General said i should say soviet soviet so I was very thrilled and we got to the races and I took the ladies down I think I 've been to the races once in my life before but I took is God intervening again there 's only six horses in the race in the Lord misshapen one 's called Moscow now this is a word of honor now if that isn 't a message to back the horse so I bias all the girls tickets are either on Moscow and there 's mr. promise love with an entourage of the KGB every time he runs everything riding it down okay so the race starts and my heart 's thumping this is going to be wonderful for international right Moscow comes last all by now I had a migraine I could hardly sir and the KGB said this is a deliberate insult visitor come on we must go we must go and adjust around that time mr. Whitlam the Prime Minister had recognized Soviets sovereignty over the latvian lithuanian an estonian states right so every immigrant from Latvia is staying here and with you anywhere out at Rosehill with banners go home Russian murderous you know that I tell you I could handle it and Nixon mr. access to mr. promise love in those of you who know he needs a now come on you come down and help me give the cup come on and when they get down there all these people at the fence and the KGB people live it furious sewn it goes over the fence and it says don 't believe Russian murderous shady and it goes over and says thanks for spelling my name correct I makes it a usually real are you such a me where you know they put their things down to laugh I mean that 's the sort of incredible thing that is done so mr. promise love was laughing to you note all of this and he was obviously a good sport so on the way up apparent matter river he looked at that glorious place at concorde i don 't know if any of you know it that was built by thomas walker an immigrant from Louisiana Scotland who rose to become head of the Bank of New South Wales and took it from a small colonial bank into an international trading back in his lifetime and like all goods beautiful scottish people he his motto was work as can and give away as much as you can so he built this gorgeous place in superb architecture so that the poor people of sydney could come up even the roads were that would then but by boat a light of the boathouse there with an onion dome and go to be nursed back to health within those beautiful warts and henry lawson was one of the people who ended up there and who was nursed back to health so mr. promise love says to me madam oh and i 've never seen it before because you can 't see it from the red car surely a multi-millionaire lives in that it 's well it 's was 72 and i said with rape right oh man mr. Tomczyk we don 't have million is in our country today the sense of pride and he said well what is that I said I 've got no idea how I but I 'll find out but it can 't be enough so on the Monday I went up and trespassed and went in to find out what it was and I discovered the late eighteen hundreds 1894 the poor people of Sydney to be nursed back to health in its war and they were closing down and they were looking for another role for so that became the adolescent unit and it still is and so many youngsters have been returned from the edge of despair and suicide and attempted suicide and drug turned around there and become become teachers nurses doctors lawyers social workers also suspect so you see how faith effective now the news know that because Denise of the Wilton 's lovely husband was a psychiatrist in Chicago at the same time as I did and of course our concern always wore thwarts for our young people that they should be given second third and if necessary force chances to be it be healed a game and get on with life so that was a wonderful learning experience in so many ways but it just goes to show that any time you told not to like any particular group of people go after it so I i went to bore you anymore but that 's what took me to programs there too so we 've we build up these networks with people who may have been perhaps not the sort but with their ideology that would have suited our but you see how change has occurred and Australia 's been there as a stalwart doing good things that 's how to be so wonderful to serve some of the young people because our destiny is for that generation to go across the region asia-pacific region where there 's so much poverty especially for the women as I said and beyond to the world to well-heeled and help because Australians are good at that they communicate properly _"

    "text": "I if you 're watching this program you already have an interest in mosman perhaps as a new or long-term resident or someone considering living here you may be planning to build a new house or change an existing one mosman Council believes that everyone can benefit from knowing more about the area its history its people and its buildings this program aims to show why mossman 's distinctive built heritage is important and worth keeping surely the first thing that strikes visitors and residents alike is the setting mossman 's superb relationship with Sydney Harbour it 's eleven peninsulas projecting to the water like giant fingers of landscape embracing beautiful bays and coves the second is its dramatic topography with landforms that cascade down from the heights of Military Road and spit road to the waterfront and the myriad built features like these divided roads that link the different levels and run across ridges and valleys the third thing is mossman 's inheritance of handsome man made places such as urban streetscapes these views in military road from lays corner show one of them there is an amazing array tiny this is the lovely Balmoral park and this is reid park in a valley which incidentally forms another bit of muslims striking topography these old photographs show what it looked like long ago this miniature reserve is in brierley Street originally it was part of the Rangers estate one of the area 's most historic the house was demolished in 1912 for residential subdivision in the prosperous Federation period there are many public buildings new as well as old which clearly demonstrate community pride this one is mosman library but maybe the buildings that characterize mosman more than any others are it 's excellent houses there are large ones like this one in Prince Albert Street and the host of relatively modest dwellings like this one many were built by speculators who appreciated not only Muslims aesthetic virtues but it 's obvious and increasing real estate values as well there is a surprising range of entrancing details like this Victorian classical entrance feature in Balmoral carved in sandstone and modelled in terracotta this one which enlivens a small house in Orlando Avenue is designed with carefully contrived face brickwork influence there is a saying that buildings are documents embedded in time buildings portray history just as fluently as written records do the old whaling station is a well-known but now very rare example that has been saved from early times it 's a Georgian colonial memorial of mossman 's maritime origins a few houses from the prosperous Victorian period survive boronia was built in eighteen eighty five by James and John Keary whose firm made horse-drawn carriages boronia was later used for many years as mosman library it 's adjacent partner tilapia has not fared as well in the diverse period between the two great Wars architecture in Australia was greatly influenced by worldwide fashions this arts and crafts example is in clifton gardens old english or stockbrokers tudor was a traditional and patriotic style that obviously originated in britain which people still referred to as the old country or home spanish mission was a historic style that started not in spain but in colonial california and the warm southern states of the united states of america it was popularized in the very influential print media of the day this house was an exception it was built as the prize in a woman 's weekly lottery to raise funds for Red Cross as part of the war effort after the war effluence returned and soon the building industry burgeoned once more mosman continues as one of sydney 's most attractive areas architecture today includes some outstanding houses on spectacular sights especially of course those that can take advantage of splendid seascapes old and new building designs can exist comfortably together showing that with care and creativity mossman 's heritage is not a freeze frame but an evolving experience and what is heritage it is the things we want to keep because we believe they symbolize mossman in the next program we look at mossman 's federation past in the Federation period those 20 years or so before the First World War mosman grew phenomenally this is one of the hundreds of subdivision proposals that were being produced by then mostly by speculators to advertise the beauty and potential of the place in the 19th century the district had attracted a good deal of settlement as many of the early picture was taken from a house in Prince Albert Street streets like this were created to serve the houses that resulted and many of the streets were long and straight ignoring the topography in 1891 there were two hundred and eighty nine residences in mosman some of these later Victorian houses were large and built on ample allotments like this one in Stanley Street some were smaller like this quite elegant and well conserved matching detached pier in Raglan Street many houses were smaller still and there were some handsome Terrace type ensembles with a bit of cast-iron filigree embellishment as the new century opened Federation was a reality and Australia was prosperous at the height of this period mosman had become one of the most desirable places to live by 1911 there were 2687 dwellings a tenfold increase in 20 years this is another of the expansive residences that were built so as to capture the brilliant outlooks which their sighting offered but most were cottages modest in scale and design incidentally the term cottage is said to have come from cot which means a place to sleep with the most prevalent was what they called Queen Anne face brickwork had been the favourite English building material during the time of the 17th century Queen Anne it was revived in Britain in the 19th century and then introduced into America and came to Australia just about as popular with the Arts and Crafts style related to the artistic movement of that name in Britain in which high-quality hand workmanship and decoration were essential this is when timber shingles were favored as can be seen in these Gables the range of material is used in these styles made Federation architecture quite different from what had gone before as well as fine face brickwork made possible by new ways of making excellent bricks they were Marseille patterned terracotta roof tiles developed originally in France fretwork and turned timber decoration which you can see in this veranda our stat cast iron as the preeminent decorative material in this house as well as the paneled gable you can see the distinctive window sashes with the curved rail that became a Muslim feature modelled plaster was often employed to complement brick walling and fine modelled in low relief most residential designs were a symmetrical informal or what they called irregular or picturesque like this arts and crafts house in kesten Avenue some were more conservative occasionally with classical elements such as symmetry or traditional columns this example is in cross street designs by tellin dirt architects were particularly interesting this is an example of the work of edward jefferson jackson who was trained in england and built several fine houses in mosman that conjure up echoes of the English Arts and Crafts movement correo in carl 's road was one of several local houses designed before World War 1 by the australian-born architect Donnell discipline and here is a design quite unique to mossman it is the work of the slightly eccentric architect builder Alexander Stewart jolly it is located in livonia Street this was also the time when semi-detached peers of speculative dwellings replaced terrace houses this is one of the most distinctive piers located on the high side of redan Street incidentally the addition to the right-hand house has been subtly designed in holt avenue this pier was specifically contrived so as became a mosman speciality these modest twins at the east end of a rimba road are in themselves a very attractive queen anne pier but they also are part of this group which is one of the most unusual ensembles in the whole of mosman a distinctive arrangement of seven matching Queen Anne style peers as mossman 's population grew groups of speculative retail shops were also built this suite in military road now includes a bookshop but when the premises were first built the shop became the venue for an early mosman post office this suite also in Military Road was beautifully unified and symmetrical until sadly the occupancy at the street corner end at the left in this view was removed in about nineteen sixty and replaced by a very intrusive unit in this photo the demolisher has started work on the corner tower some Federation period shops are important not just for their individual quality but also as impressive landmark components of streetscapes this group shows what can be achieved by good conservation here a unified upper story has been added in sympathy with the original single-story conserved it 's a convincing demonstration that streetscape is for the enjoyment of people and that houses are a vital part of a streetscape here the houses though different in design are sympathetic to one another in scale in their common use of roof forms such as Gables visual harmony is a vital ingredient of a conservation area and talking about good conservation it is possible by skillful design to add a carport to a house that was built before the motorcar became dominant notice that the carport roof here is a curved cantilever one of the most frankly modern design forms it makes a striking but very complementary contrast with the house it 's important to remember that if the old is good and the new is compatible with it then the result will ensure the continuity of heritage significance next we will look at mosman between the wars the 1920s and 1930s were years of continuing progress characterized by the striking growth of the housing industry the increase in population meant not only more houses but also more retail establishments such as this group of typical interwar shops arts and crafts there were new churches or basically traditional in form but often making a feature of new materials and techniques such as these glazed terracotta or fans elements new meeting places such as the masonic center were also needed here is a satisfying streetscape composition which incorporates shops into its design there were also more school buildings this large interwar block at the high school is a handsome symmetrical and classical design more buildings for recreation were erected perhaps the best known of these are the ones at taronga Park this picture shows the reserve at Balmoral and the bathers pavilion designed in 1929 by mosman council 's own architect Alfred hail the wonderful diversity of house building styles included inventive uses of the old traditional material sandstone as can be seen in this lovely in the war house in Balmoral that other traditional material brick employed new varieties that were made possible by advanced manufacturing techniques in this building the bricks are geometrically striated while at this house in cardinia Road several different dark colors are combined to produce a variegated texture what follows is a quick in the interwar mosman the attractive arts and crafts tradition that had been so pervasive in the Federation period continued so strongly that it has become almost synonymous with mosman the crafts of brickwork cement rendering and carpentry and joinery were adroitly incorporated knowing about styles helps us to understand architecture arts and crafts usually featured informal massing as in these houses in ched 4th Street and the style was made distinctive by the handsome combination of brick roughcast render thorn shingles and finely crafted timber work the georgian idiom was revived as a reminiscence of conservative british or even early australian origins with smooth stucco walling and a touch of classical detailing the warm climate of the Mediterranean suggested forms such as gentle archers and shaded walls and lodges and window shutters evoking faint images of that part of the world the Spanish mission style is also riddle and of warm climate architecture such as was seen in the Spanish missions in california in the 19th century its tip ified by the rough textured walling occasionally perforated for ventilation by nobly roof tiles usually of a spanish form by and window grilles and classical touches and sometimes a little hint of Hollywood Old English is the name given to the style that calls forth memories of merry England by displaying such features as textured dark brickwork Tudor archers half timbering steep roofs tall chimneys and LED light glazing Art Deco was a quietly revolutionary interwar style characterized by assertive stepped forms sharp edges geometrical patterning and steel framed windows it 's interesting that so many mosman flats are Art Deco in design there is even a church in mosman displaying a most fetching combination of gothic and Art Deco forms not only in its exterior as shown here but in the interior design as well an interwar residential style that was adopted most enthusiastically in Australia was the California bungalow it started in Pasadena California wyd roofs and eaves and ample shady outdoor rooms so did not only the Australian climate but our increasingly informal way of life one of the so-called modern styles was based loosely on the idea that form follows function its favorite features were the prominent curve strip windows and roof concealing parapets this style that became known as the International style because towards the end of the interwar period it spread through America and Britain and Europe from where we Australians were getting most of our architectural ideas architects such as Joseph Foyle who designed this house for himself in 1930 led the way to the architecture of today as this period comes to a close I think it might be true to say that the full on international style has influenced present-day architecture more than any other so next we 'll look at today 's architecture Muslims built heritage comprises a multitude of fine houses both new and old small and large the different kinds of houses can often be seen together within a single field of vision functionalist in international styles ushered modern architecture into mossman often in designs by respected architects this house for instance was designed by Adrian Ashton but a great many modern buildings express their conservative or traditional origins like the Philip Morton Housing Commission flats which are one of only two such complexes in mosman Morton was a local state Member of Parliament these Ragland Street town living but in a garden courtyard context more recently still buildings such as this residence in cardinia Road display the traditional feature of the hipped roof in marked contrast many designers now employ new construction techniques such as reinforced concrete to exploit difficult sites often with dramatic and beautiful results so it 's quite clear that Muslims built heritage encompass as the whole range of architecture past and present one way of thinking about heritage is to ask the question that if all the buildings of mossman were to disappear except those that are listed as heritage items would those listed ones exemplify what we love about mossman 's character tomorrow 's heritage will have several aspects the first is the building stock that survives from the past we seek to identify the houses the dilla straight mouseman and cherish them and their natural settings as well the second aspect consists of the new houses of today just as for old buildings the community eventually will have to evaluate even houses like this decide whether they might be vital parts of the heritage of mosman the third aspect will be the old very often this will mean making an old building suitable for today 's use this for example shows a new attic story insert it into a queen anne-style house so carefully that it is almost indiscernible in this scene the new work echoes the older work that adjoins it without exact copying so that its newness is evident the fourth aspect of tomorrow 's heritage is what is called infill inserting a new house into an existing setting without compromising the character of the original here the original is triggered in Ragland Street an arts and crafts house designed by Jefferson Jackson we 're beside the old tree guide a modern residential structure has been built it was designed as a pavilion or separated component which reflects without copying the design of the original other examples of infill are these new semi-detached houses successfully inserted in a traditional streetscape the carports compliment the conservative design this is another example of a new car port designed so as to respect the character of an older house and be subservient to it the carport sit slightly on the site and the house one of the most significant qualities of an existing context is scale that is comparative size if the new insertion is too big it is likely to be out of scale and likely to dominate the smaller sizes of the buildings adjacent to it when a new building is built in an existing setting its scale is one of the most difficult things to manage in this streetscape the new house on the left is out of scale and overpowers the older residences which are its neighbors fences should be sympathetic in scale too they provide visual links between the houses and also form part of a streetscape offense should not dominate or obscure the street scene but should complement the architecture of the residences in conclusion this is the message of heritage as a community we must critically examine the wonderfully rich resource of mossman 's built heritage and determine which ones we want to keep and then take the appropriate steps to secure their future this applies alike to old houses and to the newer ones which with the contexts of streetscape and seascape to which of the work of architects builders and homeowners for more than 150 years and also because of the careful management of building regulations by the council that mosman has the character and beauty that we enjoy every day you you _"

    "text": "hello everybody can you hear me well thank you for inviting me to speak here today what i 'm going to talk about this evening is how you can help um doing digital voluntary work libraries archives and museums helping put create and enhance resources online particularly relating to australian history and i know several of you here have already been doing that and i 'm going to be talking about some of the projects i 've managed but also a few other things that libraries are doing which you might not be aware of so just to set the scene as you may know over the last five years or so libraries galleries museums and archives have been madly digitizing their resources so they 've digitised hundreds of millions of items already and made these available on the internet and when i looked at the figures for how many people in australia are actually on the internet two-thirds of australian households in december 2009 had access to broadband internet which is about 6 million households and their total population of australia is 22 million at the moment so that things this is a photo which i thought was rather funny actually it is australian it 's in south australia just outside morgan um obviously it 's really important for them to tell visitors that when they reach morgan there will be internet access so the world wide web has changed everything regarding information so prior to the web information was produced by large publishers and libraries generally bought this and then spent a lot of time handcrafting cataloging records to describe it and so information was very expensive to purchase and it was also centralized but after the advent of the world wide web the information could be produced by anybody it was now easy and people could discover it through hyperlinking and going directly into full text records they didn 't need to necessarily bother to look at the catalogue first so information has become cheap and distributed so today in the year 2010 technology has turned information discovery on its head because content can be created by anybody and content can be described by anybody and so a lot of people say to me as the librarian 's wrong with google and i have a very good answer to this um libraries are different to google and to amazon and to flickr and to all of those sites for four very important reasons uh libraries guaranteed to offer long-term preservation and access to their information we are not constrained by any commercial pressures at all i aim is i mean like if people say you know if you if we pay you to put an advertisement on your website will you we can top in your results we 're not going to turn around and go oh yes so for us the information is the most important thing um and we 're giving universal access to everybody so for us that 's all australians it doesn 't matter where you live or who you are or what you do we 're giving everybody access and we 're always going to be free so to sum it up libraries are always and forever and so yes we are still needed also as i said before we 've got all those millions of things we 've just digitized now you may not be clear of what that actually means what it means is in the world of the internet and web we 've given people things they can do to engage with each other and data in new ways so web 2.0 means things like your ability to write a book on amazon or to say how good you think somebody is on ebay to go into a user forum and talk to another user or to tell somebody how your day has been in your online blog or to go and show you photos of what you did at the weekend people you don 't know in facebook and and all of this you can find through hyperlinks on the web so those features have been enabled but what i really want to talk about tonight is the next step the much more important step so um a term crowdsourcing is one i have been using lately to try and describe this so using all those social interaction features at the moment most people use those just for their own individual use or purpose but if you ask are using the internet anywhere and everywhere to actually work together to achieve a goal and the goal is usually a really massive goal which seems to be unattainable and individually each person does a few things usually using some of those web 2.0 engagement features and the crowd is going to motivate each other and talk to each other online and they 're going to form a virtual community and that and then they 're going to achieve something absolutely totally amazing so this is crowdsourcing this is pulling together to do something really important so for example we gather together and we form an online encyclopedia wikipedia which everybody said was totally impossible but people have done it we gather together and we transcribe birth death and marriage notices so that they can become searchable online and help genealogists and people everywhere we record our local history we make out of copyright books electronically available we improve the quality of full text historic newspapers so these are things that have actually happened so what does this mean firstly what does it mean for libraries museums and archives so data and we need to still focus on making that data accessible and digitizing it so that the public can access it but we also have the technology to give people the tools to do these sorts of things in the way they want and i think that is crucial for libraries so it 's no longer about us holding the power over information we can now give people freedom so this is a quote that i really love because i think it really sums it up written by harriet rubin who is actually a publisher an american publisher and she said freedom is a bigger game than power power is about what you can control but freedom is about what you can unleash and as some of you know we have unleashed something fantastic with the newspapers which i will talk about a bit later so what does it mean for you as the public it means all of you everybody in this room can help anyone and everyone and everyone has the capacity and the ability to help out to do something truly amazing and what have you you have got fantastic enthusiasm and you 've got lots of time some of you um and even people who haven 't got time are still making time and you have got knowledge you 've got huge and vast knowledge about all sorts of things and those three things enable you to do some of the things that we need which is creating things describing things transcribing records and sharing information so uh you can help libraries to achieve things that we would never ever ever have the time or the resource to do ourselves but if we had thousands and millions of people helping us they become achievable and you can take items which we 've got or made available already and you can add value to them by improving them or adding your own knowledge or changing them slightly and also it 's giving you some responsibility over the creation of public cultural heritage items so there is an awful lot of stuff that 's out there in public domain that technically the public owned because it 's our cultural heritage and institutions like the national library are a greater role in um that so some people still say to me but why would you do it nobody 's gonna help and they do and i 've asked some of the people who have been helping on the newspapers what made them do it and these are some of the answers they gave the top one is i just love it it 's really interesting and it 's fun it 's a worthy cause in relation to newspapers it 's extremely addictive should come with a health warning um the knowledge that you 're helping with something that is really important like recording australian history or finding out new things that people never knew before more than half of the people helping actually want to do some voluntary work and they 're looking for something like this that they could do other people want to help non-profit making organizations they don 't want to feel taken advantage of so they specifically want to help libraries which always have very little money and a few staff so they feel this is a good cause also people almost always learn get better keyboard skills or you might learn stuff when you 're reading newspapers that you didn 't know um for some it 's like the mountain it 's just a massive challenge it 's there so they 're going to do it and other people want to give something back to the community and because a lot of these activities are based on trust some people say that the more trust you give to people the more likely they are to repay it so uh what i tell people is that you must never underestimate the power of a group of people getting together this is a quote i like that barack obama gave actually just before he got into office and he he understands he 's quite right about that but i think it 's we have even more power here because i 'm not just talking about the power of people getting together to do something or change something i 'm talking about the power of people getting together with libraries and archives who have this data to make something really amazing um now i don 't not going to be watching this little video some of you may have seen it already the video is called the machine is us or using us it 's a really interesting video which shows you some of the new things that are happening on the internet and how you can interact and relate with them it 's on your sheet i 've given everybody yeah everything i 'm going to say today is on the sheet so you don 't have to remember remember long um web addresses i 've put it on the sheet for you so yeah i 'd recommend having a little look at that when you 're on the internet so now i 'm going to go and talk about some of the projects that you can help with now the first one of course is the project i 've been working on for the last three years which is australian newspapers we have made australian newspapers from when they were first published 1803 available up until 1954. so far there are 17 million articles in the database and there will be 40 million by people have used australian newspapers oh good wow there 's still half of you that happened um so this service was released in august 2000 today very quietly i have to say as was saying to people earlier this is the first time i 've been out publicly speaking about it we haven 't run any public sessions on it and we 've done absolutely minimal marketing nevertheless we have a million people using the service at the moment so uh one of the things that makes the service really popular is one of the newspaper titles we 've digitized is the sydney morning herald and i can actually give you an update if you 're a user there are 3 500 missing issues from 1831 to 1954 and we have been in the national library of australia stacks the photo here where the hard copy look like this they 're enormous books and it 's taken us several months to find those missing issues in these books and have them scanned and in the next three months those will be progressively being made available so we 've made an microfilm uh which is what we 're doing for the other newspapers because the city and morning howard is so important and there are so many missing issues the reason for that is i can clearly blame it on journalists they went into the archive at the sydney morning herald and when they found when they wanted they took it so the archive is incomplete and therefore the microfilm had many missing issues on it at this point i would also like to sincerely thank a special person in the audience who 's sitting on the back row michael from pasco limited and michael pascoe has single-handedly digitized two million of the newspaper pages first two million that went in he works at a microfilm company in and we really thank him it 's been a really hard job and not a job many people wanted to take on and they have special expertise in this area and it 's been great so does that mean it doesn 't come from the existing microfilm those missing issues we 've had to go in the stacks they 've been doing the pasco 's actually have not done the missing three and a half hours and because they 've been digitizing the microfilm they have many of the master microfilms up there in storage um and these books are so big and heavy we 've had to get a scanner into the library we 've been trying to outsource everything but again we 've had to break the rule for this because they can 't easily be moved around or anything so we 've temporarily borrowed a scanner set it up in the library to scan those missing pages um and we 've had to change the workflows as well because the workflow was set up only to digitize in a certain way from microfilm so we really have gone out of our way here to try and get a complete stat because we understand the importance of it so when you access the australian newspapers database aside from the fantastic ability to do full text searching which is as far as many people get or all they want to do you can do three other things as well so when you a few seconds you 're searching across millions of articles in a few seconds so gone are the dies of having to go to your local library find the microfilm roll through and through and randomly look for what you want if you know for example your family name or your street name or the topic you 're looking for you just type it in and in a couple of seconds you 'll have hundreds of thousands of results it 's absolutely revolution right i have had people just tell me it 's safe from years and years and years of research which i do know firsthand i used to have wednesdays my day off working weekends and for two years i use my wednesdays to go in and do some research for a microfilm on a house i was researching to write a book and um yeah and when i did the newspapers i thought if this was here then that would have been two wednesdays work whereas it was two years work for me to do it because i didn 't know the dates or the newspapers so absolutely incredible what we 've done here no other country in the world has tackled this in the way we have done or been able to try and do all of their newspapers some of them have digitized some newspapers but we are trying to digitize all australian newspapers up to 1954. um we 're starting with the big bigger titles from each state and then working downwards towards regional titles anyway what i wanted to talk about was when you get in at article level you can do three things so you can add a tag to that article which would enable you to find it maybe in a different way you want or if you 're doing genealogy you could tag it with the person 's name that you 're researching you can add a comment so people are generally adding comments to give further information about what 's happening in that article so if it 's a person 's name they might say how aware they died or what they did as a job or something or if the journalists got the information wrong which i 've thinking of the titanic where this journalist wrote a glowing report of how everybody was rescued on lifeboats you could add a comment saying they got it wrong and the northern territory papers are quite interesting but the all the activity really amongst the users is actually happening on correcting the text which is this box here on the left so what we 're seeing here on the left is the electronically translated computer text so to make this from a microfilm image into a full text searchable item we have to run it through a piece of software called optical character recognition which converts it into words as you can see this is actually quite a good newspaper but many of them are really poor quality they 're a bit blurry and out of focus and they 've got dots on them and the early ones they used old printing presses from the uk that have been taken out of circulation that have missing letters um it 's really helpful so um and they also ran out of paper so a lot of them have bled through to the so for all of these reasons when we run it through that program often this is totally not readable now when you do a full text keyword search you 're searching across this text so if it 's not right you 're not going to find what you 're looking for even if you can read it with your human eye so after exploring every possibility uh possible technologically wise uh we came to the conclusion it could only be done by the human hand and we were not prepared to pay contractors to do this it would cost millions of dollars which we don 't have so somebody suggested that members of the public could do it and this is what has happened so we didn 't know what would happen we were sort of thinking why would anybody do that or they might go in and vandalize it but all that has happened is that uh thousands of people have joined in to do this and i 've been correcting this text um now the reasons a lot of people have joined in is we 've made it notice something wrong want to fix it and click fix the text this box pops up and you have the choice to log in and register if you want to keep a history of what you 're doing in the system and do a few other things well you don 't have to at all you just can not register fill in the captcha like you would when you 're banking um and then it will just immediately take you to the next screen which is fix the text and it 's almost just like being in word you 're just on the line you change it and then you click save so it 's really really very easy people are doing all sorts of different things some of them are just going in and finding their name and making sure it 's correct and when you click save and come back and do a search within two minutes you find it so for example if my surname holly was about hilly and i went in and corrected it back to a holly and redid a search then i would people get that if they um correct it then immediately for everybody else that uses the database the searching is improved so that is the point of correcting the text so current figures are that we have more than 9000 people joining in to do this and so far they 've corrected 12 million lines which is totally astounding to us at the library um they 've also been using the other features they 've added 400 000 tags which helps other people find it in different ways and they 've added nearly 8 000 comments about on the specific articles and because people have asked us to how hard they work and how much they do it 's very important to the volunteers so we created the hall of fame so this is the month we have an overall hall of fame and a monthly hall of fame so you can see how well you 're doing and who your competitors are if that motivates you for some people this really does motivate them they have a minimum target each month and they like to keep their replaced in the top five characters were and so we found out i got their username and i emailed them hello i 'm ruth who are you and our top character is the lady called julie and she 's in her late 30s she 's at home she 's a mother with two children and she 's absolutely fascinated by murder and she corrects every single article on murder in bendigo as you can see and when she 's done it when you 've added value to the data in that way and somebody else does a search so i did a search for bendigo and you can see not very clearly here with the light but in the result list if anybody has done any activity it will tell you who they are and what they 've done so when i searched for bendy guy murder everyone said that it had been tagged and corrected by judy hempenstall so this has created quite a stir julia is now of media interest she has had uh journalists and magazines and radio not not tv yet i think she hasn 't reached global sorts of australian newspapers um and even had this article written on her saying that though she was their hero who is yours so in january this year the library the director general jan fullerton thought that the work the volunteers had done really needed to be recognised because the top five people in particular have corrected more than a million lines between them and i could see from their activity logs that some of them were working more than 40 hours a week doing this so um so we contacted them and gave them a special award we have library of australia day awards at the library um and people get gold medallions it 's all very nice and we flew the people down and guess what actually they weren 't five people they were six somebody was sharing a log on hence the six people in the fire show and one of those very special people is here today on the front row and manley and and anne is actually extra special because the other five people were had all started doing tax correction from day one in working quite a lot hours of week and we had a discussion at the library and said oh you know the whole of the hall of fame and the ranking is it fair because it will be very hard now for somebody to break that top five because they 've got a year 's worth ahead of anyone but guess what and did it congratulations then so i 'm coming up quite like steiner must have been very very busy so i guess what i 'm saying is that for the library this activity the public are undertaking we really really value this this is really important to us it 's making a massive difference to the quality of this diet device and it 's improving the searching for everybody so um now i 'm going to move on and talk about a few other services and i know i 'm already talking too long and too much but there 's so much to say i was i used to work as a trainer and did five day training sessions i still find it quite constraining to only have to moved on i 'm managing a bigger project which some of you might have heard about so i have a few other digital things that i 'm also managing and i 'm really trying to focus on engaging users in those as well so one of the other services you may have heard of is picture australia now this is a way to gather around all pictures from different australian institutions not just the national library so there 's 54 contributors to this and make digital images of australia accessible in a single place which makes it easier for the public than having to go individually to every separate library museum and archive um but five years ago um they were quite forward thinking still because they said but what you know there 's a gap here so nearly all of the five shows that were going in were old black and white historic fighters which these institutions generally collect many institutions have had cut backs in their photography departments um and with the change to digital photography they 've got rid of their dark rooms and their team of massive gap in the collection there were no colour images and there were no current images of towns events or places so a call went out to the public to help by contributing your photos of current people places and events in australia and if you want to do this and go in there 's a link just down there on the right hand side saying add your images and again it needed to be easy for people to do this so the way you can do it is um if you go into flickr there is a special group there for picture australia we 've actually got three groups one on people placing some events and i can 't remember what the other two are but i 'm showing this one because it 's probably more relevant for local history so you upload your photos to flickr and then we go and take that call and put it back into picture australia when it goes into picture australia every institution that 's in picture australia has the option to ask you if they could um add it into their been added by only 2 500 people um which is quite a lot could be even more so as an example i thought oh go and see if there 's anybody from mossman who 's done anything so i i don 't know if this person lives in mossman um but this is down at the beach um dawn chorus um what does it say does anyone recognize sydney festival 2009 january um al plata also known as gerald it 's a lovely photo yeah so as a matter of interest i noticed a gap here so i was searching for mossman and i really couldn 't find very much at all from any of the 54 institutions or the public so now is your opportunity to upload either your own historic photos of your own family or new photos of the area and region into this and become nationally available and again this is something that we really value so each month we see who has contributed what we consider to be the best fighters and give our reason for that and put a little blurb about them on talk about is flickr commons so flickr was set up for the public to put photos in but as i said libraries really want to get their photos to a wider audience and flipper has a massive audience and so um a couple of years ago flickr agreed to set up a special area flickr called flickr commons and this was going to be for libraries museums galleries and archives to upload photos and the photos that they have uploaded can be one of two things they can be public domain images that have no copyright restrictions so you can do what you will will with them and also some institutions specifically wanted to put photos up here that they had no information on they had no clue who took them or what they were of or who was in them so that the people could add information to them so many libraries at this time this is a couple of years ago just didn 't have facilities on their own website web 2.0 facilities so they had no means on their own website of letting people add comments or 're already quite advanced with that sort of user activity so they 've uploaded parts of their collections into flickr specifically so you can easily reuse the photos or add further information to them so in australia there are only four institutions in flickr commons which is the state library of queensland the australian war memorial the state library of new south wales and the powerhouse museum and there is a waiting list of about four years at present for any other library to get in here hence the national library not having a presence there so we 've done our own thing instead anyway let 's just go in so for example if you put a photo in this is one added by the powerhouse of george street in sydney which had no description so you can add comments and you can add notes but also in flickr on the actual picture itself you can draw a box around something that you know something about and add what you know and often in these old photos if you can pick out something that you can identify and get other give a location or a context to the photo so what the national library has just done is released a search engine called trive and this is what i 'm now managing so it was released just before christmas and it has had the whole newspaper section that i was talking about earlier added into it and the whole of picture australia added into it and seven other collaborative services that we 've been managing we 're also harvesting metadata from other organizations in australia so over a thousand libraries have contributed their collections and many other institutions and organizations so this is much like wider than what the library has we 're marketing this as the search engine for australia across what we call items that have got rich content so most of the items are from cultural heritage institutions and many of the items are digital so the register of australian archives ram you know ram is in here as well yeah well that 's integrated into this it is yes the whole of ram which is like i remember the acronym say it again registered archives it in here arrow which is uh research items from australia picture australia which is the pictures um newspapers quite a lot of other things 90 million items anyway what we 've done in here we have enabled some of those public interactions that people want to do so um before this this is why people were loading stuff into flickr commons because they wanted a bigger audience and they wanted the public to be able to comment but now with trove they can do that in here so what we 're looking at um is comments people have added to three different sorts of items so the top one is a newspaper article it says william henry pegram was shown in these notices of having been killed somewhere in france in fact he was killed in belgium in what became known as the battle of polygon wood his death was affirmed by a military court of enquiry held in the field on 3rd of april 1918 referred to the national archives of australia the second one is a picture of the flying officer malcolm james lark blunt and and the in the university of queensland he appeared in a film called captain of the clouds and i write this photo as five stars five is as good as it gets in our system um the third article is an essay in one of the archives and the person said this is a very stimulating and provocative little essay i enjoyed reading it and it got me thinking about a number of important issues to do with visual arts i write it five stars um so what we 've enabled is harvesting of data searching across it but also those interactions can actually happen in drive we 're in discussion with all these contributors about if they want these comments sent back to them for items they 've contributed and what they might want to do with those at the moment they 're just all exposed next to the item on the interface for the public to see i also just wanted to show you we 've got i haven 't shown you the search but you know you just put your terms in the search box it searches and you a way to monitor their own research or to just highlight specific things so for example a couple of months ago when the sinking of the centaur got into the news if you just come into tribe and do a search for thinking of centaur you found hundreds of thousands of items so in this case people have gone into that and just tagged the items that were really of top relevance almost interesting which is this tag cloud here and then and then if you clicked on the tag cloud thinking of centaur instead of getting the complete results list of thousands of items you just get the things that different members of the public have thought worthy of highlighting so this one down here is a um is a biography on eleanor savage who was a nurse who um i think she got um the george cross or something for being in the water for so long and um rescuing people this was a letter written from somebody on the ship who uh didn 't survive i believe uh life boy various other things so that 's trive would encourage you to go away and use it it 's really rich source for finding anything about local information with the success of trove do you think that that the flicker commons will become less important i do yes because bay there 's a three year waiting list for every institution in australia to get into flickr commons now which is no good i don 't know why i have no idea why there 's a waiting list because they have no issue in uploading millions of public content every day and most of these libraries that want to be in and like the powerhouse they 're really putting small numbers in they have to set up a feed and put 50 new items in a month so it 's very small numbers of photos that are going in it 's not their whole collection they have to select them so i really have no idea why that 's that way she missed but also in tribe we just want your whole collection and we can just do it you don 't have to monthly feed it in or into the strategic plan of the national library is there a community yeah they are number one and two in the strategic direction for the library and it 's my task to work to them and get them done so we 're using chive as a vehicle for that so number one is enabling a new wise the public to add that knowledge and value to data and number two is enabling our communities to develop and build virtually and online and enabling those communities to talk to each other and do new things in new models um so you know people don 't really know what this is and this is what we 're trying to work on in drive so yes the primary objective of the national library of australia is to build collections but it 's no good just building them up you 've got to do something with them um so those the division i work in is resource sharing and innovation and it 's up to us to come up with those ideas but we don 't really know that 's why we 've been and australian newspapers to say to people if you could do anything you wanted what would you want to do because it 's very hard for us to define how people want to react with data and information when everything 's changing so fast and different ways of research everybody looks for information and uses it in totally different ways so yeah so rose a supplementary question on that line what you 've got is you 've actually got an agenda setting which is more community based as a result of interaction right so how do you how do you turn that into something that 's tangible for the national library to grasp in terms of the user community actually providing guidance rather than librarians interpreting what they think the population was it 's a very good question and i know you know the answer to it and i do i could suggest that if people felt strongly about developing user groups to advise the national library on particular services that they should contact the director general and suggest that we do have a committee for libraries australia which is to the public several years ago and there is a guiding committee on that which gets involved in all changes we don 't have a model like that for trove at the moment but that may be a way yeah or even okay or going the other way the ability to link with local history genealogical um professional historical societies or whatever to get the feedback and invite input just because that 's how you get your story out there in a bigger way because it 's been worded now and you 've got a really great response yeah what 's going to be like when you actually turn it off yeah i know i 'm under myself yes yeah i mean as chris is saying you know at the moment we really haven 't done much marketing we just had a huge overwhelming response from people one of the concerns the library has is about managing that kind of response and dealing with digital volunteers on the scale we 're talking about wikipedia which i 'm going to talk about next has 10 million volunteers i went to visit staff they had to manage their volunteers and how they did this and and their response was what i already thought was the way anyway which was that the you know you need to get savvy wise where the volunteers can manage and moderate themselves we have one member of staff to manage these 10 million people he was he was rather harassed so we went out for lunch and i could see his mind was on other things but they don 't their office is tiny tiny office there 's about 20 people working that for the whole of wikipedia is incredible so it is possible to do fantastic things with the public with minimal staff but the library does have a concern they kind of feel in the hard copy world you know the reference desk we answer every single response and we 're there on hand for the public and you can 't_''_2510.319 do that with millions of people online so you do need to look at different models for handling things one of the things we will be doing soon is setting up a user forum asked us for is to be able to contact other users now parts of their profile are visible for example you know you can see julie hampenstahl has corrected articles on murder in bendigo and if you were similarly interested you might want to contact her and and this is something we know so the point of the forum will be to primarily to enable those user groups to talk to each other um but a secondary purpose is that it does give the library a better communication mechanism to directly talk to users we don 't have that at all at present and it enables other contributing organizations to try to be able to talk to users or ask them specific questions about specific areas or collections of data if they wish so we need the communication to be open and too wide and pretty much at the moment you know if you want to talk to the national library you have to fill out an online contact us form and within 10 days you 'll get an email response and my phone number is available and i have this room have phoned and emailed me and i do have a massive email box i do attempt to reply if you 've emailed me and i haven 't i 'm sorry about that um but yeah i 've got a million people on newspapers at the moment and i am the only person working on that service the same problem with wikipedia that trade would have how do you validate people 's comments and the information that contributed how do you know whether that 's true you assume that 98 of people want to do the right thing in your proceeding we don 't ask you to question this there 's no moderation what happens there is no moderation and so what we are doing is making it really obvious on the record that this is something a user added so you can then therefore use your own judgment about how correct you think it might be now you 've got to bear in mind that there 's a lot of library information on there created by us that 's incorrect as well we 're not saying that everything records there are quite a few errors in there um and so and people do make you know um mistakes they don 't mean to but also could have just got it wrong um so no so i think so long as you can see where the source is and perhaps when you can contact the person who added it um you can verify and check things for yourself but we 're not trying to i mean i mean my opinion is that people have got huge knowledge and if they 're um if that they feel they really want to add a comment in most cases it 's because they really do think they knew the answer or could add something to it um let 's see after that is that information trail been able to through that person and be able to get in touch with that person and find out where they got the information yeah that may be necessary in the research project particularly yeah yeah he just does not believe that wikipedia is therefore a reference source i have been told wikipedia let 's talk 's it 's only been seven years but i find it hard to recall searching google and not seeing wikipedia number one or two in the results list but we 're now almost taking it for granted but at the time this was phenomenal the idea that somebody said that anybody wanted could go in and add what they knew and make an online encyclopedia and there would be no rules and there weren 't um but now there are there are lots of rules so now an article in wikipedia you have to provide your references and if you 're writing about a living person there is a very um strict guideline for how you should refer to that person there has to be no bias and everything you mentioned has to be backed up by references so to give you an example the um uh i 'm in quite close contact with the um president of wikipedia and wikimedia australia and they said that when the um the founder of the encyclopedia britannica died um his son who is a wikipedia editor immediately went in and added on whatever it was and it got removed to made it lay by another editor because you have nothing to back it up with because it hadn 't yet been reported in the newspaper and it 's and so you can 't_''_2794.079 do that yeah so so there are strict rules and if you look at any living person record in wikipedia you 'll generally find that it 's uh totally unbiased and a very good description more side than the australian national biography yes we 've done a quick comparison in triad looking a few people up in the australian national versus wikipedia and we much preferred what we read in wikipedia some of the articles are quite insulting actually anyway so now what i 'm saying is yes it started a movement but there are quite you can 't do anything you want and they do keep records and backups and so on and so forth so most people only know about the english wikipedia which has three million articles in it at the moment but there are 250 of our language versions of wikipedia which are totally different articles 10 million people are registered as users again you don 't need to register to do it but you can but of those about 150 000 are active at any given time so i went in so it you know and looked at mossman and what did i find yet again the entry is very poor um it in my opinion is just begging to have a lot more information added to it there 's very few photos on it i couldn 't really find any information about notable people who 'd lived in mossman or notable buildings so again during local history wikipedia is a really good vehicle to do that because you can go in and add information you you know if you want to upload your photos this might be another avenue for you um any digital objects added go into wikimedia commons first where it refers to them and they do recommend that you you know say what you know about where you got the photo but it 's not absolutely compulsory we don 't mind people using national library of australia digital objects to newspaper articles but we know that some of the digitized archives and manuscripts and other photos have been referenced in here so that 's a really good idea and it 's really successful and then i was looking around what other libraries were doing and i found wiki northia so this is the northern suburbs of melbourne and they 've used the same wikipedia software because it 's open source and they wanted to set up an encyclopedia for the northern suburbs and this has been managed by three libraries there who got the money from the national library board i 'm not sure how successful it has been and i was struggling to see why you might want to set up your own thing when wikipedia already exists and you can create as many sub pages within it as you want but it 's an interesting application where obviously it 's totally open to the public and you can go in and create something and a very similar one is uh wiki shep i thought it said wiki sheep when i first looked at it but it 's not and so this is goldbern public library and the university of melbourne and again they 're trying to do a similar thing just for goulburn valley um i had a look through and there wasn 't much stuff there and whoever 's managing it was trying to suggest people did stuff because there 's headings and then underneath it goes you could add information here like hints um but you know one of the reasons they might be doing it separately is because of what i said earlier about always and forever because you know wikipedia is a non-profit making thing but at the end of the day it could disappear um and in the last talk that the um president said she said you know people are taking it for granted now and this is dangerous um so onto your local website which i really am not the person to um talk about because i didn 't even know it existed until burton asked me if i could maybe add it into the presentation it 's muslim and memories of your street so here we 're trying to build photos and you can go in and add things and if you 're interested um the librarian is here on the back row have a little way of librarian so i 'm sure we could talk about that so i can 't talk about voluntary library projects without talking about books so um this project is the oldest crowdsourcing project i know about and so it started in the year 2000 it was well ahead of its time based in america and people thought you know why should they wait for libraries to digitize books and make them online it was never going to happen it was taking too long so distributed proofreaders were set up as a group of volunteers to help project gutenberg their aim was to make as many books as possibly digitally available it 's been incredibly successful over nine years they 've digitised 16 000 books and they 're all available free as ebooks for you to download and they they have mined maintained a consistent amount of volunteers which is 90 000. um let 's decide yes uh what to say about this so selection on the books it 's got to fit the out of copyright thing in america but the volunteers can be anywhere and again so i went to america met this lady um she 's very nice you know she 's young like me she has a dynamic day job and i have no idea how she fits in being director of this in her evenings but she does um and she said to me oh yeah rose we 've got a big group of volunteers in australia and new zealand because you know they think it 's important what we 're doing and when they digitize the books you can access them here and these volunteers they do the entire complete process they 're going to find a book they digitize each page they transform it into xml they use a little bit of software that makes it into an ebook they upload it they proofread it twice and then finally it 's ready as a gold text so to help motivate the people at any given time you can see how many are complete how many are in stage and that 's the distributed proofreaders family so we 'll move on now to archives so family search index was set up by the church of latter-day saints the mormons in utah and as some of you may know um in years gone by when i used to work in a public library we love them because you know they made all these micro fishes of personal names and church records and we just got them all in the library without having to pay it was great so but over recent years they 've been having a really big push to take microfilms and things that haven 't yet been microfilmed handwritten records and transcribe those and make them available online searchable so on this site family search indexing you can go and put in a name and potentially find it and i thought just this is a really good description of why they want you to help it 's the key events of of lives of billions of people and so far they 've transcribed 334 million names and this again is people all over the world doing it 's the u.s census index it 's actually not they 've taken both death and marriage records from practically every country in the world and if you want to go in and volunteer the first thing you have to do is pick which country you want to help now when i looked at this a few months ago there was an australian thing appearing and when i looked at it last night it had gone so i guess that somebody 's completed some australian stuff because that wasn 't in the list to help out with anymore um instead it was offering brazil i think was next thing um so they take um once you 've volunteered it 's not public access because in in the easy way in newspapers is because first of all you volunteer and then they send you a set of guidelines and you 've got to download a little bit of software onto your computer but then off you go transcribing and this really has got to be done by hand because it 's handwritten records that are really hard to read that no really worthwhile so a similar thing in australia is the ryerson index now it 's a bit different because this is new stuff so this is current newspapers looking through the um death notices and when i read the front page i had to laugh it 's not very funny it said created by the sydney dead person society didn 't know societies like that exists but i suppose you know yeah so the sydney dead person society it was the original promoter of this and originally it was just sydney papers but now it 's been uh broadened to the whole of um australia and and so um it 's fairly easy to do you know you go into some newspaper you have and go and send them the transcribed list of all the people who 've died they 've got two million names in it 's not easy to do is it not okay it took me three years to do 11 months of the sydney morning here all back over nine years ago i had a huge magnifying glass set up on stand on top of the using the paper copies to we 've learned a lot from australian newspapers and the talk i usually give to librarians is what you need to do on your website to make it really easy for people to help and why have we had such phenomenal success when there 's things like this that don 't have that many volunteers and one of the major answers is you 've got to make it totally open and you 've got to make it really easy and fun and you must not require them to log in so these ones i 'm talking about now as and pointed out are not half as easy as australian newspapers and most of them you 'd have to contact the person first and get some guidelines and the software is a bit clunky and even wikipedia said to me so wikipedia is seven years old now and if you go in and edit an article it 's not that easy and they looked at our newspapers and said if only it could be like that it would be if we did it now but you move on and they have such a huge infrastructure behind the scenes would be really really hard for them to totally change that now and make it uneasier so the australian jan webb is a um a subpart of the gen web which is a worldwide thing and each country has its own and then each state within that has its own so we 're looking at new south wales and they want people to volunteer to transcribe resources from hard copy and send them in now this is a bit um it 's really helpful to do this but it doesn 't make it immediately all full tank searchable because when you say you go into a church and get an old handwritten book and then you type it up like this and they might deliver it as what they would call a finding aid like this but it wouldn 't necessarily be full tax searchable but it still helps because it 's easier finding something like this online then it would actually be to physically go to the place and try and read the handwriting yourself now i archives quite a lot there is just no end of archives it 's just enormous so the range of things they were offering you there were shipping records birth deaths marriages military all sorts of things i mean this is years and years and years but it 's all invaluable so um there 's another one here which i wanted to mention shipping because a lot of people in australia are really particularly interested in shipping and that aspect of the newspapers the shipping news where it tells you which convicts came in on the ships and where they got moved to and all that stuff is really unique to australia because of the convict history no other world has that in their um newspapers and so one of the uh top volunteers mentioned in passing to me even though she 's one of our top volunteers and there 's a huge amount of time with us she said oh i volunteered for other things as well so i said oh i had to have time and like what and she said oh this um mariners and shipping and australian transcribing and shipping lists now new things coming out last week i met somebody who is organizing this and i don 't know what 's going to happen with it it 's called founders and survivors and it 's about convict records so rather than just supply all the convict sources and there are many different projects relating to convicts where people have transcribed things off microfilm and got records and stuff what they 're actually asking to happen and i don 't know if it will i could not i don 't think they 've enabled it yet because i tried to volunteer and get in and i couldn 't um they 're asking people if you researched a convict and gone through that terrible difficult process of putting all the pieces together and finding the microfilm to just let them know everything you know on your convict and where you got it from so they 're not necessarily trying to take the convict records they 're trying to take what people have learned and put it in the useful way so that 's one to watch that has one it 's the university of melbourne and it 's been funded on an arc grant which started three months ago so that first step is putting the website up and the lady from wikipedia said to me she thought it might go live in maybe a couple of weeks she wasn 't sure um so to slightly change this isn 't a library this is the abc pool um so this is a place where you can go and upload content you 've created which is could be images poetry videos whatever and there 's some quite interesting stuff happening here and there is a representative from the ibc here tonight if you want to ask any more details back row on the left chris way of chris so from what i could see most of this is modern but we are working with the ibc and using this as a vehicle to maybe expose more of the archive content that the ibc have so this is another one i would say to watch and the last one i was going to talk about which is also one to what they are as i understand what they are trying to do is involve the local community a lot more in the generation of potential news stories and content so encouraging members of the public to give their own resources and viewpoints to report items which technically is sort of local history stuff you know if some i don 't know if something happened in your community and you know old bob is 85 down the road can remember when you know 50 years ago it was like this and he might appear on video and say oh yeah 50 years ago i remember when and then somebody else might come along and sort of say well i actually witnessed the thing at the time so so instead of the ibc sending their own reporters out and creating their own content they are trying to get a greater involvement from the community in that process so want to watch if you 're interested in that sort of stuff on that site is they went to tasmania and did a little um pilot where they 've got a few people from go in and see what they created and what they did so how are we doing for time okay let 's have a quick summary so what can you help with well the thing i would like i 'm biased i would like you to create newspapers i think that 's the most interesting thing i 've showed you but you can also add your pictures of people places and events to picture australia put your australia feeds into troves if you do that they will be available through trive and if you if you put your name on them it 's not necessary we only ask for a title but you know if you do add details like your name then you will be able to search on your name and try and find them and you can add your value to any of those resources you find in trive at item level and as i said very soon we will be giving users the ability to talk to each other through the forum you could go and extend the wikipedia entry for mossmen and related items pretty easily things if that 's what gives you a buzz so it is that 's right it 's aggregating metadata so um yeah so we 're not keeping so that 's why it 's a search engine like in a way in the same way that google comes and choose websites and then you search across them and when you get the results you click you go to that website that 's what in library terms we call harvesting data so cho is doing the same thing but not across websites across all these different cultural heritage institutions and we 're using a different set of protocols called oai which you 're probably not interested in but that 's how we do it so most of those cultural heritage institutions have applied similar standards to enable sharing of metadata because that 's something we 've always known is important but up until this time we haven 't been able to do it chile has been a significant project for the library and staff resource and time and technology it 's cutting edge no other library in the world is doing it out to visit us to talk about it because you know when you 're in google if you go into the search box you just search websites then if you want to search images you move into images and so on with news what we 've done in tribe is a single search and google have been working for three years to try and achieve the single search it 's not there yet um so we 've already done that so the technology behind the scenes is advanced but again that 's because you know if google were doing google now it would probably be like trovis but they didn 't they did it you know a long time ago and it 's very hard to change um so also a smaller collection yeah but we 're not we 're not trying to compete with google i mean i would say you know use google and use drive so google is searching across current day websites and we 're not attempting to do that in drive we 're searching across other rich content we have um used wikipedia and flickr a target so they don 't appear in the search results but they 're slightly off to the left and saying oh by the way if you 're interested there 's this in google books or this in wikipedia so we 're not harvesting that metadata but we 're utilizing it in a way that they have agreed that they they want to do so um yes it 's all good so what can you do now well i i firmly believe that everybody in this room can contribute in some way and do something that they feel is of value and that would help other people um but also what i would like you to do is if i if you are working on newspapers or any of these other things you need to tell other people about it because as libras and archives we 're really bad at marketing and asking people to do things and on the whole national library website there still is no plea for people to help there 's nowhere on it which will say please come and do this with newspapers if you have they rang me up and went ah you should know i went in and i i moved the text and it changed and i say yes that 's where it 's supposed to be um because we haven 't really um publicized that um at all and so the last thing i was thinking of actually was um that when bernard asked me to do this talk and i decided to make it a bit wider than what we were doing at the national library i actually found it really really difficult to find these projects and group them together and i couldn 't find anywhere where there was a list that you could even a list existing let alone that you could add to or or amend saying if you want to help libraries and archives and do something really useful online from home on the internet here are the things you could do so i actually think somebody needs to set up a page in wikipedia or somewhere else that people can come in and edit and add things to and say if you want to help do so we need a trade name in wikipedia yes is there a trust name in wikipedia i don 't think so no finding the name was a mission i have to tell you um you know we we sort of thought should it be meaningful or should it not and then you think of all these names and you go in and the website 's already taken um if you search for trive and google it will come out top so travis is not a common thing but it 's still a bit hard to remember it i say to people remember treasure drive that makes it easier treasure trove but it 's just try yeah wikipedia accepts donations okay any reason why the national library couldn 't be accepting donations for worthy digital programs i would love them to do so i 've suggested this several times and to to be honest i 'm not sure what the status is so um we we had something very unusual happen when we started to digitize newspapers all these institutions don 't have much money and digitization costs lots of waited a long long time to get this 10 million dollars that we needed to digitize newspapers and almost immediately people that look at the list of titles that were selected there 's i think there 's 104 in the list at the moment and they 'd go oh the i don 't know the mossman daily times isn 't in the list what do i need to get it in the list and so i 'd say to people oh well you know this is the budget and this was selected by the selection was done by state and territory libraries the national library actually didn 't have a say in that they we did a collaborative um activity there and so i sort of half jack and he said well you know if you give us some money it will go on the list because um you know we 've and people weren 't yeah okay how much would it cost and then the next thing that happened was unbelievable um because the sydney morning howard said why isn 't the sydney morning heralding and so we said the rule here is we 're digitizing for microfilm and one of the primary reasons for that is because it 's a third of the price to digitize from microfilm to what it is hard copy so by using microfilm we could do much more stuff than we could to large copy and we thought that was important so we said well there 's this funny thing with the sydney morning harold because all the other newspapers have got a really good microphone copy hard in a state library but that one sort of slipped through the gap and sydney morning howard don 't have a complete copy either so it 's all hard copy we can 't afford to do that um and so a week later i had a i had an envelope through the mail and inside it was a handwritten check for a million dollars this has never happened to me ever before yes yes the actually it 's the vincent fairfax family foundation not the company itself so the vincent fairfax family foundation um do give money you know for worthy things they it did herald because for a long time they 've been sort of planning to digitize it themselves they actually hadn 't because they had the same issue as us that they couldn 't get a microphone or a complete copy because all their journalists had gone into this archive and you know taken all the comments yeah so it 's a big i mean michael 's grinning on the back row there he knows all about how difficult this has been for us and has done an amazing job um for us it was pasco 's that have um digitised the sydney morning herald so thank you again michael i apologized on my uncle 's microfilming in the 1970s i did miss a few pages as well it 's his thumb at the bottom of the pages anyway i diverse let 's get back to christmas he 's asking can the public donate so so anyway so this happened and so so i said to people at the library this has never happened before i 've never worked in any library or other institution digitising where people offer their money to there are so many of them um and it is so costly they 're offering money um and it was my idea that um in the same way that wikipedia for about 12 weeks each year they have a because they 're a non-profit making organization they run a campaign to get money and they get several million dollars over a 12-week period because if people did not donate how many nine six last december yeah um if people didn 't donate of course wikipedia would disappear um and people don 't want it to so they feel strongly so i was like great let 's do the same for newspapers but the national library is constrained by anything involving money you know we 're not allowed to charge for services and donations is a bit of a gray area um and so i 'm not sure right we took the money from the suny morning hours i 'm really glad that you 've made an exception and we have like where a local history society has got together and said you know this paper is really important and then small paper maybe there 's only two thousand pages altogether we 've said if you clock together and give us the money you know we 'll do it but regarding individuals giving money um that 's a different kind of fish and i 'm not i 'm i 'm not fully sure all the ins and outs about that um or you know even if we enable it if we 're then allowed to actually advertise it or appeal for money um i 'm not sure and i know you 've suggested it before but i actually think people would do it break the balance and set up an email address put yourself in your pay pal and take them and leave the country yeah not serious why not yeah or the user group the user basically sets itself up to say on the basis of um providing some directional guidance because i think that 's the thing that 's missing right now when i worked for the national library in new zealand we did have a public consultation then when we had a digital strategy and we said to we 're having real trouble prioritizing stuff here so there was a public consultation to find out which things the people would want digitised now for newspapers for the first four years those decisions over titles were given to state and territory libraries so for each state they had to pick what they felt was the most important now it was entirely up to them how they did that but the four years finishes next year and no plans have been made for how further title selection is going to take place at all or if or how the public would be involved in that process i do have a huge list of things that the public have nominated everybody has ever emailed me and said your newspaper thing is great but why isn 't this paper in and i like it in and most of those are small regional papers i 've kept an extensive list so we do know every suggestion we 've had so far and we had talked about various things like exposing that list and letting people vote on the list using web 2.0 things know yeah i think it 's all a great idea you should probably mention why it finishes at 54 from the newspaper yeah so um that 's a good point and that we 've set up to 1954 because prior to that they 're out of copyright so anybody could actually digitize them um after 1954 that in copyright now for the first four years just to make it easy we 've just done up to 1954 but we can continue after 54 with permission of publishers and several of those publishers have indicated that um they would be open to that they 're only interested in stuff that can make them money so and usually that 's like the last five years of stuff that they 've already got online on a website so for them they still consider 1954 to 1970 ancient history um and are not you know particularly interested um but as i said it 's been a really small team and the first year there were five people um now there 's just me um so you know the work it entails doing that sort 's really been our primary reason for leaving it till a bit later but but we really would like to go beyond 54. i should also say at this point we 've um we 're doing something else which you may or may not know of the australian women 's weekly gave us their permission to digitize that so we 're we 've tried to where we are running it through the newspaper process because we have the system already set up and we 've already digitized most of that and it 's just wonderful beautiful stuff those old photos are so uh politically incorrect they 're unbelievable just fascinating we have um social history yeah one of the ladies is working on it as a feminist and she had to um do she was doing assessment on each year in decade i can 't remember the year it started but we got like i think it 's 30s 40s 50s 60s and she had real trouble with the 50s you _"

    "text": "now the little straw pile i 'd like to do is how many of you are here because you want to hear about fidel castro okay how many are here because you want to hear about errol flynn i get a couple of hands that you 're up for fidel castro but most of the hands go up yeah what do you do that 's good you 're getting what is it odds are on now what do you call it each way i gotta get the blue yes most people seem to be interested in errol flynn now maybe that 's because it 's australia if i was in america they 'd probably be more interested in fidel castro but um there seems to be i think that the thing about errol clean is that most australians even now don 't know that he 's australian uh it 's only probably in the last 10 years that people have started to understand that he was in america they still don 't know in america they still think he 's uh an american of irish descent when they write about 'll say he 's um ireland was born in tasmania an island to the south of australia now that which suggests they don 't know what tasmania is or where tasmania is somewhere in the south pacific and somewhere around australia it 's not part of australia now i have seen that exact terminology an island to the south of australia a dozen times and a dozen different descriptions of errol clinton 's history but yes the fact is that he he is australian he wasn 't surrounded sherry he was until he became a naturalized american citizen in about 1942. uh by that stage he was um not in his thirties he um he was born in uh hobart but that was accidental he um his parents were actually from sydney uh they were married in balmain and his father was a marine biologist in fact he was a uh one of he was he eventually became the most respected marine biologist in the world he was on a he was on an excursion down to the antarctic and uh with his wife with his relatively new wife and his third life that was not british i mean you were thinking about his third wife who had a name like that i 'll think of it in a minute no no i 'm talking about his father 's wife he 's his mother his name was uh mario well she hadn 't she had a number she was called mario morell but um that wasn 't official they found out that she was pregnant on the journey on the on the voyage so they stopped the vote in hobart and offloaded her because she couldn 't stay in antarctica for six months in her condition she stayed in hobart while the father errol finn 's father continued ordering target and came back and decided that because she put down roots in her votes at the same time and he got sent here at the university of tasmania now that 's how earl started and that 's how he happened to be tasmanian but he certainly was australian his parents were both uh from many generations his father of irish descent and his mother his mother of um english descent uh one of her ancestors i think about her great grandfather was one of the bounty mutineers which is rather ironic because that was errol thing 's first film it 's called in the wake of the bounty in australian film now that 's a little background of about um earthling um i think most people know about phil castro what you may not know what i for instance didn 't know when uh when i set up i set up on this um embark on this particular project was just what errol uh sorry fidel castro was like before the revolution before he became a world figure in 1958 and 59 which is what this novel covers it 's the end of the it 's deep while he called at the beginning of the revolution but it was actually the end of the war it was the end of the the the violent uprising that there 's the struggle which happened to end very suddenly 1958 no i think there 's someone trying to get in sorry that 's all right my apologies um 1958 1959 the revolution in of january 1959 and if anyone 's seen the godfather you 'll know how that happened if you if you know i 've got if you 've seen godfather too there 's a scene there where um the godfather uh al pacino is attending a big um new year 's eve party in havana he 's just been doing the deals with the character based on via lansky and so on all the and they 've gone to uh president bautista 's new year 's eve party in the middle of the party batista hears news that um the countries have been cut in half by a battle that 's just being run by che guevara in a town called santa clara about halfway along the island and suddenly the country is split in two there 's no communication between north and south or potentially no communication with north between north and south or east and west so he realized well the um the writing was on the wall he thought well why am i doing this and he literally did a moonlight flip that night took off with all left um a number of generals in each wake but none of those generals was able to form a government in the next couple of days fidel castro called a national strike everyone went out all the workers laid down the sugar plantations laying down tools and so on fidel castro then did a one week victory parade from the far rest of the country a town called santiago de cuba all the way up over a period of a week all the way up to urbana and arrived in havana anointed as the new leader of a new leader of cuba now where all this becomes relevant to the story of writing is that when when fidel castro rode into havana on in his victory parade on a tank on the next tank right behind him was errol flynn now when you hear that you immediately think well that 's of course preposterous they 're also you know the fading movie star of the the forties the king of the swashbucklers on the next tank in a serious revolution this is not a hollywood film this is a serious i written the other point of the other story i heard was that when castro achieved his victory it had happened so suddenly so unexpectedly even to someone like fidel castro that the only foreign current well i used the term loosely foreign correspondent in uh in havana or not even in atlanta in santiago to cuba which is where castro was the only foreign foreign correspondent was errol flynn errol flynn decided to uh he realized that he was the only person with access to to the american press so he filed a story so that 's how the story broke that 's how the story broke to the world that errol clinton broke the story to the world that fidel castro was now the leader in cuba now those two facts once if you were writing pure fiction uh i would suggest that if that didn 't happen you 'd be mad to even invent it because it 's just that preposterous but in fact it is true now when i heard those two those two facts and was stimulated to go looking for it if you google references to errol slim and fidel castro there 's thousands of them there 's very little in the way of detail but lots of people make reference to it you 'll even see you 'll even find um you 'll even find some photographs but the photographs aren 't particularly good the photographs you 'll find i have two here this is one there 's aerial thing up there in the top right top left and there 's fidel castro down there now this is straight after the uh straight after the victory and that one which are not exactly newsworthy photographs these photographs never i don 't think it were made in newspapers but to give you an idea of what it was how big this news was this is the los angeles times i 'm sure they 're talking about driving around stuff but look up here errol flynn wounded as castro man they 're all seen wounded as fighter with castro now that story came but that story was published on the um the 6th of january that 's why the victory parade was still on its was because the uh the journalists the foreign correspondents are all descended on cuba and they all wanted to find out what was what was eral flint doing there and how come he had released the story and errol told them and they said why are you limping because you had a damaged leg and a sore leg and so why are you limping and he made up the story about how good the wounded now that particular story has about three or four different versions in one in one he was uh in one that was shrapnel and another it was a bullet another it was flying wood because of bits of splinters of timber because he was standing by a door on the door splintered on a gunshot the fact of the matter was he fell over and damaged his knee and hurt himself so while he was shooting his spill now that brings me to why he was down there in the first place it also went down there because he was for a number of reasons number one he was broke and was looking for a to us a small fortune we 're all seeing uh owed a small fortune to the um the irs he um he was always a a man who was looking for adventure he went down there for an adventure he wanted to get involved with the you know this revolution that was happening down there but he saw primarily he saw if he went down there and made a film about this revolution that 's down there he could write it off as a huge as a tax loss so as i said in the book he wanted to lose his shirt but say he lost the whole wardrobe and if anyone 's seen mel brooks or producers you know you 'll know the um the concept where you put on a show you put on a put on you make a film and you can hide all sorts of losses which you didn 't actually make in uh in the production of a film or putting on the stage play that 's what he wanted to do lose money on this bill but then he he realized that there opportunity to to make a to give himself a tax break there was an adventure here he was always a man who was looking for adventure he used to call him rocks he said he said i start out looking i start out i start out looking for a cause and it all ends up in a rob now what he really means by cause is he 's looking for an adventure he did he did back a couple of causes well apart from uh i guess there were only two one was um fidel castro the other was in the spanish civil war he backed he backed the loyalists in the in the spanish civil war once again he he was looking for an adventure and he decided that he could be he could be like hemingway he could go across there um be part of it write about it and he came to an arrangement with uh william randolph hurst who was a who was a um an acquaintance of his that he would supply stories back to the hearst newspapers this was in 1938 so he went getting drunk womanizing and making a general fool of himself but he also got involved with the with the uh the loyalists who were on the if you remember that they were anti um the uh the anti what was his name franco the anti-franco forces so he was on the left there even though sometime later there was a book probably saying he was a nazi his politics were always on the left he spent about a month over there getting involved in the spanish civil war but partly that was because he was trying to escape hollywood he was he was always running away from hollywood because whenever he couldn 't get what he wanted from jack warner he would just disappear he 'd get on his boat and disappear for a few days until eventually jack wanted to back down and say all right i 'll give you the extra whatever it is you want the bigger trailer the extra you know the extra salary etcetera etcetera etcetera he was he wasn 't the only one to do that a lot of them did that uh but he had a bug he could disappear on so that was one that was probably the main reason he went to the spanish civil war secondary reason because he supported the loyalist the main reason he went to cuba was firstly to uh to make this film lose the money secondly because he wanted to to get involved with what looked like a big adventure and heard thirdly because he sort of supported castro so he went down there to make his film to make this film he needed the involvement of castro where he needed the involvement of the rebels because he wanted uh it was the film was called cuban rebel girls that 's the title of the phil cuban family in the book era fidel and the cuban rebel girls this was the film he went down there to make cuban rebel girls the story of this film uh the plot is a um this is this is errol with his girlfriend at the time beverly adland this would have been taken in 1959 she would have been 17 he was 49.50 this girl is the star of a um particularly little place here i know it 's just this film if you 've ever if you ever get a chance to see this film don 't i mean it really is a terrible film but it 's the story is um a uh a hairdresser from new york played by beverly apple but played by beverly atlanta the hairdresser from new york discovers that her boyfriend has gone off down to cuba to join the rebels and she says johnny 's gone down to cuba i 'm going to go down there i 'm going to go down there and find him and i 'm going to be a rebel girl so she don 't so the hairdresser goes down to cuba finds johnny up in the mountains and joining her you little idiot what you doing here and uh that 's exactly the part of the film and there 's a couple of action scenes where they when they shoot some uh they shoot some government soldiers and uh eventually there 's a victory parade the victory probe they show in the film is the beverly sitting up on a tank now that 's in the real victory parade there was there a lot further up but they were filming deadly on a tank they actually stopped the victory parade for beverly to jump down off the tank and run into the arms with a johnny this is history gone mad but it 's true so all that sort of all that when you 've when you find out all sorts of stuff i mean you don 't have to make too much up essentially all the incidents in the book uh based on facts even bizarre ones like on new year 's eve the day that the very night the batista did his moonlight flip uh castro was weighing on the other end of the country a thousand kilometers away but he had just uh change won a battle halfway up the country well castro had also won a battle on that day in a town called mufo which is way down the the east just on the foothills of the mountains and uh he was having his own little celebration because he just 's golf club this is as the battle is the day the battle is finished in the town 's golf club earl clinton throws a new year 's eve party it 's true he did and castro turned up at us briefly now um the uh i mean situations like that you know you just you just cannot invent them because they 're just too bizarre it 'd be science fiction otherwise you know so errol went down there he took beverly he made this this film but the film wasn 't finished until he died he died only nine months later he died in october 1959. the film was still unfinished it came out later that year came out a couple of months later and it was what did you die you 'd only just turn 50. yeah but they said you had the body of an 80 year old but it still doesn 't look like errol slim the way he looked in robin hood you know he 's he 's he 's bloated he 's uh pathetic he is 50. but he 's suffering look he suffered new guinea that was in his early 20s he suffered from an area for the rest of his life as one did in those days i suppose they still do if you get malaria it still sticks with you uh he had obviously had ongoing cirrhosis he had heart problems he had he had back problems he 'd almost broken his back uh when shooting um a couple of those once was captain blood he fell off the rigging onto the deck that was his first big film in hollywood he fell off the rip because he did all his own stunts in those days and fell off the ring and bang onto the deck that damaged his back and and a couple of years later he leapt from a balcony to another balcony and and uh lost his drip and fell after that they said you know you 've got to get a stuntman to do all these things because he was too valuable to start by the stage he was okay with captain blood he was uh he was very unknown he 'd only made a couple of was about the biggest name in hollywood and he he was the biggest dancer in hollywood for about for a number of years after that he was the biggest name and he was one the biggest names in hollywood during the war for all the wrong reasons not necessarily well not necessarily positive for the films he was making if you remember he made a lot of uh war films at that time well a lot of them were propaganda films that he was forced to make and he became legendary for the man who won the war single-handedly and yet never joined up well the fact is he tried to join up but he had so many physical problems that they wouldn 't take him he was classed as 4f and in selected services now 4f means uh unrecruitable unrecruitable because of the damage to his back because of the malaria because of all the others heart problems and so on and so on now water brothers kept the lid on that they wouldn 't they wouldn 't they wouldn 't tell they wouldn 't allow people to to _''_1169.76 or in the in the forces because he was getting a lot of flap for a lot of negative publicity but they didn 't want people to understand that their their big action film star was actually a 4f so he had to wear all that he also had a sensational trial for statutory rape during the war which uh if you 've heard me you 've all probably heard the term in like flynn it came from that trial in 1943 where he was a he was accused of statutory rape which in uh in those days in america i 'm not sure if it still existed in those days statutory rape was sexual relations with a girl under the age of under a certain age and that was different in different states now that whole charge i 'm not saying that it didn 't have sexual relations with girls under a certain age but that particular charge was trumped up by the um by the la attorney 's office they needed they wanted to they wanted to to bring hollywood down hollywood was too big and too big it down so they um they decided to go for the biggest and most vulnerable star in the in the biggest and most vulnerable stable which is warner brothers was the biggest thing in the miraculous newspapers for weeks on end it was bigger than the second world war all because of errol flynn so he had a pretty rough trop of it during the war after the war um after the war his career went into decline slowly but inexorably so by the time 1958 came around he was um he was in desperate need of money which is why he went down to um when he went down to cuba fidel castro for his part you want to hear about fidel now the deli 1958 was not the fidel of 1959 and certainly not the fidel of about 1960 or 61. the fidel of 1958 was a young man who a young revolutionary man who was not a communist he he um he was interested in marx but that was about as far as it went he was not a communist and in fact um claimed he could a communist i went to a jesuit school do you want me to renounce god to be a communist i couldn 't possibly do that um he was a nationalist in the old and the old terminology he was a left-wing nationalist in other words he was he was someone who just wanted to um throw off the colonial yoke of cuba cuba had been a colony of spain for 400 years in um 1899 1900 they theoretically they threw off that yoke and became an independent company but all they did was swap spain for america america became it 's that 's colonial power for the next um what 50 60 years anything that was worth owning in cuba was owned by either the americans by american companies or the mafia or people with american connections or stooges for the american mafia or stooges for american companies it was all controlled by america as south america was batista of course was propped up by the americans he 'd been there for ages he 'd been there two or three times over the course of 30 years he of course he wasn 't a communist the americans would support him they the americans were always distrustful of fidel castro even though fidel castro up until 1958-59 up until 1959 final castro was a great admirer of america franklin roosevelt was his hero he wrote to franklin roosevelt when he was about 13 years of age he wrote them a fan letter which is in the library of congress they found it sometime later sometime after fidel became famous they found this this letter among roosevelt 's fdr 's um private papers a fan letter from um from fidel castro asked him for a signed photograph a really great photo that he said to him which was never was so he was he was an admirer of america he wanted to he wanted to you know uh to give cuba um its independence its uh declaration of independence the way that america had done from from great britain but america didn 't trust it because anyone who was anyone who was rebellious in this south of florida had to be a communist so they were prepared to back anyone uh who when he achieved that victory in 958 959 junior 's day he one of the one of the first things he did over the course of the next 12 months was nationalize the important industries of cuba now he always he always maintained that he was going to uh recompense the the original owners of those things like the the sugar companies the uh united fruit companies the biggest sugar company um the telephone companies the mining companies all the major utilities these were all foreign owned he always said he was going to recompense them but because he had no money in the treasury no because batista had taken it all so over a course of time over the course of a matter of months he went to he went to the americans and asked them for um for loads for um for assistance for grants etc well the americans well you 're a communist you 're you 're sorry you have you know we don 't trust you you 've nationalized all our industries he said yes but once once i once went back i think that will what he wanted out of the americans uh within about 12 months of course the russians said we 'll give you whatever you want now so that 's why by about 1960 fidel castro became a proclaimed communist and was a completely different person to the fidel castro of 1958 he was a naive struggling young student who 'd spent five years in the um he 's been five years the previous five years he spent at the sierra in the mountains in the jungle before that he had spent um about a year in mexico in exile before that he spent two years in prison and before that he was a very young revolutionary um who attacked a barracks in santiago to cuba trying to set up the revolution uh with about what 80 men they attacked a barracks most of them got wiped out fidel and his brother raul were thrown into jail for um uh well they 're thrown into java for a long period of time but eventually they were released after only two years but they were banished from the country from the country they them the sanctuary in mexico and that 's where we got che guevara and that 's where he spent the next 12 months organizing his uh these next revolutions so he was an idealistic young man not like the fidel castro of 1960 the fidel castro i write about is the idealistic young man when fidel and errol came together the reason they came together because earl needed fidel to i would you want to meet fidel because fedor was a genuine hero and he was always the artificial hero he liked he liked he liked to be associated with genuine heroes so he wanted he wanted and he also needed um he also needed the um fidel 's approval to shoot the i mean film the um that was in the revolution to make his film from fidel 's point of view he wanted to meet earl flynn because he was an unknown at that stage outside of cuba no one knew who he was uh he was just a one of many rebels who were that have been in cuba over the years and this one was up flynn as perhaps a means of getting publicity he wanted to be on the front pages of papers he had been before he liked it he 'd been on front page and new york times twice and he liked that sort of publicity but now he wanted to be on television he wanted to be on the humpty brick be programmed he wanted to be on the ed murrow program he wanted to be taken seriously as a as a revolutionary uh perhaps errol flynn the famous errol flynn was a means of him doing that that 's why he was attracted to them but went to errol but when you think about the nature of these two men um there was always going to be conflict there was always going to be conflict they would be attracted but like the aging stag and the young buck which is the metaphor i use all the time they are bound to to butt heads together and to come into conflict and as drama is conflict that was the basis for a really good story that 's uh perhaps now if you but um i 'll try and answer any of your questions about uh about the story um don 't go too deeply into a cube of politics because i 'm not interested in cuban politics these days i 've been doing cuban politics at the time of the revolution uh cuban politics these days is it 's a bit of a bit of a strange one but um 1958 959 it was very straightforward and easy to understand yeah it was after that other talk again it 's interesting to see how an arthur talks and whether they repeat like a lot of academics do you know they get onto a full bottle of their interest and they 're sure a lady said to me um after the customs house that he one of those friends and to me how did he win it off as a lie but it might have been like uh per scalia or something you know like a big game oh a bit before his time i think before he was like this he was yeah yes he did well this is what he said was a he was only in his twenties um he probably stumbled into a card game and next thing you know he 's won a boat now that 's the sort of thing that used to happen to him he was when i say he went looking for adventure this was a daily occurrence with him he used to he used to go into a bar and um end up in a brawl now he didn 't go in there throwing his weight around it 's just often you know often fool stars these days or celebrities these days you talk about rugby league players they go into bars and someone picks on them because you 're you know someone says you 're not so tough the next thing you know there 's a fight well that used to happen to him he would go into a bar and he was famous for being this sword fighter this fighter you know uh in so many hollywood films so next thing know someone 's up there saying you 're not so tough well he could not resist a challenge now there this was written by uh david niven i 'm probably repeating myself now this is written by david niven in his uh second book his first book was called the moons of balloon and the second one called bring on the empty horses now bring on the empty horses is uh is a quote from um an errol flynn film called charge of the light brigade it 's a quote by michael curtis the director michael curtis directed errol cleaning i 'm not sure about 10 films and they did not like one another they once again banned these two flat heads and um he was he was the man who made him a star he he directed uh captain blood he directed um oh well this one the white brigade uh he most of many of his top films were directed by michael curtis now michael curtis was a hungarian he had um he had broken english um and he used to rub arrow up the wrong way and it all used to rub him up the wrong way so were constantly bickering on the set now during the actual charge of course you 've got 500 horsemen you 've got 500 mounted horsemen now there 's errol flynn up the front as he has to be he 's a good horseman he 's on the front there 's david niven just behind him there 's uh a lot of stunt men you know really really good riders from westerns and so on all the stuntmen and then behind that you 've got uh i don 't know members of the us cavalry who knows a lot of other you know a lot of other uh mounted men or men mounted on horses while they 're always up the front there one of the stuntmen a very rough tough guy cowboy radio rider you know steer wrestler and all that sort of stuff he decided you know he decided he was going to um tickle errol flynn 's fancy he had a lance and what he did was tickle the horse 's fancy with the end of his lats now the horse like that off whenever i flip onto the onto his back errol got up and said who guy said me what are you going to do about it well this that fellow got carved off the hospital and the whole thing got back on his horse and did the ceiling now errol flynn used to get into barbed walls but it was not always of his doing but it often was um and he rarely came out second best in his book my wicked wicked weights and talks about going to shore sure you know shore school um he was expelled from there as he was from a number of schools but he talks about going there and of course he wasn 't the biggest boy in the school but he was very athletic he was the school the school swimming champion the school tennis champion et cetera so you won 't find this you won 't find this on any uh honor boards at shore they rubbed his name out there they they disowned him but um he uh the the school bully decided to pick on errol well in his book my wicked wicked ways he describes this fight now once again even if only that takes place down at blue 's point on mars point they went down there and fought on the edge of the harbour and ended up in the water and butter nearly got drowned but errol didn 't won he rarely walked away from the fight until he had won so um the card going to get back to your question about the card game uh it 's the sort of thing that he might have found himself in without um without even without even uh you know certainly not aiming to be in it but just found himself in it uh he says he won a boat and on that boat he sailed up he recruited a crew and sailed up the um the east coast of australia i just i thought just came to me now that being a such a prominent vessel as it was it 'd probably be a list of who owned it at well that particular vessel is not the big that not necessarily that was his first vessel and he caught it was called the sirocco but it wasn 't the soraka we ship on in the australian but then i don 't know what happened to that he sold it he lost it it sank i don 't know and then he took myself off to europe and then up and america when he got to america he bought himself a new boat and he called it zrocco now uh any sailor will tell you you don 't change the name of the boat well he changed the name of that boat whatever it was he called it the sirocco and he had a lot of trouble with that boat and i think he lost that boat was it a storm or something then he bought a boat called the zappa and he kept the name of the zakar i don 't know i can 't know what sucker means is some island or something something from the south of the south islands a name from south yard of god or something now uh that boat was 110 feet long was the biggest privately owned boat the biggest privately owned um pleasure craft in the world at that time 100 can put that boat for 10 or 15 years and that was the boat he used to escape on he he spent he spent a couple of years sailing all around the world you know lost in a drunken haze uh escaping from hollywood escaping from his wives escaping from responsibility and uh sailing around the world and as i say you know drunken stupa now that boat was also part of part of the story of his death that was one of the last assets he had he had some land in jamaica and he had um and he had this boat and finally he was going to sell that boat and he was going to sell that to someone in europe in vancouver he took himself up to vancouver to sell the boat and died on in vancouver the day after signing over the boat now the boat um ended up in the hands of um a middle eastern cotton tape of some sort now it 's still it 's been renovated a number of times and it 's it 's still around still around really history and part of rape trial statutory rap trial because that was supposed to be the venue for the incident um taking everything if sorry i was a small but the knowledge of votes around sydney is it 's probably something you do with your story uh probably if i really did yeah well maybe it 's not called the soraka anymore yeah this is 19 31 32. um well i suppose it was but in 1932 in the middle of the depression i mean the person who lost the boat i can 't i mean can 't_''_2288.64 imagine errol 's running down to the to the i don 't know the merchant shipping register and entering his name i think he 's probably on the boat not because if someone 's after him with a gun or not or something right that 's what i meant yeah could have and um the way he remembers errol flynn was that elephant wasn 't there for very long i didn 't think it was even here but when he left um he left still own own money to my partner 's father but he you never ever paid him and that 's the way he remembered it well look yes that was what it was like that was one of the many flaws in his character um a lovable rogue and unreliable now david niven talks about him being unreliable um i think by the time david didn 't wrote his books which was 15 years after earl died he didn 't necessarily remembering all that bonding they obviously are falling out because david nevin doesn 't feature very much in earl 's own book and i think they they shared a house together uh in santa monica or malibu and it was called um they called the house cirrhosis by the sea so it gives you an idea of what the lifestyle of those who are relevant to that particular um that particular story you have when they uh that was a rent of the house it was rented from another big hollywood star and um because errol was on the bigger contract and david niven was a was a lesser he was a second second string star errol i said he would he have the biggest of the bedrooms so um david nevin had a small bedroom apparently i mean i 've seen pictures of his house it 's not a small house but obviously more than two bedrooms but i don 't know maybe the others will turn into bars or something but david nimman 's room was uh wasn 't small enough for his trysts so he used to come to an arrangement with errol you 'd say can i have your room tonight and errol would say certainly you can old boy and then he would adjust their rent accordingly i 've heard another story i 've heard another story this was said to me by someone um very kindly sent me an excerpt out of his um out of his great grand his grandfather 's diary his grandfather 's dad his grandfather was um was a recruiter in uh up in loganville or new britain as it was then and um that 's where errol was at one stage a recruiter was someone who went off to into the villages and found uh young men to work the copper one term for blackbird is another term for it because often they used to kidnap them i mean they used to call them cannabis if you remember they were called kanakas anyone of an island anyone who has had an island or background either anywhere in the uh in the south pacific new mia new hebris new britain uh anyone who was uh recruited into um into the cane fields the copper plantations and so on they called them kanakas now often these people were not recruited they were they were shanghai now errol there 's a this fellow tells the story of how errol as a recruiter went into a village and um he came he went to the head to the to the head man now you understand that these villagers had no idea how how money came because they used to they used to battle this to trade in beets i don 't know you know copra coconut people pigs well they used to get uh coins used to get um silver and gold coins so they never knew where these coins came from they thought you grows on trees or you dig it up out of the ground or whatever well errol went there and he had a cigar box that probably was a monopole magnum box and he he put a he fiddled with this thing and put a put a a a winder on it and a little mouth and uh you would wind it half a dozen times and a coin would pop out a floor a flooring would pop out so he went up to the chief and um and uh he didn 't say he was there he said he was there to buy you know to buy things to buy jungle produce from them and then he ran out of money said oh i haven 't got any more money to buy any more anything else so i 'll tell you what i 'll get my money making machine and or box makeover and he um he proceeded to make some coins and of course the chief was the chief suddenly saw oh here it is this is the you know this is the pot of gold at the end his money from so um he said uh he said what can i give you for that machine he said i couldn 't see that machine he said well i 'll give you anything to that machine he said all right how about 50 of your strongest young men so that she organized 50 of you strongest young men errol gave him that took off very quickly before the chief managed to fund it now that is there 's a lovable rogue but absolute bastard when it comes to some things he 's a real column yes yes that 's right that 's right knew exactly what he was doing of course he did yeah yeah are you still married did your interest come from um an interest in ever flynn or from pubert where did you come across well that 's as interesting i was in the middle of writing another manuscript which was using errol flynn as a basis for a character now when i say that you know how characters you draw from many from many other countries many other real people you take characteristics from certain particular character was probably about 50 percent errol slim without the um without the condom without the absolute bastard without the independability underpinnability without the film star without the job as a film star but the athleticism and the charm and the looks um those on the positive side of the ledger they were the characteristics that i was building into a character he had his flaws as well my character had flaws as well but they weren 't the same forces and i happened to be watching a documentary as research for this for this other manuscript and i saw a documentary it 's an australian produced documentary called um uh tasmanian devil the wife and tires of errol flynn the tasmanian devil was its major title and i so i watched i watched there was nothing everybody didn 't know um but um i mean if you read my wicked wicked ways this is there 's a story or and if you read um david niven and a couple of other books of your conrad book you 'll find the other side of the other side of the uh so there was nothing i didn 't know in the documentary until it got to the end where it sent this you know he went down to cuba for an adventure to make this film and um when cuba when cuba fell it was earl flynn who released the story to the world now that was that was where i uh that was when my interest was spiked i found myself i was looking into that looking more and more into it what i was fascinated by was yes the the the um the preposterousness of this this this meeting but then i felt that actually it was these were two men who were destined to come together given the opportunity they were destined to be attracted to one another and that 's where i was really interested so i put the other manuscript aside and then wrote this one so the other manuscript is now finished that one comes out next year and i 've had to go back and have to go back and fiddle with the character not to make it too much thank you and i 've been to this talk by this photo to you and errol through the guy said yeah he was a gold miner he was he was the manager of a copper plantation or copper one you know copper plantation sorry he was the manager of a copper plantation he had a gold mine but he made more from selling his gold minded information digging up picking up um digging up gold there was a mountain up there with little men scurrying all over and he didn 't want to be one of those so he probably caught someone else into buying this girlfriend but it was in between it was in between two big minds and they wanted to join them together i think and so it was actually part of even though the gold is worth a lot of money oh you know the subject no i just really i think it was mentioned i wanted to know where and how did he fit was it three marriages where do the women that he married come into his whole story did he ever settle down or was he where were the women well the first one he married lilly demeter and uh patrice weinwald that was the that was the one that was the third one she was the third that 's right now he met lily demeter on the boat coming from um from london from europe to um to america he come a long story short he found himself in london when he was in his early 30s in a repertory in a northampton repertory company he was a reference reactor which is he did that for about 18 months now that there 's a book actually being written uh called um i can 't remember what it 's called but it 's essentially the story of errol flynn 's time with the northampton repertory company now he he if you know anything about repertory acting or repertory companies um they do standard classic plays and the actors are a different character in a different play every night so you you learn very quickly you learn to learn your lines and you learn to you learn stagecraft very quickly he was seen over there by a so he he was on a boat over to america he met lily demeter now has anyone ever heard of lily demeter not just from reading oh my goodness in 1932 was the biggest female star in hollywood now she you 're never here ever now but she was she was french she was absolutely gorgeous and she was a huge hollywood star now she met earl slim he was a nobody but they had an affair on the boat uh next thing you know he 's living with her he 's a struggling actor she 's a big hollywood star and then about 12 months later he did captain bloods plucked out of obscure conversely to do captain blood and um he became a huge star well something he was a bigger star than lily so newly decided well i can 't compete with that so i 'm not going to be happy i 'm going to retire from hollywood live off errol then now when i say live off errol thing i use that term advisedly because she took him for everything he had after they divorced she the day he died she was still after his assets and she got most of them um that was his first wife now he had a tempestuous relationship with louis domita and he was one of the reasons he took he says he took himself off to the spanish civil war was to get away from living little as he told him uh i can 't remember when he divorced her but then the the um uh the second wife now once again if someone had made this up wouldn 't believe it he said in the middle of his rape trial in los angeles there was a uh there was a sagas or a tobacco cigarette store outside the um outside the courthouse and there was a young 18 year old woman serving in that um in that um in a cigarette store her name was um forgotten her name uh she became his second wife he struck up a relationship with her in the middle of his rape trial and her father was a police sergeant so um he struck a relationship anyway he struck a relationship with a few years but i mean none of our things that marriage has really lasted beyond the honeymoon uh after that it was off for a couple of years uh then he divorced her or they divorced and his third wife patrice weimore he met on a film called rocky mountain which was she was always in western movies yes well this was one of her first films so uh and she came from uh she came from a respectable family on the east coast somewhere uh and when they heard that you know she was she that errol singer was sniffing around and so on because the family was found very suss about the whole thing but uh he managed to charm them of course and she became his uh his third wife patrice he was still married to her when he died they weren 't living together she was living in jamaica by those days but he bought a lot of property in jamaica he had a hotel there at one stage um and he was that was as much home as anywhere in the world by that apart from being a con man and a charmer he did have he did make money along the way oh yes he was very high and he lost everything he was very he was one of the highest paid in hollywood in those days the studio system you were paid a weekly salary worth paid per bill you paid a weekly salary and this was one of the highest in hollywood for some years it was the highest yes but he um he wasn 't he he didn 't invest wisely i mean he lived in the hollywood hills you know up in mulholland drive and he had a lovely house up there that house has been owned by so it 's still there it 's been owned by several thorn stars since it 's always been known as earl flynn 's home and that was his favorite house he lived in that place for many many years well lilly ended up with that by about 1955 which by this stage he was on to his third wife and lilly ended up with that house and back back in french a primary school the whole lot yeah most of his most of his secondary schooling was um outside of tasmania uh when he wasn 't sure he was aboard and his parents were in um we 're in europe his father was a professor of marine biology at trinity college in dublin his mother was cavorting around europe now his mother had a reputation like his for being um uh victorious notorious she was there for being victorious she had affairs all over europe so look he had he had a a terrible relationship with his mother once again he was doing this now that 's probably where it all came from you know if you 're a black slave brother well he did and there 's probably a lot of truth in it um and that 's not her fault that 's that 's the fault of both of them but but he felt that she had deserted him he said that one day she said um what do i know about love you learn love in the cradle right so what would i know about it and it really that 's a that 's a that 's a telling insight into into his problems um he says also that he was always he was always running away from his mother but he was always trying to find her so the relationships he had you know i 'm not a psychologist but the relationship he had were trying to find his uh trying to find his mother but his actual mother he was always trying to escape from that would have been a security thing knowing she was still there yes and he tried and also that he tried i think in the other women he was looking for his mother for look for his ideal mother the way he the way he wanted his mother to be and of course no woman ever can ever can ever do that for you for him nobody ever do that so um that 's why his relationship never lasted and he was the only child no he had a sister but she never heard much about her he never never talked about it but she was there he she used to hotel in jamaica his parents used to visit him out there quite a lot and his mother would come and try to take over the hotel and once again he 'd get in his plane or on his boat and disappear couldn 't take it anymore because his mother would be there telling everyone what to do um and his sister used to visit him in jamaica as well that 's about the only time he ever talks about his sister his younger sister but getting back to the um what was the question before that it was um about school about school sorry about schools um so while while they were in europe he went to boarding school in london a couple of boarding schools it was not in london one in london one outside of london um and then he went to shore he was sent back because he got expelled from the ones in the uk they sent him to shore he got into shore even with his record because of his father you know the the emeritus professor uh ceo flynn so that 's how he yes he only lasted there less than a year and he was expelled for um interfering with well i shouldn 't say he was she was interfering with him the laundry mate he was twice his age he got into trouble with the laundry mate who was twice his age and he got expelled he got caught the way he explains it the way he explains it in his book uh he used to jump out of his door which was a bit up from the ground on the first floor he used to jump out and go and and rendezvous with with the laundry made and one of his nemesis at uh in the school probably the bully that he had the big fight with put some corrugated iron under the window so when he jumped out it made a hell of a and worked the whole dormitory up and that 's how he got caught so he was 50 when he died last year okay last year was the 100th anniversary of his birth and the 50th anniversary of his death um i don 't know if you down in hobart and his daughter one of his daughters came out we didn 't have children yes oh yes he had four children that 's what he was doing he had four uh there 's two there 's two who are still alive his eldest was by louis demeter sean sean finn he became he was as good looking as his father he was a gorgeous boy he went uh he became a photojournalist he went to vietnam and disappeared in cambodia uh if you 've seen apocalypse now the character played by a character played by dennis hopper if you remember dennis hopper when they sat up the river into that mad house with all the shrunken heads and so on and dennis hopper 's running around with the camera that 's based on shawn characters based on sean flynn uh yeah so he died in about 1970-71 and lily dementor never gave up looking for it because she disappeared you know they say they think they found these barns earlier this year or last year they think they found his skeleton but she never stopped looking for to find trying to find him um he 's set with his second wife uh nora nora ellington that 's his second wife 's name his second wife nora he had um two daughters two daughters and they are still alive and then with his third wife patricia had one daughter who died who died i think in about about 10 15 years ago she died of problems associated with drugs so i guess that was hereditary because errol wasn 't errol it wasn 't just the alcohol errol was a was a drug he abused any drug he could find yeah any drug he was a morphing he was a he was a morphine addict up until the day he died oh really the way he described it in the book he used to yesterday he got home during the during the seven world war towards the end of the second world war they um they used to the army uh used to make these little cigarettes they called little like little one one-time needles with morphine for the really bad cases when someone uh had a really bad serrated morphine and that would eventually so they could stand the pain until they died they didn 't die in pain that 's essentially what it was for well he got himself a supply of these after the war and they lasted them for quite a while i 'm not sure what the use by date was but you had them for quite a while so he became when he became addicted to morphine um it didn 't cause him problems because he had money oh yeah you wouldn 't want to sort of get too close i wouldn 't think well see that 's right now if you think again fidel castro that 's someone you don 't want to get to that was someone you don 't want to get questioned either for different reasons for different reasons but when fidel first got power um you know the old story about divide and conquer uh if anyone if anyone got a little power he would cut them down he would he was constantly changing the ministry change eventually chevrolet couldn 't stand it anymore he left and that other places and ended up in bolivia but essentially he couldn 't stand dealing with fidel castro 's ego anymore now i don 't think i mean everyone 's got an ego obviously but i don 't think errol speaker was his fatal flaw he had many other fatal flaws but i don 't think it was his ego he was he was um or he 's fatal for women and drugs addictions yeah he was a addiction to his fatal floor and he was addicted to women he was addicted to drugs he was addicted to um to adventure waves would you say you 're actually true like because i haven 't pretty much into that but obviously it 's very sensationalized a lot of it but i mean even just uh i mean the whole section on seven seas to england going from australia you read some of that you 're not sure what well if you remember he says and he says in that book in my wicked wicked ways he says when i arrived in hollywood and the and i told my story to the publicity story to create a background story for the private life with him with him they were hired to put a lid on it so the story wouldn 't get out yes when he went from um from australia to europe and he traveled all around the place with a guy he calls in the book he calls him victor palin curse victor victor kurtz now that 's not his real name yeah no it hasn 't a forward or like that what his real name was and you 've got the new edition yeah yeah you 've got audition with the uh forward written by your conrad yes yeah oil connor was his guest writer for mommy where your wife 's that 's right um yeah kurtz wasn 't his real name uh because kurtz was a nazi and um i think he wanted to um errol was a bit you know he was a bit i suppose sensitive about being associated with some of his of his reputation which is part of which is the reason why that book was written in the 70s that said he was a of time with this with this very good friend of his traveling around the world who was a nazi and they went to the spanish war together yeah without being in the book where it signed gun from ghosts i arrived tomorrow with a thousand monkeys in that 's all it said in the note and then you arrived the next day in the metropolitan spanish war yeah and kurt 's church 's sympathies were on the other side and the errols were on the loyalist side he 's israel with franco in fact he was he was probably there on a mission you know the kurtz or whatever his name was character yeah um he uh he uh the adventures that he went that he he writes about in the book look a lot of people say you can take half of all the grave with a great assault uh and maybe that 's true but if only half of them are true it 's fascinating yeah but even more like because what the war that he said they joining up in the japanese yeah in china yeah i in china and so on well who knows look even even before he left he says he was involved with the razor gangs in sydney now in the 1920s uh he 's writing his book in 1958 in jamaica it 's a long way from sydney in 1925. did you say anything yeah exactly and everyone knew anyone who was in sydney in the 1920s knew about the razor gangs and you didn 't mess with them but up but you know 1950s in on the other side of the world he 's never going to check it out so i i take the razor i don 't know the razor thing and he said he looked into the main i think it was well for sure he was afraid to tell his parents that he 'd been expelled from around the school he was about 16 by then he was probably his last year of school so he didn 't see what would have been the leaving certificate because he just took off he would not have got it anywhere no that 's right uh and he always regretted seriously and he educated himself uh and he became um he became a he became an amateur classical scholar um very much an amateur but he when he was on the um up in new britain living on a copper plantation there was no one to talk to he was there by himself with a lot of the plantation workers who spoke only broken pigeon english and uh so he couldn 't there was no one to talk to so he got books sent out to him from libraries and by his father and so on and he sat there with all the greeks he literal french humans all the german forces and so on and so on so he educated himself and as a result of that he was always he always regretted the fact that he had never he 'd never taken uh formal education seriously by then it was too late in fact one of the reasons he ended up in the uk was he thought he might be able to block his way into her into one of the universities well that didn 't happen but i didn 't realize you know i mean i knew a little bit about his background because i 'm not exactly young so i always sort of follow me through some of these movies but i didn 't realize all this background the first film he made the first film he made was called in the wake of the bounty was made by charles treville if anyone knows anything about australian film history charles treville um while errol was sailing up the east coast of australia in that boat that he um that he wanted didn 't he get the command orpheum going errol won this boat in the car game that we talked about earlier and sailed up the east coast of australia and got into difficulties um in a storm or in the background or whatever uh and that story ended up in in the papers in melbourne uh and there was a picture you can if you search long enough you 'll find the picture uh if you if you google one you know if you 'll find it there 's a picture of these men on four of them and one of them is earl 's in and he looks like your classic um swashbuckling sandal that in those days he was i don 't know he was in his twenties and he was just a um just a an adventurer charles chavel saw that picture and uh arranged to get a screen test eventually got in touch with him and arranged for him to do a screen test for his film in the wake of the bounty and that 's how earthling ended up playing um such a christian he had no acting experience and if you 've ever seen that film you don 't find that difficult to believe because it 's an awful performance it 's uh you know it 's one of those shot shot window dummy performances some would say he did that a lot throughout his career but uh he was but he had the looks and that was all that mattered so he decided he liked this acting like so he decided he was going to take himself up to europe maybe he could get a job acting maybe i can just have an adventure and that 's when you get hooked just hooked up with this guy kurt 's so-called kurtz and they travel all around the place all through asia and china and india and the middle east and they end up in they end up in europe they 're heads up in london next thing that he 'd be probably blocks his way into a regulatory company yes of course i was the star of the film and so then he had the looks and he was packed for 50 years uh then he made a couple of other big films charge of the light brigade robin hook was about 1938 by then he was the he was the biggest star in hollywood but he wasn 't the first choice for robin now this is one of the first ever color films not the first but the first big color film um the first choice if you can get your mind around it was james cagney oh get out of here i suppose the reason they saw that because he was a dancer he was a uh where he plays george and curry yankee doodle dan he 's a good dancer uh now we 're all thinking as well as well but he was a good dancer but um i kind of cagney uh he wasn 't awesome he wasn 't the first choice for um captain blood the first choice was um robert downer because he was quite beat in the english star um yeah so robin hood was about 1938 and of course it became the classic robin hood there has to be about 10 films made about robin hood didn 't you show that recently on television well probably because the russell profile the russell yeah you did it back in the summer you were looking for a quick writer yeah who would you cast interesting you should say that because my son is a film student and i asked him exactly that question i said who and he because um i 've been talking about with a couple of colleagues and um the best we came up with but the best we came up with at that time was um but he athleticism the physical i mean to walk all your eyes to turn you just have that magnetism about it um which is very difficult to find you know in you know who also has athletic ability but when you think about 90 this is 1958 he doesn 't have any of that athletic ability he 's also was a man who was who had um was very strong a very strong vein of self-deprecating humor he was never afraid to take the missing of the mickey out of himself um so anyway i put this to my son and he said we 're giving about two seconds thought said george clooney he 's the only person he 's the only person the only big hollywood person who could who has that chance has that ability when he walks into a room to make all your eyes to it not athletic no i 'm going to say this that 's right and then for i reckon any spanish actor would love to play um spanish media would love to play orchestra especially fidel castro at 1958 959 when he really was tyrant before he turned it before do you bring kennedy into any of them the fidel castro involvement in the story finishes in the middle of 1959 which is where he makes his first trip to new york after the revolution he went to new york on the at the invitation of uh what is essentially called the essentially the national press club on which water was called the the press association of america invited phil castro he was not invited by the american government president eisenhower made sure he wasn 't in town we 're not to play golf whenever whatever for fidel castro was around he made sure he wasn 't around um that 's as far as i take the orchestra on the book errol flynn lasts for another six months another four or five months which is when he dies the book finishes uh christmas 1959 so kennedy wasn 't even wasn 't even running for president he was still an obscure senator from mata massachusetts no but they they did um now the thing that the thing about um was he uh with their own castro was charmed by him but um shanghaira never trusted him uh they were they were there were meetings and i do have a meeting of uh uh flynn and checkerboard in the book just so i can express that that thought that that jackavara was a much smarter man than fidel was at that stage and uh he didn 't trust him i 'd just read them together you had to do more research and write a continuation yeah part two were you difficult ah well that 's see america this is the thing is that when it comes to people castro americans have covered the covered the waterfront with fidel castro from nine from 1960 on from the time he was in the time he was uh he was regarded as being communist and um and a person of um a person of no interest and the embargo was with the embargo in 1961 and the fatal pigs and so on castro has been covered by thousands of american writers i don 't think there 's anything i could write about federal castro was not already covered what no secret that earl flynn had met with castro although it was no secret no one had ever written more than a couple of paragraphs about it because no one was talking about it errol flynn when he came when he got back to america after being chased out of cuba when he got back to america he was happy to talk it up now the way he made money in those days this is the last 12 months of his life was guest appearances on television programs uh watched my line and front-face challenge and things like that so he was happy to talk up his connection with fidel castro fidel castro for his part when uh straight after the revolution when the americans poured into cuba when the foreign correspondents brought in federer was happy to say yes but uh el ilfin was with us a couple of days later he was saying he 'd never heard of him so it was a big falling out between the two men so fidel wasn 't talking about it elle was dead no one asked me what the story was was front page news this front burst news for a little while and then it just died lack of oxygen thank you you _"

    "text": "thank you very much a becoming iron terribly started the men who 've been dragged here by there was to discover what they are necessary but to apologize a normal rules apply if you don 't like anything I say feel free to remove your Footwear and throw it at me as is the current etiquette now this is a this is a comedy book and in a way that genre is an expression of my life which is always kind of expressed itself as low comedy rather than sad tragedy its beard between the two in the sense that my mother left our family when I was 14 she ran out and that is this kind of sad tragedy except that she played it out as low comedy by running away with my English teacher who she 'd met a parent teacher which somehow makes it work to do I don 't know why makes it was and if you think that 's not a sad if you think that 's a you know sad tragedy rather than funny then my fellow classmates disagree they thought it was hilarious this event that momentarily he left the house too he can 't went back to England and in the end I must say he installed a friend of his talk after me and in the very end he came back but it was a little bit weird at age 14 being kind of left you know I must say a very nice middle-class house with a pool so this is not a windy story but at age 14 being left on on your owner took me a while to come to terms with this iron come I have come to terms with it now any people who whinge about their parents of my age is pathetic I agree with samuel butler to say anybody who is to still talking about what their parents did wrong when they 're even 35 needs to have a good hard look at themselves so I 'm not complaining about it but I think when I was younger I did sometimes you know week to my friends about what happened and this stopped after one friend said to me yeah yeah yeah you knew never so startlingly accurate that I stopped talking about it from from then I go you know I think it 's true that in that circumstance I was not the favorite I never felt like the favorite which is tough if you 're an only child but I can I came to turn fourth and it 's always only mentioned it now to say that it has informed my writing I think in the sense that i have spent 25 or 30 years writing about the minutiae I of an ordinary happy vaguely functional family and this is work that is regarded by most authors i think as beneath them to be friendly people love writing books about the top end of town about the Packers and the Murdochs and the politicians and and all you know the millionaires and people love writing books about the the bottom into town if you go to phil 's bookstore you know there 'll be shelves and shelves of underbelly books and crime books and violence books and divorce books and the sheer tedium of being alive books and so few books about the think the only wisdom I slightly unhappy childhood gives me is to say this is not bland and not worth writing about in fact the life that I 've enjoyed since I left home and since I found my own family is absolutely worth celebrating and writing about there 's a kind of a million books about dysfunctional families about families rent asunder by divorce and drugs and children wearing hoodies and the sheer evening me of being alive there are a million books about that and I don 't mean really to demean them because there are people whose lives are added by Oh drugs and divorce but 51% of us at least maybe it 's only a bare mind of majority but it 's a majorities and 51-percent of us sit down and look over the breakfast bar other person was shacked up with and think actually you 're all right actually actually you 're not so bad and we 've got it hopefully we 've got a cultural thing as a society now that all rolling our eyes about our teenage children and saying how herbal they 't terrible in some ways but we don 't really feel it do we we don 't_''_254.18 I think most of us don 't really believe that most of us look at our teenage children see them is they 're fantastic and the main thing would feel about them is we look in the mirror at our souls we think how did he or she turn out so good looking you know with this with this genetic with this genetic background and I just feel that in some ways that is worth recording that lest there should be one book that tries to capture these sort of families the families that most of us have the life that most of us live surely we deserve one book about the life that nearly everybody lives and so for the past 25 years I 've tried to capture the drama and the comedy in the slapstick and the tensions and the problems and the fun of a vaguely functional family the sort of thing that the sort of functional family I think probably most people is room at and the best response saying it felt like you had a tape recorder in our kitchen or it felt like you had a tape recorder in our car in other words that I 'm telling a common story a story that brings together all our lives and at the center at the center of the book of course in this case is this kind of strong vert verging on stroppy Australian woman called Jocasta you know a portrait of my wife Debra and I again I don 't think it 's it 's her in particular I think it 's an Australian type God you know thank you God for Australian women who are strong verging on the honest trophy that Debra wants me to say to you that she is nicer than Jocasta so I 've said she wanted me to tell you and I 've said it I disagree with that I feel I 'm the boss Walter third Johnson at the last 30 years I 've just run around after the writing down what she says and you know quite recently we had the global warming argument I don 't know house turning off all the heaters and all the lights and occasionally the computers there were a few lost essays but um but you know Deborah was running around the house freezing to death why you turn off all the heat is my son must I 'm a global warrior I 'm saving the planet you know I 've been to see a beat see you know and I 'm what 's got uncomfortable truth and yet he got da Vinci Apple I must turn off for all the all the heaters and she said you are so not a global war you just a mean tightwad it was found a new excuse for saving money yeah that is the inconvenient truth people would be offended by just write it down there were two good Jocasta line we had recently our 30 that we 're not married but 30th anniversary of getting together and went to town for a special dinner and all that sort of stuff and it is true i have put on a little bit of weight and and and and Debra 's eyes cast over my 've stuck with you through thin and write down does it right now um sometimes it 's more surrealistic we had to send the other day where she was stacking all the underwear and she was up to 12 pairs of my underpants which he was dutifully stacking one on another and she said exactly how many bottoms do you have for we 've also been through the experience recently of getting curtains and fabrics done I know if you 've had this same way you 've had to get new couch material and and Kurds but we are very fearful of that we kind of we don 't we know have any taste we pretend we do but we don 't and we never know what to do so he always been for 30 years we 've gone into these shops and we 've looked at all the things but in the end we looked at each other and so it 's just as easy to go page you know I can criticize you then so you know so few years we 've just fought the beige the beige this was the most recent time we went there was this a tragic moment where Deborah said the oatmeal years are over you know there 's a word to strike fear in your man 's heart I think a little fire going to be brave and so he chose this thing which was red like a Berlin brothel and yet also floral and so we had this installed in enormous expense Kurds and councils everything we 've done and then Deborah stood back and said I hate it it looks like a heart such a brothel and it was entirely accurate picture brothel so again I just bottled to the Johnson I just take a note of this it goes back years and years and years the first time virtually the first time we went away together we went camping and on we must have been I must 've been 21 and she was 20 and I we drove up to the country and I install the Tanners you do you know and then the user it 's always windy for some reason are you always doing it in the end up building this kind of construction of a tent and clambering into it in the near darkness and Deborah really did say and inadequate direction and inadequate erection no doubt the first of many you know I wasn 't_''_558.2 into the habit of writing it down in those days we had recently I think I told this story last time but does it go back three three or four years but we did the homebrew I don 't know if anyone else has done the homebrew but you get the keg of beer and you set it up around the house and you 've got to get it to the right temperature so you put in the front of the house it 's too cold to form any put it up the back and it 's too hot and it 's killing off the fermenting stuff so I finally found that the perfect temperature was in my sixteen-year-old my then 16 year old son 's bedroom so I cleared the homework off the desk and install the fermenting and Taub of liquor and Deborah hit the roof and said into a brewery i said no i must because the perfect temperature and she as punishment she made me sleep in there all night and you know it still doesn 't making I smell on it sounded like and I got up in the morning I said you know all night didn 't sleep a wink all night long next to this farting belching and top of the booze she said now you know how I feel most like he 's right take a note and write that as I sir I mean who when I was 20 years old and no longer for a meta I invited to to dinner which is a problem as I didn 't really know how to cook again I don 't mean to criticize my poor mother but growing up she never really cooked anything she just kind of burnt stuff and I ended up like Pavlov 's dog dinner became associated with the arrival of the local fire brigade and I still celibate slightly when I hear sirens and so I had no recipes and I was kind of living you know vegetarian hippie lifestyle for some reason and all I really knew how to cook with steamed vegetables and so this she was coming over for the first day and I thought I can 't stand victuals on osteen two sorts of vegetables broccoli and beans pretty good so I had this old beaten up steamer I had them ready to go that was going to be the meal the entire hunting over middle and I current wasn 't into drinking Rio smoked my head off but I wasn 't into drinks I didn 't have any alcohol at all and she turned and I was in kind of smelly teacher she turned out that she had a bottle of wine and she was all done up and had lipstick on which was rare and I thought she 's actually expecting quite a meal well I got his distinguish who I remember going into the kitchen and panic in thought what I do and thinking I know and going to the fitch and taking the eggs out and breaking an egg into the top mithi why she really is pretty sexy in it I 'll break two eggs spare no expense amazingly she didn 't stay that night it just shows you how incredibly difficult and picky Australian women are better than in the end I I did win her over and all these years on I think that so many of the kind of patterns that we go through the patterns that all people go through I mean maybe the men here could confirm that when the woman goes away on business or for a trip away there is the list is there not the list which goes you know take Jessica the cello practice put out the guard the garbage day as Thursday 's here is the phone number of a doctor you know the list and Jocasta 's version of the list is a large a4 sheet of paper closely typed with all the instructions for whilst using in Melbourne and it paints a portrait of me as a domestic incompetent who could hardly run his own shower nevermind a household feed the dog each evening is the opening Sally of advice then an afterthought in brackets to of the freezer and already she 's left me fears if I thaw the food before serving it why is that the second step and not the first step doesn 't she realize that men rarely repast the first instruction in any less and if she comes back on the dog of shattered teeth from eating frozen food sure there could hardly be my fault next up she offers some personal advice don 't drink on weeknights this is helpfully written in block capital letters no doubt so I can read it through any drinking juice haze should i neglect to see the note early in proceedings point three is a blizzard of instructions involving the washing and ironing of school uniforms and I find this particularly galling since I do most of the household ironing and washing and I feel she 's going to write notes in block capitals I want to send a fax if they still exist to her Melbourne hotel room in block capitals explaining where the ioun ears and how to turn it on just in case you ever want to user I also note despite my efforts of the ironing partly because the space cadet only has three shirts and two pairs of pants now I 'm unwilling to disclose who is in charge of school uniform purchasing in our family but the don 't think she 's done a very good job point for is again in block capitals and says don 't have an affair while I 'm away I assume this is meant to be a humorous aside since offers haven 't exactly been coming in thick and fast over the past 30 years since I spent all my time either at work commuting or ironing I wondered exactly when I 'm going to fit in a steamy affair but if anyone 's interested i have about five minutes free at about a quarter of a 7ex morning we then get on to food and it 's as if I 've never prepared a meal in my life there are lamb chops in the freezer the list says before adding the witheringly dismissive detail these are on the shelf not to be confused with the dog food and the freezer drawer about the list is that it paints it all to did a picture of the person Jocasta believe she lives with and incompetent dipsomaniac who is unable to pick the difference between a lamb chop and a chicken neck it 's clear what she thinks if it were for the list the boy and I would be sitting around the kitchen table human stinking rags me pissed out of my mind during our way through a plate of frozen dog food as I try to allocate the court of the seventh spot between the various girlfriends but despite this like most people I know I 've been made by her and I know she 's being made by me and it seems to me that there 's a part of our culture at the moment that seems to believe that the negative is somehow more authentic and real than the positive the oblique ending to a play or a film or a novel is somehow more brave than one in which the characters strive for some sort of redemption in the new book by the Booker Prize winner dbcp air smoking ruin rendered by capitalism as being a totally unlivable place in a state of terminal to kind of the book as Phil will know starts on the first page with a guy wanting to commit suicide and kind of goes downhill from there it 's incredibly bleak book and yet when I interviewed DBC appear on ABC radio recently he came into the studio charlie is anything his eyes sparkle he smiles he 's perfectly nice is perfectly contented and at that point you get a bit suspicious you know do they really believe the world is this blink as the world that they 're writing about if it 's not sincere what is it if they don 't really believe that the world is this awful if they believe that the world is fun and nice and they 're enjoying it why are they trying to tell the rest of us that somehow this is the more authentic version of reality and I look at books authors i really admire really at my math name is i 've read all these books i think he 's a fabulous Martin Amos crime is everywhere every Street has got a terrible murder on every every toilet block in a look like london field seems to have police gaffer tape around it because of some horrendous pedophilic murder if you really believe that London was as bad as Martin Ames writes it is in his books you would never put your foot outside the house maybe he hasn 't but I bet he has I bet he doesn 't really believe this and that 's what 's so interesting if we if we look at things like the crime rate in Martin Amis novels it is exactly the same image of London that you get in a tabloid newspaper like the London son so how can it be that from the highest of high art to the lowest of tabloid are the tabloid reporting it is the same image of a bleak strewn crime-ridden world and when the london sun or the daily telegraph or a Current Affair sees the world through this one-eyed lens we think it 's tabloid crap so how can it be that when we go to that same version of there the world is full of pedophiles and murderers how can we suddenly see those brave 19th century novelist never saw the world like this if you look at bowls like a Dickens and flow there their image of the world is full of criticism you know they see humanity is this terribly flawed thing often in a very dysfunctional society but they understand that humanity is the possibility of bettering itself and that there are positive forces at work and the novel is often often a kind of play between those two things and they 're striving four earned Redemption now I don 't want I don 't know what went wrong in our culture I think it might be I mean this sounds corny but I think it might be as easy as the fact that walt disney and other people created these Hollywood movies with manipulative happy endings mainly for a child audience and higher thought we don 't want to do that we don 't want to admit you know we all thought as audience members we don 't want to paste 't and we seem to throw out the baby with the bathwater and do away with the idea of an earned redemption for characters and so every time there 's a theater review in the paper it says I was a very good play was very bleak as if that 's all the reviewer has to say is to assure us it was really bleak and will understand all that 's good that 's great that 's sophisticated that 's afraid well you know no one in the 19th century would think that was sophisticated or brave they would think it was one note they would think it was reducing all of the world to pedophilia there is a moment in Australian theater now where you go and sit in the theater and you sit in the stalls and a go two minutes 20 minutes 20 incest you know every single play is about incest as if it 's the most common thing in the world no I 'm not saying we shouldn 't write about incest obviously but when the whole world is reduced to one quite rare crime to be full of the bar with girls you know dress striptease girls in a girly bar behind the detectives who are seriously discussing the case as you get in something like underbelly and you think if this was really real every seat you invaded by fruit vegetables in mosman this every single second shopfront would be a girly but we know that 's not true we know that 's not the world how the world actually is so why do we believe that in it that in this culture that bleak is brave and authentic when it 's actually just one note and tabloid so this process I think reached the low point in the recent federal election when politicians of both sides seriously went to Penrith and other seats on the edges of the big cities and assured the people that no one in the world had it worse off than them really Australians are the worst of people in the world and in terms of a strand no other generation of Australians has had it worse than you it was as if that moment when Malcolm Fraser all mocked him for it every politician since has thought well I 'm not going to fall for that I 'm going to tell them or how badly off they 've got it and so you had this obscenity really of this incredibly lucky country that we 've got it 's incredibly beautiful and prosperous and happy country we 've God being and our own politicians telling us that was crap and terrible at the same time as Pakistan was underwater with flooding Afghanistan was being shot to pieces and Europe was being fought by the global economic crisis it was sick it was obscene and it was part of this culture of bleakness whereby that seems to be the authentic thing and we seem to ignore the joys of the life that we all live through this book in a way isn 't is an antidote to all that I think it 's even more than that it 's a kind of define cry of rage about all of that it is saying that the middle class a functional happy family with all its dramas and comedy and slapstick to end with a bleak ending and that those of us who have been lucky enough to be blessed by living in the middle who have been lucky enough to have the suburbs a partner who we love kids if we are lucky we are blessed and at least we could do just occasionally is acknowledged it in our culture and give thanks for it and that 's the news from I just wanted to read you one of the pieces from the book if that 's all right and it 's very important again it 's called no no books can sell these days unless they 've got either vampires or Jane Austen in them and I found it very hard to work vampires into this book about abnormal Australian family life so I went to Jane Austen but this piece is called the Jane Austen guide to bus etiquette my bus trip is turning into a nightmare the young bloke behind me is appraising the recent sporting form of someone called Barry Hall who may possibly be a player of Australian rules football I can 't follow all inadequate the young bloke makes this point in a voice so loud that I fear the rivets may soon pop from the sides of the bus the f words are rising like a dark mist from the valley of the back seat and enveloping the rear rose a linguist could while away the hours studying the speech which despite going on for about 20 minutes consists of nothing save the term bearing hall and various versions of the F word rendered as verb noun adverb gerund and in one instance and adjective modifying a noun of the peculiarly female nature again I must mention the volume which has grown so loud that even the wheezing rattle of a Sydney bus has been turned into a distant background noise I tried to get back to my newspaper in which the economics editor is making a subtle point about international finance but I trial escape the young blokes tirade each f-word exploding with a plosive pop about 40 centimeters from my right ear drum I cannot turn around but I can envisage the speaker the man is so loud he must be position the organ and supply it with nutrients at last even he tires of the f-word and begins to search for a new term with which to express his displeasure finally he has a call is a the word strikes him as perfect not since Wordsworth chanced upon the term to cont to describe those merry daffodils has there been such a perfect meeting of word and thought in this man 's hands and all have suddenly become conjoined twins inseparable as they march through his newly invigorated match report I develop a knot of pain in my stomach at this point a decent bloke would turn around in his seat and say something a decent citizen would not let this language go unchallenged but does it really need to be me surely someone else on the bus would be better placed for instance someone who doesn 't mind getting his head punched in at 20 in the morning maybe if I just approach the man in his own language I practice the speech in my head g 'day mate I might begin or maybe just wanted a word with a bit of a worry that perhaps you wouldn 't mind I 'm rapidly overcome by fear and return to the newspaper even though i 'm a master of accents and brotherly bought for me it is faintly possible the man will spot that I 'm a yuppie banker who knows nothing about sport he may also be unimpressed by my desire to assist him in the development of a more extensive vocabulary I get back to the economics editor who is debating the effect of the European Community on credit markets but a final breaks through my concentration I snap turn round and let the young bloke habit I say old chap I tell him i wonder if you can give the word a bit of a rest there 's a good fellow somehow in the process of turning around to face him my matey admonishment has been forgotten instead I come over as some sort of 80 year old British Lord Hasan 's falls between us I can 't believe what I 've just said neither the other class British accent I 've adopted nor the favor cabaret there he is travelling on the four to six down city road and has just been verbally assaulted by Lord Peter Wimsey but here 's my point it works a treat he is so shocked by this gentleman 's club approach that he stops in his tracks lowers his eyes to the Florence 's yeah fair enough sorry for the rest of the trip the larynx is transformed into a little land sharing sotto voce observations with his power about the weekends fixtures I now see that this should be my approach to all societies annoyances treat everyone as if you are fellow guests at some sort of Jane Austen house party and they will naturally follow your lead I 've been boning up on my Jane Austen ready to let fly the next time someone uses their mobile phone Paolina restaurant I shall wander over with a twinkle in my eye I fear you have delighted us with your conversation too long or to a mother in the middle of Hyde Park selfishness must always be forgiven you know because there is no hook in your case of a machine it is a truth universally acknowledged that a man in one of a ticket should wait is really it could be only minutes before I had my hip smashed in until then pip pip old chaps do you have a question carry on hello well that 's a very slender part it 's a very slender part of the book the one in unnecessary it really comes from a book by Maureen Dowd the New York Times writer who published a book a couple of years ago which was titled our men necessary and Maureen Dowd Siri was this that changes in reproductive technology test tube babies and if I read or write the invention of the forklift have rendered men unnecessary and it is true i think that the two things that men were most confident to put on their business card were you know man call me for procreation or heavy lifting and no wonder people are very common and so both these things knocked out by technological change where did that leave us and so i try to come up in this in this book very reasons why men were indeed necessary and i think it took it didn 't come easily and I think rodent control is one of them and I know that women are happy women can of course kill rock mice and rats but do you want to West men i think want to it ends an evolution thing you know we were will be we evolved on the Savannah where we hunted down the woolly mammoth and killed it and cooked it and in a frenzy of kind of bloodlust of high-fat cuisine and this is kind of deep in our mail souls and we want to express his bloodlust of killing other animals and this is hard to if you live in a flat in Mars feel the chance to hunt the woolly mammoth doesn 't arise all the time in fact you know killing a cockroach with a rolled-up copy of men 's health is about as good as it gets companion planting to get rid of the aces that 's a kind of bloodlust is again sir and then killing killing rodents is good we like to do be allowed to do it and I think opening jam jars is quite good and I know you can get devices from hardware hell that allow you to do it now but I encourage you not to buy them because if your man is suitably dressed in a t-shirt when he does at the arm muscle does flex rather rather attractively when he does it was the third reason is probably tiramisu I was trying to explain this to our Spencer this morning but terani sue is a very important reason why men are still necessary because there 's a moment when you go to dinner together and you have your lovely main course and your wine and then the waiter comes up and he says would you like dessert and the woman says cook no not for them but you have sign and so the man says the way I car of the trauma suits next mode and the man the weighted or whatever you like to eat and the tree and the waiter brings the trauma so any places in front of the gentleman then the woman gets it 's the light and you know he 'll spray because the man is taking the moral responsibility for ordering the tribe you sue but the woman still gets to eat it and that is why we 're necessary question answer there is a full list in the in the book but I think that 's this what is necessary to decay while we well we are necessary still just Bible it has anyone else got a question please yes wondering has your cooking improved on your monitor is my cooking has improved my mother screen has improved but has not improved that no I think my cooking has improved I 've moved on from the from the steamed vegetables there 's a book there 's a person that book I you know like a lot of men I do cook I cook indoors of course but I I think that men do have a slightly more competitive attitude to cooking the women and we tend to go through the books and try to find the most impossible show of Western family possibly find and decide to cook that for men reading through the instructions so inevitably that 's that form weird what you got ten people arrived in for dinner and you 're going through the steps of this incredibly complex recipe that no on in their right mind would cook and the guests are about to arrive in about five miss you already bit piece because you 've been drinking the wine and you turn over the page and it says step 6 refrigerate overnight I think that 's the point I think I mean the other thing about Matt mins cooking is the kind of desire for praise and i always think there should be a men 's cookbook with you know how in those cookbooks ahead time it 's ben 's to time it takes to cook the recipe there 's a little clock with 30 minutes or 45 minutes and i think there should be a men 's cookbook where it says expected duration of praise there should be a cop you to look like anything this dish is so complicated you 'll have to praise him for three hours i always think there 's where you know the guests are saying it 's very nice and there 's all that kind of fishing for compliments which I overdid the car yet the lamb chops were bird weren 't they were then even though knows Marva steering sprayers browser and you still add it when they 're leaving you there they 're sort of heading down heading down the front stairs getting their car reversing down the driveway with a man saw but I overdid the sherry no Jerry but otherwise we 're fantastic course of course of course of course we are I want to read one more piece but is there another food before it exists without women can women exist without me we had a little competition on the radio and to try to pick up more than three reasons why men are necessary and the best one was the last one which was men are necessary in order to produce more beautiful women and I 'd suggest men women are necessary in order to produce more beautiful peace please brother please I wrote a piece done um for my my son pensioner tomorrow but recently he turned 18 and I tried to sum up all my life wisdom in a piece and I put it was published in The Sydney Morning Herald and lots of people read it and tried to force it on their 18 year old children I think all of us had the same experience that I have which is he didn 't read it and he still hasn 't but could I share it with you this is this is my life advice for my 88 year old son who may well get around to reading it when he 's a 32 I put it in the book as the last chapter only because I 'm hoping when he 's an elderly man feel free to follow k this is was my father 's advice which was designed to inform me all these years so advice for turning eight advice for a child turning 18 and as I say if you buy the book and you give it to an 18 or 21 year old if you can get them to read it you 're a better by people who are drunk or wired wake up before eight in the morning and get out into the daylight it 's better for your body clock don 't listen to both baby boomers who tell you you 've got to slow down and smell the roses they never took that advice when they were your age and neither should you throw yourself at life understand that your happiness is inextricably tied to the happiness of your life partner if she or he is not happy then you 'll not be happy don 't cross the road with your ipod on don 't buy cheap tools understand that the more people know about a subject the more humble they 'll sound if the share market is down and you have some spare cash by bhp shares and throw them in the bottom drawer this is all any Australian needs to know about the world of high finance exactly whiskey is always a mistake keep a torch in your glove box you have to be thinned wear horizontal stripes say done for things don 't buy anything requiring the loan accept is a tax on impatience if you constantly overdo the booze you 'll end up either dying or to give it up which would be a shame as wine is one of life 's pleasures people who spend excessive time on their appearance are almost never as interesting or as attractive as they think they are you are what you eat but also what you read and watch and hear don 't feed your brain with rubbish at least not all the time don 't be negative winching is for people who want to blame others for their troubles because it 's easier than finding their own way forward if a friend makes a habit of bad-mouthing other people take a moment to wonder what they say about you spend your mental energy on people who think you are terrific not people who dislike you tread carefully if a friend asks you to counsel them about their love life never agree with their assessment that their ex-partner is hard as they will make up the very next day never get into a fight with your neighbors apologize make peace buy lunch the way they treat the waiter is a better guide to their character than how they treat you clean your teeth back up your computer files don 't spend all day on a mobile because one day they will discover they really do rot your brain don 't be tight with your money when it comes to your friends or charity do be tight with your money when it comes to choosing brands in the supermarket in the absence of any compelling reasons by the second cheapest in any product range and while you may wish to advise to advertise the brand of Underpants that you 're wearing don 't expect anyone over 40 to be impressed surround yourself with people who bring out your best side people in whose company you become fabulous funny or wise avoid people in whose company you become boring or sad and remember the most important decision you 'll ever make isn 't about career or investments it 's your choice of life partner in that one choice will like much of your happiness a final point if you are lucky enough to one otherwise on the occasion of that child 18th birthday you may find you have nothing to decorate the booth and of course to write a list of 18 Britain 's purple turning 18 in this as in everything else that your own father errors and omissions be your guide happy birthday boy you _"

    "text": "hi there I 'm I mosman resident of 30 years and I think mossman is probably one of the greatest places in the world to live I didn 't live in Los well I certainly wouldn 't live in Sydney but mosman is different Muslim today is cosmopolitan society but the future of hospin I 'd say has many problems which have to be able to come by both the community and the council and the ongoing problem that everybody has accepted in mosman is the issue of traffic through traffic particularly on military and spit road which is an issue which the state government refuses to acknowledge at mosman council sees we 're doing the best they can and keeping pressure on the state government but within muscle itself the traffic and the parking through military road between spit road and Raglan street is something which the council should and will have to address because we 've actually reach gridlock situation there they must be alternatives to these traffic and parking problems in the business area of austin and i would hope over the next not even the next the council could address that cattle with that i personally would love to see a mainstream program for this length of a military road where we 've got it complete change of the infrastructure both foot pars parking landscaping and far more access for people and to make it a more pleasant experience for shopping and generally doing business in boston at the moment it is just a chaotic collection of bits and pieces of odd bits of landscaping and the like and it really does no theme wrong the right through it if console could see their way clear to getting some sort of government grant to do it are they going to be fantastic the other issue that I personally have for the future is just that the council keeps up its ongoing maintenance of infrastructure and i don 't mean by that dust living in trains and roads and the like but the the minor things traffic signs seating public garbage bins around public things which tend to get built and then left to deteriorate and it 's not under they actually fall apart of the council believed years to the residents of the municipality and firstly to the residents and secondly to the broader community and I think that the fact that the council does listen to the community is a good thing but I think I need to appeal to a broad a spectrum of the community to all generations as young and old and those who sort of fall between the cracks in the middle of people who don 't necessarily speak out but are probably the main beneficiaries of any activities of the council has it 's a great place to live it 's a great community spirit in mosman and I trust that the future will be only an improvement on what we 've got today thank you _"

    "text": "thank you for this opportunity to contribute on this subject at the age of 64 and in good health I find I do not have a niche in the present mosman council set up the 55 plus seniors quarterly published magazine offers me the opportunity to sit in league play cards etc the Ramblas club is just that Wranglers and the dance classes are not much faster therefore what do a quick thinking quick-moving young 64 is due in mossman i am a neighbor aid volunteer a community visitor and a tutor in computer hell but I have to leave mossman to find my own activity I play table tennis for seniors in Manly where there are 18 members one gentleman is even 91 and still plays successfully and also I play in worry wood where there are 20 very active members to join a walking club I attend Prouvost in waverton I want to strongly emphasize that my age group in mosman has been overlooked therefore I suggest for discussion the following points social I suggest table tennis for seniors be set up for both men and women aged 's a fun quick reflex and active game that helps to keep people young and alert anyone from 55 to 95 complete another suggestion is a walking club for seniors that want to walk and get their heart rate up you could utilize the beautiful walking tracks around mossman governance as a computer pals tutor it has been my absolute pleasure to teach senior citizens to use a computer and assist them in using these skills on their home computer however when they have a glitch at home with their printer or computer they come to a grinding halt unless they can be sorted out by their tutor or pay a very expensive commercial technician to visit their home I suggest the council set up a bank of fairly knowledgeable people who could be called on to visit these residents and have their computers running again perhaps with financial assistance to cover fuel costs I 'm not sure where to put this suggestion however I do believe something useful is needed to involve the retired seeing a men of our community many play bowls and assist with meals on wheels created where the men are made to feel productive again this concept needs to be overhauled I think as a days of making wooden toys is over perhaps making furniture for organizations such as rotary or lions that could be sent to third world countries could be researched hopefully these ideas will be a positive contribution to the discussion in mosman thank you and it Watson _"

    "text": "thank you very much bill and thank you everyone for being here it 's a pleasure to be back in the hospital library yes the publisher is quite ambiguous on the subject of my fiction it 's all right for every second book to be a level but we do need books that sell as well so what makes us tick have you ever asked yourself the question why did I do that it 's an extraordinary question isn 't it because you did it and so if you don 't know why you did it then perhaps no one does it 's true isn 't it that we 're often at a loss to explain why we 've done the things we 've done in order to understand why other people have done the things that they 've done especially if we judge our behavior to a bit reckless or irresponsible or inappropriate in some way well the thesis of this book really is that it 's no wonder we 're so often puzzled by our own behavior because almost everything we do is the product of a complicated in competition with each other for our attention what we do is the outcome of the interplay the interaction the contrast between those various desires so let me begin by running through the ten desires I don 't want to say too much about all of them or your motivation to buy the book might be diminished but I want to begin that they 're not in in order of importance except for the first one you 'll notice that in the book the chapters are not numbered and that 's because they 're not in order I don 't believe in the idea of a hierarchy of motivations or any of those things that some traditional areas of psychology have emphasized the first one I think is a sovereign but after that read them take them in any order you like and the first one is the desire to be taken seriously wherever you look in human behavior from war to seduction from graffiti artists to philanthropists from architects to humble authors there is always it seems to me in a magical mix of things that drive us there as a unique individual the desire to be noticed to be appreciated to be valued to be accepted perhaps even to be remembered some of you might recall an interview that Andrew Denton oddly enough rope program did last year with Helen bambor British campaigner for the care of torture victims and in this interview with with Denton Helen bambor described the experience of holding in her arms a woman who had just walked or crawled out of the Belsen concentration camp when Bilson was liberated that at the end of World War two Helen bamboo cradled this poor woman in her arms while the woman rasped out a horrific story of what had happened to her in the camp and Bamber said to her I 'm going to tell your story and she said at that moment the woman seemed to become calm it was as though she didn 't want to die and feel that her story would not be told even a death we seem to need the knowledge that we are being acknowledged that we won 't be ignored or forgotten we all want to know our voices to be heard I don 't know how often I 've heard young people in the job market describing the disheartening experience of applying for dozens and dozens of George and not even receiving an acknowledgement of the application and then saying it 's as if you don 't exist we live in an era when official apologies of all kinds of being Mac we 've had in Australia of course the apology to the stolen generations we 've had the apology to children who were damaged emotionally and physically and by the institutional care but they were in a lot of people are sitting other countries are doing similar things we had the Roman Catholic Church apologized to Jews for its role in in Nazi Germany etc so many people are cynical about this and say well what does the apology actually achieve you know unless there 's some kind of substantial reparation of compensation does this mean anything well of course its effect on the people being apologized to is profound because these are all minority groups who feel as though they 've been overlooked who haven 't they haven 't been taken seriously at all this of course is why we hate being the victims of sexism or racism we hate being just lumped in with the category as though we 're not unique individuals but just part of a group well what happens to us when we feel as if we 're not being taken seriously enough there can be a good outcome occasionally here stories about what happens when people are humiliated or ignored not taken seriously Kim Maroney the recently retired New South Wales Police Commissioner tells a story about when he was a probation constable and his supervising officer in his first performance review said Maroney you 're never going to amount to anything and Ken MORONI 's response to that was to become police commissioner but those are the unusual cases generally speaking when people particularly early in their lives or a crisis points in their lives feel as if they 're not being taken seriously it 's almost always a wound and it 's often a wound that takes a long time to heal if it ever does a or into defeat never feeling as if they are worthy of being taken seriously by other people some people of course respond to this by taking themselves too seriously and this is one reason why we should take other people seriously to avoid the problem of people who take themselves too seriously because as they saying well no one else is going to take me seriously I better do the job myself and say you find arrogance and hubris almost always emerging in personalities as a result of people who had some early experience of being marked or overlooked or belittled or diminished in some way it 's the desire to be taken seriously that explains why listeners are so highly prized in our society and it also explains why most forms of counseling work there 's all kinds of inter nice I 'm tribal warfare between various branches of psychology that the different schools of counseling but the truth is for some people they all work one way or another simply because the act of being in a relationship with the counselor says to the to the client I and we all need to know that even if it 's only the dog there are people who say that the dog compensates for our feelings have not being taken seriously by other people it 's no accident isn 't that if you look at the people who are most sophisticated about communication namely commercial advertisers the most spectacular spectacularly successful advertising campaigns through history are always the ones that are not trying to make us feel better about the brand they 're the brands that are trying to make us feel better about ourselves well it 's the desire to be taken seriously that explains why minorities thriving persecution individuals don 't but minority groups do it also explains why some people stay in abusive and even violent relationships it seems as if the it 's bizarre and hard for someone not in the relationship to understand it but it appears as though the attack the persecution be arguing even the violence implies that we are a serious target so often you hear these very tragic tales of women mainly women who say well at least he wasn 't each other the way we show interest or not in each other 's passions and projects the way we respond or not to each other 's needs the extent to which we make time for each other even the way we made love to each other all of these things send signals about how seriously we take the other person those of you who 've studied psychology in your in your background will be familiar with one of the most famous experiments ever conducted in the field of industrial psychology was connected by an Australian psychologist called Elton Mayo just after the Great Depression Mayo did a series of experiments in the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company one of the first circle time and motion studies and may I was studying the effects of various changes in the working environment on the productivity of the workers he found for example that when he increased illumination levels in the factory productivity went up later in the experiment he reduced illumination levels again to see what this would achieve and productivity went up further and mayor 's conclusion which has effect was that the workers were responding to the interest being taken in them not to the illumination levels per se which has led some cynical people to say if you just have men in white coats holding clipboards wandering through the factory productivity will go up well maybe it will so that 's the first and as I 've suggested it 's kind of the foundation desire but but many others of course are involved in any any piece of human behavior for example the desire for my place we talked about the sense of place among indigenous people as though they have a kind of mystical sense of place which we couldn 't share or even understand which is rubbish of course we can understand it because we lose yet it 's a fundamental human desire this desire to have a place that defines us a place where we feel as if we are truly ourselves a place that says things about us that we 're pleased to have said it might be a shed for some people at home although it 's rarely home sometimes it 's for some people it 's bed for some people it 's the car I think for a growing number of people in our highly mobile society it 's that mobile capsule where people feel that this is my very own place this is where I can sing or do whatever I like and on my own we need that we all have sacred sites places that symbolize particular moments of significance in our personal history and of course we yearn for something to believe in the third of the of the desires that drive us Bertrand away we do seem to be born believers we humans Bertrand Russell who I think is still one of my favorite philosophers once wrote man is a credulous animal and must believe something in the absence of good grounds for belief he will be satisfied with bad ones well that was Russell the cynic but it 's very interesting that the field of neuroscience which is you 're aware i 'm sure is fast replacing psychology because it 's finding out so much directly about how the brain and central nervous system really do recent that i found out about them after I 'd finished the book unfortunately but these experiments show that the cognitive effort involved in believing is much less than the cognitive effort involved in remaining skeptical so our natural tendency is to believe what we 're told it 's an unusual thing to step back and say I 'm not sure I 'll think about that it looks as if we are born to believe as if we 're kind of wired to believe what we 're told but the need for something to believe in is clearly most powerful and fundamental for some people of course it 's religious belief and through the ages religion has been the main area of belief that are satisfied this desire for some people it 's astrology I don 't know how many of you would say you believe in astrology but about thirty five percent of Australian say they do believe in astrology and so do about thirty to thirty-five percent of people in all Western societies wherever you look it 's a remarkably consistent figure and I should say by the is very much a book about Western society so there are lots of case studies and examples from countries other than Australia including on this point but it is interesting isn 't it how often people I 'm sure everyone in this room knows what your star sign is even though you might say it 's rubbish for some reason you know your star sign and when you 're at the hairdresser you can 't resist taking a peek a little sparse column that 's already three months out of date to see what was supposed to happen to you you hear people being quite skeptical it like this is all rubbish I don 't believe in astrology from a but on the other hand my husband is a textbook Aries don 't know what we make that for some people at superstition for some people it 's conspiracy theories for some people it 's science people who worship science or rationality in spite of the evidence that we are profoundly non-rational creatures some people believe which you always behave rationally some people believe in the free market and think would everything would work out all right the famous medical phenomenon of the placebo effect is the result of our desire to believe I 'm sure you 're aware of the placebo effect in a clinical trial of a new drug half the sample is given the efficacious drug the other half is given just an inert substance a piece of chalk or something shaped like a tablet navigate hundreds of clinical trials have shown that about thirty percent of people who are just swallowing the chalk achieve experience an improvement in the in their symptoms in their condition comparable to the improvement experienced by those taking the efficacious drug precisely because we are so keen to believe that we drive a process in the body that is just like healing as a result of the drug some of us of course Phil alluded to this obliquely in his introduction some of us make the mistake of placing our faith in leaders as though leaders are something we can believe we saw that in 07 did me the kevin 07 phenomenon was very much about believing in a symbolic new Germans did it with Hitler history is littered with examples of cases where people just went overboard invested far too much faith and leaders which of course always turns out to be a mistake because they 're human well then there 's the desire to connect I would say much about this acceptance if it 's a three faceted desire we desire to connect with ourselves to know ourselves to understand ourselves better my psychological hero in the professional psychologist American now-deceased psychotherapist called carl rogers Rogers reflecting on 40 years of clinical practice said there is only one problem and by which he meant whatever people are presenting when they come into his clinical rooms whether it 's a dysfunctional relationship or marriage breakdown or drug dependency or phobias of various kinds when it 's all boiled down the question they 're looking to find an answer to is Who am I what what what kind of person am I really so this desire know yourself this desire to connect our selves runs deep as of course does our desire to connect with each other of our communication we 's the pathway to love to friendship to our sense of mutual obligation all of those things rely on connection with each other and the third facet of the desire to connect is the desire to connect with the natural world to feel as though we belong here to feel as though we have some link with nature and most of us feel pretty stressed if we lose our our links with the natural world which is why even in a high-rise apartment in mosman you 're likely to have a pot plant or two on your balcony to bring a little bit of Mother Earth up to the 14th floor well the revival of interest in gardening is another example of people 's desire to get close to nature even some of you are old enough to remember the pet rock movement of the 1970s devised by Californian advertising agency executive who correctly discerned that people didn 't want a bit of nature in their home so he sold them rocks complete with a guidebook on how to sort of handbook on how to look after your pet rock that it was not a deeply satisfying relationship but but wasn 't it interesting that that swept the world there 's just something this desire the desire to be useful is another one I 'll say not not much about that now and leave some of these for you to read about but it 's the desire to be useful that leads some of us to do quite heroic things to stick it jobs that they particularly inspire us but that we know need to be done to the desire to be useful that drives one of the noblest things we ever do namely altruistic behavior the desire to belong reminds us that we are social creatures that we that we need tribes we need herds the little hoods and the big tribes to give us a sense of identity and a sense of emotional security for many people religious practice is as much about going to a tribe as it is about believing particular things our default position as human seems to be together the desire for more we 're a greedy lot and we and whatever we 're more of it whether its food and drink driving an epidemic of obesity of course or more stimulation by the media or in other way is more adventure more money for some of us more violence people who behave violently enjoy it and what to do it again and if you look at human history even the last ten minutes you 're tempted to say as a species we even desire more war or else why would we maintain the world 's armies economists and politicians want more growth environmentalists want more sustainability fitness fanatics want more exercise all of us want more life and we say of course we 're interested in the quality of our lives rather than the quantity and we say and when we start saying stupid things or behaving radically or become incontinent or is it just hits on the head and it just put us out of our misery until those things start to happen and then suddenly we 're very interested in the quantity and by medical intervention we 're wanting to promote it and of course many religious believers embrace their faith life because of the belief in the afterlife or in the constant recycling of life very incarnation the desire for control potentially one of the most destructive one of the most insidious of all our desires because it gets us into so much trouble we keep on wishing to control things that we just can 't control such as other people or external circumstances and and events we know the life the only life we can control is our own but that doesn 't stop us behaving as if we think we can control other people 's lives as well loss of control which is a kind of modern epidemic isn 't it in a world of rapid change many people experience that as loss of control and that often produces high anxiety even phobias fear of flying a fear of crowds fear of sitting too far from the exit in a cinema and so these are all to do with loss of control one of the ways in which one of the favorite ways in which we try to exert control is of course through interpretation to try and as though we understand it and therefore have some control over that 's one of the great appeals of religion for many people that they have a kind of template which they can lay over whatever is happening and make sense of it in terms of in terms of their religious worldview but any world or any any search for meaning any any way of attaching meaning to what 's happening makes us feel better as if we understand what 's going on virginia woolf many years ago wrote has been a very amusing essay which wasn 't intended to be amusing at all but it was her experience an experience which had profound it moved of seeing an early horror film called the cabinet of dr. Caligari not a film I 'm familiar with but she wrote this essay about about this particular movie and what impressed her was that she noticed as the movie proceeded a little black shape in this started out as the shape of a tadpole expanded and contracted and changed its shape a bit so at one point or filled almost half the screen a visual symbol of fear and she wrote in her essay what a remarkable thing it was that a filmmaker found a way to visualize and emotion and as a kind of running commentary on the film this back shape came and went now the dark shape was actually due to a malfunctioning projector until the essay was published but didn 't hear wolf wasn 't aware of this well we also have a desire for something to happen and this is a real paradox for US isn 't it because on the one hand we say we want stability we want security certainty we don 't like things to change too much we don 't like to be hit by unexpected events and yet everything about the human organism and especially now that neuroscience can tell us so much about how the brain functions tells us that we thrive on change that all of these things that that disrupt us and destabilize our lives that we resist are actually very good for us and they 're the things that keep us alert and alive and many people say as every that 's going to keep the brain alive well the first week while you 're learning how to do a crossword that 's really good but once you 've mastered it it 's doing you no good at all what you need is constant change constant challenge it and and lots of social interaction you 'd be much better playing Scrabble than doing a crossword or even just walking down to the shops and interacting having some unexpected conversation so we 're we 're confused about that in our thinking but the truth is that change is good for us and our desire for something to happen for some people it 's a desire for excitement is a well-placed design that we 've had since infancy and finally the desire for love need i say more love obviously has the power to enlarge our spirit has the power to bring out the best in us to encourage acts of kindness and compassion it comforts us that reassures us that boosts our self-respect develops our capacity for empathy and of course it can all go horribly wrong love does end as possessive love there is such a thing as obsessive love and these are destructive expressions of the desire for love but people who 've experienced perhaps in childhood the miracle of unconditional love or the joy of romantic love or the wonderful experience of constant faithful friendship know that love can be our richest source of emotional security and personal serenity well if they 're so that 's the 10 and now of course there are other desires I 'm sure some of you are saying he hasn 't said this or that I mean there are ethereal desires like the desire for justice or truth or beauty there are much more basic bodily desires like the desire for food and drink or sleep or sexual release but this book is about what I 've described as the 10 mercial desires the desires that are linked to our sense of identity and how we manage our personal relationships and find our place in society 's neighborhoods communities so here we are with all these desires swirling around inside each of them wanting to dominate us and somehow or other the competition and sometimes even the contradiction I mean we want to reduce our carbon footprint and we want to fly to London how will we do both those things well we can 't_''_1763.809 do them both at once we struggle to reconcile this desire for more stability and certainty with our desire for more excitement and stimulation and who hasn 't felt the tension between the desire for love and the desire for control and when the desire for control worms its way into a loving relationship that 's almost always trouble so what makes us tick is this interplay this contest between all the all these various desires and let me just conclude with a couple of quick examples of how this works out a young couple announced that they 're in love they want to live together the rest of their lives so they go to marry so why are they going to marry in a society where a higher proportion than ever before of young people whether they cohabit or not don 't get married so are they just marrying for love yes but they might and they might want a particular kind of recognition that they think will come from being a married couple and they might want to create their very own place we know that nesting is about much more than breeding and one of them might be from a rather dysfunctional family an abusive childhood attacker an abused childhood wanting to join in to a more stable loving extended family and they might want that special sense of connection that they think will come from making the formal commitment of marriage and one of them at least might want the excitement of a wedding well that 's seven desires demonstrating perhaps how pointless it is to say to someone why did you do that because unless they 're very contemplative and reflective and introspective they probably don 't know because so many desires will have contributed to that behavior i haven 't_''_1887.529 mentioned all the possibilities there i didn 't for example mention the desire for control i would get him once i married him I 'll shape him in the image that I wanted cetera and the desire for more which of marriage so yes they married for love but that 's only a small part of the story what about work what desires does work satisfy apart from the obvious need to earn a living now why do some people become workaholics now why do people continue working when they no longer need to why do people persist with jobs they don 't enjoy why can 't some people give work up well obviously it 's because work satisfies so many desires that desire to be useful obviously the desire to be taken seriously nothing says I 'm taken seriously more eloquently gonna pay packet the desire for my place many people forge out a sense of their personal space more successfully in the workplace and they do in the domestic setting the desire to belong the working environment gives almost always provides a hood along with and a try an organizational tribe or a professional tribe as well and even the desire for control is probably more likely to be satisfied and the working environment than elsewhere so when you start exploring how all these desires interact you begin is so appealing to us religion for example now on the rise in many parts of the world especially in its fundamentalist form now religion is often attacked for its irrationality but when you look at the array of desires that religion satisfies you realize that for many believers it ticks all ten of the boxes and the critics who attack its irrationality may be having it quite their own wrong target well none of the ten desires that I explore in this book is inherently good or bad each of them has the power to bring out the best in us or the worst in US and I 'll conclude by just reading a few sentences from the introduction to the book several chapters of the book include a brief reflection on the dark side the darkest shadow cast by each of our desires is the wish to see that same desire frustrated in someone else refusing to acknowledge another person for instance is usually a cat a shadow cast by our own unfulfilled desire to be taken seriously mocking another person 's beliefs is likely to be a believe in wanting less for someone else is a shadow cast by our own unfulfilled desire for more the withholding of affection is a shadow cast by our own unfulfilled desire for love unrestrained desires can land us in plenty of trouble but unfulfilled desires can be emotional time bomb when the desire to be taken seriously is frustrated for instance the frustration itself can become a dangerous weapon in the hands of individuals communities or entire nations each of these desires can be turned to good account or bad those are the choices we make every day via choices that shape the kind of society we 're becoming thank you thank you very much now there 's plenty of time for some questions or comments or jokes discussion hmm this is partly cultural I think that is to say in Western broadly European culture this when you look at any piece of behavior and I did this in the first chap that will take a number of bits of behavior and try and analyze them it 's very hard to find something we do that doesn 't express a it 's always there now I 'm told by authorities in some other cultures that this is not universal you know that this is not just human it is cultural for example some people say that in indigenous communities where the individual ego it doesn 't get the same kind of nurture and attention as it does in our society the desire to be taken seriously is not such a big such a big issue the desire to belong is far more and to connect these are far more powerful and pervasive desires but in our and peculiar culture it seems as if we can we can I mean conduct this experiment in your own mind think of anything someone doing something and lists a whole lot of examples of people doing things right at the beginning of the book and think why would they be doing that what of these desires would be contributing and I 'm virtually able to guarantee that every piece of behavior you look at even though there 'll be many contributing desires and they 'll vary from person to person but the desire to 's really an empirical point I 'll make I 'm not saying there 's some mystical reason but just when you look at it this seems to be always there yes and in fact and then and then here sorry ah yes thank you thank you for that do this yes yes yes can you hear the question there 's about more Norman Wisdom the British actor who the questioner is suggesting would not want us to take him seriously and I suppose you generalize that to say comedians don 't want us to take them seriously and I deal with comedians at some length in the first chapter because I think they like everyone else on the planet have a desperate desire to be taken seriously but to be taken seriously doesn 't mean all look what a serious person it means notice me acknowledge me to value me and comedians I think tread an absolute knife edge on this point because they are trying to be taken seriously by not being serious and so many of them are depressives many of them have famous cases have suicide some as though they 've they finally said is it me or is it just the jokes and many entertainers I remember Judith Durham the other the lead singer of the second saying years after the Seekers had disbanded and she 'd gone on to her solo career say she never believed that she was important in the grip she thought was all about the boys well you know the fact the adoring fans I thought it was at least as much about her as about the boys but but she had this desperate desire to be told that it wasn 't just the music and it wasn 't just about but she herself was also taken seriously and I 'd be prepared to bet that northern wisdom is in that category though I want you to laugh I want you to ridicule the act factors that I portray but I need you to take me seriously as a person yes I yes look dead be cut the question was the follow-up was about Shakespeare 's use of the fool the Jester same point i mean this is this is a the play is to point up other people 's or flaws and frailties inside but to be treated as in spite of all the joking all of tomfoolery to be treated as a source of serious wisdom in the play yes very hard and i justit just me that perhaps the reason so many of us are here tonight is because there seems to be a way across perhaps the rest of the world for us to cope more with what life is throwing at us and yes to be treated seriously but I because I 'd like to have more wisdom well the book is only thirty-five dollars thank you baby that was I did not expect to be taken seriously but look I think there is an absolute yearning about well exactly 17 years ago I published a book called reinventing Australia at a time when it seemed to me and people were yearning for a deeper understanding of what what was happening to our society how was our society changing and what would be the impact of this on us now I think our focus has shifted 're quoting professor Schwartz are saying is very true that we 're now saying and I 'm saying as a researcher let 's get a little deeper than that you know let 's not just look at what 's happening to the birth rate or what 's the social impact of shrinking household to a high divorce or in information technology revolution is all this stuff is fascinating and I 've spent my entire research career studying all those things but I 'm with you I 've reached a point a few years ago where I said now there 's more going on than all this stuff you know there 's something else something deeper than this there are some things that don 't change so what are they and so I started to look again at my own research and at the wisdom of many people of course has written through the centuries through the millennia about this the ancient Greeks said already most of what probably in this book and I was trying to say well what drives people to behave in the way they do regardless of a recession or families are shrinking or beside all of that interesting and important though it is to study but what drives us as people why do we do the things we do my aim in writing it I mean goodness knows whether I 've succeeded but people will soon tell me but my aim was to say if we could understand a bit more clearly why we do the things we do and especially why other people do the things they do then maybe that would promote the clarity would promote a little more tolerance a little more kindness of the more compassion recognizing that we 're all struggling to reconcile these competing desires yes yes what do you distinguish between the desire for control and particularly as you get over the desire to be in control of your own destiny hmm was all part of the same desire I mean the focus changes it 's a very interesting point that it is one of the desires that I think evolves as we get older a hope it evolves as we go over a little smarter younger p I the universe because they noticed if they shriek they get fed you know and if they 're lying in a dirty nappy someone will come and clean them up and sell and it 's very easy in the face of that evidence to think broadly entire universe revolves around me and I 'm in charge so it 's a very painful process through childhood and adolescence to realize that actually that 's not the case is there well there 's other people competing and they are actually beyond your control unlike your doting parents when you were young so we evolved through that to the point where as you 're suggesting i think that the focus shifts very much on what will become of me what am i doing with myself have I have I filled my own potential am I in control of what I 'm doing quite apart from what other people are doing or what they 're doing to me yes there was another quiesce and living in this amazing multi society that we do in Australia not only multicultural that moldy religious multi hood drive etc much of these are attributed to the culture and the values and the cosmology that people are brought up in type well I think totally this is why I can find the environment i can find the application of this book to western societies similar to our i mean i give some examples from Western Europe some from Scandinavia something North America some from Australia New Zealand etc where there are very similar social phenomena happening and where the cultural underpinnings are very similar so even though yes we 're an extraordinarily diverse culture here still the dominant values the dominant cultural model is the European model but it is culturally determined i mean there are some things like the neuro scientists are saying well we 're born believers yes okay but how we how we express that is very culturally determined so so i 'm not too ambitious for the book i 'm not saying wherever you go in the universe where there 's life these are the desires that drive people to pay this is very much about humans in a particular kind of society what their desires 've hurt someone that I have to share this with you I heard someone this morning saying the friend had said that who recently been divorced a woman said are we separated for religious reasons my husband believed he was God and I didn 't there 's something in that look there were two things that this was beautifully from the previous message was that all about culture you 'd think there would be big differences between the genders and perhaps also between the generations and I think there are some but before I say anything about what they might be I emphasize I think the much greater differences are between individuals in their own circumstances and at their own point in the life cycle so I don 't say of any of these desires this is a peculiarly feminine or a peculiarly masculine or peculiarly young or old thing although they acknowledge in response to that question from the back earlier that as we get older our priorities do shift and some of these desires become far more urgent for us but i think it is true for example become a more evolve culture but i think it is true that women are typically not universally but there are many observers but typically better listeners and men women are typically more interested in a process the way a relationship is working than just the outcome whereas men are more interested in the outcome now those sort of variations mean that women typically are better at taking other people seriously not that they don 't take themselves seriously or almost less seriously than men but traditionally in this culture women have tended to offer the gift of listening more generously than men have and that means a lot a lot of men a lot up until the women 's movement and the gender revolution I think it 's true to send probably still true to say that more men feel as if they are be taken seriously man women do and when that when that comes into perfect balance it 'll be a golden age I was just wondering if you perhaps comment on something that I was thinking over the desire to be the desired for an easier life the medical field like we want to go to the doctor and get a tablet to fix something just just our whole you know why we perhaps lean more towards fast food as a supplement you know just just to kind of attitude in act within our culture yeah look that 's terrific question to end on except that it 's a huge question but let me just get a couple of brief responsible I think there are two two powerful desires interacting in to explain the situation you describe one is the desire for more that we just want more of whatever we 're enjoying in the fast food industry relies on the fact that you know here are easy and convenient ways to get the gratification that you want and you want more and more and more men if you say to them is not good for your health well we know it 's not good for our health but the desire for more at that moment overwhelms the desire for more gratification more sensory pleasure etc overwhelms the desire for more life we think about that a is the desire for control that these are ways in which we are trying to take bit the whole the whole movement towards perfection and more happiness excellence all of these things seem to me to be expressions of a misplaced desire for control so if we know that the pill example that you can 't you know but we say he for example we grow through pain and then as soon as there 's a pain we want to get rid of it yeah presumably not so we won 't grow parents say I just want my kids to be happy and I feel like shaking cocktail surely you want them to be sad you want them to be disappointed and frustrated you want to know how to deal with failing etc because we would have actually behold what our experienced the full register of human emotions but the desire for control has led to this I think very perverted very distorted view of what human existence should be about which is we should all be happy and that it is the whole positive psychology movement I think has a lot to answer for _"

    "text": "I started scanning every Saturday morning I cycled down to Bombay and scout around my school that think about where I come home because when I act all day we are really able to make an exhibition in myself I want to attract too much attention so initially last year our spots were conceived containable from bees and southern senators I sit in the older section or row damage to the cemetery and other point of view pains of actually brave sound at the cranes beyond them and then I found another spot amongst the old foundations of the butter on conversation of useful idiot and right on the edge of the new cemetery and I 've actually go back near all the new gravestones and discover building of the cemetery of ogden contain war from there but that spot wasn 't too good because the guys who do all the grass clearing and flipping in the cemetery pop up a little Bob can and I tip all the grass clippings over the years one day I think that a whole load of grass clippings and and weeds right mix many notices there I wasn 't better maybe faster you know I was just throwing the different with a tip there bobcat and then I found that there was a really good view of the containers from Porsche or driver they 're just recently building I only you can take more and done all the landscaping along the foreshore driving you can 't spoke about there is no stopping so I worked out like the park near the golf course in Jason banks Park and walk around golf balls carrying the spear but appropriately and then I 've crossed a very busy road for short drivin with another tremendous stretch I 've had 25 timings of the containers I I just kept doing as long as I was excited by the project and it 's not I feel I didn 't want to repeat myself so eventually I think I stopped having contenders now but I think I did probably about thirty but Andy 's from that hundred a street and by covering a kept at 20 of them it was also like a race against time because I had the new plan insightful in here the new landscaping like I never knew when I 'm going to go up and is giant like a sprinter and again this this would be points where I needed a noise and I go home God and I ride that I liked I had a big drop of gathered up in a plastic bag on run up and I 'm instructed I think they got the top of this bridge but get around it and it would be done this are the bags here okay I mean I had everything yeah they prepare I 'm just going to show you my mighty announce or pathetic what just thought okay I 'll just look at that this is a bag from a supply shop the free end which I just inside here I carry conscious with various size this is one of the panels that are typical of what I painted those ones on I found all these secondhand nice quite thin on the panels into place for the very American rule of recycling place often I use the sides of old drawer so in the strength I 'll pull out the drawers I also look at the grain on the side of the panel if that 's going like this it 's good means it won 't cut in the Sun but if the grain is going like that it means it 's cut out of a different part of the log and when you actually prime it and take it out in the strong summer I can often war so this is probably 3040 year old Mike so it 's pretty stables nice and straight I painted this one I normally work on the white ground that I 've been doing some nocturnes lately so I 'm from them of how it works where I start so basically I 've got all my plank panels of different sizes there and my pod nearby cabbage Dan says she won 't walk makes me and doesn 't even know baby I 've got masking tape so when I get back to the car sometimes I take two pitches together if I do two pitches the same size and they 're wet I get a I take them really tight together and then I can say I 'm in the bush walk out with the palings tape together the same size and they don 't touch this in their space in between mostly carried over the summer but here we go and some strains actually really just forgetting oil paint off your fingers so this is that one of those wedding chains made in India I think which is good because the surface doesn 't dissolve if I had a plastic bag that the Turks were later holding it you know put two up silly yogurt container just gonna show you this about every week I bring you my palette this is that 's get a real skin on and starts to dry out ends on the different colors make this Fox myself it 's got inside it 's got things like skin bottoms or something to stop them hello flippin against the other side and I just use these little pair of pliers there it is that 's mine help my ears are on one side of button I paint white and that 's use plain white but it 's poisonous and stop using it recently and then I have done different purples and through the Reds the yellows are starting to get a bit squished up so it maybe I should start to move them out but I intend to keep the colors in the same place then it 's I can look up and be painting and I can almost push the brush to towards a certain color and know exactly where it is so when I 'm painting I 've been trying to paint these nocturnes lately if the light is not very good so I like to if I 've got this alibi not really where all the colors I already and it comes to appointment it 's getting dark you can only really see the times but because I know where I put my brush I sort of know what color it is so but I have quite a lot of glows here sirillium ultramarine cobalt and their low blow and then some mixed grades I use them to have these in my palette when I went to Melbourne things up if I had some pre-mixed tertiary colors in my palette and I I carry a lot of brushes with me so that I can quickly not waste time actually washing the same brush all the time so I keep them in just a roll of now this is not nearly as many as I normally have persisted in terms of having today but I normally have about 40 full different sizes I use these you know which ones and and longhand and stables and I 've got usually got bigger for one one or two really big ones in there as well so I just roll up and put them in there like that in the front of the bag I 've got two teens but tips one is doing it in the other one so that 's to wash the brushes I 've got one of these little little things to put my medium in on the teller and I have a this is an oily medium and this is a lei medium and I use that for I don 't paint with particularly shiny but up do it all in one go and with these things everything was moving around so fast that the containers would be shoveling up and Emily attracts so nothing stayed the same during a one and a half to two hour period so almost we 've done another one and a half hours eyewitness faster so good and I had to make decisions about where I was going to put things out today mood and sometimes if you 've a big crowd mundo I rub out what I 've done and change it sometimes I think I 'll leave it there and I 'll just work around that pace and then the weather of course changes the clouds come to us but usually by my client painting a landscape there 's a sort of two hour time frame in which you can paint up in which the life has really changed too much the shadows of moon except sometimes on a very grainy sort of day that 's about all I 've moved on from the cranes now I was sort of trying to take some of they are some doctors around sydney and in portraiture i 'm doing a series of portraits and twins identical twins that 's my next project thank you very much this painting is part of a series that I 've been working on for over two years now and when I was COFA it involves presently panting music fabric in particular magnitude fabric and I 've become so engrossed in it that I 'm now doing research trusses where I 'm looking at the parallels between knitting and penalty now they both have materiality that 's compelling and even though you would predict that you know paintings that literally did the series of best photograph was taken an initiate should have died out a couple of centuries ago machineries were invented but people are practicing feeling meeting so to go back to the beginning no I didn 't set out to paint using like a interesting pattern delightful to look at but I also see is a way of a nonverbal language we communicate with pattern we read pattern some of it is culturally signified it strikes that big bold diagonal stripes on in the don 't need to know you even almost intuitively know that that 's what that means are constructs means something you know different polka dots are different again so it 's that 's where this originated from the certain English in languages Israeli as patents at communicating I also like with passion it it 's away from all of the compositional rules or because that 's where my in words and then I 've just painful sniffing and thought alternate story together it 's a way of talking about happen and usually something 's that I used to be quite a bit off each and there was not much else to do and so I understand it an appreciation of it it 's also something that I feel some cultural attachment to my father taught me to knit on the talk built in it and I can imagine that women in my family for generations and probably the same passions and that I find quite appealing so I 'm smiling about woodie 's rather when I first first started with the impetus through the pet within the actual defense first really found was reasonably happy with that but they there 's a limit to how much you can say and then I started looking at pattern I don 't know what we can see from this distance but pattern within the stitch so you know just the one color warm things but you get lovely indentations as well and coming forward and back more of the texture shadows and I think it emphasizes the pen which is what the interest was so yes I 've got to the point then where I lit up the little attachment section of this stitch the title comes from the name of the stitch it 's horrible and it 's one of the most simple of all stitches so probably wondering why I talk about happiness is too obvious but I wanted going back to the idea of imitating I wanted to communicate a sense of space just really had to slow down when I started doing this research I found if the researcher of researchers of meeting figure on the internet there 's all sorts of roles mostly kwan-yuen women even some men apologetic was at the time that any out there likes to yet nor thought so busy to sit and knit while you know it used to be centuries ago something that people would do you know it 's a very practical utilitarian thing people do it to make money now it 's a luxury as time isn 't a luxury if you 're just interested to know where I might be going from now I 'm now starting to look at lace patterns and using the negative spaces within those fashions because I have been painting in that spot a couple of years I need a bit of a break so I 'm doing works on paper and abstracting the pattern a lot more so for example I put this over and women here projector adjusted that onto a large sheet of paper and then instead of drawing where that all would be I draw the negative spaces within the passion and I think as my work goes on just continually will be breaking that pattern this pan is hot a series of fellas that part of the series I as I won 't hear anything after a lot of gynecological creatures I 'm giving the sides I 'm seeing these aims with tight legs velocity ran and I wasn 't deeply don 't so why don 't you guys commonly say for example xbox live in Venice please please light the welcome fortune means that it 's very penetration most I might also add like that or you get your services if you got or something I think out on the side and I was more just in the one little selecting this agency right Angela see no so steady investment with a bit awkward for example there was one being Pompeii which was a tackling and it consisted of aligned with just one leg beautiful a soccer ball sort of shake body and I 'm not sure everybody asking attention that he 's expression was somehow caught between a raw kind of like his bathrooms kind of like he 's crying and I thought it 's pretty unusual in and it kind of inspired me so I 'm thinking about why do I have a brand of can that one 's really impressive and just so happens you mind if I get to read young people of their own traits and 4x10 past their own personal companies then Faculty of impeccably so slightly Tribeca later so I started talking about based on my real people sometimes friends and very well it 's unfortunate that 's why I 'm using the self-portrait yeah as you can see or hopefully see it 's a very small light head placements one and to make a mine looks somewhat ejected and passed with frustrating how passionately attached was wrongfully haven 't been seen is a fact I 've seen some sort of companies yes they could see a live is being a person strongly or have some meetings of the power of latin passed on to the power and the bodies sort of mostly due to like racing flattened data yes oh boy okay and so this is the before is there 's about five something techno things that are fairly different but understeers will happen to a series of them double launchers cover among others volume houses of various calibers they see on this way some way mostly paid pieces of interiors of people so Hollandsworth West Tennessee some animals on their laps and overall I 'm interested in combining things up to 115 Dobson so I try to learn something it I 'm glad I that princess is easy again sometimes of saving it 's like inner essence any and is the any daily dedicated so I 'm trying to bring this get excite off intimidate Otis didn 't feel like sir watch the paint a different a little bit about my technique so what I 'm trying imitation straightaway gives a sense of form and by for my biggest roundest something lacking the world moving up and you can see this one the main form the wing that 's our time finally someone some sort form and get a first that kind of set for like picture and then I tried paint rest of the forms that speaking as closely as possible with them the initial one donated so our childhood and this area Tom my reference was to match 10 to the 4 deserts next single highlights of lucky what I can keep one day I started is a subtle the rest they said two ascents and I realized also some time to try the way to love that I would never raise my knees worth anything I think they 're quite meticulous instantly and snow ice or bad wine that is using a challenger tinny as I get her that 's right I just like us a conflict where a particular society finally beautiful and make it it might be such things my conscience is he a place that has some things in surprises about that thank you yeah I 'm full on maxius and on born and unborn engine it is not a rotten Northwest visit in place for Boston mysterious hardly a Ferrari which is a much you familiar that with the parties from Boston so a lot of my work has been men 's had faced it is more influence multi-step than a pictorial reference patient Italian a colossal 11 work is Ryan volunteers for four years in Thailand I decided to employ in printmaking is the head of the university the last day he did it better and very much I go through to all the series in every time I said two years but my placement again which is interesting upon this is the common thread within my work brother placement in particles on camera entire born in a rural setting that 's where my original drawings of the Reese 's stand so a respite engage with cockfighting and the divide between the females roles in society and the male roles in society in entire society so originally I am establishing drawings and forgetting isidro a lot of all Tom doesn 't come down to choose but not not I was asking with the people burn my trailer play network is subsequently show that in my master 's work called daughters of planning so my streeter elevate its imploring on beautiful Rosa I also work for the people that are in my studio from its let me go to city farmer it 's okay Velma is full of beautiful forms and very energy but my heart is been 222 ha in mine too seven of them are three days away so I work from about 65 million to talk to us on another material which is in a beautiful big barn and unadorned as I begin to attract in every way so I kind of died how to divide between my studio life my working life and and I think my home life it 's all reflected within my work after had entirely necessary crucial time in terms of my career I had had a very start relativity a showing true I was making quite abstract images but I became very disconcerted what once I was trying to just tell you in my work so I mean to work Israel is made huge impacts away and after Israel back to my parents are witches the generation that that area so to explore the notion of the notion of objects as a vehicle to think so I hope the subjects like tractors and roosters and physical landscape but I already had in mind that most of the things were enamored inanimate objects that could transcend one arms they in pain but also how I felt about particular object or particular time in my my expressive emotions relating to object to before my hard work so that 's a entertainment minutes with four or five years and through a lot of howling for my my my awesome my friend who sort of said Rosa and not ever cameras so I think I became quite stubborn I refused cameras over here as well and I refused been told there are still large panel and and then when the bubble burst I really started to engage with the forms that I was working with the colors I work with for a probable that in a more symbolic way so the new Shoreham going to happen in a monkey is his base of always do a performance yet the underlying nature of the show was in part to do two friends that are initiative passed away and the first friend of that has a way a very great accident stimulated me to start writing more which I had done the password to put down boots up actually right when I suffered an image to start didn 't by writing the text about how I felt about people speak to so that was kinda through this sort of hearing where this is one which is from the show but the handles with with this rain passing away and I said meant more and more works that obviously the road a very elegant forum anything that that I used this sort of dark very backgrounds 200 show contradictions between sort of life and death and then recently sadly to say a friend of mine was very close to just just passed away and I think it kind of reconfirmed what I was doing then right I had the opportunity to see this person for two ways just that every day something was holding me back and the event happened obviously we all think over what am I stop wearing my stuff so I can so continued in saying I 'm writing to people within my word and that enjoys a lot of work that has that actually has kissed if you can say and then he hinted places over the top combined with a very strong sort of bonds and aside to talk more directly than this disagreement and come transcends exactly what I said then about my friend and you know anyone many parameters Rihanna passed away I just thought that was a beautiful sentiment when it came to this painting by the time he informs that will transcend the way in which are doing tonight my bathroom is actually like I said horticulture before needs and at the same time I was a professional sportsman and my wife is up and I wasn 't a birthday though he 's been hanging like he 's dancing studio because I think I worked a lot on adrenaline I do a lot of I want to do a lot of drawing and a lot of track to the paintings and I 'm trying to place upon within the dimensions that are working but when I was actually making is quite explosive and I sort of am irritated that the semi-desert I 'm working at like that way and the same and it doesn 't done and the whole ham stanza from last year for which which enjoyment no the soldiers action hammer because of this year for the got people that I do that I said at the time I was working with local hello grinders from the heartbreak and happens to be a taxidermist as well and we heard we 're going to kick your relationship where I 'm going to operate and said Allah is anything around the Sun today and you know he plays he got a background about things that the governor city and Trust becoming how my sculptures are valid because enough right but my idea without resources down the 0 obviously the Indiana is a real mentor were in contradiction again which is it 's kind of held by what works is a portion forward in the world that creates the tension when when really words I hope attract attention that the viewer actually engage with whether they like or dislike it there 's an emotion there that they can respond to bitterness many where the beautiful weather so my god any in sculptures is maja I mean it 's the idea familiar provision the animals is chisel uses discard waste recycle and um kinda created it is a chance deserves for without the English at home in Java has interrelation pains that I actually have a Michigan installation of my tricky taxidermic sculptures and I feel like I should have them photograph with my friends first and then studies with selfie Alice you _"

    "text": "[Music] our journey started in early 2021 when as incoming ceo i was tasked with observing the organisational climate this involved a review of both the culture and business disciplines using my eyes ears and mouth in equal proportion observing the business disciplines was easy taking the pulse of the culture if not done correctly can be fraught with danger and is often a make or break for any leadership position i use a tool i 'd been successful with in the past called the voice project giving staff a platform to shoot straight and tell it like it is but nothing is ever that simple [Music] one of the challenges when asking for feedback is encouraging staff to feel comfortable about expressing their views in the past there may have been reluctance to do so due to the shoot the messenger syndrome if staff feel they 'll be singled out they simply won 't speak up the only way to alleviate these fears is to use an independent facilitator to attend in person depot or depot office to office to explain the benefits of the survey-based feedback and to to a specific author for the most part the minds of the staff were at ease which resulted in a 95 participation rate in our first survey this was exceptional [Music] while encouraging positive participation rates and honest feedback was one part the next challenge is to determine what we do with what we 've been told when the staff survey results were received all staff were provided all the results including comments we then developed voice teams made up of volunteer staff members who were tasked with addressing two or three of the lowest nine scoring areas from the survey if it was low scoring it needed to be prioritized for improvement the teams worked to correlate feedback and ideas from the entire staff body and deliver a number of suggestions to the action managers directors and the ceo were prohibited from participating in the voice teams as to ensure an amenity was maintained in parallel because all managers and directors also had the initial survey results changes started to occur organically as those in leadership 's roles were able to truly see their reflection the most obvious initial around face-to-face communication in general across all levels of supervisory positions the general engagement with all levels of staff enabled a huge improvement in buying to help deliver the solutions the voice project gave us an opportunity to voice some of our issues within council and to boost morale and to look at some of the issues within council [Music] one of the main tools for improvement that came out of our voice teams was an instrument called the navigator this set a repetitive timeline to ensure that the lower scoring areas in the survey would continue to be addressed well into the future as well as the navigator all managers and directors met with staff to work through individual departmental issues [Music] eight months after the initial survey a repeat of the same survey was completed the improvements were absolutely compelling the march 2021 priority matrix compared to the november 2021 matrix showed obvious changes most work practices assessed in the survey have seen an improvement within the short period of time the largest being director leadership manager leadership recognition and cross-unit cooperation i joined the voice team in opportunity um to actually have our opinions put forward um i also pass on the ideas that the boys teams have to the workers outside um to also give them their opportunity to have a have a say in how the new structure we 're going to have and how we 're going to move forward so being part of the voice team gave us an opportunity to really unpack the issues that have been raised by staff during the survey our team put faith in the promise that there 'd be no repercussions for providing honest and earnest feedback about what we thought would direct some transparent and meaningful change throughout the organisation [Music] when leading cultural change a top-down approach just doesn 't work a servant leader is a leader who leads from behind seeing the needs of the team by helping to create the conditions that allow individuals to shine using a servant style of leadership and the voice project as the tool has delivered huge improvements in less than a year the famously successful author and motivator stephen r covey best summed it up the vast talent intelligence capability and creativity than their present jobs require or even allow in following this simple recipe you 'll be guaranteed to unleash your organization 's talent i 'd also like to thank the staff there 's one ceo on council but there 's 215 other staff mathematically proportionally there 's no comparison between the efforts applied by the vast majority of staff compared to the leadership in the ceo so thank you without everyone adopting uh the attitude that we need to improve our culture and vastly list our performance we wouldn 't be able to achieve the excellence that we 've done thank you [Music] _"

    "text": "hi i 'm leonie cannon and welcome back to spreading the good stuff before we launch into today 's episode i would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet and chat today and to pay our respects to their elders past present and future i would also like to extend that respect to aboriginal peoples listening in today as many of you know for the month of october we are hosting a special four-part series of episodes as part of the 2020 new south wales small business month festival which is in partnership with the new south wales government and also murray river council in previous episodes this month we have looked at building your brand online and we 've also chatted to some small business owners in our region who have started and grown their businesses in the local area we 've shared some of their inspiring stories of how they did it including how they 've adapted and pivoted during this time of covert as well as some helpful tips around money marketing and resilience in this episode we thought it was small businesses and how you can go about accessing support when you need it the rural financial counselling service offers free independent and confidential support to small businesses so we thought it was a great fit to bring in a representative from their organisation to chat with us today court saya roberts is a business coach with the rfcs in the new south wales southern region and he joins us now hi court and thanks so much for jumping in to chat with us on the podcast today oh hi there well thank you for uh inviting me to join in pleasure to be here terrific now court we were chatting a little bit off on before we came on air about your work with the rfcs and the program that you 're involved in called rewire so i understand that that 's the small business of the organization and correct me if i 'm wrong the rural financial counselling service has typically been geared toward offering support to um i guess those in the the primary production field um and the rewire program is looking at bringing in uh i 'd love to kick off if we can um with you just sort of talking with to us about your work and specifically about the rewire program how it came about um the kinds of businesses you work with and and i guess who 's eligible some of those things that would be great all right yeah my pleasure so the uh the only the rewire project came about or the program came about from on the back of an election promise in the last election so the um the federal government realized that while there 's been a lot of support for agriculture or primary industry through our organisation we 've received funding they actually had a commitment um that they made to actually provide some funding for a small business program because at the heart of regional areas there 's is important to they recognize that there was a gap there and they wanted to understand and set up funding for a pilot program to really just to see whether there 's a need for support for small businesses in regional areas and primarily the focus was focus of the program and where we came in uh with the rural financial service we were given the funding and originally we started out just focusing on um six local government areas obviously since our inception and since we started our program on the 30th of march we 've had obviously the pandemic with covert 19 that really has um caused a lot of disruption and change and challenges for all businesses not only small businesses but also that was a recognised need or i guess for further support so what 's happened with the pandemic is that the government said look we 're you 're already in the space we want you to actually provide support and extend your services to uh small businesses of for all of southern new south wales and while you 're doing that can you also provide support for small businesses affected by bushfires so in terms of our program while it 's a pilot program the rewired project primarily focused to help small businesses and when we define small businesses they are a any entity with that employs no more than 19 's experiencing financial risk or at risk potential you know at risk of experiencing financial hardship so where we come in and what our service does and provide we work along existing professional services we 're just small businesses to understand their financial position identify options and implement plans to improve the viability of their business or the long-term future of their business our services are free they 're confidential and they 're independent so we 're really there as a in a true sense a coach so we 're there to actually be able to help listen um and provide some tools um to small businesses to really upskill them give them the necessary support um and that will actually allow them to develop the skills be in a position to make informed decisions about their business whatever that may be but obviously moving forward so they actually can reduce some anxiety and stress so when you talk about hardship some of our businesses that uh that we deal with um well all um across all sectors so hospitality from your restaurants and your cafes right through to to you know you 've also got motels and then also people in the retail sector as well so the other side type of businesses that we work with and what 's the uptake been like so you started on the 30th of march right as that pandemic hit i guess it 's hard to compare if you have been six months earlier we could have talked about you know the uptake at that point and then how it 's changed as coburn 's hit but you 've started this pilot program right as the pandemics hit what has the uptake been like yeah well let 's just say i think um it is actually definitely picked up in the last three months so we 've probably seen a a 50 um increase in update and um i think the challenge which we faced only only when we started this pilot program was due to the social distancing restrictions it was very very hard to actually raise the awareness of our program and and also you know in terms of small business owners there 's been a saturation of information around filter all the way through and see and understand um what kind of support is out there um that can be quite a challenge for a small business owner when they 're going through the stresses of you know have i got enough money to pay my staff um i can 't pay my you know my next bill um you know you know i 've had to close or close my business for a period of time so there 's those sort of challenging factors so that could be um you know pretty hard and that 's you know what we 're finding is um we 've definitely seen an update um three months and so how are how are businesses finding you primarily you 've talked about the challenges involved in raising awareness about this this pilot program how are our businesses and um you 're saying that it 's it 's at risk um businesses that you 're targeting how are they coming to you and then i guess also in reverse how are you kind of getting the word out to them yeah so we 're also have um our website so um you know it 's uh so we 've been advertising through our website which um behind me um we 've got some of the whole branding and also we did a direct mail dropouts and then um also outreach as well so now with the reduced um you know limitations around social restrictions we can actually go out to um our the the council or the or the shires in the southern region so the new south region and actually walk and talk to businesses introduce ourselves introduce um our businesses and explain what our program 's about um and obviously we 've seen um a real pick up and need because you know people actually are looking for some support so you know we 've had uh referrals have been probably where we 've gotten the most of our um our our clients and that 's you know through people contacting um our rural financial counsellings counsellors in their in their regions and so they 've obviously referred um those clients onto us and explaining we do have a specific program to council as well contacting local councillors they 've been on their newsletters uh local business chambers as well we 've had the support so they 've been you know really promoting and saying that we 're a new service that 's not-for-profit and we 're basically available to help small businesses that 's a fantastic service what talk me through um what some of the challenges are that you 're finding in businesses that you 're dealing with i understand that you are looking after this area and businesses in the murray river council region and also the edward river or edward council region um what are some of the specific challenges that you 're hearing from the businesses that you 're working with i think you know prior to covert obviously impacting the ability to trade and for some business owners travel um if we 're talking um in this region um immediately the first issue was drought so you know we saw a lot of people actually lose with jobs a lot of industries were contracting and so you saw you know people actually leaving our towns to obviously had a flown effect on the small businesses um covert has impacted the ability in terms of traveling across the border so being in you know moammar being a a border town obviously you know that 's impacted um clients we have a particular client that actually travels across into achuca in myanmar and so uh it 's made it very very difficult to actually be able to service his own clients yeah so those are the type of challenges that they sort of face at the moment so i guess those are the key things yeah and when we talk about um at-risk businesses at what point what what are some of the things that a business should be looking out for um and when when would a business know that it needs help at what point would you recommend that they come to you yeah i guess um i guess it 's really being able to um do a little health check on your business so that 's that 's the key thing so it 's it 's um sort of identifying what are those early indicators know how how is your business going and uh you know that comes down to you know what kind of systems have you placed in in terms of your administration um so you know i do have a how you manage um managing your invoices so you know in terms of invoicing your customers if you 're in a in a manufacturing sense you 're providing a service now how do you handle that how do you handle your paperwork in accounting um practices do you pay your bills on time do you have some sort of system involved um you know how is your filing is it something that you love to do or hate to do or something you always leave you know i 'll always get to it and it 's always going to be at the end of the month you know in terms of the operational processes what you do do you have visibility does a small business owner have visibility of their income and expenses and do they reconcile their banks transactions you know on a regular basis so do they really know if um you know they 're just paying the bills as they as they come do they know you know how well the business is going as there 's positive cash flow of their if it isn 't um you know they 're having to make um you know having difficulty making supply payments now lodging for you your quarterly bass is that something that you do on time you know and then is that a stressful practice as well so a lot of our clients um that we 've discovered there there are a few that bass is a very very stressful time for them so it 's um you know you know an end that adds you know anxiety um you know all they just don 't have the time and it 's always i 'll get to that one day and then it 's a mad rush to try and get the tax in time and whether or not you 're actually on a payment plan with the taxation office sure so that 's a good health indicator um and another another factor is you know um do do they actually know what their sales are going to be and what the expenses are going to be um each month and what their return on or do they know what their break even at that point is and are you finding and also and also well-being so how are they feeling in their business so that 's an important part well it 's not a a marchery thing it 's also you know uh you know do you feel when you 're running your business you feel you know stressed um you know or time poor you just hear what there 's not enough hours in the day so that 's a good health check okay and so that 's something you work with businesses on is conducting those financial health checks is that also something that you recommend businesses just do on their own as a regular thing anyway yes so so what we do in terms of our um our program and our approach which um any client that comes on what we we have an onboarding process we actually conduct an interview and we ask questions you know are they finding you know what other stresses their business are they able to pay payments on time um and these are the things that we sort of you know as a leader get an understanding of where we might be able to help them um and also um we basically um we do a review as well so once we do an on-holding questionnaire and we interview we get a sense of where the business is at how their business owner is feeling and then we actually do a financial review so we look at all the systems what they have in place and what they haven 't got in place and then we understand their financial position so sometimes with small business owners um they 've been surviving it 's been a sense of survival mode and they 've been doing that way and that 's just the way it 's we 've managed but it 's also being able to provide that visibility around their financial position so then they can be in a more powerful position just getting to that stage actually lifts informed decision rather than just persevering and you know having to draw on or put more money in the business or ask for an extension on loans um that 's being able to you know make an informed decision and then you can you know develop actions from there do do you find that [Music] for a lot of businesses that are maybe perhaps struggling in that kind of area is it often a case of just being so busy working in the business that they just you know have perhaps neglected or just haven 't_''_1101.2 been able to find the time to do that kind of work on on the business or um you know what are you what are you finding sort of across the board are there are there patterns in in terms of how people are finding themselves in these sorts of situations and these challenges or is it a really unique thing i think there 's um there is a there are some common things and i think it 's around about having a business plan yes and you know when people get gone into most important thing is being able to review that business plan because things do change and their business grows or you know you 're having to and all of a sudden it 's not something the goals change or and it 's really been clear around what you want your business to do for you so a lot of business owners when they first start up uh if they 're sole traders they 're not drawing a wage so and it 's and and then all of a sudden that becomes the pattern going forward so while they 'll pay their employees and everything else they 're probably not actually drawing away to themselves yeah so they really want to be clear on what you want your business to do for you and then also when they start they 've gone through this incredible growth period and it was always i 'll do that or put the system in one day and one day you know it just becomes um there 's not enough time and they just they 've gone you know they 've gone too far and it um just choosing an accounting software that 's how you and that 's no fault of the business owner it 's just um the business has grown and um and i think um it 's got to the point where they just haven 't got the capacity or the time or the support to be able to take a pause and be or have someone to support and be able to have a look at their business and support them through and actually but it 's almost like drawing that curtains and having a look at what 's what 's driving and what are what 's what are some of the challenges and what 's the causes um that are creating the anxiety or um you know issues and their business and how can what actions can they put in place or structure can they put in place to be more control and um have a you know be able to set some goals in place and work towards those to sort of rectify some of the things that are causing them you know anxiety and stress sure i was businesses um to help them sort of safeguard and future proof their financials um you just touched on that the business plan being so so crucial would that be your main piece of advice or other things as well yeah i think there is i mean the key thing that we do within our program and i think all businesses should do is um you know it 's right to do you know have your accounting and systems and you 're recording what 's happened but it 's also using that information then to look forward so being understands what your break-even points in terms of covering all your fixed costs and overheads but then also developing a cash flow forecast so not having something that looks good at one point in time but having it becoming a living and breathing document so you really bare and then taking the time and putting in the discipline and structure to review your performance against your forecast and understand and that 's the thing if you 're going to you know have creating a a roadmap for in terms of using a those costs may occur in the business and then if you know you can then plan for for those expenses or also having a contingency as well and you 're in your forecasting so you 're understanding what your tax commitments are based on the number of sales that you 've made so you 've got your gst covered having a separate account to be able to have an offset account for your gst rather than just using one operating account when it comes to paying wages and you know paying your superannuation and your tax liabilities you 're not sort of scrounging around for the all that money or having to draw on an overdraft or take a loan out or go into a payment plan because your cash flow was so tight and that causes a necessary stress so the key thing is obviously with the cash flow forecast is you review it and you review it and you review it and then you 're basically planning for the future so it 's a constant it 's a constant living breathing document um also i think what businesses their business you know in terms of financial aspects is um spending time to reach out and support um you know accessing where there 's eligibility where this might be through government grants there 's a few government grants out there loans um as well if we 're talking about just only just last night with the budget now there 's some announcements with budget for small business owners especially around the employment side in terms of having the job maker scheme so that 's been announced so there 's a credit of 200 now if you were hiring someone from the ages of 16 to 30 that year each of the small business owner would get and then you know then there 's a hundred dollar credit as well you know from the ages of 30 to 35 and then you know looking and understanding what 's out actually out there now um there are you know being able to talk to your bank as well and it 's not about waiting to the point where you actually need finance or need necessary funds by actually establishing a relationship the bank and they understand how your business operates so they 're going to be there so it 's very being able to work ahead of time so um to be able to develop an action plan rather than actually going through when you 've already hit that crisis point and you know and you need to refinance it makes it it 's a difficult conversation but if you 've actually got the plan in place um then yeah that 's that 's a good thing and the other thing i think in terms of safeguarding and future grouping of business there 's also an understanding looking at yourself and look at your own personal budget and understand what you want your business to do for you in terms of how much you need to be able to support you know support your lifestyle because that 's that 's going to be critical because you may need to change or modify things in your business if it 's not being your lifestyle they don 't have you meet the business you you really want to be in a more powerful when you 're working with businesses and and through all this um these great services that you you 're talking about how long is this process how long do you have businesses are they needing lots of work or is this something that can take a few sessions with businesses to kind of get them on the right track and empower them to take control a lot of a lot of these things themselves or is it an ongoing kind of support service to them yes that 's a really good question because um every business is is while they might have some common themes business owners can be in different places so in terms of you know what we 've discovered and myself personally there are business owners where i 've had to start at the right at the grassroots level of under understanding their financials and really being able to support them through that and understand what 's going on um you know if that takes a little bit more time um you know we and then you 've got other uh business owners who are uh you 's just the you know for the circumstances they 've you know through you know some of the drought bushfires or you know covert that 's really throwing their business out of kilt so they 're in a position where they can actually um change very quickly so they might be sort of uh you know three months or you know two to three months and then they 're on they already built their action plan gone through the financial review set their business goals and they 're already working and implementing their business goals the other thing that i should mention i didn 't mention earlier in terms of our program we have access to a five thousand dollar professional services grant and what that does is um is used as sort of a catalyst to be able to engage professional third-party providers um to really help achieve those goals and once they 've implemented an action plan and that might mean you know strategic marketing and communication advice specialist accounting or taxation legal business planning advice workforce planning and then also personal training as well that you know you know improve their business so there is a 5 000 grand program yeah and so there 's no end point then a business can come to you and can be receiving that support through the program for as long as they need yeah so yeah ideally we 'd like to go through we have um what we call six stages so um basically you know uh and really where we come involved um there 's like a four stage process we have like a review stage which i talked about earlier which is a financial review and establishing a financial baseline because the key thing that we want to do when we develop our roadmap forward is we want to see these any goals that were established um reflect back in financials because that 's a true indicator in terms of the viability of your business going forward and then we you know obviously the planning of goal-setting phase and then we have the implementation of those goals and i guess as you know in terms of my title as a business coach we are there as a coach we 're in partnership with the business owners to actually develop the goals and then we 're there to actually check in monitor help and coach and help people through because sometimes you know day-to-day things can come up but we 're actually there to help support them to keep them on the right path and to achieve their goals because um that 's what we 're here for our primary purpose purpose is the success of the small business now whatever that might be so it 's a real holistic approach so we 're we 're not just worried about the finances but we 're also worried about the well-being and we know we 're not worried i said we 've got a vested interest in the well-being of the business business owners as well so we want them when they come through the program on the other side that they have the right structures in place a good support network a good relationship with their uh their banks and then also they 've got their tax in terms of compliance so things are all undercover and it 's and they 've got a little bit more time to be able to be able to work on their business going forward and plan and hopefully you know live you know develop some skills that will take them going ahead going for so that they 're in a more powerful position to make informed decisions about their business so that 's that 's our primary focus sure and that that accountability is just so so important isn 't it having that accountability partner um yes as you say things come up and we have the best of intentions of doing the work and um unless we have somebody else there um to keep us on track sometimes that 's really challenging um what sort of results are you are you finding um with the businesses that you 're working with are you getting some good results yeah i have um you know i 've got some uh some clients that um just you know just feeling a lot more free and have a lot more time to actually work and develop on the businesses so you know for example they 't have any accounting software in place when it came to bass reporting it took three weeks and it 's very very stressful and um even just reconciling accounts will always be left to the end of the month and they 're not having understanding that you know in terms of managing cash flow that you 've there are such things as payment terms and being able to put some structure in so you 're not actually paying a bill immediately when it comes in just because you just want it off you guys by actually having a or using the you know there 's a lot of good accounting software out there um that saves time where you know your best could be done in 10 minutes rather you know for some businesses it 's a three-week um exercise gosh that because they 're having to go back changing for them to go from that to some of those amazing programs that are just yeah and then also you know they 're just doing a um looking at uh you know the cost of goods sold and understanding you is actually um we 've benchmarked their business in terms of the particular industry that they 're in and being i had a look just as a you know it 's not something that we can do with all businesses but where we can we like to do it as a sort of a value add and then also gives our clients uh some insight in terms of how they should be performing whether they 're performing better than the industry average based on their location or it gives them just a bit more information about what they could technically be looking at in terms of indicators in terms of performance so we 've seen customers once they 've actually got that information they found it really enlightening um and then also it 's turned a light on for them to look at their costs and look at their stock building look at their selling price and and really understanding you know what is their return in terms of what they 're purchasing and how they 're getting a good return on investment as well so court for any businesses who perhaps um you know what we 've been talking about is resonating with them or bringing up you know some um feelings for them around their businesses and that perhaps helping them realize that maybe they do need that little bit of support how can they go about getting in touch um with you guys and with the program well so you can get in touch with us um through our website so um that 's our i 'll just do there with me i can put that in the um in the show notes as well yep yeah we can we can link yep i don 't know that 'll um but also we have our um our number as well 1-800 number as well people can actually contact us so we 're we 're on available through social media as well through facebook um we have a facebook page for the rewire project um and then that has all our information our links um or contact the you know their local rural financial counseling service provider they can if we have offices in a lot of the we do have a 1 800 number okay and then also our website is a good um portal where people can actually go online and um just register their interest and then what we 'll do is we 'll actually um give them a call and have a conversation that 's how it all starts it all starts um with a conversation yeah terrific court is there anything that we haven 't touched on um that or that we haven 't covered that you think is important that we we should share or do you think that we 've given a pretty good overview of the service that that you guys provide and also the kind of supports that are available to small businesses um i i think it 's um i think the importance is being able to take some time out to actually look um to see what 's out there there are other providers you know not just ourselves you know there is um a lot of organizations that are out there to help small businesses so we talk about business australians out there with the entrepreneurs out there and they have a service called the bincy uh business concierge service um and their number is 13 77 88 and they can actually support identify suitable grants that might be applicable to the business your local council as well is important so contact your local council to see what might be available i know that um in some regions in the southern new south wales especially on on the coast the local council actually offered support grants for small businesses affected by bushfires so um and then also i guess we 'd talk about it um there 's not just the financial support but then you know going through um you know looking at well-being um you know there 's also you know people that are sort of fighting very very hard or challenging or might be their employees that are fine uh there are organizations that are out there especially with the social distancing restrictions there is a coronavirus mental well-being number um where you know people can actually contact that 's 1-800-512 and that 's where people can actually just have a conversation um as 'll include that in the show notes as well all of those various resources that you 've mentioned

    "text": "welcome back to spreading the good stuff i 'm your host today katrina myers and for the month of october we are proud to be hosting this special four-part series it 's a four-part series of episodes for the 2020 small business month the new south wales small business month and it 's in partnership with the new south wales government and the murray river council and we would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet and pay our respects to their elders past present and future we 'd like to extend that respect to aboriginal peoples present today so i 'm joined today with kate uh kate redfearn from 12 good eggs and it 's lovely to have you here kate thanks for joining us oh thank you for inviting me i was really honored really stoked when you invited me last week so yeah thank you oh that 's so lovely yeah no it 's something i am nervous i am nervous i am also excited oh yeah don 't worry everyone gets nervous nerves are good it 's all good yeah lovely to be doing this series i think and to be able to uh interview some of our fantastic local businesses and hear from them and how their business operates and how they 've been able to cope and manage through this whole crazy last 12 months so really looking forward to digging into the questions with you so i thought we 'd just start with if you could just give us a little bit of a background about your business how you came to be at 12 good eggs and what you do sure um so we purchased the business uh six years ago it was a business um owned locally here in barham um we purchased it because mum and dad were sort of looking to step back from mainstream farming my brother was coming home it was sort of a semi-retirement project um so i was always going to be working with them but sort of once we purchased it we decided it 's actually more of a full-time career not really a cruisy little semi-retirement project so i 'm really grateful that we have done it yeah that 's where we started around six years ago okay and so you you bought the business from someone else yes so my family here in barham owned the business so glenn and marty gray and they had had it for three years and then yeah they were looking to move on so we 'd actually been to see them previously just to you know perhaps talk about um building our own egg farm to supply them and then they came to us and said actually we 're going to sell so that 's how we came about purchasing ah fantastic so 12 good eggs it 's obviously chooks that produce eggs and how many drinks we currently have 3 000 we do have the capacity to have up to five thousand however we sort of had to cut back into numbers a bit once the board is closed um we were sort of building our way back up to the five thousand and now we 've cut back down to three thousand so currently we have three thousand trucks every day free range environment fully free range um they have plenty of room to move around okay tell us about i know i 've seen them they 're cool caravans that they live in yes and they 're all like artistically sort of you know decorated and stuff yeah they 've been painted yes they have been painted and i 've got some new ones actually that it 's a project down the track that yeah we 'll be looking to decorate oh cool you like get like school kids or get some that 's the thought that is the thought but obviously yeah with covert at the moment they can 't come out but the thought is to do some sort of competition or some sort of community involvement anyway yeah love that absolutely love it that would be so cool i 'll let you know minter excellent yeah absolutely we can promote it on here if it 's a competition or something we 'd be more than happy to do that love that and so we 're so sort of prior to coming over or you know like when you first set up and everything what main distribution yeah so our main distribution is through igas um smaller independent type supermarkets food works sort of gourmet food shops health food shops things like that we also attended farmers markets um but obviously where we 're here on the board of new south vic all the farmers markets we attended were in victoria so that was probably the main thing that shut down for me when the when the board is closed yeah right so and so how many farmers markets were you doing um i was doing bendigo every week which was a huge one for us and i was doing achuca which is fortnightly another really big market for us and also kahuna so not many but they were weekly like bendigo was weekly and it was a really really really good market yeah right and so bought a shot and you so they just said you can 't go like well basically if i went to bendigo i then had to when i came back to new south wales i could go i definitely could go but when i came back i 'd have son couldn 't go to daycare um i couldn 't go into the office different things like that so it just wasn 't going to be worth it to go to bendigo once come back i slept 14 days and then just have to do that every every week so yes and so that must have been like i remember seeing one of your posts i think obviously you probably had like a lot of stock ready to go like because it happened pretty much overnight that border closed didn 't it absolutely very quick i wasn 't bending on thursday i think the border closed they basically put the police on the border that weekend and i wasn 't able to go to the following market so and yes we had built our stocks up because i had i was selling so much of that bendigo market so suddenly i just had eggs and so what did you do well that 's when that 's when we just had to think about what we could do and you know we we didn 't know when the board is going back to bendigo so it wasn 't you know i don 't want to throw eggs out so to start with i donated a lot of eggs to bendigo foodshare which i love doing i love to think that people out there you know eating fresh healthy eggs kids out there who have nothing um but obviously that 's you know for business i do need to make i do need to make money so i got talking with lauren mathers who here another local operator bandara berkshires and she actually has a truck um that goes down to melbourne and one that goes to sydney and delivers door to door and i just started thinking about it i 'm like gosh that is the greatest opportunity for us you know she 's already set up the infrastructure what have you so i basically just got online i built my online website fairly well overnight um started pretty basic it was a learning curve and yeah i 've just been adding to it ever since and i now um it 's it 's building really well it started off just and supporting me and spreading the word and now i can deliver two doorsteps of melbourne sydney bendigo and sort of anywhere in between so people jump online order i take them to lauren they go on the truck down to melbourne and then all to sydney or to wherever they 're going and then they 've employed a driver who just drives it around the city and door knocks and delivers so that 's how we changed started off slow you know i think i 've got 15 orders the first week and yeah it 's just built ever since and it 's been i 've had the most amazing response absolutely amazing that people really want finding that people really do want to support they want to know where their food 's coming from more than ever and everyone 's at home everyone was baking everyone 's kids were at home in victoria so they were just yeah really appreciating the eggs to the door oh i love that so much kate it actually it 's like it 's it 's pretty much exactly how we deliver our know yeah i love that and um i love that you are able to i mean really that 's a massive pivot like very quickly isn 't it so interesting that like that forced you know it 's something that was forced and at the time would have been just like oh my goodness what are we gonna do but it 's actually led to this whole new market for you because you 're right and i mean even when and if i 'm allowed to go to victoria again i mean yeah we 're i 'm loving doing it i 'm absolutely loving doing it it 's every day i go on and i just have all these comments from people saying thank you and we really appreciate not just the taste of the eggs you know we haven 't_''_488.4 we don 't want to buy them from the supermarket and yeah it 's lovely so good so a couple of questions how did you like sort of nuts and bolts how did you set up your website like what platform did you use i 've already got like 've done a course on building websites so i do understand how to do that um of course i do have a marketing background but i just went i just did a bit of research and i went just with the basic shopify which is really easy to use it 's very user friendly and yeah i just found it really easy to do so okay and i 've just now just linked it to my 12 good eggs website paypal you know those sort of things but yeah there 's a few technical parts but yeah there 's so much there is so much information available to you um so at night time after henry went to bed i was just sort of online just researching researching yeah just working out how to do it myself yeah it 's pretty phenomenal you can google anything these days really can 't_''_547.2 you like it 's it 's all there if you can figure anything out but um but actually doing it is still quite challenging sometimes but when you 've got kids as you know so absolutely and you 're full-time or part-time that you work as well well with all my jobs combined i work full-time really um you know yeah but then i work obviously with western murray lane improvement group so i do the accounts a bit of marketing just to project work for them so yeah with every everything combined it 's pretty well full time yeah yeah and so you were having to do this as you said at night henry 's gone to bed he 's trying to scramble and figure out okay how do i get a website set up so i can sell the eggs online i 'm gonna set up the logistics like that 's quite a lot to actually sort out i must say but um so cool that you 've been able to do it and so you know obviously there 's a few of us doing it like yourself and the orange juice and there 's a few different people doing it now and it 's everyone 's really supportive and you know we 're all in it together so um asking questions and just talking to each i love that and i think it 's actually you know that 's it 's kind of one of the silver linings to come out of this whole pandemic is that people are you know much more open to sort of trying new things but then also consumers are like he 's more open to buying products online that they may never have thought of doing previously i mean eggs is one thing that you sort of think oh eggs online tell me about it it can happen and i think you know we started doing avocados 10 years ago like when we first started and back then like no one was doing any food online but now it 's you know it 's becoming a lot more common and this is really kind of you know escalated that will catapult it forward even more i think so it 's fantastic well a few years ago i saw this it 's not possible that 's not possible and i mean it wouldn 't be possible without your networks you know made as transport and obviously you know unless you 're yeah that 's how i 've been able to do it so it 's been wonderful yeah so that 's a really good point though i think it 's it 's being able to use those networks that 's tapping into what 's already existing like don 't try and reinvent the wheel figure out what 's already there and how you can tap into especially coming from a rural area like this like you know they 're sending it down already whack it together helps them as well it helps pay them so yeah yeah that 's right and so how are you then marketing it so that 's how you 've done sort of your website and the logistics side of it you 're tapping into those local networks how are you marketing it so people hear about it okay so i started with a lot of customers that i already had through going to markets and obviously i had direct contact with them which i had quite a big database so i basically started with them and just let them know that 's what i was doing few boosted posts and things down in melbourne sydney area but i 've it 's sort of been a lot of word of mouth and i 've i 've have given a few incentives to my friends where i send them and say please can you give these to neighbors friends whatever let them know that they can buy it online and it 's just sort of been building that way but i do yes predominantly social media um yeah yeah social media is phenomenal really isn 't it like it is yeah it is and also i suppose that um because i know like linking him with tapping into lauren 's markets and stuff as well as that help does she put you know tell her audience that 's the other thing is as lauren has you know created the local produce boxes which includes our eggs in that so yes so yeah sort of everyone getting together and helping to co-promote basically the region i think um yeah love that just yes so good and so do you think you 'll go back to like you would you you 'll go back to doing it because farmers markets are actually quite you know we did it for a few years but it 's a lot isn 't it it is a lot and they 're early mornings and i was quite relieved to skip winter the frosty mornings i 'm not yes not missing that at all but look it is face to face with your customers you know there is a lot of benefits to them and i do enjoy the social side of it but yes it is a lot of work so whether they go back to what i was doing or not i 'm not sure so yeah if you can keep growing this like it it 's obviously growing still and it 's doing so well so maybe this is easier for you for sure yeah yeah yeah do it all from my office so yes absolutely so what else um i guess what have you learnt in that um you know having this kind of forced adaption like during this last it 's nearly 12 months isn 't it it 's crazy um i think like the disadvantage to it is it 's constant people are constantly contacting you um so you i do find that i 'm on my phone lot more i 'm answering messages a lot more um so they 're the sort of things i need to look at ways of um i don 't know how i managed that but what i have learned is i need to employ people to do more of the day-to-day work such as packing the eggs we already we were employing but we 've actually employed more so that i do have the time um to go out and promote it so i 'm not in the shed well i am still at times but i 'm not always there packing it 's just pay someone to do that so that i can clear my mind so that i can focus on yeah what i 'm doing here and it gives someone else here in the region a job um and yeah so that 's that 's probably one of my my main learnings i love that okay so how many we 've always had um in the shed you need four people in the shed so mum and i have always worked there for a long for a long time anyway um and we had two girls helping us so now i have four people in the shed so that i don 't have to i 'm just sort of there i 'm usually overseeing the internet orders and things like that for the moment and then we have someone helping us collect the eggs as well so what 's that for five we have five people yeah yeah right that 's quite a lot of stuff because you 're kind of running like two you 've got the on farm where the chooks are in the caravans and you 've got sort of that part of it then you 've also got yeah the production pack so you run you do all the packing you manage all of that yourself don 't you yeah yep so we 've got a shed here in barum that has our grading machine and packing facilities yeah right yes that 's quite a but i think that 's a really good point that you made about um being able to employ the right people and not try to do everything yourself but it 's a fine line isn 't it in business too you 've got to get to that point where you 're kind of big enough in some ways to justify but sometimes you 've almost got to employ those people before you 're ready sometimes don 't you because oh how you keep it growing yeah and look i 've sort of i suppose we 've always done it ourselves we think i 'll save money do it yourselves but do you really because you 're taking away the time that i could be using my marketing background my even my accounting you know the accounting for the business that the bills come last because you 're always in the collecting ends you 're packing you know you need to be on top of your accounts and um things like that so yeah i think employing people to do that day-to-day stuff and then i can then focus on other oh yeah i love that yeah i couldn 't agree more actually we 've found the same thing yeah yeah and getting the right people is really important too i would say like yeah yep gotta make sure you get the right stuff so your mum 's still working in the business as well yeah yeah no she 's involved yeah yeah it 's a fairly affair and roger your partner as well isn 't he yeah roger 's a girl too yep he 's certainly the sounding one of the sounding boards and you know go-to for advice he 's he 's got a food science background so he 's very helpful in that type which you know we have we we 're audited quite strictly um you know salmonella and various things um so he 's really handy in that side of thing and you know you know roger he 's got a thousand ideas a day so yes i do know roger and i do know he has a thousand ideas a day i can also relate to that but we love that yeah well he would to the business really yeah yeah we were really lucky actually with the skills between us um yeah good yeah that 's awesome isn 't it it 's actually yeah another thing that 's actually really important in the business too is to have those diverse range of skills and i think also when you 're employing other people it 's to try and match people up that compliment the your weaknesses yeah you know like look at what your strengths are and then think about how yeah and it 's nice that you and roger have got that and then your mom adds brings something else and yeah it 's lovely to have that yeah and we all work well together everyone yeah i mean everyone has their moments but we work really well together so yeah that 's awesome so what are the plans from here then like what 's the future look like for 12 good eggs and where do you want it to go yeah look my biggest thing is my biggest problem spring is when you have a boom in eggs but everyone in the as well so there 's eggs everywhere and then we that 's when we do it 's our toughest time of year september october is our toughest two months of the year for that reason there 's eggs everywhere the name your neighbor gives you eggs everyone gives you eggs so they 're not as many are being sold so i 'm looking at something some value-add_,_1108.64 um i 've i 'm going through a business development program at the moment through western murray actually some funding they got there and we have been talking with a consultant and i 've been part of a group which is focusing on the local the region itself and you know maybe branding the region doing different things but also value-add for my own business so i 've got a few ideas um i 've got a couple which aren 't they 're not fully developed at all at this stage but my idea is to deal with the waste product um is we 're looking at a calcium product potentially for the soil um putting the eggshells back into the soil type supplement for dogs so oh yeah i know i know out there because i looked at pastor i looked at baking and as much as i love food and i love cooking and what have you there 's a lot of that out there at the moment and yeah i just don 't have the i 'm not to say that i won 't do that down the track but yeah these are the two things that we 're sort of looking at at the moment so watch this space oh i love that so you could do the other thing you do is you talk about like you do pre-made things with eggs in them or something there 's another that 's another value out of it that 's more common yeah yeah so a lot of people have branched out into pasta which i love i love homemade pasta but yeah so we i 've sort of looked at the things i 'm you know getting more into the the agriculture side where perhaps there 's some sort of a supplement for the soil uh but as i that though i love just like that the formulation of those ideas even and thinking like that i mean that 's what like i 'm so passionate about i think it 's so lovely to cultivate is that just like thinking differently and thinking about what 's possible and really like that 's that real innovation which is just and it 's also so excited i 'm seriously i have to pry myself off the computer at the moment because i 'm just the more i find out i 'm just yeah i 'm really enjoying it and just this this consultant that we 're using that they 've employed to do this program she just yeah it just keeps you inspired motivated and yeah what will come of it i don 't know but yeah that 's that 's the path i 'm looking at at the moment i love that is that rhodes yeah yeah yeah right froze from reachability yes yes that 's right yeah it 's great that project so so am i right the western murray land improvement group sort of got together to develop innovation yeah that 's right so we received funding for that through the murray-darling basin economic development program probably about 12 months ago and we are running a range of business development programs i think we 've got a group of eight who are doing the initial pilot program and we 're hoping sort of once we get to the end of it then we 'll be able to promote it and bring others on board to do the next round and part of that is potentially looking at some region branding so just looking at branding our region perhaps looking at a trading platform that type of thing for all the regional producers to come on board and be able to get their food into melbourne so awesome i love that it 's a really great project yes yeah a lot of positives and just a really great group of people doing it and yeah it 's been fun yeah that 's fantastic and i know roger 's been really passionate about the regional brand for a long time and you can see how um you know especially as avocados pork chops people out there who want to do things but they 're not sure how to or you know so this program is brewing for them as well there is a lot of people out there you know looking to value-add and what they can do with their farms and whatever yes and if you can show them what 's possible and say well here 's the options for you like it makes it easier for people doesn 't it they can say i can see how that can happen and it 's you know like a bit like what what you 've done with setting up all this logistics and having to go and you know build those networks and stuff if you can make sort of a process around that and say well here you go this is all you need to do like yeah so much more appealing to someone yeah yeah absolutely yeah because i can understand i mean i brought an established business but you 're starting from scratch it 's quite daunting and when you start you know who do you go yeah absolutely but see that 's that 's actually what i love about what you 've done one of your great skills obviously and you know obviously shining through and how are you able to pivot so quickly during this you know a really difficult time and um and adjust like it 's a real credit to you to be able to do that and it 's very inspirational okay it 's awesome do not stop lying something had to be done or otherwise it was going to be a huge waste and absolutely i don 't like that my parents certainly didn 't no no it was one of the sad things wasn 't it to come out of it you know there 's many sad things but um one of the hard parts about the border closure was that was this stuff that you know you couldn 't get your produce out like that was you know that 's hard isn 't it and there would have been lots of people in that situation that go across the border yeah you know yeah yeah absolutely yeah so it love it um and so will you be looking to get more chooks as well or are you happy with the sort of the size that you 're at now given that spring issue are the numbers sort of good at the moment or would you like it to grow yeah does it depend on demand yeah look it depends that 's another part of the business development program we 're looking at margins financials you know is it best to grow your business or to concentrate on you know sort of what you 've already got so my gut feel at the moment is we don 't want to get to you know a huge size we 're employing a whole team of stuff we like to be involved ourselves perhaps if we could just utilize all the waste product um sell what we have as i said we 've got the capacity at the moment to grow to 5 000 and you know that 's probably what i 'd like to get to and whether i go beyond that or not i don 't know so um that stage okay yeah i love that what you said there 's something that we often talk about and so like that i talk to people about in business and in terms of your vision and where you want to get to and even in the well-being work and stuff that i do is thinking about not kind of just the the monetary goals and the financial goals but also balancing that with you know your lifestyle and how you want to manage it and like i like what you said that you want to stay involved with the business and so so it sounds like that is a is a factor for you and your decision making which is cool yeah it 's not just about the money it 's about the obviously that 's important to you that family yeah the why of the business yeah you know that 's what i want to be involved in farming and this is the way i can be um the mainstream farming these days has gone beyond me um so it 's just a way i can still i get to farm and also my marketing i get to be creative it 's my own business i get to be creative and utilize you know that 's that 's how i say it i love it i can 't ever imagine going back to work nine to five for someone else i just love to be able to have my land and also use my creative side as well i love that kate it 's so good i think you know um often we think about these you 're gonna come up with these new entrepreneurial ideas and innovations and everyone wants to be an entrepreneur but like farmers you know your classic entrepreneur really like you you 've always you own your business and you get to you can be as creative as you like really and so much room for innovation and it sounds like you 're just nailing it i love it and i love what you 've been able to do over the last 12 months who knows where to from here who knows yeah yeah oh goodness me like you know the next six months could 've been able to you know implement all these all these changes so that you can ensure the future of your business yes yeah yes it 's awesome what you 've been able to do um is there any other like sort of tools or things that you 'd like to mention that you think would be helpful for anyone who 's sort of thinking or you know where where they could go or what helped you in the initial stages if someone else is thinking juice i 'd love to be able to do a pivot like this or how do i set up my online business or have you got any sort of last bits of advice for people if they wanted to try something new in their business yeah look i think you 've just got to talk to other people um as i said i wouldn 't have been able to do without the transport and i was just having a conversation with lauren about that um if anything any opportunity that comes your way any of these events that are being held locally if you meet one contact it 's worthwhile going so you 've just got to open up i suppose your mind and head along and just talk to people that 's that 's what i think um i love making contacts networking helping each other because we are all in it together um you know some are faring better than others but yeah we are actually all in this together we 're all from this community we love we love our community we 're proud of our community so the more we can do to help each other and make it success and viable for our kids to live here too well yeah that 's how i that 's what i believe yeah i love that kate i couldn 't agree more i 'm so with you on that i love that i think it is so important to talk to people and that 's that is yeah if you don 't have the answers yourself or if you don 't know what to do then just ask you know there 's so many people there 's a lot of help out i think there 's going to be more to be honest you know as covenant roles goes along or whatever happens there 's there is going to be a lot more out there so yeah absolutely and you know particularly if you are in the sort of in the murray shire area the western land improvement group is it 's just good to give them another mention like the work that they are doing is absolutely amazing isn 't it and if you have an idea and you 'd like to see you know come and talk to us we

um we 're chatting with two small businesses based in the murray river council and and chat with them about how they 've had to adapt very quickly and respond to the impacts of covert 19 which for many um was pretty much overnight for most businesses so first of all we 're chatting with um zoe crump from the art of zoe photography based in mathara welcome zoe hi christy how you going good thank you again for joining us today we might just get a little bit of history um when you started what you do and um and what that looks like for you on a normal daily or weekly basis no worries so i 'm a photographer and have i think i shot my wedding about first wedding about 10 years ago so um most weekends in february march april october and november uh usually booked up every weekend um with weddings but uh at the start of this year in march i had a wedding for the first time for the start of march and then there was talk of restrictions coming in and you know things happening and we were all like oh yeah well it won 't happen to us because you know we 're safe in the country and then i had a wedding book the following weekend and the restrictions started going down to like 50 people then 20 people so it pretty much just got postponed and then the phone just started ringing of oh postponing our wedding our wedding and it just went on and on and on and i think i 'm up to um yeah it was a bit you know business just stopped really how many ways for how many weddings did you have booked and how many did you lose essentially overnight roughly uh i actually haven 't counted but it 'd probably be at least 10 or more yeah up until like so i had actually two weddings on the weekend just gone so they were just very small family dinners as such with like 20 people so and they were your first two back since march yes since march since i think it was the 8th of march wow that would have been pretty special for everyone involved yeah so it was pretty exciting my first wedding back was 140 k 's north of hay so i think i saw the pictures that looked amazing beautiful outfit yeah so how wonderful just nice and isolated yeah well you would have felt quite safe i imagine yeah and there 's no fake no face masks involved out there no no nothing out there just a few flies pretty much um so i also do take a lot of preschool photos i because i live in new south wales i had some that i do in like rochester and leechfield but i couldn 't do them obviously because of the rich border restrictions so they stopped as well and family photos stopped and so i kind of not one to sit around and do nothing so i saw online um my friend that i follow from gippsland she started up um taking photos at people 's front gates and i was like oh yeah that could be something to to do so i just messaged her and i asked her a few questions about what she was doing she said oh i just saw it in america um people were going to people 's front door taking a photo from a safe distance and then moving on i 'm like oh i 'll just pop that online and see if anybody 's interested so i just put a post on my facebook page and and asks you know is anybody interested having their photo taken and people started messaging me so then i had to sort of section it into towns this day and then all these messages started coming and i was like oh um i 'm not sure if i can make it around all those people so because it kind of just did it for you like when you first put it out there it went really nice didn 't it yeah sort of like people were at home they had nothing to do you know often people postpone family photos all the time because they 're like oh my husband 's working or the kids are playing sport or you know there 's always a variety of reasons that they can 't do them so um like in denny i just said you know i 'd be in east denny between three and four and just sort of sectioned off times but at the start i had to find out like where all these addresses were and i had to map it all out by hand and i was like oh my god this is too hard and then i found an app that a delivery driver uses so oh wow just pop all the addresses in that was easy you know we 'll have to mention that in the show notes for people who ever want to you know tackle something yeah what was it called so it was called road warrior that 's awesome so obviously um thinking on your feet and adapting pretty quickly like how much did that help fill the gap i know that um you know as you said people were at home and this was in first lockdown when obviously you could still get over the border so you were obviously covering yeah none of those those issues sort of were in place at that time like it was no dramas that we could to could go over the border or not nothing was a problem there and i actually rang the police and said you know am i allowed to go to people 's houses i 'm not going into their house i literally stand pretty much sometimes i was in on the nature strip and i just toot my horn they 'd be ready standing at the gate i 'd wave to them take their picture and drive 're you know you 're working because one of the reasons were that you were had to leave home for work so that wasn 't an issue and so people then had the option to purchase a print or the hi-res file yes so that was all you know delivered online and stuff so and i know that you charge the minimal fee you know for that but how how far did this concept um the front door concept go to kind of replacing income you may have lost from weddings or was it just to kind of keep you busy doing that just your crap initially it was just to keep me busy but um it did generate revenue as well so yeah like it was fine and yeah it was very handy really but because there was nothing else happening and so when you said all your weddings were cancelled well postponed like did you did you were you kind of um comforted that you know weddings would come back like did you you know did you always say like okay i 'll have you know i had march and she postponed to september and i kind of thought oh maybe that 's a little bit early but you know it should be fine by then but um so they could have went ahead but they actually lived in victoria and they were getting married in new south wales so that 's where the issues yes came across then and you know i had on saturday the bride 's her two best friends lived in bendigo so they couldn 't come to new south wales then her brother lived in brisbane so tricky there was those yeah so they pretty much had like four cameras set up in the church oh really so i think they said there was 137 people from around the world watching oh wow they 're weddings so yeah that was pretty special and all the groom 's family were from england so oh wow none of his family could be there and being very involved in the wedding industry like how long do you think it might take or look do you see weddings you know going back to some sort of normal 's going to take a long time i think they will be but i think a lot of people there will be a change in the size of weddings like people are now just saying oh we might just have our immediate family and have very small intimate dinners yes and a lot of people are saying oh you know but i might have a big party next year but i really don 't think that will happen because i think people 's lives move on yes you know that 's happened they 've been married and they 've moved on to something else you know in their life rather than it 's almost like funerals like i don 't think people are then going to have another big yeah another wake in 12 months time or yes yeah can i ask um zoe just you talked about the app that you used to kind of you know find all the addresses and and obviously you use social media to sort of get the word out there what other tools or like what what else did you use to actually um put a post on my facebook page had my pen and paper here and i just had you know you had to have your details of this is your address what section you know i had sections of towns in just you groups please write what section um your name your phone number and your address and then i literally just wrote all those down and once i got to like a limit that i thought yes was achievable in that hour i would just say sorry that that 's it for that day i can 't fit anymore in and then i would type those addresses into the app and it would sort them in order so wow that was that was very handy i really don 't think i would have been able to do the amount that i did if i didn 't have that app because it was so time consuming of looking on google maps trying to work out where it actually is and was it actually like did it feel like a lot of your time like i mean you 've obviously got six month old baby so wally actually came with me i think out of 680 families that i visited wow i reckon he came to 630 of them so that thing feels very cool so that 's such a billy member yeah to my two-year-old he actually stayed home most of the time because he learned to take his seat belt off and get out that was a bit tricky not super handy and obviously the word really spread and i i know i saw um some articles in the weekly times were you on the front of the weekly times no there was um the land newspaper yes um the outback magazine yep uh the kahuna oh no the baron bridge newspaper yep um the grazia magazine um and then just the local papers like the riv and the pastoral times and did you put it out there to all those um publications or did they find you because of the i suppose the online presence that you you had and people sharing their images so a few people um so like the local papers just contacted me and magazine i kind of just sent them an inbox on instagram and said you know this is a real project because there was a lot of farms that i did cover yes yes and i really love the way that you shifted from like families and farms to them that the older people did you want to talk about that so when i was driving to hay i was i 'd visited a few farms that had older kind of families at them and i was like uh there 's lots of newborn photographers and people that specialize in kids but there 's nobody out there that really specializes in the older generation and they 've got so much character and i could photograph old people all day like they 're yeah wonderful yeah have a chat with them so i was when i left a few farms i was kind of driving out there in the middle of nowhere and thinking um you know i might just put it out there that because they they did say you know they 're going to leave the farm and other family what they got up to on the farm so you know when i pulled up at one farm the grandpa 's walking in with his hat full of mushrooms that he 'd been out to pick and you know little things around the farm that they talked about you know we built this shed in 1960 something and yeah so that kind of stopped a little bit when the second restrictions came in i sort of was a bit hesitant then of of going into older people 's houses yeah um for obvious reasons um i didn 't want to be the one the e5 yeah that 's something so i think once um once things settle down again i will promote that again that 's great and because it 's basically unexpected kind of um yeah like down that yeah memory lane for the older the older people that was something that you weren 't looking for it just sort of happened but not at all i just sort of thought oh yeah okay we 'll see what what happens here and as you said it 's probably an something like that and and yeah there 's a lot of photographers that i know specializing kids and maternity and but nothing it 's sort of at the other end of life and do you think that covert is certainly um helped you look at other avenues or as you said it was a bit of a happy happy accident that happened but you know i think when when businesses go through these sorts of challenges they do look at how else they can they can adapt i suppose yeah that 's right i sort of was like oh well you know lots of people were like oh well that that 's it you can 't shoot weddings and i 'm like oh well there 's always something else that you can do so um just so happened that i didn 't think that the project would be that popular so yeah it kind of done someone explained it to me they 're kind of like well once one person had it had a picture taken it was sort of became a thing oh well they 're having that done and i also think too it was a great opportunity for so many families who had wanted to get around to doing that family photo and never got around to it but actually had the time to just think about it and coordinate yeah that 's what you said and a lot of people i went to you know they had kids that were eight or nine and said this is the first family photo we 've ever had so yeah wow sorry zoe based on your experience um during covenant adapting really quickly obviously thinking on your feet and and pivoting when you sort of um you know had to find something to do both i suppose for for your work but also just to keep busy as as you were saying it was such uncertain times do you have any advice or tips to sort of businesses to um about how to cope in a situation like this it 's so difficult because it was so unknown to other people and to everyone really because not often you 're just told overnight that 's it your business is you know look you know obviously around the world of what 's happening with other people and social media is a great way to communicate with people and find new ideas so i think yeah it was really tricky because it was super unknown to everyone so everybody was in the same boat but you know all other businesses seem to have adapted to you know you could buy bread and milk at the drive through bottle oh and yes cherry yeah so i think everybody just yeah worked together and helped each other and even just having that you said like just looking outside at what other people are doing and having that bravery to sort of you know get on the phone and touch base with someone doing something that yeah that might work you know because i think there is that sort of you know we 're all in this together and i know it sounds cliche but i think that if you do look outside and um and like look to see what other people are doing and getting you know advice and tips from other finding that that that the road map kind of app you know like because there are lots of little things like and you 're you 're you 're you know adapting to what you did obviously logistically it was really challenging for you so yeah that 's right nobody ever would have thought oh the logistics of it would have been the biggest um issue yeah so good on you and look what about the future have you got a few weddings coming up other than the two you just had like how 's the schedule looking in the next six months yeah so i 've got another two this weekend great and then um we 're just assessing sort of what what 's happening with the other one because they 're quite large weddings so and you know obviously victorian weddings are still yeah unknown at the moment so it 's lucky that we live this side of the border at the moment yeah and a fair bit of your work i mean you 're based in murray river council at the therapeutic fair but your work is is it it varies at times like sometimes i all of my weddings for one season would be in achooker yes um but yeah i just happened to be lucky this time that i did have quite a few weddings north so yeah that was very very handy well thank you so much for chatting with us today and well done on you know pivoting your business so quickly and doing something that was you know truly amazing for all the people that you you know um shared your skill with and and took photos of families because i know that they will enjoy those photos forever yeah it 's something that i think families will look back on and go oh remember you know we were locked up and definitely yeah well done well thank you again and good luck with the rest of the wedding season hopefully it 'll be it 'll be a busy one and hopefully yeah thank you chat again soon thanks so much zoe in this second part of today 's episode we 're going to be chatting to julianne daley from the border inn at the border inn welcome jules hi christy how are you good thank you for um chatting to us today before we get started and talk about how the border inn kind of coped i suppose with the challenges of covert 19. i might just get you to talk about the business and how long you 've been involved and and just about you know the bordering as an institution essentially in moammar yeah okay so my um parents um moved to achuka moamma 32 years ago and for the past 30 years we 've been at the bordering so in that time i first started working at the border when i was 22 23 so i always make the joke that i 've watched everyone in moamma grow up some people not grow up but um grandparents um yeah so there 's not really very much we 've missed happening in muammar and over the last 30 years but it 's good and we love it and it 's still our family business um and i know for so many jewels too sorry to interrupt but you know like like i know for myself as an 18 year old i came into noema from a farm out of cornwall and learnt to pour a beer at the border in with your darling dad and jb your uncle and you know for me that sort of started a career in hospitality that you know paid for overseas trips and just sort of you know it gave me the ability to to just you know talk to people and you know and learn skills that i 've sort of still got today so i know that the border inn um holds that you know that really special place for a lot of people so um i just wanted to start to say that so very special place in my heart and i know for a lot of people in the area as well yeah which is what most your local pubs in most little towns are and of course we 've watched moana turn from a little town um into a quite a big busy town and getting busier all the time there 's a lot of like it 's a think that it will be even more exciting for everyone when they stop um queuing on our bridge when closure has been bad enough it was busy enough before that but there 's lots of exciting things happening in moammar as well um i think the council 's done a fantastic job and it 's a great place to live um so and you 're right we 've employed a lot of people over the years there 's not very many um times you go out somewhere where someone doesn 't go they either have worked there and i 've forgotten because they weren 't there for very long or even their parents under john murphy have gone um i used to work at the bordering even before our time so yeah it 's good and we 've still got our local kids working there so which is fabulous so julianne tell us what happens when the pub when it stops overnight for me yeah well for everyone for the business like when covert hits like you know so many businesses things changed overnight essentially yeah which it did and everyone was in shock and that first week when scott morrison announced that um this was going to affect our country and we got limited so we had to take some stools out and it was coming and everyone started to say that you know we were going to shut down then that monday morning came when we had to pack up the pub and it was it was such a strange feeling and i can remember having that feeling and feeling sorry for people that maybe lost their farms or have lost their businesses through other ways that it would be so devastating and the only thing that kind of kept us okay was the fact that everyone was doing it at the same time but it was probably for the first time that feeling that we weren 't really sure what we were going to do or where how this was going to end um yeah it was a really strange time upsetting for a lot of people um when you 're in the hotel too a lot of people come to the pub because they like to away from them um so all of a sudden also they were stuck at home like no one was allowed to go anywhere um it was it was a worry i i was concerned about our staff i didn 't know what was going to happen to a lot of them we didn 't know whether it was going to be for two months or whether at the time they said september so we just crossed our fingers and thought can we get through two months of not operating so that 's when we that first week we traded and we decided to do takeaway because we were lucky enough to be able to keep the bottle shop open so you did that straight away pretty much no way because we could keep the bottle shop open so we thought well that 's important because at least we can keep a little bit of something ticking over and i suppose we had uh two temporary visa chefs at the time that if they couldn 't get centrelink um job keeper job seeker so we kind of didn 't have much do enough food to keep these guys that don 't have any income employed so of course the first two weeks was a disaster because we were going backwards like you don 't make a lot of money out of food and that wasn 't good at all and then scott morrison announced that we could have the job keeper and that gave everyone a little bit of hope so um lost a lot of money that first two weeks and then once the job keeper decision came in and we thought well we will go with that that made it a little bit easier so that was the job that that was our two months of shutdown yeah off everything turned off every air conditioner thank goodness it wasn 't cold we didn 't need the heaters on because our staff were turning up to answer the phones and it was cold and there was nothing going on and all that 's all they were doing was running the food out to the bottle shop for people but the locals gave us amazing support like it was really good be able to actually go for a drive in their car and pick up their takeaway food definitely yeah and just from that welfare point of view i know that you know in in the second lockdown particularly there 's been a lot of talk about you know people 's well-being and you know we were talking before we started recording about you know it might be tough here at times waiting on the bridge or you know having challenges but you know people living in melbourne still um today you know in lockdown and can 't_''_1624.559 can 't_''_1625.279 go more than five k 's from their home um and they can 't leave for more than two hours so like the challenges of that but just the well-being and and one of the first people that i thought of when the pubs were shut were the regulars jewels like the people that go to the pub every day and it 's part of their life and they might just have a couple of you know ponies of you know whatever it is they drink or seven ounce and then this time and like that must have been terrible thinking about that was someone like my dad who um at two o 'clock every day would hop in his car and he would drive down or scoot her down to the pub at two o 'clock he would have four beers to see what was going on which my mum loved that as well because that was her two hours where she was home alone and be able to do whatever she wanted that that was his break there 's a lot of people like that it 's just what they do um just to catch up on what 's happening in town or if there 's anything going on so all of a sudden and mom and dad were probably a really good example of just sitting there and nowhere to go nowhere to escape particularly for the older people yeah it was really important for the young ones too which of course um it was it 's tough on the young ones when they couldn 't go out anywhere and they couldn 't even catch up with their really tough um and yeah i think about the melbourne people still all the time now all the things that people are going through that until you you know get the opportunity to talk to other people which are with which they 're not but for example i 've got a sister that 's had a new grandchild and she hasn 't seen that baby and it 's her son so um alan she um her mom 's in ballarat and that baby is now four months old and there 's no support no support no friendships and um she hasn 't even seen baby mum so there 's so many stories yeah yeah that 's unfathomable jules i might just touch on some of the things that you put in place like you know obviously you said you started doing takeaway um straight away and you kind of learned a bit of trial and error but were there things that you kind of um tools that you use like you know was it just as you said like your staff they 're answering the phone like what things did so quickly so something that we had never really thought about was some well the delivery for a start but we used uh um an app called bopple yep that took a little bit of setting up but that was um really new for all of us and different for all of us because um technology wise we relied on a couple of our younger staff to go radio this is what we 're going to do now um there was quite a few examples of that like thinking outside the square what are we going to do um and that was good and it was good for everyone to learn you know online ordering which the young ones do but you know the older staff they 're like you know more traditional probably a little bit more i am a bit of an online shopper but but i think to it in a town like a chickamauga where we don 't have you know um your uber eats and you know we 're not used to kind of ordering food online so sometimes if it 's like we just i 'm sure a lot of businesses did it differently there wasn 't kind of one one sort of you know ideal ideal app but i know that a few did use um the bobble app and did that work well for you yes it did it was good i think maybe gave us a little bit more exposure um where maybe people hadn 't even maybe eaten at the border in before right um yeah so so that was quite good there has been a couple of positive things that have come out of it staff wise working as a team and all putting our thinking caps on we probably had more meetings than we 've ever had before yeah yeah try and continue that and the only reason that happens is because life 's routine and it 's busy and we 're always short-staffed and there 's not enough time to sit around and think about different things that we can do and also listening more to your staff um not that you don 't deliberately not listen but maybe they don 't get the opportunity or you when you get desperate um you can put anything on the table and and give it a thought but when you 're really busy you 're like oh yeah that 's a good idea but you know maybe later and you just keep doing yeah the same thing what would you say jill 's the biggest challenge has been um for you or you know or are there a list of challenges obviously you know apart from financial worries um and when i say that it 's probably the uncertainty of not knowing for us at the start i would say to 80 you know we have worked really hard our whole lives in hospitality tourism that 's what you do you don 't get to do all the things that other people get to do we 've never been away at easter we 've never been away at christmas time you know you grab a week here a week there and everyone was saying it was such a level up oh isn 't this great coverts going to level everyone out and i 'm like no that is not now i 'm level with my daughter that 's not fair um but that was the uncertainty of it like just not not knowing whether we could be closed down for 12 months and um for us established business 30 years maybe that would have been doable um just to shut everything down um but for a lot of people um not even an option like that would be just it of course you shut everything down um i suppose your overheads are gone so you don 't have to worry about your electricity so that was one-sided but that was just anxiety and anxiousness of that you 've worked your whole life maybe for nothing but after that two months and you know we think okay things are going to be okay if we can get through this time immediately it was the staff like i said when when you 've got a small business you are more personal with your staff like in big big companies you know you don 't get to know everyone 's issues and problems but most people that have small businesses are close so it 's really stressful to think where are these families going to get their money from if they can 't go to jobs because they can 't go to the government what do they do so they can 't fly home to italy to the uk to sri lanka because at the time things were disastrous there they have no income a couple of them with children um and there 's no money coming from anywhere that really stressed me out yeah i bet my once you know it was bad enough having to tell people you know i 'm sorry you 're not going to get the job keeper you don 't have a job anymore go home and live with mum and dad you know that was a little bit stressful but not it was more the families i don 't think what is going to happen and of course in the back of your mind you 've got this what about me too like yeah so the job keeper the maintaining our staff um was probably the main concern for me through the whole thing apart families yeah of course um yeah like you know nieces nephews out of work you know my brothers and sisters worrying about their families us worrying about my mum and dad all those things yeah yeah and anxiety particularly you know and just that worry but now that we 're sort of we 're not we 're not through but we are certainly things are different now um particularly for um you know murray river council-based businesses like things have been a bit more open in new south wales for a couple of months now um is there a couple of things that you can kind of pinpoint jewels that 's that 's really helped you and your business through like if you had to kind of name a couple of things even if it was just you know not non kind of logistical things in the business that kind of yeah helped you through yeah so i suppose one of the things i 've reflected on is we 're members of the australian hotel association it 's very expensive to be a member of that association and i suppose don 't really you know we don 't really use them you know what are they for why do we pay all this money or we have to be a member um this experience being a member of association and the guidance that we 've received from them with the covered safety plans with all the things that we 've had to implement without that association it would have been really difficult and you know i would have um rung them maybe once a week for the last months not sure about laws rules regulations asking them to help us with the border closure situation complaining a lot about all the things that are unfair and they 've represented us and they 've been really good so maybe the resources that you 've you don 't use that you should use more often yeah but once again over the lesson they 're there use them no different to achievement tourist association which is another real example i probably never really called them um my river council before and asked them anything or um so i 've gotten to know a 're for so use them yeah actually commandment tourism have been terrific like at the moment i think they 're really trying to help um the new south wales accommodation which is in a little bit of trouble at the moment yeah because we 've got no tourists on this side of the the river and it 's been what it 's been six months now they 've been empty so that 's a little bit of a worry but um um tourism have been really helpful with that c4em um i did notice early days when we were using australian hotels association that c4em were putting a lot of stuff up on their site for the small businesses that maybe aren 't connected to an association yeah how do i know what the grants are what they 're entitled to what they should apply for i notice are really helpful with advice for the job keeper and community for achievement like it 's important that 's what they 're there for to help our community so and we 're about stills can i just ask whereabouts you were getting media like all these things that you noticed um where were you finding that information mostly well i noticed it on facebook but ah it will send out stuff yes yep with mostly social media emails um but there was quite a few people that i 've run into that i 've said you know did you apply for this grant did you apply for that grant and they hadn 't or they didn 't think that they would be eligible for it so they hadn 't applied for it yeah and i quite a few times stay on c4 am um because they 're pretty well much were over the top of everything yeah and if they would ask them a question but so those are really small businesses um i i think that that was a um that was a good initiative from singaporean to keep all that stuff updated yeah and now as i said on with a bit of reflection on you know from sort of now back to march number one lesson learned or a couple of lessons along yours is there anything that you forbid yes i think business-wise and personally because um like alex my daughter it was a good thing too because she is a saver and it 's not that her job was affected by it because she 's a school teacher so she still had income but for businesses i think you have to save for that rainy day i mean i never would have thought in a million years and i 've said it before over the years that hospitality tourism i thought was one of those industries that was really bulletproof because everyone always everyone wants to go out and everyone wants to go on a holiday and i seriously thought that we were pretty much bulletproof especially here in such a great tourist area so i think we 've learned that no business is bulletproof you just never know so you have to have a little bit put away yeah same on a personal level anyone you know you just cannot live from week to week because you just don 't know what 's going to happen no so that 's probably um one of those things learned this support your local community yeah without our local support so take the tourists are away um who are we all left with and that is our local achievement community so it doesn 't matter whether it 's you know whatever cause it 's for charity sponsorship or um just your local community shop local look after each other yeah i think that 's been and i 'm i 'm really happy with the chickamauga the way that we 've still remained as like one town it 's been hard yes yes but we have and and there 's been no you know all um you know they shouldn 't be over here or they you know why are they allowed over here um i think we 've all been frustrated for each other with the border closure the weights on the bridge i 'm frustrated for a duke of businesses i feel really sorry for them that they 're still not operating as they should be considering there 's no covert i think that 's really frustrating i 'm frustrated with frustrated with our premiers both of them will put us on the map is that border town that complained that squeaky wheel and i think i just wanted to touch on to that community support and i imagine you know 30 years of the border in supporting community whether it be sport or fundraising or individuals or families i 'm sure you 've felt that come back to you in in some way during this time yeah definitely definitely um i think sometimes and you 've heard it over the years that a lot of people complain about the tourists and how many tourists there are um and i understand that that can be really frustrating sometimes but i do think over this time now when we found out that we need the tourists which is why we have beautiful facilities a picture theater a heated pool all the things that those tourists bring us i think maybe there 's going to be that nice balance there of you know understanding that we can still be a local town um and enjoy the money that the tourists bring into our community as well yeah i agree well go is there anything that you will sort of um retain from this private experience to sort of i suppose future proof i mean or bulletproof as you said nothing is bulletproof that 's one thing you 've learned but is there anything that you 'll keep in place or that you will um reach to you know in the future that um that you that has helped helped you through um i said at the start of the covert that i would never complain about anything again i would never complain about my phone dinging because someone can 't work not being able to go away on a busy weekend um i think and i hope and everyone can remind me um i think that we 're going to be more resilient um as a business moving forward i think that probably everyone we won 't complain about ever being too busy again i do think that it has been a nice little reset for everyone i think noticed out in the park even out here a lot of people riding their bikes a lot more family time yeah out those good things and you know take from the take from that and go well it does totally and i think a lot of people would say that you know despite the challenges i think that it has been a bit of a recalibration of sorts i think whether it be for your business or for your personal life um even schooling the way our kids have learned you know there 's there 's been lots of lessons learned and um i think that it sounds very cliche but it 's true so um the funny things of the people with the customers that come in and and the staff and i think they have a greater appreciation for their teachers now someone made a little um yeah they found out that um maybe um maybe their kids weren 't as clever or yeah i agree and i think you know i really thank you for um joining us today and just sort of documenting this time in history because i know my mum has always won through the whole period saying i hope the kids are keeping a rolling their eyes going well we 're probably not but you know it 's really important to document this time in history because we are living history you know as painful as it has been and still will be for for many people so thank you um jules for for joining us today and you know sharing

    "text": "hello and welcome back to spreading the good stuff i 'm leone cannon i 'm christy o 'brien and i 'm katrina myers hi girls it 's great to be with you again this is technically our 52nd episode um but it 's also the first episode in a special four-part small business focus series that we 're sharing here on the pod waves for the whole month of october yay which we are really excited about so october is small business month in new south wales and in celebration of that we 're partnering with murray river council to deliver this short series of episodes that 's really aimed at supporting people in small business so just like us that are based in across regional new south wales i think it 's fair to say it 's probably an understatement uh to say that this year 's been one of the toughest on record for lots of small businesses across the nation and across the globe many have suffered huge loss they 've been forced to shut their doors in some instances they 've had to pivot many times had to change their offerings many have had to move online and move whole businesses online it 's been a huge period of change and so over the next four episodes we 're going to be doing our bit here on the spreading the good stuff podcast to help businesses reboot to up skill to look to the future and to really i guess help improve their confidence so as part of that we 're going to be chatting to um some wonderful small businesses in this region who have been forced to pivot as a result of covert 19 and really looking at some of the lessons that they 've learned and are continuing to learn along the way ultimately we hope that the conversations go a small way towards nurturing a really strong engaged and inclusive business community and one that we can all learn through and move forward together so we 're going to kick off this small business month series with a conversation today all about building your brand online so pryda covered many in the small business community already had an online presence but there 's been a time that 's been about really examining how well their online presence has been working for them and looking at ways that they can do things better for other businesses it 's been about moving whole businesses online and all of their product and service offerings and then there 's been ones that weren 't online at all until now so that 's been a massive learning curve for them so today we 're going to do a deep dive into the importance of having an online presence and some ways that we can go about building your brand online so helping people out who are starting from scratch people who are already in the game it doesn 't matter where you 're at we really hope that we can share some helpful advice that might make the whole process a little bit easier for you at this time so christy i might throw across to you first um just to talk about i guess before we even start building that brown brand online what are what are some of the first important steps sure so i you are what you do and why you do what you do is probably the first thing to think about and even if your business has already existed for a little while or you are brand new um it 's a really good exercise to sort of really get clear on your brand 's story and your brand story is essentially your why and i know that you know that what your why has been sort of something that 's been you know thrown around in recent years i think we can thank simon sinek is he he the guy i think katrina that started that you know watch your why and it really turned marketing on its head too didn 't it and and as far as story to to sort of tell the world what you do has become really important so you know figuring out not figuring out what you do because what you do is probably quite you know obvious but um really sitting down and working out what your why is and and that comes down to sort of you know why you chose to you know and it is it might be for the money but that 's that 's the obvious one we 're talking about you know like what what 's deep down inside you and it 's about your values you know what are your values um that you bring to your business are they are they in line with your personal values because you would would hope to think they are and and if they 're not then maybe that 's a process you have to sort of work through as well um things like your mission statement like why do you exist and you might have a product that that services you know people in this way but how does it make their lives better you know like how does it actually really bring some some you know change and value to people 's people 's lives so getting really clear on that on your brand 's story is actually something that helps you move forward and and it kind of then um influences everything you do moving forward whether it be in marketing whether it be content for word when we write people 's website words that 's a really great example they 're a brand new business you know this is what we do can you write me a website and then we will say well actually why do you do what you do and some people find that really difficult so we have a process that sort of helps people unpack that and really figure out like ask questions about why you do what you do and we find don 't believe that some businesses find that really difficult and we give them homework to do that it 's kind of it 's not easy but it 's such a great process because when you really crack it open it opens up this whole world of um for want of a better word like marketing content you know like because that because that 's what it is marketing content is literally telling the world why you do what you do and honestly people will come to your business because of who you are and why you do what you do it as much if not more you guys agree with that absolutely yeah so simon sinek says people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it yeah exactly what you 're talking about there chris yeah that 's like a summary basically of exactly what you said and that 's certainly been um i guess kind of my experience in watching grand grands bro brands grow i love what you do that 's so funny um watching brands grow and you know the ones you love are the ones that you really buy into their their story and their wine you really connect with and i think that 's like you know as humans we 're all craving connection and so so when you can really feel connected to a brand and what 's behind it that that 's when you like latch on and follow and want to kind of you know um binge on everything they do and so that 's the goal really so i would say definitely agree with you on figuring out your why and then also once you 've done that thinking about well who is a service-based business it 's really then about thinking well who is my target audience and who am i doing this for once you 're very clear on your why i think that why you know your reasoning is first almost important but then who is your target and who is the product for and or who is the service for and really honing in on that and getting really clear on that because you know all the top kind of brand specialists and online course creation people and all of that they all talk about really you know it 's you know we all know there 's so much on the internet these days it is just a there 's so much to choose from and so if you can make it seem like you are speaking to people on that really individual level then that 's what will get them in you know you 've got to be able to talk to them and make them feel like this product or this service is made for them so that 's really important and i would say that around your imagery your logo your colors all that kind of stuff really try to hone into what your customers want because you know i mean we still often see some like logos out there that are just you know like slapped together or whatever but you know and and the branding and the colors but really that stuff can actually be really important as well in connecting with your people too like what really resonates and and thinking about what your target audience would want not just what you like i think that can be really hard for people sometimes is to get into that get into the shoes of their customers but really valuable and really important when thinking about your actual brand imagery and not just your story i think so in creating our brands absolutely absolutely what you 're saying they 're so true and i think before you can go down the path of looking at any of your imagery [Music] you need to get really clear on that stuff that we 've just talked about and the christie 's just spoken about that who you stand for um because until you 've done that it 's really hard to pull together all those other elements absolutely yeah that 's right and that gives you that 's like your pillow then and your brand values and your brand vision and all that kind of stuff and that 's what you go back to when you 're designing all of that so that it all aligns and um i think that 's where the gold is yeah and i was just going to say like in creating our three brands that 's what we 've really well so we 've created the barometricators for the club brand and now i 'm working on my personal brand and i think it also evolves too like i don 't think so sometimes you can get really hung up on this stuff too it has helped me back on my personal brand a bit like oh my god who 's it for who 's my target who 's my ideal customer avatar and you can get really sort of stuck in that too so be careful of that because it and as your product grows or as your service grows that 's all okay as well so don 't feel like it 's necessarily got to be whatever you decide on today is what it 'll be forever because it can evolve it can grow and that 's all okay so just keep that in mind as well sorry i was going to ask attorney before we move on to you lay just about that knowing what your audience wants um like how do people go about doing that i know there 's you know market research you can do and i 've spoken to other people in small business particularly online small business that you know actually pay like outsource that you know research online research so how do you go about that um katrina yeah it 's hard i think it 's a bit of um which came first the chicken all the eggs you 've got to start putting some stuff out there and then seeing what resonates with people a little bit as well and that can be that really challenging part i think it 's there before you really know because unless you 've you know what do they say clarity comes from action so unless you 've actually got something out there yes you don 't really know and you can do things like you can survey your customers or you can ask the polling questions on instagram sometimes you 'll get crickets other times you 'll get responses i know that when we interviewed sally branson she was really big on do the market research like pay someone you know she had found that very helpful for her business doing the actual you know professional market research but yeah sometimes you 've just got to start putting stuff out there and you know like if you 're using instagram or using social media track your um your insights and look well which posts are resonating what 's resonating with people and and that kind of thing and you know if it 's a product based service then yeah again you can see you can facebook and instagram have such great uh audience analysis you know works behind them now so you can look who is really connecting with the products or the service so but i think it 's about in the very initial stages it 's about getting something out there and then seeing what resonates from there and then sort of making it grow and evolve as you go i think is because sometimes i think you want and i think sometimes when you 're starting out like you want everything to be like you know um ready you know like yes if you wait for everything to be ready and and know everything and find out all the info you 'll never start you know so yeah exactly but sometimes it 's better off just to get something out there and then just see and and and go with it what you 're saying is good advice yes i would 100 say that from my experience too like with our barometers brand it was easy i just sort of got it out there and got going with my personal brand i 've been a lot there 's a lot more fear and limiting beliefs around that so really you know just get it out there you won 't know and i know lee before you let me cross to you lee like you and i talk a lot with our clients at this point in word about that paralysis by analysis you know even if it 's the smallest content or the biggest amount of content you know like yes make sure it 's as as good and as accurate and correct as it can be but just put it out there you know because you can just be crippled by that analysis can 't you yeah absolutely and i think it 's you know it 's also a bit about running your own race too isn 't it i mean we can give all this advice about what 's worked best for us and what we hear from the experts as well and and things to try that you know really worthwhile um but it 's about doing what feels right for you as well and for your business there 's no wrong way really to do it but there are you know a couple of things that you you that give you the best chance and we for our business in particular because we are all about communication content writing storytelling is just such a huge part of what we do that 's how we 've really chosen to build our brand online is through story but the the thing about that is that it 's that 's not just because of the the nature of the work that we 're in that that storytelling works for our for us as a brand online it is proven to work for absolutely any business whether you are a service-based business or a product based business storytelling has been proven time and time again to be that sort of golden nugget that makes the huge difference and i love this quote i i came across it many many years ago um it 's a native american quote but it 's tell me a fact and i 'll listen tell me a truth and i 'll hear tell me a story and it will live in my heart forever and it 's just so so true when it comes to building that is through storytelling and it 's not this isn 't just something that we 're making up the sciences to prove it um that stories are the quickest path from the heart or between the heart and the mind so our brains are just hard wired to remember them it 's just it 's it 's just a fact so which is really exciting too lee i think for businesses because sometimes i feel like there 's this silver bullet out there and there 's this kind of secret formula that i don 't know and how do i figure out how to do it well it 's already inside you like your marketing tool is your your story and and you know touching on what you 're saying there about the science like google as an example like they now recognize you know like storytelling like human centered content as way more important than search engine optimization words in your website content like that that is really great because it means that anyone is capable of telling their story because it 's coming from within exactly and that there are many brands and businesses out there that that don 't weave story into their their brand um and their content marketing so if you look at the two when we market whether it 's a product or a service um without storytelling you can see it you can look for examples if you do it without storytelling you just it 's a really hard sell for that service or product but when we use those stories in our content marketing we 're showing through that story how this product or the service um that we 're offering can actually change someone 's life and there 's a really big difference in that and that that 's the power of story right there and talking about that brain science when we tell tell stories is actual those um neuro transmitters are released uh into the brains of our listeners or our readers when we 're telling that story those neurotransmitters are released and they induce those hormones so those good feeling hormones like your oxytocin and your serotonin and the endorphins and so when our customers have got those body that is that is when they are connecting with us that 's when they 'll we start to build that real real trust and human connection between ourselves and our brand and between the the clients themselves and when they 've got those beautiful hormones in their body they 're more likely to to want to buy from us or to want to support our business so it 's just something to keep in mind um and like you said christy often with clients that we 're working with and we sit down with them and and we talk to them about the importance of storytelling they will say to us but you know i don 't know how to do that like how do i weave story into my my content marketing um but there are just so many opportunities to do that it 's it 's not as hard as what what it seems and i think a really good way is to have a look online at other businesses that are using story um and just to note the difference and see how they 're doing own content marketing yeah and that 's the beautiful thing about every every business every small business particularly that exists like they all have a story about how and why they came to exist you know and and why they keep choosing to do it particularly during tough times you know like why do you think why is it that you choose to continue on even when sometimes it seems really hard so you know that that 's a really important story because people can connect with it it 's that human connection and and that 's what drives people to to kind of yeah align themselves with those businesses so so where do we tell these stories that 's probably the next question like how do you choose where to share your story because the online platform is pretty big and vast and scary for those who haven 't kind of dipped in so um i want to talk about that yeah and i would say straight up to not be overwhelmed because there are so many different platforms there are so many spaces online that you can potentially know there 's obviously website blogs your edms electronic direct marketing you 've got all of your social platforms facebook twitter instagram pinterest linkedin um there are just so many and within all of those platforms then you you can have you know posts and then you can have stories and videos and there are just there is there are so many ways to do it so i think as a starting point um particularly for those that maybe aren 't online or just sort of starting with to play around online to to pick one or two and to really focus on doing those well because if you try and do 15 from the beginning you won 't do any of them well yeah definitely and i think you have to think about what fits best with you as well like we 've worked with some businesses that just don 't do facebook they might just do instagram they might just do video and and they might not do written like long form written content like blogs so and there are no rules you know you you don 't to linkedin and and some might be twitter orientated so i think that you really have to do do your research as well about what might work best for your business but also what you 're comfortable using if you already use instagram a lot for your personal personal life or you know and you 're comfortable with that platform then then maybe start start thinking about instagram which for some people would say is a really like positive platform more positive than others but it depends who you speak to and what their experience is so if your business is very photogenic then instagram is is great um often lee and i find in our writing business it 's hard to come up with images because you know we haven 't got a product and um so it 's kind of thinking about how you can put that forward but little videos of just helpful tips can be maybe more powerful than just just an image so platforms is something really worth considering katrina would you agree yeah so there 's a couple of things i was going to hanging out too so you know like that 's just another part of really figuring out who your target audience is because you know if your demographic is women and you know there 's a certain age group then chances are they 're on instagram so it 's really good to be there i mean if you 're targeting men probably they 're not so much maybe they 're more on linkedin like just have a think about that about who your products were and where those people are hanging out because that 'll give you the best bang for your buck and then match that with what you 're comfortable with and in terms of what you 're comfortable with you know this is a really tricky one so i bet some people are going oh gosh well no one wants to hear my story like my story is boring or you know but you know i can 100 tell you that everybody has a story and every story is interesting and fascinating to everyone else even if you think it 's the most boring story in the world it 's different and it 's your personal story and it 's your perspective and and your perspective is what people love to learn and know about and so just to give you that confidence booster and if you don 't feel comfortable then do the work to get comfortable because showing up and being new and being authentic is what people will love and it 's that building that know like and trust and unless they can see you unless they can connect with you they 're not going to trust you i mean there 's so many brands out there that don 't have faces to them and then it 's like and especially these days unless you 're getting you know present with them and getting up there in front of them in there it 's going to make it a lot harder to build that connection um there 's i 've actually just been recently doing this like free course with the school of visibility i highly recommend checking out particularly for women because i think women particularly struggle with that really showing up online and and all that sort of thing and just really powerful in um that work is in just stepping into yourself and being able to back yourself and you know and like i love seeing people 's videos and i love seeing that connection and most people do love that so just you know if you 've not feeling that confidence then do the work on building that up so that you can really get yourself out there because that will really help to build that connection with people i think and um you know you 'll you really notice a difference once people can start to know like and trust you i think and it 's that level of exposure to is the next trainer which is difficult but you know more difficult for some than others and my advice would be to that if you love playing you know on instagram but you 're on there kind of looking at what everyone else is doing and you 're thinking about launching something maybe just start you know commenting on people 's other you know products or brands as yourself people very nervous about even commenting or liking or sharing anything online and if you have trouble doing that personally then it 's probably going to be the same in your business so just get used to like putting putting your voice out there and and then as you said katrina figuring out what your voice is and what you what it is you have to say so you do need to just dabble and then what the biggest thing about online and we say this to all of our clients like if you 're not giving online you 're not going to get anything back so you can 't just put things on there and expect people to give you the love because if you 're not giving it out you 're probably not going to get any back sorry absolutely you have to you have to jump in at some point don 't you and that 's that 's a huge part of building your brand online that we haven 't really touched on and that is being a really good digital citizen and getting out there and following you know other businesses that you love and that you may be aligned with or just that you really love the way they go about doing things um and just getting to know them commenting on on their posts and and the love will come back to you so that 's a really important part about it i think the other thing too is not to i mean i agree with what you 're saying absolutely katrina about you know getting out there and and you 've got to really show yourself and and and who you are that kind of face behind the business so people can build that connection with you but but not every time you engage online do you need to be doing that there 's there 's so many other ways um in building that online presence it 's not doesn 't all have to be about your business um so those brand stories can be about about your consumers and the value that they get in return for the service and the products that you 're offering so it can be a real yeah well i would really say a lot of it has to be about the customer you know like really you want to be really focusing on them mostly you know if anything but it 's it 's how you or your service or your brand relates to what they really need and tapping into them you know it should be all it 's not about you it 's about them really at the end of the day mesh in with as you say a little bit of your story but then relating that to how that helps your customer basically is the gold really isn 't it and that comes back to a game like why your business exists like for example for our business the splendid word like we we exist as storytellers because we want to tell positive stories you know about people so as opposed to negative news stories so you know that that sort of that as a premise is sort of something that we can then share other people doing the same sort of thing and you might have a a turf business but environment you know so you 're going to talk about the environment world environment day and why we love green space and so it 's that bigger picture stuff but you have to figure out what those things are and that 's where your business values should line up with your your personal values about what 's important to you and then realize there 's a whole bunch of other people out there that share those those values as well and you know you 're not going to relate to everybody but that 's okay you know so it 's finding that kind of um those bigger picture things that that mean more use those as a connection as well so exactly with the platforms girls did you want to talk specifically about some of the technical stuff like which platforms we use we probably haven 't_''_1536.0 we 've talked about a few but what do we think works best for our businesses katrina what would you say um okay well just this is more like a graphic design branding tip but if you don 't already know about canva a game changer um so just canva.com and you can get a you know professional account or whatever you can get the free account but it 's just you know you can design everything in there yourself really um and it just is such a handy tool uh and then you know obviously there 's the scheduling um apps and everything that you can use for instagram and facebook i 'm currently using plan olly which is quite good i 'm quite liking that i have used plan in the past which is pla double n and there 's also one there 's quite a few and i think with that it 's just a bit of figuring out which one you like best or which one works for you or works with your style so there 's but that is helpful for when you want to plan out your content ahead of time um which i 'm actually not that great at doing i kind of like to do it a bit more in the moment but if you do like to plan ahead and plan out your weekly like on a monday morning or on a sunday night or whenever you 've got time to start of the week plan out your week 's content and gone are the days too where you have to have it 's not about like mass content anymore there was a time when instagram was all about you know just heaps heaps of posts every day but now it really is that quality over quantity so you know if you could just plan out three posts for the week using an app like plan only or later or something like that then you 're done you know it does take a lot of the pressure off too especially if you 're a business owner with kids and all that kind of thing if you can do that little bit of planning and start a week that can be really helpful so that probably my two main ones that i would recommend is canva for your graphic design stuff just awesome and then plan only um for the like sort of planning stuff yeah that 's what i 'm working with at the best the only other thing i was just going to circle back on which we hadn 't talked much about was email um yes i don 't know katrina you have your email database and we have ours for the splendid word just to to mention how important that is for businesses as well um if you don 't already have one just to it 's such an important element of building that brand online is to really start building a database of subscribers that you can email out to directly because as we 've spoken about on the podcast before social media is all well and good and there is such powerful reach to be to be found on those platforms but it 's real estate that you don 't own and it can be changed at any time as happens all the time algorithms are not always working with us from working against us but that um email database is something that you as a business actually own um and look again you know at times email can be such a noisy space as well we 're all i know for me that some of the businesses who i do love and love the way they go about their work i love hearing from them on email you know i wait for that weekly email to drop into my inbox so i think that 's one that people really should consider as well and in doing that just to i think the one key advice i would give there is is just to make sure if you are using email and sending out to your database just to make sure what you 're sending to them really offers them some value there 's no point just sending an email out just for the sake of sending one because you think oh i better send an email this week because that will help me build my you know online brand um and that goes to everything i think really in every piece of content that you put online really think carefully about what value it is that i 'm offering in in putting this out into the world and if if there isn 't any value in it maybe i just think email is a big one and um i know for you katrina as well that 's something that you use um what do you think about that one yep i could not agree more and i totally agree with the fact that you own that it 's your database and yes i think building your email and it 's also like straight to them the other thing that you just reminded me of there to talk about though too in terms of building a brand it 's it 's like i 'm looking at doing one for myself as well but is to really look at the podcasting option or youtube but just as your really core content and and so more and more i 'm realizing that you know that if you have a podcast or you have a youtube like it might seem completely overwhelming but something to work towards it just gives you that core piece of content every week then that then you can feed all your other you know avenues with that so maybe this is for a more kind of advanced starting out probably looking at podcasting and youtubing might be a bit overwhelming at the moment but for a more advanced business you know i highly would recommend starting a podcast or a youtube channel or you know igtv and you just focus on that one core piece of content each week that just adds heaps of value and then you can take quotes from that and you can take bits from that and you know and i think that really builds your authority then too as a thought leader in your industry and all that sort of stuff so email and also like looking at podcasts and that 's that 's youtubing that 's key what you 're saying katrina is in in repurposing content definitely yes because yeah you don 't need to keep reinventing the wheel so if for example with our spreading the good stuff podcast in in what we 're in this episode today from this we 've then got content that can be used in our social media posts for the for the next week in our um email marketing on our website and mind that if you produce a piece of content don 't just roll it out in one spot think about how else you can best sort of get that bang for your buck and best use of your time if you 're gonna put the time into creating something then think about all the different ways that you can feed that out to to the customers who are wanting to hear from you i agree and i might just take a few steps back a few steps back as far as having that you know that um the content on your website like a game with email with your website you own what 's on there um as far as as opposed to social media but for people a bit scared about podcasting video and instagram tv like you know a regular blog is a great place to start and you know the great thing about a blog on your website is that it 's a place where you can really tell your story like you know you can really put your imprint there which can be shared over to to kind of um you know share your values share your story and really kind of um dive deep and again you put your um blog can be shared in in a regular email out to your your people as well i think it 's a good place to start um for those who might not be ready like so if you 're starting your business and you 're not ready to sort of take on stuff that might be a bit technical i think it 's a really good place to start and like google ranking like you know putting a regular blog on your website will help with your google ranking as well like it 'll just keep your content fresh you can um you can have lots of links to different things like once you start a podcast or or you know you can add links in there as well so if you are building a website um i would highly recommend that you have a blog kind of aspect or tool in there because it 's really really useful and well also on that though just like i don 't like writing i much prefer making videos so if you don 't like writing you 'll probably never do it so and there 's another technical tip for creating a website too you just reminded me something to talk about is you don 't need to spend a fortune on a website you can make your own website so easily these days and i don 't know if you guys agree but i tend to not go to websites as much these days so i don 't think you need to make your website unless it 's a product based website then you know and that can get really technical then i think it is worth paying someone if you 've got heaps of different products but if you 're a service-based business or if you 've just got you know a couple of products and just squarespace or wix are just you know perfectly fine and simple to do it on so don 't feel like you need to spend a fortune on a website that 's for sure but yeah and also yeah blogging a quick little if you 're more comfortable just bashing something out on camera then video yourself doing a blog you know each week totally but if you like writing right yes but that weekly content is really super helpful yeah and i think this leads really nicely yeah this this conversation leads nicely into kind of you know technical stuff at the back end like people like for some people don 't see and obviously planning is really important and that was a tool that i wanted to talk about which also you know leads into probably one of my favorite tools is um trello or any type of online kind of um organizational project based platform so trello.com is a online whiteboard as such for want of a better explanation and we use it for all of our business work i use it for personal stuff as well and all of our clients use it as well so it 's a wonderful platform where you can order all your information you might have a board that 's got your website content your social media content your your core so it 's a one-stop shop it takes everything that 's happening in your business and in your head out of email out of text messages out of all the other messages you might be sharing with people and it puts it in one spot so um there are other versions of trello like asana is one that we used a while ago lee which you know i think works for for some people as well but trello works really really well for us and you can upload documents you can upload images you can set reminders you can do so much with it it 's um it 's really cool so that would be a place to start we 've been using trello now for probably four years at least yeah at least i reckon yeah that 's free absolutely love it yeah yeah it 's really good it 's not everything that we need you can use it for personal stuff i know like i 'm involved with you know sporting organizations and i 'm like let 's put all this stuff happening in this sporting club you it all on this trello boards you can have all your you know you can have rosters on there you can have everything it 's just really great and because it 's free and that 's one thing we haven 't really touched on like yes there 's lots of um things you can buy and you can yeah have someone make a website for you but there are so many free tools out there particularly when it comes to social media like it 's it 's all free totally and the trello christy too as you say i mean it we use it a lot for our planning for our social media for for the splendid words social media but also for a lot of our clients social media because we can all hook in our clients can jump in on the boards as well and upload their photos and check off on copy that we 've written for them it doesn 't do the the posting um as such but you know it you can always have another program alongside it if you need that but we just you can see everything there that you need and it orders everything for you really takes it it gives thing it gives everything in order and i think sometimes when you 're starting a new business or you might be rebranding or reinventing which a lot of us have had to do in this time where do you even start you know like and then if you have a plan and it 's on it 's on a whiteboard but online which you can have in your back pocket because there 's a there 's an app to you that you can use on your phone so um we don 't get paid by trello but we bloody should because i mean a huge part of our work now is actually in teaching clients how to use trello so but we love it we 're out there yeah if you need help we 're here um do a course girls you should create a course there 's a good pivot for you i just love funny things that are helpful and you know we 've i 've recently helped a that was in their email and in their head and in their you know the boss 's head like just all on the board and they 're kind of like oh my god like it 's all there and they didn 't feel that overwhelmed so i mean i 'm sure there 's other tools out there and you know um once this episode goes live we 'd love to hear from anyone listening about the tools that they use because there 's you know more than one way to do these things so but this is um that 's something that way you definitely use it and that 's what i love that 's probably my favorite tool as far as you know how to just we can tell them i 'm not sure you love it as much as our steve katrina we have dragged you into the fellow oh look i 'm just not as project managing planning like it 's just attention to detail is not my thing so like you know i i do like i like it i appreciate it but i i don around in your head katrina yeah i do i like the big picture strategic visioning stuff i 'm not so good on the detail but you 're lucky you 're in the background doing this i know but where do you put your planning katrina i 'd love to know [Music] all over the place exposed okay this is my strength area yeah it 's just i 've got some trello boards i 've got some google drive stuff i 've got some dropbox stuff there 's just yeah it 's it 's you wouldn 't want to see mine carrying it yeah exactly so lee what 's your a lot of the tools that you girls have talked about i love as well um but the one thing i i thought perhaps just the tip i would give um given that we were sort of at the very beginning talking about that first step and what to do before you even think about getting online and that 's all about getting clear on on your brand story um so i would just suggest there that it is such an brand strategy and there are so many ways to go about doing a brand strategy they can be as simple or as complicated as you want them to be and we do a lot of work with people around brand strategies just to help with them telling their stories so i was just gonna i thought i 'd just mention a couple of the key items to work on and you can pull together your own brand strategies so just to make sure that it includes your vision um so that 's really the idea behind the brand to help you know guide the the future for you focus is really on tomorrow and who you want to become so starting off with your brand vision uh your mission statement so that 's all that 's really looking at the pain points of the day-to-day struggles that you 're offering solutions to so that the what we what do we do the why we do it that really tangible stuff um then to look at your brand values uh and often those brand values in business are one of the let 's be honest really there is not there 's no difference between you and and your business um and what you stand for particularly if you 're running your own business um so those brand values uh then looking at your brand 's unique message so we talked about that there can be ten different brands that are copyrighting like we are or that are selling shoes but the keys to finding that really unique selling point um you know for us it 's about spreading the good stuff and using our words words as a force for good that 's that 's what sets us apart from other people who do the same kind of work as us so getting really clear on your unique um message and story uh and then things like um what you want your business to be known for that 's a really important thing as well of course where you are going to express your messages on what platforms um your tone of voice is a really important one to get clear on how you want to sound um whether you know or educational more you know gentle a softer warmer kind of brand just get really clear on that tone of voice who your people are so being really clear about who those heroes are in your brand story um and of course like you spoke about katrina that target audience so really knowing who it is um that you 're talking to what their buying behaviors are where they hang out online um so there 's probably i don 't know ten sort of key headings to to include and just you can pull together your own brand strategy but it is just such a powerful tool then to always circle back on um any time that you are going to put content out there and that you are putting your business out there online it will just keep keep that consistency of brand moving forward which i think is really really important yeah i agree and i just want to touch on one point let you mention there i know we spoke earlier about paralysis by analysis and just kind of putting stuff out there but i think research are doing and and and not just finding other businesses that you love the look of and what they 're doing online but also figuring out what you don 't like and what you don 't want to look like online i think that 's just as important you know because we all see those businesses go oh that 's kind of you know you know they 're not talking to me or that i don 't that i don 't get that whereas you 'll have others that you really align yourself with then and i think you know we 're not talking about copying what other people are doing but we 're talking about kind of looking how other people behave online and how they build their brand and and you know go with something similar or you know see the videos they might be doing or see the content they 're writing and kind of go yeah that fits with my skill set or what i feel comfortable with so i think research is really important but not to the point where you get overwhelmed and go _''_2593.52 heaps better than me that was probably at your point they were probably at your point at some point at some point as well so you know you don 't don 't get overwhelmed by the comparison but that 's what i 'm trying to say yeah or just give yourself a timeline yeah yeah give yourself a time frame for the research like because you can get really stuck in the what 's everyone else doing trust me yes i know i 've been there but it 's probably a journey isn 't it katrina like you have to go you have to put yourself out there and have a look and immerse yourself to kind of be in the world like if you 've never been on instagram before you 're probably not going to go well i 'm going to go on instagram tomorrow you know like you probably need to play in the space for a while and even that he 's just observing for a little bit and and going with what 's what 's comfortable so um yeah yeah i feel like each each we can keep talking forever but we are going to be covering lots of other topics in our in our next couple of conversations lee yes yes so so from this episode uh the next couple of episodes will be uh interviews with some small businesses based in the murray river council region um so they 'll be coming at you we 're probably looking at maybe weekly for these um but we 'll make sure you 're following us on the socials and we 'll be giving you plenty of warning as to what 's coming up and when usually we 're fortnightly on a thursday that we release the episodes but we 're going to change things up a bit just for this month because we 've got a few extra episodes to slip in uh so yeah the next the next two episodes will be interviews with businesses who have been forced to pivot during this time of the global pandemic um looking at what they 've done how they 've done it and the lessons that they 've learned and then we 'll wrap up with thought leader probably more around financials we 're looking at financial support for small business so um we 'll keep you informed as we go along during the month but yeah if there 's uh any feedback that you 've got to give us following on from this episode uh any questions anything specifically you 'd love us to ask some of the businesses that we 're going to be interviewing then please get in touch and i think for all the technical stuff too late to jump in there all the technical things we may have mentioned any kind of you know products we might use or tools we will share the links to those in our show notes so for those new to the podcast we always um share a link on our socials and also on um where we share our podcast for the show notes so if you go in there we pretty much have everything we 've talked about even if it 's just a sort of random book or a random podcast or whatever we always share the links in there so then you about so hopefully that helps but feel free to touch base you know by direct message on any of our socials and um we 're only uh a quick message away really one of us will yeah touch base so i think today 's been fun i feel like we 've just you know it 's the tip of the eye we have covered a lot yeah yes i hope it wasn 't too overwhelming for people but there 's a lot we could talk about this stuff all day i think but i i think you you that um that document that you talked about at the end early and doing your brand sort of strategy i think really summed up everything that we talked about and is a lovely place to start for people i think too we 'll go back too yeah definitely okay girls well thank you thanks for the chat thanks for tuning that was fun thanks thank you thanks guys and

    "text": "[Music] this video is a playback of the community feedback that we heard on the draft community strategic plan following six weeks of consultation in may and june earlier this year this is the first of two videos in about a month 's time we 'll be able to share with you the updated community strategic plan that has been updated based on the feedback that we heard from you all my name is gisele and i 'm from right lane consulting we 've been in partnership with murray river council for about nine months and we 've been involved in this project as this is a strategy document for and by the community and so we 've been brought in as a third party to help the community provide their perspectives to council so we can create this plan so this presentation will take about 12 minutes and i 'm going to cover six topics first i 'm going to do a bit of a recap on what exactly a community strategic plan is and where we 're at in the process of developing this plan i 'll also plan that we tested with you the community and the process that we took to engage with you all to get your perspectives i 'll spend the most of the time on the community feedback that we heard and finally i 'm going to wrap up and talk about what happens next in this process so to recap the community strategic plan is a community-led plan that identifies priorities and aspirations of the community it covers a period of 10 years and is an overarching strategic plan that guides the council 's four-year delivery program and one-year operational plan it 's delivered by the council as well as partners such as federal and state agencies and community organizations you can see that it 's such a foundational document for the council as all of its important plans flow from this community strategic plan so we 're in the very early stages of developing this csp so you see it referred to as the csp and so as i mentioned earlier we gathered your input in may and june and now we 're at stage three of a ten stage process at the stage now where we need to refine the draft within council taking on board your feedback and iterating it to create the next version of that so we tested key statements from the draft strategic plan with the community over the last few months and so these are the different elements that we tested the purpose the 10-year aspiration and the strategic themes we had to get creative and use a variety of different methods to get your feedback on the community strategic plan ordinarily we would have come face to face run a couple of town halls and a couple of uh facilitated a couple of consultation processes because of covert 19 we had to use different methods and you can see here we used four different kinds of methods and so through these channels we engaged with a total of 38 people we facilitated some network consultations with representatives from business and tourism organizations within council we also facilitated a conversation with representatives from community organizations within council some of you have participated on the your say murray river platform in completing the online survey and businesses in council and the average age there was 50 plus we also wanted to make sure that those that weren 't online at this moment weren 't going to miss out on giving us their perspectives and so we arranged a number of phone calls with older residents who were supported by murray river council carers to be able to complete the survey but by phone i 'm now going to take us through a summary of feedback from the community i 'm not going to go into complete detail and read everything that 's on the page a pdf with the detailed feedback will be available on the your same murray river platform for you to be able to download similarly if you do want to stop and read some of the feedback you can just hit pause on the video and then keep going so the first thing we tested with you was our draft purpose statement which is to enable a healthy livable and prosperous community the feedback that we heard from you is is first we asked you about whether you could describe in your is and so it 's a couple of themes you can see here on the page and one that i 'm going to call out here is that the role of the council is to provide beneficial services for the good of all we also asked if you agreed with the purpose statement and 80 of you said yes and 80 comfort level is really great for a first draft we also ask you what you think is missing from the purpose statement and so some of you said that there needs to be a bit of a reference to the small town atmosphere and adequate amenities because that 's something that draws visitors and others to visit and stay in retirement there are some wording suggestions and a couple of other questions there too we then tested our 10-year aspiration to create a thriving community within river country where people want to live visit and invest by working with businesses community groups and neighboring councils as well as advocating the needs of community with governments and so again we asked if you agreed with the statement and 80 percent anything missing from the community aspiration statement and you can see here that there 's a reference for environmental sustainability that could be integrated into the aspiration statement we then tested the strategic themes that sit below the 10-year aspiration statement so there are five themes here i 'm going to go through each in turn so we asked you if you thought that there were any themes missing from that list of five i just showed and 70 of you said no so in this instance no is actually a good rating because we 're asking if you think there 's anything missing and so a lot of you said no that that list is pretty comprehensive we also ask if there 's any themes that you 'd like to add and so some of you suggest that we could consider including or updating a theme related to the culture and arts as it 's something that could not be its own theme or fit as a sub theme under any of the five themes displayed we then took each theme in turn starting with the built environment and environment statement we develop a well-planned built environment that provides for future growth and investment which supports our existing community businesses and visitors we again ask you if you agree with this theme and goal so in this instance only 60 of you said yes and we asked what you thought was missing from this theme and there was a question specifically on how this theme fits with the next one on the natural environment so wanting to understand the differences between themes is something that we need to consider in the next iteration of the draft we also ask you what activities the council should be focusing on in relation to the built environment theme and so you can see here that uh some people suggest partnering with neighboring councils for example echuca and that getting synergy across the twin towns is something that 's desirable to people some other suggestions for different activities on the built environment is around the beautification of facilities as well as completing all streets with landscaped areas so you 're wanting to see a bit of an improvement in your built environment on with the community we value our natural environment that is accessible sustainable well-managed and healthy and this is what we heard from you eighty percent of you agree with this goal but in terms of what 's missing from this theme there 's a lot of references made by a few people are to the rivers and streams and someone noted that we 're surrounded on all sides by rivers and streams and that should be mentioned in our community strategic plan some of the activities that you want the council to focus on in relation to the natural environment is an improvement of walking tracks for all as well as supporting farmers to secure water access as something that you think is really important when it comes to natural environment on the theme of our people the goal that we tested with you all was we enable our people to experience a healthy inclusive culturally rich lifestyle through services facilities and community activities and 90 of you agree with this theme and we had some wording suggestion feedback as well that potentially we could rename this thing from our less internally focused and a bit more expansive the kinds of activities you 'd like the council to be focusing on over the next few years is an improvement of recreational spaces and facilities amplifying the arts and culture in our community as we 've got great festivals and we can continue to build on these and a need to maintain community belonging as well for the theme of our economy the goal that we tested with you was that we aspire to have a prosperous economy where traditional and new industries have opportunities for future growth and investment 85 percent of you agreed with this statement and you had some wording suggestions in terms of what 's missing from this theme so wanting to see innovation agriculture tourism excellence included because at the moment for this person that 's not a particularly inspirational theme and so some of the activities that you think the council should be focusing on in relation to our economy as a theme is to support the growth and innovation of agriculture so a food distribution hub and manufacturing precinct for commodity producers to value sector and the needs of new businesses and industries is something that came through as important as well and finally our leadership the goal that we tested with you here is that we provide leadership and governance that meets the changing needs of our diverse community eighty percent of you agreed with this theme and goal and some of you made some suggestions around how it could be worded and some slight changes so potentially changing it too we are always striving and constantly trying to improve our leadership and governance and some of the activities that you 'd like the council to focus on here is leveraging the local expertise within council so utilizing local people in these roles that are in touch with the area and to seeing this is this is a community strategic plan that 's an example of a suggestion that really helps connect this plan back into the community so what happens next we 've heard that feedback from you all and as i mentioned before a much more detailed version of that can be found on the you 'll say murray river platform next in this process we now are going to refine the draft csp within council as you can see here number three and then the next in april 2021 we 're going to be displaying the draft plans for your input again so we 're really keen to hear your perspectives on the next version of the draft but you 'll see that the journey doesn 't end there there are five other steps taking us all the way to june 2022 when the community strategic plan is adopted so we 've got plenty of time to get your input and feedback and make sure that we get this plan right we 're going to be working with the mayor and councillors and the murray river council to review your feedback on these statements and update the draft content we 're going to be feeding these updates back in the next month or so in a second video you will be able to review more detail on the community 's feedback on the have your say murray river site and as i mentioned we 'll upload that detailed pdf for thanks very much _"

    "text": "thank you and welcome everybody there 's a real cross-section of people here which we hope will provide valuable input for us as we go forward with this consultation process the community strategic plan is the key long-term planning document that the council is obliged to produce it has a 10-year outlook and as as as you 'd understand it it looks at the long-term future of the community it is called a community strategic plan for a reason because it 's about creating from the community from the community itself not from people inside the organization but from the community itself a plan for how the the community the council should develop over that 10-year period and it will provide opportunity for for strategies and aspirations that the community holds for the development communities so I won 't say more than that at this stage other than to say that the the process will be a stepwise one in which we 'll start at a very high level and then work through a series of other consultations that will dig down a little deeper into that plan to provide a more detailed comment from from dares so thank you everybody for attending and we look forward to your continued involvement in the process throughout then thanks mr. mayor Chris and say that thanks for that but say the community strategic planner will councils under their legislation have to adopt an integrated planning and reporting strategy which is includes the key document which is the community strategic plan or CSP as we get to know it and as Chris indicated it 's a 10-year document but it makes reference to a number of other documents that are developed with inside of Council which is a resourcing area so our asset management plan there workforce management plan and sort of LEP and then a couple of other documents that we actually have a long-term financial plan but all of those are developed around the the aims and aspirations that come out of the community strategic plan so then understanding the community strategic plan is actually a document for the community while council actually writes it up for them and part of the part of the consultation is is to get you what are the things that should be maintained within the community and what are the the opportunities for advancement of the community now whether that be by economic development what whether it be by you know sort of action internally and you know sort of enhancing the things that we 've already got there you know so but the community can talk about been all over all of the factors in their community and now they may be health education safety you know emergency management such as policing etc while council doesn 't necessarily deliver on those areas we can actually advocate on behalf of the communities for those so this broad reaching document will actually and the ideas that come from all of the community input will allow a fantastic and had development over the next 18 months we 'll be able to have a really well developed document that talks about all of the aspects of the community that we want to enhance in the you know in the next 10 years and from that council will take out those that we can actually deliver on and and program and then air an annual operating plan that actually comes out of that and so just to reiterate what both the mayor and des said that the community Juke plan is a community-led plan and that 's a really important part of this it 's a beginning of this definition because it is the plan by the community for the community and that 's why this first step in the consultation process is so critical so the plan identifies the priorities and aspirations of the community as des mentioned it covers a period of 10 years and it is that overarching strategic plan it is the sort at that top level it 's what guides the four-year delivery program and the one-year operational plan and as des mentioned and it 's delivered by council as well as with partners such as federal and state agencies and community organizations and so why is it important that we get your input here and why is this plan important it 's because what 's included in the CSP the community strategic plan leads to tangible change in the community so a really is in 2017 Council called for expressions of interest to collect the community 's ideas for major projects or initiatives that would benefit your local area and so as a result of this process we now have many of these ideas being delivered or on their way including the Barham state skatepark the toilet Buckman 's 4th Park redevelopment the picnic point redevelopment the bar and pavilion murray downs walking an exercise track and improvements at the miami rec reserve including a multi-purpose pavilion and these ideas were called for because i will link to a part of the previous community strategic plan so in the previous community strategic plan the one that 's an expired or expiring we and had a theme there around the built and physical environment and the goal there was around and that we wanted to our built on physical environment to be well planned connected safe and designed to support our communities and industries and businesses and the specific strategy here that was is to improve and maintain community infrastructure so because that was a specific strategy council called on these expressions of interest so it 's really important that we get a diverse array of perspectives on on the community plan we want to hear from as many people as possible because people 's perspectives are really important in shaping what the ultimate CSP will look like and so where are we at in this process we 're in the really early stages of developing the plan and so you can see here that there 's a there are 10 steps and major steps to get us to the point where we 're finally adopting the community strategic plan so here we are we 're in stage 2 in December there was an early draft created within Council by a council leadership and that was very early stage thinking giving a little bit of structure and giving the community something to be able to react to and that 's something we 're gonna go through at the moment in this process and and so we 're gonna gather community input to that step 2 then what happens next is that that we take everyone 's input and we refine the draft within council process and see what changes need to take place in the plan we then will display the draft plans again to the public for more input and then we 'll finalize the drafts as pay for the incoming council our new councils will be elected in in September 2021 and then the council 's will provide their own input on the CSP around October then we 'll gather the final community input on the plan in early 2022 and once we take everyone 's perspectives finalize the last elements of the plan we display those plans to the public for the last round of input and then we finalize a community strategic plan and it 's adopted in June 2022 so really what happens such an early stage in the process and and while I 'm going to communicate this is it 's really important to note that this is not just a where we 're putting the plans up for you to sort of a proven tick off and keep moving there are a lot of different points along the way where we 're going to ask for the point somewhere with that input is going to shape this ultimate plan and so every stage where we ask the input is really critical for the final products that we create with this community strategic plan and so what is this draft plan that we have at the moment so there are a couple of key components when I mentioned that in step one you 'll see here step one there was that create early states draft so this is what we 're taking to you as part of this process and so there are a couple of different components in this draft community strategic plan and we 're going to go through each of these in turn but I wanted to explain a little bit about what each of these components are so firstly we have a purpose statement and that 's really an the why council exists why we exist and how we why we do what we do then there 's the ten year aspiration statement so I 'm another way of thinking about this is a bit of a game plan or what the community want that 's really a long range of you of what we want to see change and develop over the next ten years and then finally there are some strategic themes and these are our areas of focus so we 're looking at that 10-year aspiration is where we want to get to and the strategic themes translate that into the different areas that we 're going to focus on in order to bring that aspiration to life and so this is what our early stage draft looks like and I 'm going to take us through each of these elements in turn so no need to read all of this at the moment I 'm going to take us through step by step so firstly I 'm our drop purpose statement the purpose statement here that we are working with at the moment is the enable a healthy livable and prosperous community so this is really at the top why we 're doing what we 're doing next we have the tenure aspiration and that 's to create a thriving community within River Country where people want to live visit councils as well as advocating the needs of community with governments so it really paints a picture of in the next 10 years where we want to get to and then we have our strategic themes and so these themes are our built environment our natural environment our people our economy and our leadership and so let 's take a look at the goals that are at these next here are the goals so let 's take a look at those and in turn as well so we didn 't outfit the theme of our built environment the goal that gives us a focus in terms of what we 're looking to do specifically around the theme of built environment it 's we want we develop a well-planned built environment that provides for future growth and investment which supports our existing community businesses and visitors when it comes to the theme for our natural environment the goal here is we value our natural environment that is accessible sustainable well managed and healthy for the theme of our people we enable our people to experience a healthy inclusive culturally rich lifestyle economy we aspire to have a prosperous economy where traditional and new industries have opportunity for future growth and investment and for the theme of our leadership we provide leadership and governance that meets the changing needs of our diverse community and so when we talk about input community consultation what are we actually mean and I think for some people and we 've got sort of some sample sort of fictional quotes here to give you a sense of the kind of input that we 're looking for so it might be that we some of the language isn 't clear enough and so we want to make sure that when someone picks up the plan they can really understand all of the words in it so if there are things that don 't aren 't quite clear that don 't make sense we really want to know about that so you might ask for clarification on certain things you might want to suggest ideas or you want to see something different let 's say see something change you want to see some ideas that are specific to particular from Council and you might have ideas or you want to see more different community groups being involved in different ways so this is the kind of thing that we 're really wanting to get so it 's not just about um specific it might be specific ideas that you have but it also could be the kind of community that you want to see what what 's not being captured in this planner people being excluded different areas or industries being excluded we want to know about that and so when we 're thinking about input it 's a really broad range of different ways that we can get your perspective one of the things that strikes me about this process is that in in a very tiny way the cupboard Nadine has provided a silver lining for us and that is that so many more people in our footprint and elsewhere in the country have become much more digitally aware and competent than they ever have been before and that of course facilitates this trial kind of consultation and when you compare the number of people that we the process of going around physically and talking to people in each community we 're probably going to reach more people this way than we did through through turning up at at town halls and the like so we 've got to make the best best use of it though and the key to that usage is not just these kinds of engagements but the use of that door say Murray River Murray River you 're saying Murray River website and and to reiterate Giselle 's words it will reach its potential only if each one of us and everybody you meet is encouraged to use it and we spread the word that this is a very actively active engagement process that will that will capture ideas for the CSP this is the longest planning process I 've been aware of for the CSP development and I think it has the potential therefore to capture and and synthesize a direction for us over the next 10 years in a way that we never have before so I want to thank everybody has been involved so far and and we 'll will be to facilitate this process further so thanks again and please please spread the word stay in touch and if anybody wants to get involved in this particular process and the iterations encourage them to do so _"

    "text": "good morning I 'm Greg Smith I 'm from Marcelo and I 'm here today to talk to you about the rates harmonization process and the presentation that I recently gave to councillors so today we 're going to talk about the the rating background the rate harmonization process the objectives and requirements constraints the opportunities the service pricing and rates benefit analysis would undertake and then undertaken and finally the rating structure options and the impact on rate payers so when you think about this there 's been really no change in the rating structure for the last 50 or probably 75 years and that 's largely been changed and evolved as a result of the community demands and the decisions of councils over the years so the question is I guess is is there a need to realign the rates and the fees and charges and there 's there is some argument to say that this is the opportunity and as an example we 're suggesting that the ad valorem component that is the rate the dollar might go towards funding the infrastructure the fixed amount that is the SIPP I might go towards providing the costs or covering the cost for the services provided we need to think about the benefits to that each of the rating categories to get and we will talk about that a little bit later in terms of rates paid and benefits received and being mindful of the service pricing and the capacity to pay for individuals this exercise is not just about the rating structure councils got a broader issue in terms of making sure they 've got enough income to deliver all the service is an infrastructure that they need to deliver and at the same time manage and use the the income they 've got in an efficient way the other challenge for the merge councils is the service harmonization and generally across the merge councils that 's Barry from counsel to counselor what we have observed is that the service levels generally have gone up to the highest level from one of the participating councils so what we need to be mindful of is that there 's going to be potentially increasing cost as a result of those be looking at service seems like service pricing to see whether we can recover where the council can recover a greater money from the fees and charges as opposed to the rates so in terms of the rate harmonization objectives there 's two paths but one is you 've got to develop an equitable rating structure that distributes the rates burden fairly across the new council area but then that 's going to be balanced with the need to reduce the extent of the impact or the on the on the majority of a pass and into some regards that is a conflict you 've got a set of conflicting objectives and from our work done today it 's going to be a real challenge for council we councils maintain their current rate yield they don 't lose or change that and they also need to be aware of the iPad baiting review that was undertaken for rates right across New South Wales the requirements under the Local Government Act it was amended so that the former councils couldn 't alter their rates for four years and upon reaching their many councils had to then or harmonize their rating structures as I said the initial day was the first of July 2020 and but now they 've extended that all councils can choose to extend to that to the 1st July 2021 so but the basic requirements of the Local Government Act is that there is an ad valorem component which may consist of a minimum as well or base amount and counsel makes those decisions based on the information they have in front of them the the fixed amounts if you like the minimums and the base amount help smooth the distribution and from our work today the the base amount approach rather than the minimum does that more effective more effectively particularly in rural and regional councils as I said earlier the rates permissible income and calculations that won 't change the amount of rates that council can charge will not change and there is a new evaluation for all properties which I believe you guys would have got I 've got mine recently that then that counts as much to use setting they 're making their rates have bunch of issues and constraints for this whole process at the moment as I mentioned earlier there is an iPod review of the rating system there were 42 recommendations a number of those have been ruined by out we don 't believe that be any decisions made before the 1st July 2021 which means we 've got to use the current legislations in place I 'll talk briefly about the submissions that were put in in in relation to that report and I 'll provide a high-level view of that the constraints that council God is in terms of timing of the changes it 's it 's you know come the first of July either 20 20 or 21 the the new structures in place and they 've got limited options and they 're limited by the legislation that the council operates under some of the issues the delay in the implementation that is a harmonization implementation increases the correction gap so if the longer goes the bigger the gap it is that needs to be corrected we need to be mindful councils need to be mindful that total you 've got general water sewer and potentially storm water so they 've got to be mindful of that and the council elections are coming up although I understand now that Ben may be deferred until 2021 regardless its it 's something that councils need to be mindful of the the I guess the summation of the I part the submissions to the eye part I card on their report is best best summarized in this in this sentence well where what is clear from the feedback received is that any change the rating system will attract both applause and criticism every aspect of the system is consistent and fraught with competing vested interest ideas of fairness and differing views regarding of technical application basically there 's pluses and minuses and there 's going to be a difficult path in terms of any adjustment to the current rating structure there was the the one of the major issues was moving away from unapproved capital value in terms of how your rates are calculated to capital improve value there 's no clear consensus on that and our view for rural New unapproved capital value so in terms of our methodology this is how we said happening is that we we develop up a discussion paper talk to counselors making sure that they 're clear about what the issues and challenges and things that need to be addressed are we do some high-level analysis which you 'll see shortly and we finalize the discussion paper with a clear project plan an action plan that needs to be undertaken then there 's some pricing and revenue strategies analysis rates benefit analysis then we undertake the detail rates modeling and out of that comes some options which you will see a bit later and then council makes a decision on which of those options they go to the community engage with and that 's one of the key key parts of this process once that 's completed and goes back to council then council makes a decision about what the new rating structure is and what new revenue policy is for the council going forward these are just quickly the deliverables through that process and we 're talking to you about these ones down impact model for councils they 've got some levers to use we can talk about the suite between residential and business or residential and family or family and in business it just depends on what 's happening on the ground to the council 's okay they can choose to move income between categories but for for our analysis we our two options and Alice 's we haven 't done that you can use councils can use also use more or less subcategories that helps deal with the differentiation of rates that are paid across those categories and also we to consider the affordability or if you like the let the service level as we mentioned earlier there is in terms of the structure there 's a base amount an ad valorem or minimum and adver lon but with the base noun council can only collect up to 50% of the rates income for that particular category or subcategory so so that 's the limit on that but it does smooth out the impact when you 're trying to bring together a number of rating structures special rates is another area works but maybe they could be used for works and services councils can also a sense and chains of revenue streams and wash we 'll talk about that in a minute and also they need to be very mindful of their concessions through attention arrayed rebates and the debt recovery policies they have in place now in terms of revenue policy there 's obviously the key driver for council is financial sustainability have they got enough funds to deliver the infrastructure and service requirement council as I mentioned earlier that 's one of the key things that counsel needs to be mindful of and then once that they understand that expands them what 's the mix of rates and other sources of revenue that can actually fund the delivery of those services and infrastructures when we come to rating principles there 's there 's a bunch here and the two key ones for us equity that balance between the benefit and the capacity to pay principle are the rate payers getting the benefits equal to the amount of money that they 're paying and the other one is simplicity principle you know everyone can understand it but we also need to be considerate about efficiency we need to be consistent with the policies of counsel we 've got to also think about the public good versus the private good in terms of how much counsel subsidizes services they provide and of course the intergenerational equity where people in the future you know got to be contributing towards the operation of counsel and not all the present-day rate payers are paying for all the for example all the infrastructures all the infrastructure costs because we 've done a lot of work with majority of the council 's some of the some of the key observations we 've made that counselors involvement with executive support is critical and the reason for that is that counselors will need to make the ultimate decision and so they need to be involved they need to be on the journey through this process so so that 's critical so when it goes out they 'll be able to talk to the community the community got questions but then it 's got to come back in after decision there 's a need to develop and communicate the rate structure methodology so it 's important that the council understands and communicates their approach to then you revise rating structure because the fundamental I guess issue is that there 's no silver bullet here there 's going to be unfortunately there 's going to be some winners and losers through this process and that 's that 's due to the constraints of the legislation that we 're going to work within there needs to be a clear and a green project planning in and I mentioned that earlier that that comes as part of the early part of the work and then once you start the project and you 've got some momentum you need to keep that going through council through community through the staff and we 've seen a couple of examples where councils have stopped for a you know for some good reasons but then it takes a while to get that going again so if also we can say is that once council start they should keep going strong start participation direction is important because we don 't know what 's you know what 's a priority what 's important on the ground so staff help us in that space and finally there needs to be some really solid community engagement through this process because at the end the community have got to you know understand but they 're the ones I 've got to live with it or once council make that final decision so we 're talking about income so this is the two years 2008 in 2008 in and the breakup of councils general income it doesn 't include water or sewage and it doesn 't include any capital income so you can see here that your rates represent twenty twenty seven percent of your total general fund revenue and down this end you 've got general operating grants and specific operating grants which are reasonably high which is pretty typical for a Regional Council and then your fees and charges and then new charges in here and I guess what I was saying earlier if council could start to move these around a bit it may have an impact on the about the former council area so what this is showing is that thank you come here but is that so what this is saying is that Murray Shire had 55% of the previous rates and Walker 45% of the previous rates then in terms of land value of the former councils Murray had 67 percent of the land value and Wallkill 33 percent of the land value and this is one of the I guess the issues that 's facing council is that the former Murray has got a disproportionate amount of the land value of the new council and that impacts on the options when come the options analysis which basically means that there 's that former Murray guys will probably have to pay a little bit more than they have done in the past in total simply because the the amount of the land value in terms of councils rate revenue this is the new Murray reg número brewery council you can see farmland provide 54 percent residential 37 and business 9% and when you compare that to land value and it 's pretty close in reality land a bit of a mismatch between land value in them amount of rates paid but that 's just for comparative purposes only the next one is the gap if you like in the other average residential rates now please don 't rely on average for we weren 't really relying on averages going forward this is just to help us understand where the potential issues are so what this is saying is that on average the residential rate would need for the former walk cool would need to go up by 105 and for the for the married for Murray River it would need to come down about 55 that 's on average but because you 've got a bunch of self-care degrees that 's it 's not as straightforward as that and we 'll talk a little bit about that later for business you can see here the wall cool on average would need to come down by 119 and Murray would need to go up you know to equal the average rate tired so it 's that 's highlighting an issue there for us that there 's going area and then farmland you can see that the form of wall cool the rates would need to come down by 600 and the form of Murray they would need to go up by 560 again on average again suggesting to us that there 's going to be a movement of rates income from the former Walker to Murray to the former to the previous Marion council very so they 'll talk about rate benefit analysis and what we now do is just join a line the rate pay to the benefits received and so and that 's trying to using the principles around community service obligation and transparent funding so so in terms of rates benefits some ratepayers have more access to make more use of and benefit more from different counsel services so if I use a swimming pool for example in Miami those people in know Emma would have more access to it probably would use it more and they would therefore would benefit more from it than say the rural and farmland people that might be 50 100 or 200 kilometres away that 's the principle subjective but we 've used it in a number of councils now and one council in particular is using it to adjust their rates income between categories the allocation methodology is has two criteria one is a direct beneficiary of the service which if I use sale yards if you if council had some sale yards the direct beneficiary of those will be farmers and in probably the business people not so much the residential so that 's that principle and the other one the council wide line is where it 's the admin or corporate cost that where everyone there 's no direct beneficiary it just needs to be in place for the council to run now this is the these are the assumptions we 've used and we 've allocated the service costs across all these categories so this information is with the council staff and they 'll review it but it 's the principle upon which we allocate service costs as a benefit to the to the categories of council rating categories of council so what we end up with is the rates income allocated here say these are the proposed categories and sub-categories we 're using and basically what it 's saying is resident residential rate payers of cane say urban are paying 1.8 million dollars but or achieving or receiving about 3.4 million dollars worth of rate payer benefits we equalizes back to the amount of money paid that in race twenty two point nine million dollars represents the net cost of services provided by Councillor so you can see here that the residential rate payers are paying less than the benefits they 're getting or that residential urban are but when you come down to farmland you can see farmland are paying more than the benefits they 're getting so and this is pretty typical of rural councils across New South Wales that farmers tend to pay more than residential and business are pretty much aligned and I and I believe that 's you know a lot to do with the history of the rate structure when you go back quite a number of years farmers will probably with the you know the more the wealthier more better to do people therefore they can of the rating structure over many years the net cost of service place is what we 're trying to show here is that from the fixed income the council raises through rates which is the minimums in councils cases of minimums represents 1.3 million dollars yet the net cost of services excluding infrastructures so the 22 million dollars previously included infrastructure costs we 're now taking those out is about 8 million dollars so there 's not a strong alignment between the fixed cost and the net cost of services and you might argue that that the probably council needs to collect more through this to make this fairer for some of the ratepayers whereas when you look at the rating the dollar amount that is the ad valorem it represents 9.3 million dollars and the infrastructure cost is fourteen point four million dollars so you can see there that the ad valorem amount is conferred in significantly more to the infrastructure cost so then there is a possibly an argument to you know clinic more in the out of the fixed charges and then that would then make the you know who 's paying for what part of the service the other piece of work we 've done is the service pricing piece and this is really trying to understand the full cost and income of each service determine the cost level of cost recovery for each service and then align those council 's policies in the actual costs of each service and then the output of that is divided information and a guide to council to adjust or realign the funding sources for each services so it also once you 've got the model in place it also allows councils to then to review the policies and how they park playing apply their policies in terms of setting fees and charges for councils but fees and charges of council into the future this is surprising policy metrics so each fee in charge has a a is allocated within this and whether it 's a market price or whether it 's a marginal you can see the recovery cost here or whether it 's statutory and you know the fee is set and there and there 's no chance 's not all the services this is some of the services that we 've done the analysis on so if you look at caravan parks for example they 've got operating revenue with surrounding fifty three men operating expenses of 277 so they 're recovering 127 percent of their cost which you will expect because care impacts are a provided by the private sector so it 's a market price market price policy and stoke you weren 't expected that that would be where it is whereas if you come to say the corporate engineering and overhead please the revenue is significantly lower than the operating result and so the operating expenses so the recovery is much lower and so each of those services have a different recovery rate so overall the current cost recovery is thirty nine point four percent we 've suggested a proposed target of forty forty three point six but that 's really up to Council in terms of how they want to go about reviewing and changing the cost recovery and that could be in the form of increased fees and charges or it could in a particular service to change that rate of recovery this is just a comparison with some councils nearby and you can see here that Mary River based on their fees and charges and this is from the audited statements they 're recovering about eighty nine percent which is on comparison you know towards the upper end of other councils so you 'd say Murray River are doing a reasonable job in recovering or setting fees and charges to recover the costs of some of the services that they provide now we 're going to get into the rating structure so this is developing your options but firstly your KTAR rating structure you have three categories residential business and farmland in residential you have seven categories and subcategories and you have six different minimum rates that range 358 to 591 but the business you have 13 categories and sub-categories and for minimums ranging from 95 to 605 and then in farmland you 're currently got five categories and sub-categories with two minimums of 457 and 605 so as I said earlier in harmonizing or bringing these two braiding structures together categories and subcategories which I 'll show you in a moment but in doing that there 's going to be some anomalies when you start to look at the outputs of the the analysis of the new rating structure when when we compare the new rating structure in terms of rate to pay to the previous rating structure in terms of rates paid there is a significant anomaly here with business minimums at 95 you 'll see when we get to the graph that it goes off the Richter scale that certainly needs to come up a bit and as I mentioned earlier land values in them in the former Murray Shire a higher than Walker therefore there will be some movement of rate payer income between the two former councils so in terms of the rating structure options we take your we take councils 8000 sessemann and drop it into our rape our intake model the outputs are by former council area we 've streamlined the sub categories which I 'll show you in a minute but there are still three three major categories of business residential and farmland see are largely due to reducing the number of sub categories so this is what it looks like so we have residential with three sub categories not over in rural and the same with business of urban not owned and we 've got grain sheds and then farmland we 've got dry irritable and intensive and over here is where we 've allocated the former subcategories into the new sub category area so you can work out where you were and then where you fit into the revised sub category now so we 've got four options to work through so the first option is an ad valorem and minimum as the fixed amount we have no special rates we are using the same percentage your by category so what I mean by there is your turtle rates income is allocated to categories residential business and farm land so we have left the same him come in each of those categories as they were previously so before the simplified sub categories hasn 't talked about earlier the minimum for urban is 475 the minimum for non Auvergne is 468 and the grain sheds 620 and then fill up for the farmland all the minimums are 620 so what does this mean so what we got here is the output of option one looking at the former world Walker residential rates the key is going to look at here is the right-hand edge where it shows you the variation in percentage terms and that they are the lines the two lines are the gray line is the 2016 valuation where we 're comparing your your current rates 1922 the revised rated news rating structure that we 've got here and then the black line is the 2019 valuations comparing it to the rapes United in 20 rates so so for Walker residents under this option you can see at the front end is a slight increase in the minimum charges and then there 's a drop and then there 's there 's a increase now this drop is due to the anomalies from the seven subcategories that you previously had what how how we distribute or how we graph this is by percentile so there are ten percentile across here so percentile and do the comparison so there is a bit of variation in the walk all rating structure for minimums then for the former Murray Shire you can see here that with the introduction of the new categories subcategories and the minimums you can start to see that there 's a slight increase in most of the rates across that spectrum now for business formal walk or you can see here that there 's basically not too much of an increase at the front end there 's a bit of an increase in here mainly due to the 13 subcategories as you would have thought and then towards the back end it drops off and why it drops off it because the land values playing a greater role in the calculation of the rates and because we join Walker land the formal walk rule on the merrier together we 're now looking at the income across those and as a result some of that income now has moved to the form of Murray Council area so I show you this one and the reason for that the major reason for dollar minimum I will that 's move to 457 if I remember rightly so there 's a significant increase in the front end of this graph mainly because of that 95 but then when you come across here there are some increases 10% and again they go up in this 40th and 50th percentile mainly due to the vagaries of your as former 77 subcategories and then they drop down and pan out I think it around about 5% so that 's the minimums for the minimum options for business now to farmland so what we 're seeing here is that there is a decrease in the Walker or farm and rates and that 's simply because of the the proportion of land value when you bring the bring the terrain former rating structures together murray river is paying proportionally more in income because of their higher land values so that 's what it looks like with the minimums for walk cool and for the former Murray it looks like this so you can now see whether you know that increase has now come into the that deep crease that family an area and you can see that there 's some significant increases in that you know right across the spectrum the second option is and valorem and base amount so this is where we can collect up to 50% of the income for any category through a base amount by setting a base amount amount so what we 've said for this analysis is four bit for the business category we are getting we 're modeling forty five percent of the business income coming through the base amount residential forty five percent and family and 12.5% remember we 're using the same income yield that 's currently in place and oops and we 're using the same subcategories that that we identified but you can now see that the base amount for this different subcategories three eighteen for urban for thirty-three for non urban and 367 for rural and business five fourteen to 60 and 1803 54 and four forty so those amounts apply to every single rating assessment whereas in the minimums they only apply to those land values where you where when you multiply the land value than the minimum your charge the minimum otherwise you just solely use the the ad valorem all right in the dollar what the what the base amount does is it provides a more equitable system because more more the rate is a fixed rate everyone 's paying the same amount therefore the rate the dollar whatever lorem goes down so it has plays a lesser role or has a lesser impact on the calculation of rates so if we start yeah so if you look at more cool as as the formal world cool you can see here that the base amount even though there 's some reduction at the front end through the back end in the middle stages it starts to increase slightly you know again there 's some anomalies because of your sub categories but you know seven a half percent and five percent through here again that there 's some anomalies there so you know and then they 're going towards the back end because the the land value is higher it 's that the the rates start to move down and some of that moves the base amount option you can see here that again at the front end there 's a reduction but through the middle here there 's more of an increase in a more I guess a more even distribution when you look at the the bars as opposed to the lines and again the decrease of the back end is a combination of readjustment and the income that also people paying more through the base amount than they have in the past so that 's the base amount for residential now business the formal war cool significant reductions up front because there were higher minimums and lower base amounts so you would expect that and then through the middle here there 's you know a significant increase in the in these areas because they doused learning to pay there if I can put up there their share a more equitable share of the rights for these land values and then towards the end there 's a bit of a kick up because simply because there 's really high land values there in in the last little bit for Murray River sorry the front end this 95 so quite a number of rape rate payers will get an increase say if you adopt this model and that means more people are paying their fair share at the front end and again and this is what this gray graph is representing is that these guys are paying more of their share and towards the back end this far to come off because the front end people have picked up more of the income now for farmland under this model the workerle remember 15% going at the front end there is a slight increase you know two and a half percent and then as you move across it slowly decreases and no matter because of the size of the land value the amount of size of land value and farm land there 's still this redistribution of rate income between the former or current Murray councils and then from our EE what we 've got here is again at the front end there 's more people paying a bit more and then as you move across it 's it 's not anywhere near as those percentile so you know when I look at that again well that seems to be a fairer a fairer model for a fair approach for farmland for the former Mary so there are two key options the third option and the fourth option I 'm not going to spend a lot of time on and the reason for that is that what we 've done is simply moved three percent of the income from farmland to residential that represents about 300,000 and the reason we did that was because if you recall in the race benefit model and indicated the farmland were paying a little bit more than the benefits receive and residential you know we 're paying a little bit less basically it just means that the the graphs in three and four similar shapes to two and one and two except they 're slightly higher and slightly lower so as an example here is option 3 for ad valorem and base them out so you can see there if you recall that 's very similar to this one here so this is a walker or under option the shape there so that 's option two and for option three it 's just slightly increase so and again if you wanted to look at option three for Mary again it 's the same shape only that they 're increasing by three percent so if I just quickly do that and then you might not be following but the gist is that the shape is still the same so I 'm not planning to spend any more time options three and four mainly because you know it 's about just moving income between categories council may or may not choose to do that and that 'll be up to those guys so really that 's the three options and I understand now a council will be taking this presentation and sharing it with you guys out there in the community so thank you and good luck with your deliberations and considerations of your rates harmonization approach _"

people in public participation tonight uh mr granville taylor wyden 12.2 of the joint regional planning panel mark zizer is change of use and alterations and additions and also micro valentine in relation to 15.1 the question uh we 've noticed it 's on record regarding the squash in relation to the joint directional planning panel you have three minutes mr taylor and if you just push the button into new system when you speak you have to hold it up forward [Music] mystery [Music] i 'm here this evening to talk on item 12.2 which is a nomination as the community representative of the joint regional planning panel i 've already submitted a resume with a few comments and i won 't add a great deal to that other than perhaps some of the cuff comments and also so that the councils who don 't know me can possibly ask any questions excuse me so what i did describe was my initially my educational experience which i think is over something like eight years and that 's not necessarily reflected in use at the funding panel but it does actually give you an opportunity to research detailed topics and it does give an opportunity to adopt an even handed white can be looked at from several angles and then reach what i think is the best conclusion with other members of the panel and that was both i think developed in uh in my scientific experience and also in my universe experience in business administration and furthermore in my years my many years since stockbroker i 'll also comment specifically i think on some of the employment experience i 've had a lot of people may think a stock broker sits behind a desk waving arms around and looking at the screen with share prices moving that 's being a small part of the job it also means going out to factories to cotton farms to scientific operations all of which need in fact a very deep understanding floating a company which opens an ipo often requires anything up to six or eight months work in the field and literally that is as many of you all know i 've lived in industrial for 17 years we moved here in 2005. we 're following some of the younger people at that stage to retire to las vegas and we of you who visited skelter house that was our main reason for coming here and it 's been actually very useful to use that particular property for things such as garden parties and meetings and things like the hunter woodworkers where i became the apprentice it was probably the oldest adventist ever however i have also had some very useful experience in the community in particular starting in 2013 which was a group called machine which was the lobby the new south wales government for what we hope would be a new hospital in the event so we 've got a uh that you almost got a uh a fully refurbished model hospital for those of you seeing the work to date is extremely good and courtesy of the new member in the upper hunter david that would be finished in about three years that was a very satisfying piece of work and a very constructive committee which included two people a little later named citizen of the year generation and the great thing is the fact that groups like that can do wonders for the community as did both government who are very very cooperative so those are the the words i wish to end tonight but i 'm willing to answer any questions thank you very much for that mr taylor does anyone have any questions in relation to 12.2 uh for mr taylor the jrp name thank you very much for your time and uh appreciate you coming along and giving us a picture you 're very very good at that thank you thank you i now ask uh mark zizer in relation to tennessee uh 12 overview street and mark mcsamus ready i 've been there for 27 years we acquired the property next door which is formerly john scott 's garage we bought the condition that you possibly was contaminated um since then we put an application to turn into a licensed food premises must state that the main street denver now uh towns has done a very good job into a one-way visitation we 're getting a lot of praise from tourists and locals um for the work that 's being done um what i what we what i 'm trying to do my food outlet is a success that 's been successful in the pub and we want to emulate that to a certain degree next door a little bit ahead with with council conditions um we had a problem with um delivery service and such off-street parking off street parking contaminated site and the police puts in some injection objections to the license plan has been there 's 28 hosted premises and we 've had one or two little incidents of the public for 27 years so um but as i understand now i told hey earlier on the police are happy with the modifications we made to the drawings we have luckily we are next door we 've kind of do a boundary adjustment which will allow off-street parking off-street deliveries for four services but we come to headwind with the parking now i 'm putting up for an argument that since the car parking has been increased at the rear of the main street and all people have contributed all taxonomy council great payers have contributed to that car park i feel that i have and i do own a warrant to use our car park for our facilities and that car park has been built for a reason to um it 's been extended to increase trade to the main street and it is not being utilized to 100 and especially the fact that when we will be operating tonight time you could um actually front down australian but too many cars in and definitely the rear car park is usually empty so we 've got alternating use for an alternative hours it 's been brought up to my attention that possibly the council would consider a contribution to council for parking but that goes back to the fact that i believe that we 've already contributed to it and we 're going to utilize the car second thing is the contamination report now i 'm more than willing and happy to do a contamination report on the site because looking at quotes between 20 25 000 to do such a thing i 've asked the town planners to put out the condition of approval of forward progress but i 'm really improving so the only thing i 'm approval rather than a part of the application process so if you and i 've spent a ten year two weeks ago she she gave the indication that they were flexible on that now so the early correspondence was no it was part of the condition of application and she said since then the council would consider looking at in another light that 's where we stand and and just to finish off the um it 's important that we get a lot more theories and reasons to come to main street in denver um we have back at the hotel offering free caravan parking overnight such as a huge success and it does benefit everyone in main street they have more more places to visit to spend the day event and then so that 's why okay thank you for that mr zizer anyone have any questions in relation to 10.2 before us councillor do you realize that um what we 're asking for in regard to parking is only for the additional addition on the building not the existing one that used to be scott 's garage and to provide in the parking based on the additional square footage only um well the site doesn 't the site doesn 't really allow we have made allowances different initial screen measures at the front that the vacant building was going to be all the goaler and seating branches we 've halved that now to give access to a truck um and and the truck would hit a dead end because it 's an offshore block and now we proceed to extend widen the block with using luckily mounted properly next door to give that extended room so you can get a like a flop done pantech or something down there so there 's no parking facilities inside um so if you want to use like girards for an example they we 're going to pick up the whole unfortunate character 's restaurants a few dollars up the very top restaurant just close them they to use an example they never had a parking issue problem at nighttime um i 'm sure a lot of councils here and it was even really an issue and that was prior to the by council has therefore reasons need to be used for people using the facilities in the mainstream so if you go back to a site like darwin goes to sarah hillsborough years ago yes contribution council was important for parking and that was the contribution of ethereum behind contribution council was one day they may build a car park and they will house with the funds they collect from all the community they will have the funds together with this car park them and have a basketball council done the other way around we 've agreed to a rate rise to kill the car park and that 's what that 's the only one i 'm saying for that if the no figure has been put forward turning to for a contribution council um i would possibly have to consider it if we couldn 't come up to it with a an arrangement tonight um i don 't want to bury this this this application i think it 's worthwhile um but at the same time if it becomes too expensive um a place will become a storage room or don 't think that 's the direction council undertaker it 's a beautiful building we 've we 're going to create we 'll put a uh paris report in that 's the locals there 's a favorable uh reply from the encounter from locals on facebook so people in town do you want to see up and it 's just a facility for them the thing is you know build it now will come the more the demon creates coffee shops and food outlets the more attention we 're going to get the better off we 're going to go for developments here on the street you know someone 's going to want to move in when people want to move here the price will say goes up and therefore develops become a feasible contribution to the area so if you get the main street right people will want to come and visit yeah mark you um indicated there that you would be willing to sit down with council and discuss a contribution towards parking i 'm sure you 've read the report which says that they have reached out um so would you be in favor if the if the item was deferred to the next council meeting to allow those discussions to take place okay well additionally i would like the approval without the contribution account that 's why i 've come to the meeting tonight to play my case on that i would have to after that consider the proposal paying and paying a fee but um does everyone even watching onto the money um and not do such thing i just think i 've got a good enough argument for you guys to discuss to realize that one that 's a good thing we 're doing two we 're operating different hours to where the car park that was built for this purpose is not being used and you know just use that sort of basic information to conclude that know we can we can use this facility without a contribution to deal with the question how would you respond to the thoughts that there 'd be an equity issue with you not contributing to car park and not providing additional car parks and that equity their rates well it 's only come about and council too this is a typical normal thing for council do as soon as someone does a change of use i think he also come up with a this you know with with regulations we went with it with a main street with the entrances to the shops of china shopping main street pizza shop and they were you know we had an issue because we changed the use but to provide wheelchairs these things have always hit these hurdles dealing with cancer because it 's an opportunity to bring forward new legislation to make an old building try to conform to new practices these things these these things are buried projects because they become unfeasible to do it now if we 're going to looking at 30 40 000 contribution council i 'm going to pluck out here we 're going to look at 30 40 000 worth of regeneration of soil it becomes too hard for a person like me to develop a site like that so the council has to look in two ways do they want it they going to look so far ahead that nothing gets done thank you no further questions okay thank you i now ask for mark valentine on 15.1 question with notice today council balance valentine there 's no question from the board this is a question yeah thank you mr man and um councillors i didn 't think i 'd be back speaking at council again but anyway um thank you for watching i just wanted to bring and raise the council 's attention i know and this is in relation to um the musk book squash club and the fact that it 's been much much quite club of being a part of the community for over 60 years very successful club over that period with all volunteer members and building successful competitions and except for the last 10 years and in all of that time we 've had to um i suppose build a club based on private ownership of buildings and squash courts it 's been a very difficult process been very difficult at times to work with various private owners um it 's really in relation to the future of squashy basketball i 'm not just talking about the future of the musclebook squash club i believe it 's the future of the squash impossible being a successful club at being a successful organisation we have volunteers that are out there promoting it through schools assisting community organisations and actually trying to build up a sport in town like every other sport is here when um unfortunately the courts that gary harris owned were closed that 's ten years ago now super cheap i spoke squash cup had nowhere to go so we then went to the um german courts and thank you for counseling likes to be there but and successfully run competitions at denman but obviously it 's very difficult to run competitions in dental and denman for muscle residents a lot of people don 't want to travel so the competition obviously numbers dwindled down to the point where we still have a good base of numbers but and part of that process was actually getting a 3 300 000 dollar grant or at least money put aside from council towards this project now was involved except for squash club and we had lots of discussions to and from with council council staff since that time um suggesters were brought forward to us that we actually look at the golf club renovations that were going on at the time and we agreed to be part of that process other government funds towards a project in the meantime what happened was the rsl then obviously took over the golf club and became owners and we went into the gulf of the rsl club and also down sent to them with the builders that were part of the young not just with the builders but also the advisors of squash and helping them secure what the project if you like and being part of it all the way it 's only just been recently that we 've now been informed by the rsl that we 're as the squash club we 're no longer welcome to be at that club our members are allowed to be there as citizens but our club is now has no home and so since we 've had 10 years of to be left on zone we have a great fear that it 's not just the courts but it 's the actual club itself and also the squash industrial because the aerosol and golf club have no expertise they might have one or two members but they don 't actually have the bulk of gosh playing members and especially all the long-term members thus so do they have the motivation to keep squash alive and going in town when really their main business is the rsl and or the golf club where we believe that those funds that were actually put aside for us no questions yeah is it okay if i just ask one thing um just to council we 'd just like to meet with council at some time to see what we can do to actually help progress squash in the sock in the shower we still need to speak with our members who don 't know all of these details yet about further action that we might want to take and regardless but we do see that we can actually meet with council and council staff all progress organize that through the chat manager and staff thank you josh okay no further public participation we are now

concept designed for denver to sandy hollow water pipeline officer 's recommendations vane taylor 's council approves the transfer 300 000 funding from the water fund reserve to expenditure legend number fifty ten point welcome redundant to enable tenders to be invited for the development of a concept designed for the denman to sandy high water pipeline project by someone and this has been a

woodruff i 'd also like to speak for the motion mr mayor um again it 's through the hard work of our staff that has um lobbied for this money it 's twofold um it just turns out that sandy hollow actually happens to be the second recipient the initial funding is um to progress the abattoir plan for yarrawov i think it 's a win not only for council but the establishment of if you 're not aware sandy hollow 's never had potable water as such early on in the council term we did previous councillor berkel divined a spot down on the golden river to allow us to have water for the township in its first place because originally it was only through the the grace of rosemont estate that allowed the township to get some water and that would only really happen when we were irrigating our vines in the sandy hollow vineyards there and once we got an overflow that 's the only time sandy hollow would get a semi-permanent supply of order so council back in the day recognised along with the community in sandy hollow that that was lacking although the quality award has never been good um council over the years has tried its best to reduce the hardness but um this now mr mayor is very fortunate for everyone in the community in san diego and also with the prospect of jobs to come if they have talked us in very concerned cancer not gareth yeah well said counselor i think we all speak

two council endorses the future funded long-term financial plan does someone wish to move upon that motion counselor neon councillor maharjun do you have anyone to speak against councillor yeah i think the report speaks for itself and um i would together um i think it um it clear clearly highlights the um council 's financial position and the best way to move forward if we go to the future council martial do you restart anything counsellor yeah thanks mr mayor um i do appreciate the report i just don 't tend to agree with it i think that um the future fund is exactly that um i suppose it 'll all depend on where council goes with the uhedc i think the two are closely linked i think both of those things were born by council with a look to the future of our communities how they could be sustained and how we could best play in that way excellent yeah we should speak uh against the motion as well in essence in essence it ceases to become a future pump it doesn 't have money allocated three million dollars is coming away from it pays dividends it ceases to become a future fund in fact the whole idea of it my understanding whole idea of the future fun was to uh obviously make investments as it has and pay that that debt uh up one while interest rates below we 've never seen them lower at the moment and two while we have uh the mining rates um as we 're all aware mining rates mining rates in this uh in this council make up some uh 70 percent of our total rate of income uh with obviously 30 percent left from residence rates uh when mining rates go and they will go whether it be five years ten years whatever it might be when they go it appears to be that 's what we 're leaving you know all the debt now and what we 're doing is putting back and and effectively it might be what it is we 're saying we 'll work for you down the track with someone else down the track and i don 't i certainly don 't agree with that um so i i i oppose them i oppose the motion it would mean without that mind mining rateable income effectively what it will mean if we do lose that or even part of it but what we would do what happen is residents in this shower their residential rates would have to triple to continue to provide the same service level as we as we provide now um and frankly i 'm not prepared to move that one uh [Music] also also against the nation i believe that the future fund should be just that future fund and as um council woodruff and councillor draken slaven look i don 't disagree with uh councillor drayton um it 's just uh it 's just to me uh a timing thing and at this point in time um we have a lot of demand on our funds and as we saw the presentation that discretionary spending is around about five percent so it 's almost non-existent we have uh communities community survey which is putting a lot of pressure on us to um to service the community better and as we 're told as we can read in the local government act we have to make financial decisions being mindful of the community 's expectations and community priorities so the priorities are there i think we should listen to the community and that 's suggested doesn 't mean it 's going to be there forever it 's uh it can be if you have financial position improves uh two or three years time um sure we can revert back to a a position of higher investments thank you councilman neil um i can 't_''_3174.8 say the screen i apologize to councillors he fund the recommendation in the offices report sorry councilman you can 't believe the council house was the second done gus 's head right yeah that 's it sorry the council endorses the revised future fund policy was moved by councillor mcneil seconded by council mccarthy at the heart of an output to a vote if those in favor

representatives council elective sports and recreation committee consists of councillor barry council of bowditch council mcneil and councillors skulls let 's check that they 're up to date with all that yes we 're good to go now put that forward that 's the recommendation of motion all those in favor sorry someone to move that motion council douglas find um that that the musclebook squash club supported that application the grant application impact both the green applications on the premise that they could come and run there they could come and run the muscle squash club out of the new squash courts now of course if you read the chris augusto letter back in 2016 where he talked where they talk about the club where they talk about the club being forced to move it 's competition to them we know the reasons why it 's a valentine told us that and nearly all the members played in more competitions that were run by the club they 'd expect to do so so it was quite made quite clear from the support the squash club were giving the golf club at the time this was eleven obviously in support of a of agreeing that the squash club had full expectation that they would be able to run their competition from there um as they continue to do today and i haven 't seen any correspondence yet that says any different to that it says that they they can 't or they shouldn 't run their uh run their competitions from there as i say it is quite disappointing uh the outcome and hopefully we will get some more uh some more documents in the next couple of weeks and those early documents i think are uh certainly wouldn 't have certainly or the rsl and wouldn 't know about because they pre-dated the rxl or haven 't_''_3703.599 that having anything to do with with the muscle group golf club so uh if that 's the case i certainly would like uh the council to continue to work with the mustard squash club obviously to enable the swashbuckler to run there to run their own competition well to run the musclebook squash by the competition while the rugby league club runs their competition the rubber uni club and the golf club and everyone else run their competitions muscle squash clubs should be able to do the same so i 'd like council to continue to work with that with the muscle squash tub and if that means working with the squash club to enable them whether we uh where the councils in some way can assist uh with the squash torts in denman or certainly in transport seems to be one the issues but the council might be able to assist in some way but certainly i 'd like to see council continue to work with can to make sure the community has the best outcome after all yeah there is some 465 000 i think of uh of both rate payers and taxpayers money that went into those squash clubs i say on the premise that uh an 80 or year old club should be able to continue to uh to do what they 've been doing for 80 years yeah thank you councillor drayton and i thought we ended up i have been working myself with both the sports club and with the rsl club intend to continue to do so this should be we do need to find the documents that predate when you 're speaking about to see whether there is any commitment there but at present what we can do is work with the best interests of the community as you said and hopefully come to a resolution that can be worked with all parties with council members spokesperson at the time and i 'd have to acknowledge that the musclebook squash club i uh played a really big part in securing that securing that green funding from council so you there 's there 's a letter in here um that 's which is actually uh to the muslim squash club um court proposal and it does stay on there the musclebook squash club muscle rsl and muscle um golf club so there is support there to say that the muscle of twitch combation had a lot to do with that brand all those grants i don 't think anyone is going to dispute that from anybody or any angle with squash club did a great job in securing funds for squash facilities in this child but i just have to commit that that 's a note for those items in relation to the information we noted we have someone to move on and we do have a commitment just before i sorry just before i do have done i 'll now commit that as emotional as a _"

    "text": "hello my name is fiona plissman and i 'm the general manager of muscle brook shire council and i 'm steve reynolds the mayor of musbox council and last night we had our first ordinary council meeting on the 1st of february 2022 it was a fantastic meeting and a lot of decisions made and this is our first video uh for the muslik shy council to take through the community with what our decisions are after every meeting we 'll be doing this every day after the council meetings so moving forward informing the community that 's good i think it 's a good a good opportunity to let people know about some of the decisions one of the decisions that council has made last night was to remove the level one water restrictions fantastic opportunity i think to fall in line with our neighbouring upper hunter and single and shire councils when it went into place in 2019 yeah well in 2019 the water restrictions were brought in because the glenbard dan at that stage was at about 39 and now it 's about 78 so you know we do hope that the community will still be exercise a bit of water conservation waterwise yeah i think look it isn 't we 've had a great rainfall in this period and see the dam of what it is at the moment at 75 that 's fantastic but just to exercise still common sense when it comes to water usage the other decision that was made last night was uh thomas mitchell drive intersection the council has refused the application and given it back to staff to take forward basically around safety and measures that we had concerns about fiona yes um the uh the report that came up on thomas mitchell drivers was a major intersection for council from thomas mitchell drive on to denman road council has decided to refuse the section 138 permit so that they want some further safety features included in that intersection and and staff will be following up with that and having discussions with transport for new south wales it is a busy intersection and the safety of people that use that road uh is vital and uh look i commend the the safety for all road users and pedestrians of our community so and one of the other decisions was um bringing a new new business into the area um it was council endorsed entering into a planning agreement with a new um waste transfer station at glen monroe drive in the nozzle brook industrial estate and new businesses are always welcome they 're really looking forward to that so it 's fantastic news you know it 's great outcome for our community and well done to council staff and those involved thanks and the uh joint regional planning panel all councils have to elect councillors to sit on a joint regional planning panel yeah we have two councillors that are nominated from our council and now it 's council skulls and councillor amanda barry in her first term so it 's really great to have that mixture of experience with the fresh values and the fresh faces that the community wanted to have so to go on that pedal i really commend them both putting their hands up and there 's expressions of interest out there at the moment for panel so check out our website it will be on there and we 'll be advertising yeah we 're looking for a community member to join the joint regional planning panel and further information will be available on council 's website but i think that pretty all wraps up for our run the achievements from last night it does and moving forward uh it 's just regarding the questions we 've noticed um from the councillors it 's just going to be more communication about how to go through with your works requests and more communication from council as to what we 're delivering and what we 're doing we want people involved from the inclusion of these things and not sitting on the sidelines so thanks very much thank you _"

'll just send my buyer to council scholars all those favor 14.2 i 'll move to defer this motion until the next meeting of council uh councillor neil obviously so we moved to the next meeting uh being that one question would cover someone 's second that motion uh 50 questions with nose 15.1 fencing for muscle skate park motion uh sorry okay yes mr mayor um while we 'll see many vehicles are actually blocking up and passing through into the end of the roundabout right opposite where you come out of coals you have the kids skate park and they there 's a lot of things people say you know anyone could be t-boned there they can have a medical episode and if they hit the accelerator they can go up over the footpath up through the fence there 's only a pill fence they 're stopping that car going on to the skate park where we 've oh it 's a what if the school in sydney two years ago was a what if um seven kids injured two died we got the child care center again it was in sydney not musselburgh but no bollards there were bottles in the front of a school entry near the car park they deferred it a cow a car had a um episode and went through so i move that we take this as a priority for our safety of our community as our kids you 're just suggesting that the lights be put along there i 'm suggesting that the bollards be put along there to protect the kids from an event that may and possibly would happen in time as a priority to protect our community so council knows the information containing the report and requests that the grant funding opportunities are saw in relation to the provision of the safety barrier with fencing at the section of brotherhood adjacent to muscle skatepark and we 'll consider the project for inclusion in the 2022-23 capital west program yes okay so if it 's a question with notice motion off a camera off a question so the question is being asked i 've just asked the general manager for clarification um thank you for your question with notice council about itch the reply that 's provided and provided there for councillors is that council currently has not budgeted for the installation of the safety barrier bollards or fencing in the section of rutherford road adjacent to the skate park and provides three options that are open to council for these projects there are three options provided there and including the consideration of this project for inclusion in the 2022-23 capital works program i recommend that this be considered when councillors are looking at their priorities for the 2223 capital works program what council would you try to ask is the promotion as attached to a question of notice i don 't think you can have a motion attached to a question with notice so there 's an answer that 's provided and a recommendation sorry so you 're happy to move on that you shouldn 't have the word motion there so hold up i think one of really important and i understand that these things can happen but i think the biggest issue we have currently in that area is the kids actually climbing events and running across the road two coals scooting across the road on their scooters going across the road on their bikes that small to me i sense a bigger danger to our community um i don 't know about anyone so i can 't tell you how many times i 've had human race for the kids rushing across there and the people from colts have said the same thing so i think we 're going to be looking at it then we look at it as structurally being something that is going to make a difference is the way to go or or do we have an opportunity to re-look at this and think about what 's um going to be more suitable because we don 't want to be risking the kids jumping those fences and jumping them out as well so i think it is an issue and i think potentially the 22 23 capital weeks program is too the whole thing from the whole safety okay so risk assessment the whole thing as a risk assessment because even within that you 've got a fencing or follow-up you 've jumped to a solution without truly identifying possibly the risks and that you 've really got to look at the risks identify the risks and then develop answers for those for those things but again as i said i still think referring to the 22 23 capital works program i think we should be uh councillors asking council officers to investigate other sources of money where any works that they decide for that discussion can happen as soon as possible last council council staff for a report on that as soon as possible so um we 'll add that to that item uh councillor yeah i 'm happy for it yeah i i don 't want to see it just parked i think they 're not even done so if that report can come back to the next council meeting as soon as it comes as i say again it 's the kids safety that our children 's safety reports council bear or barry um i just want to commend the australia day function that was put on with all the staff involved it was a really good day really well organized not the easiest of situations um considering hovered but it was really really well set up and i really enjoyed the day out so congratulations to all the staff that were involved in organising arranging that for today thank you any other council reports i just want to add to that too i want to congratulate the council staff inclusion that was involved in on the day of our culture and they 've brought back to uh you know that we are partnered we are all here together and that 's really shown so i want to thank the staff for that and also i want to thank the staff for the response on some emails on some works that needed living around town the council staff fantastic responding to those works as well and getting them done you know they need to be thanked any questions for the next meeting item number 25 it 's just works requests well we used to we used to have a dedicated line and then you know just the process i suppose are we commonly in the gm and derek at the moment but we used to have a call-in or email a works request and then we had a process for everybody 's benefit there should be a process that we can put a works request in there is um the website which we have been using as councillors there is also that hub facility that we can use but accounts will provide a report we are working on at the moment and some hand out information from the community members and how to go about doing that as well directly so as well so we used to have a phone line and councillors had an alternative you could lodge your works request and went through a process where first off you 'd be responding to to let you know that somebody got hold of it and then there was a timely response on what the outcome was going to be so you would go back if we have go through the channels but as i say that phone line no longer exists and we don 't have the works request form as part of the council web anymore to add to that as well so you know like we 've been discussing making it easy that should be um the community shouldn 't have to approach one of us all the time about getting you know a pothole fixed or curving or any of those things i i just feel that the community should know how they can quickly take a photo on their phone and upload it to something and get a response themselves as well without us having to be the middle man all the time i 've been inundated with messages from the community about roads footpaths different things like that i just think if we have a system and we promote it professionally and properly to the community how they can shortcut that take that photo upload it themselves and get a response there is the currently is a system that 's just the education process that we need to go to but council just um um make a commitment that we 'll provide that information before the next council meeting we can be sending you um some detailed information about how to direct those uh inquiries that come directly to yourself so that you can send them on so that they can find a a quick very exciting one just with counselors when you when you 're replying to an email that 's been sent out over by the staff can we not reply all unless it 's relevant that you reply all because if i haven 't read that particular particular thing and you reply all it goes all the way down the money system and if you happen to actually open it on your phone and not on your computer you lose the attachment that 's uh yeah that 's the question it 's really interesting it is if you don 't have to reply all because there are um one last question i asked a question earlier about how is council going with a with a map development that we can supply to the community um with upcoming works with know if it 's still something that can be still floating around and moving forward and getting that happening i think we discussed that at the council 's strategic planning weekend and we are making you know take a notice out of question um it 's a two-pronged question in the app and in relation to better social media as i was saying to terms of relaying the message yeah so we 've got the council 's got the website up which is really great a lot of people have been using it reading it but a lot of the same posts is the comment coming up with the same posters there but if we can start putting on there at the beginning of the week works program for the week um that 'll give people an insight that you know council is actually planning moving forward we are doing what 's for our roads and gardens and stuff yes any other questions for next meeting yes can i have another one of them to at the next on how many trainees that we have or looking at putting on intake if so no thanks everyone thank you the members of the public who have come along _"

libertas yes [Music] [Music] 11.7 mengele of waibon post office road um my employer undertakes work for the applicant so i won 't be taking the part um public participation will be left limited to three minutes because of the numbers if you would like to stand around and uh answer any questions we would like that to happen as well so first off we have the first uh public detail participation will be in relation to the closure of why monster publish road which is the uh report on the mangular extension section 138 report we 've got keith campbell margo white michael white neil and rosary who are speaking in opposition to the report 11.7 particularly in relation to the closure of writing we 're just waiting for the participants to come into the chamber um you 've got three minutes and uh if you 'd like to wait around afterwards some examples of questions yes no worries thank you for the chance to talk and i strongly object to the the rain closure because there is a hub of three in there that need urgent medical treatment for their heart bones from time that road exposed we wait another 30 minutes for it to drive around and come back down ridgelands road get to us and i think that 's health can 't_''_2158.8 be called goal i 'm afraid and also if they want to work on that on the area that they 're not and they want to with them right there 's nothing wrong with a stop and going on their road so that the public gets straight through at all times now they cannot be shut off until such time so there 's an alternate route into the wildland area whether that be their road or the council vote i don 't care so long as there 's another access in to that area because we do not need 30 minutes of waiting for medical treatment to turn up because the right the the oven right across the blue cup that 's available i 've got to sign the subject at this point getting down for some questions yeah okay um mrs kendall how many times has the production been cut so the last six months in the last six only reason why the council no no nothing about that is because the signs close the road off they 're still sitting there from the first closure in march they 're sitting on the side of the road growing over with grass the bloke coming up scratch the road probably shifted him so he could splash up the road but they 're still sitting there six months after the last foot or not the first one last one last one was about the fortnite it was 12th of june when the first one come here in june the first of the three but there was two in march and i was uh addressed at the purposely meeting one day about the manager of the project he 'd come here after the club and said stood the causeway and looked at it and he said we could solve this problem by putting the two and a half weeks in i said you better come out and i 'll give you a history lesson though because that has been up to the corner where you 've been to go down under the spent a week cleaning it up so the closure of the road is a long period at the moment we haven 't had major clutch we 've only had short pressure go through but we 're in line for a major play again i 've lived there for 40 years so this video shows what goes on just a question mr campbell thanks for the public participation um i didn 't establish to start off with we 're about to see you in relation to the post office road um you 'd know more than anyone then we 've had um information come through from traffic counter than eight vehicles approximately a day the problem with post office well yeah because it 's quite busy at times there are days and especially when the school 's wrong that yeah they might only be they don 't care that they go up but when the school holiday is wrong it 's quite busy it 's like that 's true and the consultation what consultation you had from the girl and having me oh all right anyone thank you mr campbell thank and councillors thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight i 'm margo white and i 'm a white on resident which is somewhat of an endangered species these days we don 't get much out of waibong but we do contribute quite a bit through the richmond 's cold exploration license we contributed five million dollars to this community we got a little upgrade on apple rest at that point elsewhere in the community we don 't take much we get no garbage collection no water or no storage but we do pay away and we are still here we accept that mandula coal 's continued operation project has its approval to proceed it 's not what we wanted but we now have to try and live with it and it 's many negative impacts we 're trying the best we can we understand the total road will not continue to exist as it is today however we do not want to lose continuous access for large vehicles school buses or when it comes and the crossing is flooded whatever option is settled upon under the independent planning commission without extensive consultation with the community and today there has been no consultation with the community and nor it appears with counselors the supplementary business report only appeared on the council 's website after 2 pm yesterday so really we 're asking for a defendant we think we 've been denied procedural fairness we simply have not had time to properly look or get any advice on the stuff of every business report any final decisions must be made after consultation with the community and by council resolution not delegation to the gm recognising that the mind effective growth network plan adopted by council in 2020 prefers the optimist my understanding is that this plan is not booked by the state government so there should be no legal barriers to other options becoming the outcome we the community do not want to have post office road clothes before an alternate is built we are only asking what those who use edit and wrote forgiven continuous access money being paid now and set aside for purchase of lands or work on roads somewhere sometime is not what the community wants council as a community by clothing one bomb road temporarily adding 20 minutes to our federal time to the law now you are contemplating doing the same by doing the beginning of manual call and closing post office road with the promise of some time in the future giving us back the access post office road provides us with today thank you for your time thank you michael thank you thank you thanks councillors would you like to find your own investment yeah if you had a choice or uh in your opinion the residents had a choice between an upgraded yarman road crossing over white long bridge if there was a if that accompanied that delay and i mean it would be six months to a month or an alternative route on post office road what do you think would be the preferred option i think actually the community are rather agnostic about which which one it is we just want continuous access so you know a delay for maybe six months if that 's the bridge that doesn 't give us continuous access um because the bridge with post manual of mine and not the community but we want continuous access that that 's what we want and and i really think it 's been important to other people in the editing road example is one you know why did we have to suffer and and i mean i find it sorry yeah yeah thank you finish it off but yes there 's a delay we 'll get used to it and it 'll become the norm to you know take the 35 extra kilometers to go south or west yeah it 's not good thank you thank you [Music] participants speak from um they 're not actually not visible for us at home all right thank you but we need to see yeah i mean i don 't wish to make a huge deal about it but obviously um if they 're making an appeal um reading their body language and seeing them as a person does make a difference mayor councillors thank you for the opportunity to address you this living uh michael white 's my name i 'm a resident who lives on yemen road we now um we 've we 've tried to live with the impacts of the mangula current line and there are times where that impacts significant um we were not keen on the mangular ex continuation project and raised what we felt were quite significant objections but at the end of the day uh the decision was my the project go ahead and we 've basically got to accept that we also understand that as part of the mangrove project that a portion of the post office right will need to be closed off as part of the mine project area and we also accept that so that 's i 'm not here trying to do anything that obstructs the mangula project but i 'm here as a resident and as you have heard from two of the other residents here who have spoken we we 've already been significantly impacted out there in the community and i noted in some of the council submissions during the uh eisn project submissions both to the ipc and to the department of planning the concerns around the community form part of council submissions significant upgrade at community hall out there and now we are contemplating in the proposal before you who actually close access off and make it significantly harder to get to that community centre when the creek is up now you will have heard that that that happens from time to time and this year we 've had a number of events i thought the number was four key flips closer than me five um but it 's not only when the creek is up but it is also the flood uh debris that is left along the road there you can see that that road the access may be cut for a number of days until that 's cleared away so um yes if the creek wasn 't flooded at any stage we 'd go around german road my significant concern is that that can happen at unpredictable times you would also i hope all as counselors have received a letter from our senior deputy at our uh rfs i 'm a deputy at the rfs as well and we 're also concerned that this will be another hampering of decided upon constructed and open prior to the closure of the road now we 're not here asking for the m1 we are simply asking for our access to being maintained or if it 's a little bit enhanced terrific but we just want to have confidence that we 're able to have that access both for the community activities at times for emergency school bus um you know that is a bus route we already struggle to entice people to come to the whiteboard area making it harder for people to get your kids to school is not going to be a plus now we 're told that the community enhancement program which is what we were told by the independent planning commission and mangula is going to address all our concerns out there and fix all our social issues well if this is the first second community enhancement program it 's a retrogame step um i noted in your document that it said that mangula after the prior advisory mandrel would be responsible for this for extensive i 'll wrap up you know extensive consultation um with the 's a little bit like told being told we 're going to be euthanized euthanized and where would we like the needle to be stuck you know this is about this is not about the closure of post-op australia it 's about ensuring that we have continued or improved access and so i would ask you please counsellors to take serious note of our concerns we are not asking for the world we are just asking for respect and being cared for thank you very much that 's what it 's doing just in relation to that and going back to what pete said are you saying that the richlands road actually goes underwater more times on that side of the on the outside the arrowman road where the creek is the under lake obviously does but the road actually goes down underwater further no what i was saying was that the crossing i was talking about across um there are other couple of those points but any interruption there or on ridgelands road um is is very transitory it might be an hour or two thank you as well is neil and rose through thomas all right so the next one is actually from montula nick slater is currently online and uh he is also accompanied by brian p they 're both from mangula line okay so it 's similar and okay thank you mr mayor i 'll just um i 'll get straight to it so consultation with the council regarding the mcca project 's been ongoing since june 2017 and mangal has been granted the new approval for the state significant development 8642 on the 26th of april there 's currently still three matters relating to the project that are outstanding and relevant to this meeting uh however we 're really here to discuss two of them the finalization of the deed of arrangement between councillor mangula largely pertaining to the closure of weibong post office road and construction of the hull road over bridge over wabong road and finalization of the terms regarding construction interactions associated with mangoes application under section 138 of the roads act and the other one is the voluntary planning agreement which is not up for discussion today so since the approval matters to enable construction to commence and therefore maintain operational continuity at the site so we 're grateful for this cooperation as maintaining morning continuity is important to the success of mangoes business and the and the people that work there our workforce approximately 400 people uh 80 live in the upper 151 living within the musselbrook lga with over 140 suppliers and contract firms that we actively engage every day and i guess important to note is that the broader community that 's noteworthy that 85 of the 860 submissions received by the ipc were in support of the project over the past three months mangular and council representatives have constructively engaged in the development of the deed of arrangement to detail mengele 's interactions with councils roads and obtaining approval under the roads act so mangular expects the deed will detail amongst other things the arrangements for the closure of waibong post office road both temporarily under the section 138 of the roads act and legally in accordance with part four of the roads act so the closure of the portion of waibong post office road is required enable completion of the construction activities associated with the pro project and therefore ensuring the continuity so mango is mine plan um currently the current existing operation has two morning areas that are working their way around the envelope set area so these areas merge into one as works continue and the morning area becomes constrained over time with the reduction in the morning area resulting in the need to commence operations in the new mining area north of waibang road to maintain continuity so in effect we 've got to split the mining fleet in half otherwise the mining footprint becomes too intense to maintain the full fleet uh as we sit now so when the eis was lodged in 2019 mangula 's life of mine plan required access to the new mining area in november 22 for mining purposes and at this time an estimated 16-month construction period will be required at the commencement of construction sorry i missed that road did you start is really about uh getting this deed of arrangement done so that we can start the construction works given the limited footprint of wildlife 't start construction of these operations in september it might mean that we have to start parking up some of our morning fleet uh in early 2023 if we can 't_''_3420.88 be mining across the road at that point in time so okay thank you councils have any questions mr white mentioned the possibility of being completely cuddled by our um it 's the road that joins uh brings on the road would you like to comment on that uh well my understanding is ridgeland 's road remains that open in in the high water events so the access is still open by ridgeland 's road i 've been in the in these in the situation the rain rain event where the road gets treated flooding uh that would be yeriman road yeah the creek crossing there yeah just possibly could be done um on cut access to whiteboard road so that there could be residents that could be completely isolated oh yes so when that access is cut yeah at uh at the creek crossing there in yerman the only access is will be via ridgelands road yes yes 'm not sure i understand the question mr reynolds i think um when post office road is closed access must be via yarraman road and vigilance road now those two roads have crossings or causeways which could cause the rain to be closed no rips of throat now literally that does it doesn 't well it has a waterway yeah it can do it so i 'm just trying to outline the concerns of the residents not only to be inconvenienced but in a first response situation um being majorly disadvantaged the other question i have is regarding the urgency you mentioned the 30th of september there 's a deadline for the runs for the month created yes that 's correct [Music] so there 's there 's a number of construction activities that need to take place and and the main ones being the overpass bridge that needs to be started construction overwhelm on post office road so that also that allows a conversion road that will be used to access traffic on ybon post office road while we do the construction works of the bridge so there 's an quite a quite a bit involved and there 's also a couple of other major works happening at the same time which is relocation of 11 kv power line and diversion drain systems that will run around the mining footprint that are also required during that period so the consequence of those not meeting that deadline would be parker so what will happen is if we push if we push that construction time frame out uh it 's likely so we 're due to start mining over in the other side of the road in january 23. if we push that construction time frame out then the mining footprint in the existing operation starts getting increasingly intense for the mining operations so it 's most likely most probable that will no longer be able to run the full fleet of gear in that operation we 'll have to park up at least one existing fleet which is probably somewhere in the vicinity of about 30 to 35 or 40 people so a 916 excavator and six trucks and a few dozers given all this what would you put down to with the residents uh i guess our our submission in terms of the project outlined two different proposals one was the um the relocation of weibong post office road uh as well as if that was not the preferred option of council and they were going to adopt the mines affected growth strategy that we would contribute to that strategy so the eis and uh and and our project was approved based on the fact that uh either of those options could be adopted by council councils since adopted the yarraman road and the mines affected road strategy so that 's the strategy that we 've been working towards to get the deed with council approved on thanksgiving thank you good morning just in relation to the timeline in closing post office road in relation to the works that report what are you looking at in that time frame exactly um well in effect we 'd like to close it as soon as the date is agreed so that 's as early as in september and that 's been in negotiation with council in relation to construction activities and access 't that can be pushed out but at some point in time that road needs to be closed because it sits within the mining footprint so there 's diversion drains and other things that will eventually cut across that road but we 've been negotiating with count sort of get construction access off one location off wabong waibong road and that 's where we 're going to create our diversion around the overpass so do you understand the concerns of the residents though in relation to emergency access is to be a life-threatening illness um some description that they may yeah 35 minutes they 're saying oh yeah i can understand um mr campbell 's excuse me thank you thank you yes well except the answer to personally yeah i 'm just all right i think that 's all we 've promised participating for our 11th century now we 've got one team that 's the one thank you thank you all and brian uh if you wish to stay online you can but we have a series of other public participation in relation to other matters um so you okay thank you and the other one was canceled thank you [Music] i believe is thank you for the opportunity to address council again in relation to this va please note as employee council i 've declared a tutoring interest and i address council today as a home movement with the impact by this uh proposed development i live at toronto cooler by course and today i 'm representing residents of four six seven eight ten and fourteen full of our quotes 16 blood will grow as well as expressing views that are shared across the neighboring community i wish to reiterate the strong opposition to the proposed development which has been made clear by the community over the two and a half years this da who was submitted to council it 's noted that despite being defended several times to enable consultation with the applicant for the consultation the proposal before council tonight appears to be identical to when it first appeared on the council agenda back in bankroll and indeed unchanged set the application with life notified to the public in august of 2019. perhaps the lack of for the research the amenity of adjoining properties is directly and unreasonably impacted by this proposal especially in terms of privacy airflow and social impact more broadly people in the community continue to be bamboozled and the prospect of bulldozing the trees are one of the highest points in musclebrook and to be replaced by more grey roofs this development is absolutely intrusive to surrounding residents and inappropriate for this location it 's not in the public interest as it 's been demonstrated in a large number of objections submitted hopefully our councillors recognise the impact that this proposal will have on the lives of existing residents and the enjoyment of their properties thank you for your time thank you thank you yes is is is [Music] so basically [Music] okay so we 're going to 10.3 besides last suggestion we 've got margaret morgan amy jones would you watch something yeah that works um i guess i don 't have a massive big speech i 've got more sort of points about everything um first and foremost living in mcdonald 's 24 hours is a nightmare if my actually my family home um all the signatures i read are about noise yeah don 't say there 's no noise you do um so that makes me wonder yes they put some signs up but i think they 're about eight four a three size small writing hard to read so what 's the point um rubbish is never ending even today there 's rubbish below road it was there until about 3 30 this afternoon um that 's always been an ongoing issue my husband i know has had several conversations with phil the general manager i believe he is um whether it 's by a text or firing you know the garbage can and then they 're still there for lunchtime or whatever we live up the street we should have to pick up the rubbish um finest major issue there 's a large bloodline in the father that shines right up the street um as well as the headlights from from the cars when they 're in the waiting bay and whatnot so sign up and shine through my twitters and i know that a few other from the complaints we have made several complaints though it makes me quite like this angry if they don 't um my family i guess not i guess he has been subject to bullying from other managers there unfortunately he 's been told that his parents are the reason why they can 't do 24 hour trading and um so people get wet which is really hard for a kid in this town it 's you know trying to go yes we do make several reports to the police at night time but the noise that goes on the street you know sometimes it 's like the kids will wake up scared because they think there 's people in that right now you know they don 't realize how much it echoes up there um you know and i 'm sure this is probably the same um racing in and out of the car burnout that 's [Music] just in relation to the complaints um instead of being made you 've got you 've complained to mcdonald 's and the place so we 've done online resources and when you you back you never get a phone call my husband 's had several conversations even went down with phillips at mcdonald 's the information that we 've got that says that there hasn 't been any complaints and you have to recall if you i 'll go through phone records and then emails when you get that automatic general rated i don 't have only but you must have someone called the record and we have the text and phone calls probably that positive feed is done um probably around 11 30 mark depending depending on the weather it kicks out earlier but generally your 11 o 'clock mark would be sort of the start of it um and it just can continue some nights with my daughters still awake at 2am because it 's just out of control and look we know the movement over everything um uh it also starts if it has been quiet it will also start a little morning and then juice all right we 're going to ask you so what 's the intersection um cat fights bloke there 's drunk and disorderly um 's i think now been removed sit there they can have really loud conversations there 's [Music] v8 vehicles [Music] and whatnot um but yeah that 's about loud even though they can 't control but however because of the time they 're there you know if they weren 't yes um yeah that 's definitely one and look just the general safety i guess probably the only other one i missed that i wanted to mention there 's already 24 service stations in the area that happened in my mind and probably most people 's mind better access to the larger trucks you know that the sort of aim that they 're going for of being open that so you actually have trucks coming up through yeah like i said another point that i haven 't been able to get to is trucks do you come into short present um yeah and they do come around now i can 't give you exact times on that whether it 's daytime or night time but the increase of later in the evening has started to happen given the benefit that 's you know residents on the road and you know that sort of things coming through so yeah it 's just generalized i guess area cannot be that and that would be my concern if they 're open 24 hours you know that sort of where are those sort of limitations um where they depart are they going to be left finally creating more noise [Music] thank you everyone um so just to introduce yourself i 'm captain wilson i am the owner of muscle mcdonald 's and also the owner of singleton mcdonald 's take the opportunity everyone for giving us this opportunity to put this application there in i 'll have a little bit here so i 'll just read it directly as you 're aware mcdonald 's have utilized the covered 19-minute stereo order to explore operating outside the regular training hours over the past year this has provided an informal trial opportunity to understand and see firsthand benefits of expenditure during this first nine month trial period has been demonstrated that muscle of mcdonald 's has provided ongoing safe late night and early morning service to staff have been employed over this period of time furthermore it was emphasized that the police referral response supported the application and highlighted that there is a link between production and anti-social behaviour and the stores increase showing hours we appreciate council 's emphasis in the past has been understanding the levels of community engagement and again i 'd like to highlight that we did do the letterbox drop prior to the 24 hour application and providing the community with an outlet to come to us and as you know we didn 't receive any further feedback from that and the council obviously received full submissions so i just want to address some of those issues that were just addressed a minute ago rubbish with the rubbish just i just want to put things into perspective a little bit the actual overnight training from 11 o 'clock to 5 o 'clock in the morning actually comprises less than four percent of our overall trade for the week so just to just to make that clear we have very few people going through that time of time some may argue why even putting a 24-hour patient in the way in mcdonald 's operates it actually works well for us that we do most of our cleaning at nighttime and we provide a service to the community but primarily we do a lot of cleaning in that time pretend to address the rubbish um we do actually do five major pickups a day [Music] we do one first thing in the morning we do one at about seven o 'clock and then we do them throughout the day so we do have what we call a litter patrol and that is actively done um and just to address the comment that was made about being contacted about rubbish yes mrs jones is actually correct my number was given out and i started to not take notice of the calls that were coming through about the rubbish because every time every time a little piece of rubbish was put on the ground i was actually notified that there was rubbish on the ground and it did feel a little bit out of control the second thing was the picnic table now that has bit of a gathering place for the youth we removed that that 's now gone and i think i 'll just refer back to the police report that 's actually stated that anti-social behavior has decreased in the time that we 've actually been open we see being open 24 7 as a very positive thing to the community it 's safe we 're open the lights are on there are people there the police are there the police are visiting us at early hours of the morning the signs yes as per the last meeting we increased all the signs that is correct deliveries were all taken out so nothing is coming before about 6 30 in the morning now there are no deliveries happening and we also make sure that our crew are arriving respectfully and going around the back of the stall coming in the front which shouldn 't um be upsetting anybody uh so look just to summarize on that you know um every period of advising council we are committed to the community and we are committed to making sure that this works well um that we 've been going down this road and i still believe that it is the right direction to go all the community i i would imagine that if we ask the people that are using our facility the miners the old out the people that are working on ours the ambulance the police they will all tell you that our facility is working well and is really a good thing for the community so i 'll stop there um just want to thank everyone again for allowing us to put this day in the application and not allow the artist to come up works okay and doesn 't may open up to any questions thanks um just pretty much i 'm the town planner of flr behalf of mcdonald 's for the application and we endorse council 's recommendations for the 12-month trial 24 7. pretty much just here to fill any point if you have planning related or obviously operational that 's the next day to look into us yeah just in relation to you that the community classically happy with what your service you 're providing but would you say that they 're relatively happy given um probably not no to be totally honest but i 'll be honest with you also that i wasn 't involved in the planning process that put mcdonald 's there in 1989 either and then deemed the jurisdiction to be able to run a business there and all the rest of it so um not to bring mcdonald 's australia into this too much because i am a local operator but you know it 's just every mcdonald 's is 24 7. i 'm heading that way and and so most other businesses i guarantee that every other business would be up here knocking on the door to try and do exactly what we 're doing if they had the same ability to do what we do um you know i think muscle work is a 24 7 community um we see it we see people before we actually went to 24 7 we had a line up out the door uh ready to come in people wanting their coffee and muffin and so before they went to work the need them i can 't it 's hard to uh to really say but no but with um with a population in musclebrook i believe it 's it is a good thing can we do anything to eliminate some of the noise [Music] the police have done their submission and said that there 's been a reduction in social behavior because increased violence um i just know i believe that when i saw that miss morgan was going to be speaking in public participation yeah we previously had a conversation is have you had much complication with those people in those immediately affected houses because there 's a few here saying that the noise et cetera and they bought percent cleaning overnight yeah they would predominately could go on for a big period so to get them [Music] but the consultation ongoing complication there 's no complaints that you 're saying except for acknowledging uh the text messages is there any other complaints that have been looking forward from the likes of this uh well without doubt i mean we we actually uh my general manager actually goes over and sees to be totally honest i don 't think there 's anything i 'm going to be able to do persuade her i mean but they 're waiting for other interviewers i can just jump in so i guess and i think phil mentioned it when he was on speech before um and we appreciate from the council 's discussions you know this is the first extension about the application with um mcdonald 's uh community consultation has been a key piece that your counselors are concerned with um and that 's why we you know bill and the mcdonald 's team made sure that before they went 24 7 that they did a letterbox drop to the residents now that provide appeals contact details gave people opportunity speak directly to the store manager um how those residents predicted was um actually based off the residential receivers outlines in the acoustic reports and the ones that were most likely to be impacted they were all contacted um and i guess from there we 've given we know mcdonald 's given the opportunity for the residents to speak in that time there not very much and they 've been registered to in your own council assessment report but the dependent complaints received during the extended training period anyway yeah still um i should know the answer if you would deny the 24 hour operation what would get ourselves uh so it 's ten o 'clock at night monday thursday and then eleven o 'clock friday saturday sorry happy new did that well it is about four percent yeah so it 's um so it 's not huge um but i i i definitely would have to well i wouldn 't let 15 people go but it would definitely stop the the progression of more people coming through so we 've definitely upped our staffing numbers um we 're employing more people than we 've ever employed um and what we 're finding is a lot of the younger managers coming through and doing the overnight so quite like the overnights and then we progress them through the normal management ranks and then progress them through the business and could you do your cleaning uh without this extension else that 's all we at 10 or 11 and then we do a one hour claim and then the store is clean pop the bottom closed up for four hours and then we reopen again at five um that 's that 's what we 've done since 1989 um so um yeah so all right yeah thank you anyone else thank you gentlemen okay excellent thank you very much um for the following reasons [Music] of section 631 topography of the motherboard development control plan that relate to the extended cut of bill committed for residential development part two is prosciutto section one b the preset proposed development would have a significant adverse environmental impact on the amenity of adjoining residential properties by way of people privacy acoustic and zoning impact development is developmental is a development unsuitable for the subject thought the stupid underlying topography of the site is not compatible with the proposal as a reshaping of the site and its development is considered to result in adverse environmental impact but for pursuant to sections 4.1 5 one e the proposed development is incompatible with the public interest the proposed development would the development locality and would detract from the regional center character and livability of that residential precinct in the muslim township yeah do we have a sector do we have any discussion in the contrary yes which is va 2020 slash 133 which is the backpackers accommodation at 14 cajun street online [Music] um the fact that the most effective residents adjacent to the development claims to have not been notified whether that 's at fault of the council the resident of australian posts i guess is impossible to establish however being really the most effective and probably the only effective president i think is the inappropriate to to improve this ga without giving them the the opportunity to make a submission to council especially giving the extent of oversharing over showering yeah you 're talking to the emotion good point do we have a second it 's just yeah the reason is as i just explained um and also the fact that um yeah for me i just disagreed with the um officers view on the reasonability of oversharing um and the diagrams don 't actually show exactly how 't show um at different times of the day o 'clock but what is it like to apply the more detail you started without promotion was you can clarify what your proposed motion is and then get confirmation of council of reynolds that he supports it can i give you the reasons why i 'm asking you to do that no give us a little give us what your motion is yeah nicely together [Music] it to the nearest resident and be communicated with and get the opportunity to appreciate and have the opportunity to express their objections which they have done to me personally people yeah on the basis of it that he 's been notified that there 's no the consultation hasn 't happened there 's some fault not that it 's councils or all right so that the reason you 're declaring it is for that reason the memories online that 's the promotion today is all in favor of council mcniel 's research [Music] all right let 's talk about this three which is da 2021 30 change of operational hours for dolls 83-89 maintenance street to approve uh development applications to be approved a week for an hour at what 101 dp one two six six five one five eight three eighty nine patient street mustn 't be approved for the prior period of twelve months subject to the conditions of attending student report so we are comfortable with understanding what that 's the officer 's recommendation do we have any discussion or supporting can i speak on that [Music] and the information that 's come to hand in relation to there has been complaints that hasn 't i think you want to defer but yeah yes yeah you haven 't_''_5789.199 said it elsewhere you haven 't_''_5794.4 been controlled sorry could that be repeated please it 's coming across a little bit blurry so jason just in relation to that i said uh moved to defer it i didn 't want it but just in relation to tonight i 'm hearing that there 's been completion conflicting information um i 'll speak to it after that yeah so is that in relation to the complaints not being responded to yes you can do that yeah complaints um that we had conflicting information in relation my thing is that the cover 19 period could be for 12 months jason and we could be it 's not one month is not going to or even two weeks if we 've got an extra ordinary council meeting coming up to have that time to have that consultation we have mrs morgan to speak here he 's done um and whatever purposes she couldn 't be here but um i 've done a proposal and i was aware that mrs morgan was in support um of the mcdonald 's but it 's in this yeah all right so [Music] um seem to be affecting the business and to get the clarity of human minds i think he 's very good do we have anyone with against the proposed person [Music] all right all right so next one is ken paul which is the da202082_``_5918.04 commercial cutout big royal hotel bridge street [Music] yes thank you thank you thank you um the council obviously normally reduced parking space i 've been an agreement with the proponent for nine thousand dollar wants to ask questions okay 10.5 which is da202136 curved accommodation and function fashion center at 1 831 miriam will road sandy hollow we have a councillor 's recommendation i 'm happy to meet you all those are favorites and please raise your hand clear to be honest next one is training composer 10.6 which is discounts on the field any discussion i put it all those places you 're right there if you notice okay 10-7 which is the planning proposal tp018 through his own reason at a former forestry site at 72 to 74 maintenance street musselbrook there 's an ox with recommendation to resolve it for the uh the documents i 'm not able to read through all that but it 's basically for the resigning of the old priority site to allow to be used as a school um so this is just a resigning proposal and it doesn 't do anything about the contaminated ground it doesn 't in any way prohibit that from being fixed sharon 's online i believe that 's the case council yes thank you very much the general manager also uh council foreigner council of woodrow any other discussion i put the motion call there 's a phone please raise your right hand let 's declare that you know this all right now on to 10.8 which is the model report for planning environmental directory services catharines amazing any discussion i put in all those slides right your right hand uh councillor reynolds yeah sorry yeah all right so now we 're on to 11 11.1 which is the integrated water cycle management strategy uh i could congratulate the council officers on the right of this particular report um okay that 's uh we 're invited by the officer 's recommendation council award whoever seconded it came to the wardrobe we 'll be having a discussion always in favor please say aye all right david um capital works program rights australian office of recommendation the day recommendations council endorses the following priority list of works and the undertaking of the 2031 capital works program to the extent of the funding under the various programs do we have a rumor for the motion i said a question regarding the um linebacker got not not expending all the funds thank you very much for the question there is a grant at the moment between badminton street and uh which is coming under construction the sector 's been contemplated now it 's between plastic close i think it is and linebacker just filling in that gap yes all right so do you connect with register is a high priority however we 're considering that perhaps that would be best placed as part of a larger project with curb and construction and payment rehabilitation perhaps so which part of turtle street it 's between power street and paxton street on the southern or the northern on the southern side this is continuing undersea there 's a six of footpaths between palestine to the creek yeah and it 's extending that too all right so do we have [Music] [Music] oh and considers the extraction of the product on a raised pad so it was basically they looked at whether to put it up on a pad or or put it up on raised pairs and it came back to the workforce if just as an update on the german heritage village because um i think it 's a bit further ahead and more estates that 's medical yes matt lightfast if you 're available online can you provide an update on the denman heritage village yes fiona so what we were looking to do is get a design and construct um tender out this um this calendar year uh to get it under con under construction yep yeah just a report still had at the last stage and none of the cards yeah all right so all right all right sorry can i just ask a question on that i actually couldn 't find one where did i what have i done wrong i couldn 't find that one it 's um [Music] it 's 309 on the paper copy jason yeah right so i mean so to cause the interruption there but i had a list of items and attachments and i just couldn 't find the correct attachment to go with that report was i looking in the wrong place they 're in a secret under a separate cover i could not at the wrong place uh yes because the size of this business paper we had to send it out differently so they were uploaded as two separate documents it 's about three rooms of paper jason yeah i have all the ones and it has the item numbers listed next to them and it 's got about five of them with item 1.1 or sorry 11.1 and i couldn 't find this this item number in there anywhere 11.4 uh um can 't show you where that is i do apologize if i 've missed it or looked in the wrong place is there a particular writing council forward that you would like the question i always like reading that one to check on the status of the um entertainment center um yeah and i couldn 't find it that was all that 's okay max can you provide an update on the entertainment center uh yes so we 've um the project team has responded to the rfis from our planning team and the regional planning panel so that went in uh earlier this month the project team we issues the one of the big issues was around the property tenure arrangements which we 've dealt with so we 're hoping that um we 're planning to going through some notification and uh a process now and then we 'll get a an opportunity in front of the regional planning panel in coming months uh and then there 's also a report about the um the early engagement of contractors and the design and construct tender running concurrently um later in the in the business paper yeah yeah okay thank you matt right so is it uncomfortable that we we put it 11.5 level by coursework which is the major projects that support so we had a [Laughter] those again said hey they 're at carrick and harvestly so 11.5 which is the water and west water levels of service for the fourth quarter 2031. the council most new information contained in the report council on the bill count down for woodwork and your discussion always in favor say hi those again say no david carradine 11.6 which is the general design program council changes and art centre so design for the council chambers an art center with further design work including the enlargement of development applications [Music] um yeah just in relation to the council chamber side of things mr mayor um the structure in the settlements it 's templated there it 's not the actual setup but in light of the the space we 're sort of moving from no bigger as such to what we 've got here uh it is moving it out towards there but until we get a new council changes that we were pleading down the track would not make sense in this campaign environment council meetings in a more spacious environment upstairs and we 're moving into this facility general manager and i had this house this book the applicant room this meeting would have been [Music] and they 're not agreeable um not only to the regular looking out of the room but the um the room is not well set up for audio visual um our meetings it would actually make it quite quite difficult to do that um we would have to literally and maybe we can negotiate money into an av setup rather than having to just if we 're going to be more inclusive this day and with the community and more consulted that we 're moving to a duplicate of size that 's not really inviting of any more sorry i i think for obviously for bigger meetings and you know meeting like tonight then you would then you would look to book the atherstone room or or or somewhere else um council also has the meeting in emin that they that you do every year um but for for meetings where you you don 't have a lot of public participation uh essentially it 's it 's the same space um that you 've got there but what you will have is you have the addition of um breakout spaces with the two um the the two heritage rooms and then we 're looking to add um uh you know toilet facilities in kitchenette and things like that a little bit of public participation we think it would be fine but a bigger a big council meeting you 'd have to book somewhere for might have seen the thing that 's got more of a before and after so that means all the counselors can see one another that means we can set up a lecture in a position where anyone who 's calling in can actually see the people of the election it 's that category at this stage i think the proposal will really do this it 's not to say we shall do it it is basically to progress to this state so we understand what potentially there is i totally respect that that 's what i 'm just saying it 's duplicating what we 've got now and we will lose income for rental but we 're trying to make more things more inclusive to the public to rather than being online you want to engage so yeah um is operation project now [Music] [Music] um the length of this okay so officer 's recommendation don 't go to the general manager of the authority and dancing engagement the white home road overbridge works dude as our outlawing in report and that would be subject to further report the council to continue to negotiate and sign the s-138 raids 93 approval generally in accordance with the draft specialist additions set out in the report the consent be provisional on a suitable form of security agreement with the general manager prior to the expense of construction of the minoan asset infrastructure within council 's rate reserves and the use of council raid reserves to access the construction plan three as outlined in the draft special conditions insurances detailed design and family management plans are to be submitted and certified by suitable mostly qualified consultants and accepted by the general manager see the consent be proposal on the special conditions including the condition that the physical closure of wildlife based on the probe is not permitted until safety upgrade identified in the road safety order for ribson 's road between white home road and yarraman [Music] to council satisfaction prior to the physical closure of white on road and there 's an added one which won 't be there delegate to the general manager formerly to engage with the white honda community in relation to this the pleasure of warrior post office wave oh well i 'll put it up actually you know [Music] the residents um conditions of consent we are a diversion or i think equivalent funding for the upgrade i think that 's still the total is correct and saying that it 's up to the general manager yeah we 're still negotiating to negotiate in the deal we 're still going can you explain it so it 's in the moment you 're what i 've said well the s138 which gives vanguard some comfort that figures are still moving we 're also giving the authority with regards to the general manager to progress the greater things with regards to the d now within the d will be the things that um the figure writers with regards to upgrades at the arm and road and richmond player but that whole idea of this particular motion as you 've seen it is it 's identified that there 's a work that needs to happen immediately with regards to richland and and to make them safely compliant so basically we 're saying we 're trying to get that locked so that will as part four was still part of that section 138 that 's been explained to us by the deputy general manager and the general manager we 'd have to still put on public exhibition reporting okay yeah [Music] again this this motion does not really have um the possibility of the diversion being um the other question was for council 's consideration so this will come back to council yes yes and when it mentions work deeds that includes dean 's associated process right the whole the d is is a big agreement which covers the whole thing yeah on the road rich and slow passed office right wide operations satisfaction what does that mean account of satisfaction is that that 's [Music] officers [Music] [Music] what does that mean to formally liaise most basically where we 're coming from with that is we 've had a situation tonight where the people have spoken to us in over forum the only other forum they 've had at this stage is by sending all of us sending us emails it 's basically putting all their concerns and things together mean a proper consultation process like and those concerns are then um summarized and put in the report is that right thank you thank [Music] i think that i also taken consideration some of their requests like yes you know their big request earlier but today they represented yeah australia of course i think i should 've made it up because as a leader chair sorry to be a pain again but when the uh the formerly liaised is that doesn 't involve a formal written notification of of the pro the proposal as well that 's that 's that 's just with the amazing it 's finding out what people think and formally recording what they do to people and addressing their concerns and giving them feedback what point are they notified that it 's going to happen so they can officially form an opinion before they 're liaised with i think they 've got their opinions we just we just want to follow together and be able to forward [Music] [Music] how do i know that they know they 've had time to consider what they 're giving in relation to this 138 ago sorry goes on public exhibition they will we will we will yes with the residents yeah we would use that in the decision-making process indeed bringing back the council for council to consider and decide upon that and there will be an exhibition here yes of course written to or notified that this is happening or that this has been proposed yes that 's that 's right yes they 'll be formally notified and and the general managers are committed to meeting with them as well thank you that 's why we inserted the word formally into yes i mean but it did only say liaise then i was trying to clarify uh at what point they were formally notified and then liaised with okay all right hi okay could we invite um yes um all right so the uh the next one is um four point one let me see we 've gotta go i think council around is is all right so we have 12.1 emeritus mayor officers recommendations council recognized the long service provided to the committee by the former mayor approved that case to be made [Music] please we can come back into the room uh okay 12.2 the council 's membership manager of the hana joint organisation his office 's recommendation he is noted by the hco that after reconsidering the decision by msc on the predicate forward on a journey of just now that 's all the remaining member of the hko i have a discussion so what have we got it because i support that yeah well i i support the um especially the um in relation to sharon pope 's address in regard to the training which is not available allegedly easily from alternative sources economies of scale mental by mr finnigan and as council reynolds has alluded to previously it 's not a great noun um it was because of that commitment he said tonight no longer they have nothing to do with that they 're not part of that anymore [Music] and that 's been removed so many people have church oh you need that question sorry i 've made that passion do we have any contrary i still have content are we is 28 days and the event that they 've been there in public submissions the general manager which could be a little counselling with all those in china those against their carrier right you lose one question somewhere um that 's the council caretaker provisions the use of council material 11 [Music] [Music] i next one is 12a the draft module management and collection management policies office recommendation the library election mandatory policy and why do we managed to policy be placed on public exhibition for a period of 23 days and the reform is submitted to council at the end of the public exhibition period foreign [Music] it 's old age so 12 9 we have a whole series of financial policies with an office direct invasion with regards to the political policies replaced from exhibitions but the foreign policy the financial mountain policing the investment on its policy the debt recovery policy the highest economy and with the policies to be reset at the council for consumer action once the public exhibition period has been completed can i move that way and just request that we have a workshop meantime so remember have a second yeah [Music] workshop to notice the difference between the both policies and changes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] department can i suggest uh councilman mcneil that we go through each of the policies in detail with the workshop on policies yeah 12.10 okay so 12.10 which is the carrier progress and so the new new motion is council approved the caravan project as identified in the report gets times to me we need to move and load on 12.9 thanks all those information [Music] [Music] this year mr floyd yes so it 's a slight change from the basically because again because we 're not finishing up an account at all by captain mcneil second accounts of woodrow although upon completion of the order okay now report on investment seller of june of 2021 after the frequent days of the information show through the june 2021 good point of the recommendations of investment as a june 2021 [Music] report on council grant funding june july 2021 council notes the information contained in the report of like the murder of the game council level of local and our officers with regards to the success we have had as a council um with grants is absolutely phenomenal my question is says most patrol councillors required national funds this project will be coming from the general rep program and or a large capital green program i can assure you i would have consulted with this and i wouldn 't have agreed to it was that a resolution [Music] sorry it 's just for the uh so i think it 's been was required to contribute so it 's been determined that 's where it 's coming by earning the grants the temple had to resolve that way [Music] [Music] and we 're all and i will just say that usually the grants officer is trying to finish an application you will not believe that the time frame can i just request um can we get a copy sent to the councillors of the application for the olympic park new museum and the netball court just to see where we 're at with that all right 12 leads that could be passed i 've been voting so i thought the authorization knows section 226 of the local government office of recommendation there was four council merchants information provided just in relation to one mr mayor i 've spoken to the general manager and we 're sending a letter just in relation to the first one um there 's amendments that need to be noted in relation to the mouth president that was the signed document for the s-226 i just want that to be noted in there that there needs to be changes and i 'll be sending an email there could be an amendment um as i 'll send an email through in relation to the first item in the nature of its what 's been submitted to councils there 's no attachment there 's no attachment in the document but i 'll just be loading it um [Music] extension officer 's recommendation council vote report on the commencement of the memorandum of understanding house award [Music] thanks to the council officers that were injured because what actually happened was there was a new committee and they were a little bit fearful of the whole exercise so the cancer was extraordinarily successful thank you i 've picked up a bit of scholarship but that definitely died that whole thing is happening position [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all those events 12 16 which is the trivia project often recommendation council make the progress of the treaty project move capital level um just in relation to it it 's saying that and i know that council legends being very hands-on with this one but just the way it 's worded in here it says all counselors have been involved in the original workshop correct and subsequent workshops or individual meetings haven 't been a part of any other subsequent workshops or meetings and i 'm not too sure all other councils have because the nature of this item um i believe uh on the next page it says uh to move forward we 're going to have some community consultation and one on uh and communities thoughts one-on-one conversations with additional stakeholders including muscle shy councils i think it should be a group participation rather than one-on-one so as we know where we 're coming from with it well it will also be one-on-one someone would if someone left somebody might not say something in a group yeah what people really think and same with the community as well [Music] um in relation to the wording of the first thing about the original workshop okay so i 'm imagining what they mean in the initial workshop that we did at the strategic planning and then the workshop that happened with um some key people from the aboriginal community that counselors came along to which was only some counsellors [Music] [Music] so 1270 which is the officers community services officers recommendations the information containers report commanded council leads senator council on medline appropriation all those folks [Music] committee on the from the first to the seventh to the fifth of the fifth seventh and the fifth of seven sorry and the officer recommendation is the minister for the spaceship your

showing still they 're going to come over over this hill back along to denman road they 're to go out bengal a link and then down at cayuga cross dorset and then go back into blam on lane so we have a real problem sorry they go back through the dark with mine we have a real concern about how we 're going to manage the damage to our road and what the procedure is we 've notified them that we will be opposing yeah so they 're very keen to talk to us so we haven 't had the most everyone move the executive foreign finance review and advising committee on the 8th to the 7th the 15th and 7th the 22nd to the 7th of the recommendation minutes for finance review of the guys committee meeting on thursday thursday and thursday approaching july you know moved to a councillor secretary july 2021 he received and the recommendations came contained there is adopted moved by councilman secretary by council of woodward put the most okay do we have any notices of motion rescission do we have questions with those um receipt all councils received an email in relation to the parking out in front of the book free medical uh for the buses the bus that 's having trouble well no no okay so there 's an issue when you come to the committee but there 's an issue with relation to the bus um at the parking at the front of the book street medical that there 's a delineated bus only and people with disability the traffic is being backed up down past north carolina but backed up down to the traffic lights um where people are temporarily to drop off can we get something sorted out that people in front of that can come before the traffic committee or report recommendation because it 's becoming a real nuisance [Music] just a question mr mayor in regard to the pavement failure on the extension of uh the contractors the failure of the surface um council staff are aware of that it 's essentially being caused by the recent events um the account the contractor put in place a sacrificial seal so they 've been required to go and 's a prime seal alone and it 's there to put a seam allowance on the surface while the second stage has been carried out then of course once those two stones have been carried out will be carried out in both sections but in the meantime we 'll be required requiring them to carry a satisfactory remediation work scene [Music] and the other question i have is with the closed council items yeah how do the council 's access to that because obviously close closeness don 't go online right so do we tell them [Music] is [Music] um [Music] oh really well that 's strange because it came to me and it wasn 't even addressed to her mate that 's why i told everyone [Music] you _"

bailey on behalf of the applicant uh we 've also got people attending that aren 't speaking which is uh shane dilforce sue ryan langford and ian breber ian webber and we 've got um requests to be linked in uh from uh sue pollard shane mcintosh angela dawson and kell and jenny hinchen so welcome to all of you um and first up uh fred is spread available would you like to come up and if you 're speaking at if you use the dice that 's useful because um we are video conferencing and these are the speakers that are around the room they 're really quite strong and they make it quite clear for people who aren 't uh in the room to be able to hear so i 'm just going to [Music] set my timer um fred are you right to start yeah guys okay thanks um firstly let me state how disappointed and frustrated approach with regard to the uh residing application i purchased lock 201 in november 10 residing on the eastern side of my mark uh leaving the debacle of different drive to building what was advertised and promised as a rural land knowing you know the land behind me was e3 and not to be built in main note i strongly rejected there the reasoning directly behind my boundary and have submitted such a register that is still to be addressed from our request for council although i understand for our town to flourish we need diversified land offerings but first a couple of stats straight out of your own in your report the muslim residents obviously grew by 675 people between 2 11 to 18 96 people per year on average through that period of time if we look at the average 2.3 people therefore in the household and at worst case we 're only looking at 43 new premises required per year and that 's why councils aren 't in your report furthermore the census growth of 1.9 between 211 and 218 if we use that information and do potentially worst case 400 homes not potentially 2 000 new lots that are going to be available if this subdivision goes ahead council state we 're in a period of sustained growth toward economic resilience seriously guys it 's really frustrating a quick search today showed that today uh on domain.com 181 vacant lands uh landlords are for sale and muskegon and there 's 624 properties for sale in the muskrack and surrounding area these das is there 's a currently in the ein for 600 blocks um these book links top up the existing hundred that have been repaired uh and not yet sold existing land approved behind robert hall 's hybrid state ironbark um and even queen street and we want to add another 500 blocks guys again the the last census basically identified occupied dwellings in musclebrook were 5761 however unoccupied dwellings were 1065. this is 16 of the existing occupants or the existing residence that is not occupied i asked council to respect the existing residents as stated in the m triple rs payjack states the development will respect and respond to the character of the states existing circumstances for adjoining land zone for the large residential will effectively be mirrored by this proposal this is far from the current plan if the reasoning is to be approved i and 21 direct existing residents with the direct rear boundary plead with council to provide one guaranteed condition grayson respect for our previous commitment to the estate that 's all i 'm asking this ensures the council and the proponent commit to the existing residence with a specific dcp in the development control plan to be adopted as per clause 6.3 to be adopted referencing the mirror image lots of four thousand squares in one acre this ensures that any future council members or any prospective developers comply before any subdivision of land may proceed this protects the rural field that we initially purchased it has to be said this is not a lot to ask considering that you 're replacing the existing views of what we see sun rising over the channel trees boundary kangaroos cattle grazing and all the wildlife and you 're going to replace the 500 by 600 square meter blocks the officer develop a specific for a site-specific dcp in accordance with the plan dated the 6th of may this is not acceptable the poor effort to amend the plan with the proposed r5 between 1500 and 2000 squares at joining the land is not in line for the mirror image we all want a reasonable outcome and the offer is the complete insult we want to support and grow the prosperity of muscle however surely existing residents with the shared boundaries must be considered in line with the interval rs a guarantee a council and a proponent amend the current plan in line with the mres sorry a guarantee the council and the proponent amend the current plan and include such a note in line with core 6.3 of the of the mustard left to mirror the existing land image to ensure that those one acre lots and join the existing residence is favorable for all parties thank you for your time and i trust you will consider my request and respect the wishes of long-term residents online again thank you very much fred um um i 've failed to mention manager here uh and some of the counsellors are also in the room and some of the other senior staff um and we might be able to make a a few comments towards the end but uh are there any particular questions to go to fred before we move on from any of the councillors well i might just ask one friend i found that very helpful and um and i think quite generous as well in terms of the proposition about the mirror housing which you said to you was the one thing you want guaranteed and can i just ask that that really is your position that 's the one thing you want above anything else i hate to say it yes you know because of the fact that the time frames are being allowed and you know there 's a raft of scenarios i 'm going to put forward but at the end of the day you know in the essence of progressing we know this would be some time but that just gives us that real feel i personally brought in the first by the first that obviously while i 'm joining the e3 because i knew no one was going in that was the purpose otherwise i would have chosen another location or elsewhere um so again i love the area i like what it 's got to offer um you know i throw lots of those i 've been a and read since i 'm a five-year-old um and you guys want to say but all they 're asking is all i 'm asking for my personal um well-being is mirror that image on my back face that four foot barbed wire fence mirror through push it through then put your road on and then build through your 600 squares a 1500 or 2000 square block what fence are we going to have all the batteries you know so all i 'm asking is the m engine rs you know stakes that mirror image and that 's all i 'm asking the council 's i think certainly indicated that but i just think it 's extraordinarily generous usually when objectives come in they throw everything at it including the kitchen sink yeah i think to invite neil up he 'll apply thanks neil thanks councillors for the opportunity to speak um my my speech will probably be a little bit shorter than fred so we 'll call back a little bit of time um i have about a dozen points i wanted to raise so the proposal uh suggests that there is a two percent population growth in musclebrook over the last seven years that does not justify the potential release of these 600 lots when there are already over 700 lots either available or currently going through the da process there is already 10 years of supply already available without this development on page 55 of the proposal post there has been no use of new sub sub subdivisions for residential purposes in the show in the past three years this is purely because there is no demand in musclebook currently industry is on the decline and current workforce is transient providing small blocks does not entice people to live in this area the proposal mentions identifying additional ants to be zoned as r5 but minimal loss have been allocated as r5s in long sizes or area zone r5 to reflect the transition between existing large lots and propose standard residential locks the transition consists of one half street which is a minimal transition bordering iron bar bridge we 're proposing the development area that is visible from my embark bridge is to be r5 locks to the same size as the ironbark existing ironbark bridge development and that the closest area to these book links over the hill is developed as r1 reflecting that estate this would be a true reflection of transitioning existing lot sizes on either side of the development proposed in its current form the land does not represent an extension of existing large presidential laws development and repeating the settlement patterns in immediate locality as detailed on page 22 of the proposal the rezoning does not provide subdivision into a range of residential lot sizes consistent with the joining development as adjoining land sizes is not consistent with the existing development the land sizes are small at between 1500 and 2000 square meters on the ironbark bridge site which currently exists at 4 000 square meter loss we detailed on page 13 of proposal and further makes changes to the proposing plan the proposal amendment has not divided signed land suitable for the variety of residential development and as such provides unnecessary continuing housing supply and lack of choices with lot sizes limited to a dozen quarter acre blocks and 600 r1 blocks as detailed on page 22 of the proposal the adjoining existing adjoining land use of large lots residential and residential will effectively be mirrored by this proposal this statement is incorrect it does not appear the proposal responds to the concern of devaluating our properties this will occur on a gradual basis most likely over 20 over a period of 20 years for proposal stakes is a proposal saying that this is okay to devaluate our properties over the course of 20 years the proposal states that 90 of the shire 's population lives on r1 loss does that not say that we need more r5 blocks in the musclebook shire for diversity the proposal also states that the council has a goal of diversifying the employment available in the shire however i failed to to accommodate these people and finally the proposal states that the current owners are local and it is not in their interest to provide low quality subdivision next to their ironbark their ironbark rural residential subdivision the vision from mrs webber was for the estate to be rural living and original blocks were sold with the surrounding area advertised as being an extension of the existing linebacker stages mrs webber would be heartbroken to see houses stacked wall to wall within r1 lots this was not her vision and certainly not her legacy thank you thanks very much neil sorry the next speaker is grant lloyd thank you for the opportunity speak quite a few points that i disagree with the documentation that council has said for us to review uh on page 17 the intended outcome is to provide land that will allow subdivision into a range of residential lot sizes consistent with adjoining land use [Music] that 's a pretty loose statement but to me it means that on the back of the new proposed development that would be the same as what 's on the other side plus square meter blocks and says enable the logical extension of and connection between existing residential areas which it 's not really a logical extension between existing areas when it 's from one size dramatically down to a much smaller size of 600 square meters the developer will respect and respond to the character of the area and the identified settlement hierarchy of the region which to me isn 't being carried out if the reduction from one back fence to the next back fence is a reduction of more than 50 and as fred said uh my impression that i bought up there it 's not supposed to counseling i think it 's only an impression was that being b3 it 's going to remain at e3 so what why would anyone think in an environmental land would change to residential that could be neither for me but that was my belief and i 'm sure was everyone else 's belief that brought up there originally new residential areas will be planned with streets that make it easy for people to walk and cycle and with regulate recreational and open space from the initial plan was in december last year on november december last year i don 't think there 's any recreational area in there and the open space whilst it 's great to see people that it is more for waterway water runoff to stormwater drains and an area for people to use and on page 108 the document from hines bail we have a comment bottom of the first page we further note it was a directive in regard to leia of the previous director of engineering mr neil paint that open space be kept to an absolute minimum to reduce cost of future ongoing maintenance of open space areas so there 's a contradiction in those statements and uh it 's a bit worrying that council has the opinion that open space is just a menace to be maintained as opposed to benefit the population to enjoy which i think is pretty common knowledge that people benefit from being outside more than inside the responses that were uh given to the submissions that the residents put in this continuing i suppose the same question was provided which was in a lot of instances not answering the question at all it was just words from a local environment plan or other council documents uh you know a good infrastructure someone said schools are reaching capacity musclebook fair which is on that side of town and the parking is virtually full up traffic on road is so congested that it comes to a standstill at times with an uh increase of numerous dwellings in the future obviously not straight away it hasn 't been addressed whatsoever in the council response um it says that the final street network will be subject to detailed design work as part of what future subdivision applications street lights and geometry will need to comply with the engineering standards fair enough but the actual problem is the town 's infrastructure and uh say uh shopping center has not there 's no plan to address the situation which obviously is in the future and we 're looking at a 10-20 plan here so that 's not being addressed [Music] environmental i 'm sorry the land is currently zoned b3 why was it zoned be zoned r1 r5 the answer the cycles most likely zone e3 environment as it contains remnant native vegetation amongst pasture and it doesn 't say why it should be lightly through anymore excuse me are you almost finished yep great okay having fun uh we know that all the land immediately surrounding this proposal is owned by bhp and is under environmental protection thus all residents can be confident did this land the open space for the foreseeable future which is exactly what we thought were important so i can look at that if thank you very much mr lord could i invite shannon foster to come and speak a lot of the investments today that i 've recently purchased uh 106 in uh ironbark within two weeks um i did it wasn 't it was brought to my attention that there was reasoning and things were happening at the land behind my property for my new property however um all this information i had to digest in the last four hours so i don 't have much to contribute i think i could go on and bring up said at the end of the day i just wanted to bring my personal um say to it and my concerns from the plan that i 've received obviously um developments and progression it 's going to happen you know i mean i 've got no problem with advancement and moving forward and developing but the biggest seller for us and my family was originally from sydney everything 's come back you moved to musselbrook yeah it spread out a bit more you get the country feel but we 've just invested quite a lot of money for the lifestyle that was sold you know the the country lifestyle that 's where we wanted to bring our kids up that 's where we wanted to you know the kids walking down the streets and have that open plan living [Music] the potential that i could have from this plan um 13 to 15 properties along my back fence which is only a three foot wide fence at this stage is quite concerning there is a pasture of land there there 's obviously been um oh it 's called offset land 's going to be whether it be a park or just left how it is but having two culver sacs based off a strip of land that 's probably 30 to 50 metres wide it 's very concerning i agree with fred and fred 's proposal pretty strongly that progression is going to happen there 's no issue with that but what i do think is the initial owners who bought there and new owners who have invested there that have bought for the lifestyle they should be respected and it should be something that is put forward in future development plans um at the end of the day these plans may have been in place for 10 years that 's fine but things do change and a lot of people have invested a lot of money in that area so i agree with it like i said yeah have a mirror image on the back if if i share a three foot uh wire fence with another 4 000 block and that 's what i 'm looking on to then i can accept that you know but to have back fence i think that 's a bit pushing the boundaries a bit so that 's all i ask is that you know we come to an agreement the development 's going to go forward things are going to move forward we all know that but if we can just come to an agreement mirror image what 's there keep things equal so at least we 're not looking out on the 500 properties with moving out onto another yard that 's similar to what we 've purchased and invested in so like i said i 've only had very limited time to look over everything but i just thought i 'd bring my personal tables thank you thank you thanks very much we only have a few minutes left um um mr clay did you want to actually say anything thank you um so i 'll just respond to a couple of the points um not sure whether it gets 2 000 from it 's so just a correction there is literally 400 on this piece of paper and it is a re-zoning he 's not a va this we 're talking about tonight not a ta so it 's all open to bigger lots changing to the mud responding to the market it 's a concept for research and purposes we 're talking about zoning land not subdividing so there 's a there 's a difference which a lot of the responses that came back to us seemed to be thinking this was a d a or it was going to be a this is the final layout well it may be close to what it is it 's going to be subject to va conditions it 's going to be subject to talks with council it 's going to be subject to open space discussions it 's going to be subject to further floor and fauna it 's going to be subject to further things this is a reasoning not a subdivision you 've only got about 30 seconds the only other the traffic is we have done traffic reports and we have had rms sign off on it um the reason we don 't go into too much detail now is the muscle bypass may come 've had exactly that situation it 's going with a 400 watt supervision up there it completely changes the requirements of the town and that 's all the stuff happens um and as we 're saying the transitioning of the lots reaches one element the 2000. we 're also joining into the residential on the other side and the i believe we 've provided a nice transition 2 thousand square meters it 's not a small block or less two thousand square meters it 's half an acre well you guys are quite afraid yeah if you guys got an anchor two thousand square meters is still a big block of land thank you thank you and uh thank you very much everyone that closes our public participation council 's about to move into its um ordinary council meeting which needs to start almost in 30 seconds you can 't save okay _"
