    "text": "a request for community participation 78 residents wanted to get involved 12 were selected representing diverse communities across the LGA many perspectives ideas and opinions were gathered over two full-day workshops I think it 's important that people coming should know that the history of the land they 've come into so we 've got words like grow their people come in together and then they went together in the gathering place and they gathered in love well communion and gathering in love I should have a somewhere to have a have a smoking ceremony it 's just concrete but if you look at that with history you will have more appreciation of how those people bring this thing together this city together for a lot of people there 's a black history in a white history where as I say it 's a continuous history first step you have the Aboriginal languages Aboriginal people the second step you have the first fleet the third step convicts the fourth step farming type town the fifth step you have the multicultural Australia or Parramatta it 's something that everyone connects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like the circles our circle is a part of cultural symbol in almost all of the cultures and the waves of the water even webs of water symbolize something in every culture so symbolic pictures like those might be the common things it signifies to me a little bit of the waste thing but also movement and also time because the whirlpool will probably stay around for a while it is pulling a lot of things into itself from surrounding areas but then it will settle but then there will be another one pool after some time but in the end there they 're still waters there 's little points of history that are still remaining he just takes us back to those people and how they lived why we do what we do why we do things differently Aboriginal history it wasn 't really taught in school you know the great indigenous leaders that came about from Parramatta and how they were great hunters and you know I didn 't learn that in school so being involved in this project I learned about that some of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found through what they 're being saying that a lot of them do has more respect history impacts everything that we do now it 's always been an area where things have grown like as I said it 's growing from the soil from the you know from the aboriginals with the the water being here and in the convicts grew a gray color here and I think we 're growing our own culture here as well we should be trying to build on the past to better our future that being innovative in transport so the cycle ways like like well keeping the public and open space and said then that the governance then comes in over the top of all these things that 's a attachment a belonging and I look at the history and thinking about the future I feel like I want to be in part of this for the future in this area I have been in the country for 11 years I don 't have much understanding of the history the main thing that I would like to see for parameter square is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one place and the different symbols that might mean things different people combining the history and the multicultural aspect it would be a good thing to see not Paris where I think you know Parramatta we have a lot to celebrate in regards to our culture in regard to being the first set of government in New South Wales the story of our River in regards to the journeying to travel the trade in everything I think it 's it 's wonderful really that they 're listening to just kaleidoscope of people to get ideas in I think it 's a good idea otherwise people think decisions are coming down from the top and the ordinary people aren 't getting involved so this is an opportunity to do that seems like a privilege to be asked to voice our opinion so the fact that they let me come in and see what they 're doing is really inspiring because I can actually see how I can impact how power man is progressing we heard how important heritage is it 's vital to hear from community members Parramatta Square will be a vibrant space for all [Music]"

    "text": "[Music] I 'm a 21st of June this year the city of Parramatta councils issued a discussion paper on the many complex planning and traffic issues facing the people who reppin this planning review wasn 't about rezoning or increasing density we know that the people of Effingham the rest of the LGA are already playing their part in contributing significantly to Sydney how the Otago rather it was aimed at correcting the deficiencies and planning controls that were implemented in 2014 Council held a series of workshops anything to hear your view from the community about community facilities public spaces that are needed for growing community about heritage traffic and the need for commercial safe and local job we also asked you to tell us how those issues affected your daily lives and how we can work together to improve the lives of the current and the future residents your responses of been overwhelming over 500 locals have attended community forums and Lodge submission highlighting your concerns what 's clear is that there is no easy answer there is no magic wand but importantly stage one of this planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop a set of principles which will address these important issues in future planning as the population continues to grow all-important social infrastructure must keep pace with development the community has a real concern that the Epping Town Center needs a community hub and that would include a bigger better library community facilities and a plaza either on councils rawson street car park or on the chambers courtside Council will be exploring both of these options and at the same time we 've made the firm commitment that there 'll be no net loss in community space in Epping and that 's why we 've also allocated 20 million dollars in the new draft section 94 plan to acquire open space to ensure that as we develop we also provide better social amenities in 2018 will also be consulting with the community about a master plan for beautiful dense park with the assumption that a 50 meter pool will be retained [Music] we heard your message loud and clear about the traffic problems in Epping particularly around the town center where approximately 80 percent of people using the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't a single solution to Epping traffic challenges one factor is apparent like so many in the community I believe that a detailed traffic study one that 's currently underway needs to be completed before any major CVD planning proposals like Faustino or like other developments a fine line and I intend to write to the New South Wales Department of Planning strongly urging them to adopt this position council can 't solve the traffic problems on its own but we are working hard on initiatives that will certainly help these include retaining and reinvigorating the village look and the feel of the town centre it means improving pedestrian connections and bringing back local shopping and jobs [Music] the current planning controls have not produced the job the retail or the commercial services that were imagined back in 2014 we know and council will deliver stronger controls that will ensure that retail and commercial space is provided in future redevelopment the proposed new controls will require a minimum of three levels of retail and commercial space in all future development on site zoned b-two council cannot and will not ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beautiful streetscapes that we find an etic street and Rosebank avenue and the distress of the residents who are currently living with a loss of their privacy and amenity as a result of the adjoining building no one can reverse time but we can look for ways to mitigate the impacts of that which is already a fair the council is looking for ways to better manage the interface between the multi-story apartments and the houses in the adjoining heritage zone Council will also be preparing new planning controls for further consultation with the community those controls would allow some of the homes are joining the apartment buildings to be redeveloped as manor houses which is a two-story small apartment building with a maximum of four apartments another option that we will be considering allowing three-story development but with strong controls on important matters such as setbacks from boundary fences and the maintenance of street fronts the review has identified four changes to the current planning controls that must happen now we simply can 't wait for the traffic study to be completed we need to replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every dollar collected from Epping town centre redevelopment stays in Epping and is invested for the needs of the growing Epping population a draft section 94 plan the Epping town center is currently on exhibition and the results of that consultation will be presented to the new incoming council before the end of 2018 we also need stronger regulations to protect Epping trees we need to ensure that mature trees of a much wider range of species are protected from deliberate or careless the structure proposed amendments to the hornsby DCP will provide that protection are also currently on exhibition we also need to look at high usage in the town center in Council is drafting an amendment to the Hornsby DPP that will reduce the number of new passports being built for new apartments as well as looking at introducing a system of residential parking permit so there think I think we also need to protect pedestrian safety at rawesome streets and council will undertake a two-month trial of a lollipop attendance at peak time across the street at that crossings where we hope to improve pedestrian safe now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to personally thank the hundreds of residents who took the time to share their views with us following the elections in September council will brief their incoming lord mayor and councillors and seek their endorsement to progress this project under stage 2 council will drive new planning controls for discussions with the local community the council has already committed that the new LEP will not be inactive until detail controls around issues that toughen their backs trees and other supporting qualities are also finalized and also ready to be implemented thank you again for having your say on our things future you"

    "text": "Western Sydney we know has had potential for a large number of years but suddenly we can actually see it starting to happen you can get a sense of vibrancy and the vibrancy in this region is in large part its people our potential will be realized if we 've got the business sector the community sector the for profits and the not-for-profits actually working together it requires in my view new forms of partnership new forms of collaboration which are not usually seen that 's what creates a genuine sense of community its economic and social growth going together so this project is about getting young people apprenticeships in painting and we 've got some very significant contracts it 's fantastic for those young people because it 's often the first job that they 've had and we 've learned a lot about social enterprises this is very much about making it work as a business with the social element included later we 've done that the other way and often they don 't work because they don 't become viable financially often we wait till the government gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative we can actually show and lead the way take a chance the outdoor reading room project came about as we are trying to actually am encouraged the whole community to be supportive of their own families in the concept of reading is based in sort of a gap in between a couple shops in their local shopping village so local businesses are getting on board I think they see it as an opportunity to try and rebuild the community agent or you know people coming back to that Pacific space we see this is long-term project because when you sort of work with community partners and with businesses and with councils etc it does it 's a relationship it 's not just a one-off thing we just throw that in there walk away had to support that maintain it the community with saying you know what do you wanna do this base now that you have it so we 've come around and outdoor movies can be run you know taste testing all the different shops yeah it 's part of the journey of developing this community where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate agent that forms himself together to provide a resource to prevent people from becoming homeless what they wanted to do was today to real estate agents we 've got resources and help that can be provided to an at-risk person so if you 've got a tenant that is falling behind get that information to us and we can then work on going ahead and saving that tenancy there 's the obvious social benefit that of appealing to people to say you 're able to go ahead and to save a situation like that there 's an appeal to the owner of the business that they can save a lot of money the cost of going through tribunals the cost of at risk of losing the business of the landlord who may blame the agent for that issue by saving the Tennessee they 're saving in their business good business is where two people make money not one person so one way street it 's going to be very short term if you want a good society then you need to you need to help that society be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the income they received from the job they want to think it 's worthwhile that they are contributing to society there is shared value being created that 's what keeps young people today wanting to work with businesses there 's a lot of people moving into the area towards Western Sydney in a lot of jobs coming up and what we 've found is that we would like to place ourselves in a position to become a resource not just for local students or future students but also the local businesses that need I guess a little bit of help with social spending what gives it longevity is the networking and so we just network not only with the local government but also local community groups what community organizations do is actually invest in the community they need to say we don 't want your charity what we want you to do is to actually invest your money in the social and public benefits that we create so I would say to all businesses here this is an extraordinary opportunity night here in some ways is a unique opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law to break with the past to actually work together collaboratively in partnership to build a greater western sea"

Street access has been the lifeblood of the Parramatta the north-south axis we 've been working on this fascinating project over the last four years to extend public access along the riverfront through this most historic of bridges Lenox Bridget we 're opening two portals on the riverbank level to let people walk through cycle through we want to make this a public waterfront and extend access all the way through the bridge past the breach to Parramatta Park they 're digging those tunnels but they 're digging them from the top down through the road down to the level of the bottom and then they 're going to put the tunnels in this site is important to the whole state because it 's one of the most important all bridges built in the late 1830s so we had done a lot of research on the history of the bridge and we knew that the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got wider that the original bridge was 1839 and have been widened on the western side with a walkway and then again in the 1930s I came in here right at the beginning because according to the New South Wales Heritage Act if you 're going to excavate in a historic site you have to have an archaeologist do it so we have to be here all the time any digging is going under the ground to watch what 's going on to look for any significant objects or changes so we always knew that there 's going to be archeology in the bridge and when the early days of the work we found what we were expecting to find so small pieces of pottery bottles food bones and we thought that would probably be the extent of the feel that we did we find initially during the piling process which is the following a consumer side their bones in the third wall we expected to find things but nothing of this significance the first thing we started over there and we took dirt dug away and we found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew if it had be there or not as we went down further and further we actually realized that this was truly significant find during our during excavation we found a few pieces of the timber of the the first bridge and then from the archaeologists came down and we uncovered it from there so we were expecting road surfaces so we came down to road surfaces which were basically made out of firm crushed shale and crushed fine sand stone and then compacted so we found those but then towards the east we found the top levels of this retaining wall and we recorded all the surfaces and before that was basically it and then we exposed this side of Gihon retaining wall until we got down to the UM to the actual wall of the old and so-called trail bridge the wood was probably part of the bridge girders there are solid beans stretching from abutment to P or from peer to peer that was built here in 1804 which is sixteen years after the first settlement so none of us knew that we 'd find an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be none of us have actually ever seen since 1935 in inside the dear Marbury it 's a project which has every time you come on saw it gives you more surprises more challenges it 's constantly changing we keep finding wonderful things more and more important things as we open up the bridge and so we have to be quite flexible in adapting our plans to try to incorporate this archaeology which men are continuously changing put it front to accommodate the extra font well I think is pretty great as is great to be able to have that as part of part of our project now how it gets documented in the board will be we shown through the years to come and we 'll be able to say the little part of the construction as the council we 're actually the custodians of our own public places and spaces in our soil and built form so we are actually very important in the preservation of the Lennox bridge and we see that as as part of our leading roles making sure our heritage has a place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about it there 's the unique way in which it was built there 's the fact that it 's one of the oldest things in Parramatta still standing the thing is that people who live in Parramatta it would be great for them to be more aware of the historic heritage that they 've brought here now I 've driven a busy street hundreds of times I never thought about it but you have to go down to the water on either side of it to really see it these portals are like a passage through the history of Parramatta it 's not just about the functional movement of pedestrians and cyclists it 's about being able to read interpret reveal for everybody 's pleasure the history of Parramatta which has been hidden hi I 'm councilman Scott Lloyd Lord Mayor of Parramatta see this Lennox bridge portal is a really small part of a major leak now we 're able to access the river from both sides linking everything together Westmead Parramatta Park right through to the heart of the CBD and onward to Homebush I urge everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done to preserve this bridge without the work that was undertaken on this bridge we would not have this bridge for another fifty or a hundred years time this is a city that 's going upwards and outwards preserving our history but looking forward to the future it 's great you don 't have to do this this goes straight through to the park I 'm gonna enjoy their company joy it 's good I think the boys will be very happy that they won 't have to carry their bikes up the stairs now they can write straight along and underneath and keep going up to the park this will bring thousands of people on their bikes in cranes in wheelchairs you see our beautiful bridge our beautiful city so come on down see the history in place Parramatta we 're building a Stratos next great city you"

here at the university today today we welcome participants from our local high schools universities and businesses to take part in this most important forum participants will not only learn about leadership but will develop and share opinions and ideas on the future development of parramatta and greater western sydney but i wish you all the best i wish you all the future for your hands is what creates our our present and our future our knowledge you people here acknowledge respect and accept my spirit elders past and present yeah take care god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to this inaugural young leaders forum the great lineup of extraordinary men and women who will address you today will set the tone for the involvement of the whole host of experts who will contribute and guide

vision for paramatta as a vibrant of the 21st century today you 'll be presented with a unique opportunity to contribute your ideas and help to shape the future development of the parramatta region council and uws are working together to develop parramatta as a knowledge centre a city that fosters innovation and research and a city that lays a platform for future generations to thrive and prosper your input ideas and enthusiasm will be a vital part of this journey many many years ago there was the the commander of in the first gulf war fellow corps general norman schwarzkopf who said this when placed in command take charge that was his secret leadership when placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten that and i 've always thought through what does that actually mean how do you go about that task what is the practical implications of all of those things and and for me it really boils down to two and then i 'll tell you what it looks like if you are a leader first of all it 's about character character is the most important thing for any leader second thing it 's about confidence and so beth and the team have asked me to touch on the theme of leadership today and i wanted to outline the journey that i have had of working in png to be able to give you some context as i reflect on my leadership experience and i know that i 'm speaking to a group of people who aspire to developing their leadership skills and capabilities over and above their academic qualifications and this is actually where it all began for me throughout school and uni i was an extremely hard-working student and achieving academic excellence was always very high on my priority list but there was always a desire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needed extra fulfilment and in my case i ended up just stumbling onto this leadership path that was never planned and really came about as a result of that first kokoda crossing and i think my story is a good example of how you might set out on one path but that this should never prevent you from being open to what the world will throw at you and the interesting thing was that a month before the hsc we still didn 't have our house so i have to make a decision now and i realized that from now on i 'm not going to be the victim of my life circumstances because i can 't change them at that moment in time but what i can do is start creating the opportunities and i realize okay well if i need to study here 's what i 'm going to do i started waking up at 6 30 7 30 i 'd be on a train in penrith i get to parramatta station at 8 30 and i 'd wait at parramatta westfield you know where borders used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour until 9 30 and then i 'd try to be the very first person in parramatta library and then i 'd study basically every single day some weekends there was track work and so i 'd have to travel one and a half hours to parramatta study for one and a half hours and then travel back for one and a half hours and even though i traveled three hours and only studied for one and a half hours that one and a half hours was exactly what i needed um so the element of livability that i looked at was entertainment and culture which is obviously a major contributor to livability it 's something that certainly parramatta has potential to develop i mean we already know that paramount has fantastic eateries but part of this entertainment discussion that we had also centered around museums and galleries so again this was just an element that we could really develop in parramatta just to draw in a new kind of demographic so the way that we looked at entertainment and culture was um through a concept of magnet infrastructure which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reflect on cities such as london paris new york they have an element of culture to them that is supported by their infrastructure and definitely a drawing card in terms of livability hey everyone um so for our group we sign off by thinking in 30 years time what 's in new york and what 's paramount going to be like you know it 's going to be an increased population by a lot especially with the current growth rate and so we want to think about how can we be sustainable well the three main areas of sustainability that we need to address the first one was engine recycling so for more people we 're gonna have to use up more resources and we 're gonna have to start better harnessing the natural ones like sunlight and we have to start recycling what we 've already used so we thought first one would be energy architecture would be quite an important career we wanted to firstly see in terms of what our group thought of government and and media and we started off by asking a question about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to a uh a local mp or councillor or to the media on an issue so i 'm gonna do the same thing here how many of you have actually had contact with government mps all the media on an issue please raise your hands okay it 's pretty similar results to what we what we had originally so we wanted to talk about what some of those barriers are and what we could do to to change that to have that level of engagement so i think when we look at innovation there 's a few things here and i think the unique opportunity for parramatta is that we don 't need to compete with the city we are unique in our own right we build on our own competitive advantages and build the future build our city for the future and i think the notion that we 're the poor cousin or western sydney 's the poor cousin to people of the east i think we just forget about that we run our own race and we be the innovative leaders and it 's a mindset in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and i think when you get to that innovation space no longer do we need to look behind us at the city we look in our own direction and and i think if parramatta can embrace that we 'll find those creative leaders and the answer to all of that is understanding our own unique competitive advantage and yes it is within the diversity of cultures and the rich history that this area has and by growing that i think that 's an inspiration to find those leaders but once we get those unique uh the next google or the next iphone or whatever it is or the next richard branson it 's how do we then commercialize that how do we actually because the key for parramatta in western sydney is going to be not just the one richard branson how do we make 20 000 jobs off that how do we actually employ this region get it cracking and and i think where you guys have started is pretty awesome money doesn 't start from firms it starts from individuals and from individuals who have ideas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow that here i like your ideas hi everyone how fortunate we all are to be part of this great forum the very first of its kind i 'm sure you all have a fantastic day and come forward with some great ideas to benefit this great city of parramatta as you know i am 17 years old and represented australia in athletics at the 2012 paralympics there were many highlights along the way i loved training competing and meeting new people and of course traveling however having said that the road to london was certainly not easy i overcame these challenges um with sheer determination hard work and of course my love of sport i was really delighted to leave this wonderful group and my co-facilitators were absolutely brilliant i say that publicly to you and just a couple of comments that i say in passing there is only two speeds in this day and age now forget about it see that in the context of innovation and entrepreneurship i really mean that the second one is around innovation and entrepreneurship one of the beneficiaries in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a very positive attribute from what our department looked at today and the third and final thing relationships are a currency see that in the context of collaboration as a new management theory uh with regards to where innovation and entrepreneurship so the three takeouts for me and our wonderful group the one thing that i 'd say is the there is no chance that technology is going to solve all the issues and problems that are facing and opportunities that are being faced by parramatta congratulations to the mayor and this for facilitating this function today this place is a big responsibility on cognitive shoulders to act upon what we 've talked about today and i 'm sure you 're up for it the one thing that is certain though is that great civilizations have developed in this world of ours at times when the arts and industry and education have all collaborated together and i think we 'd all be encouraging the mayor and those who are taking leadership roles to step up and look at how we can facilitate that collaboration even more and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's responsibility to take that leadership role everybody in this room should walk away with a commitment to follow up about this whole exercise i 've been in this entire day and mayor congratulations and all the people that are here thank you so much and we want to congratulate you on your great achievements you 're truly an inspiration to me and many other people what you 've shown me is no one should win your life because just watching you what you 've been able to over overcome the challenges in your life look at you you 're a true champion you 're a winner and you 'll always be a winner for us that we are truly honored to have you with us today interesting so on behalf of the city just got a small gig a bunch of flowers and a small gift from our city to say thank you so much for being part of this you"

powerhouse museum discovered it amongst all the other photographs this german photographer took this beautiful photograph shows the bridge actually it 's the second bridge across the nepean river it 's not victoria bridge it 's before then in the early 1850s so this bridge was built by toby ryan who was a local businessman grandson of a convict who lived in the local area and so with along with some other businessmen they built this bridge because they knew with the gold rushes happening in the early 1850s that people needed to get across the river before then it was a punt and so it was just showing that the penrith area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1850s it was a small small community only a few hundred people actually lived in the village of penrith and so they were looking at how they would cross that river and get people over the mountains and to the gold fields so this bridge actually shows the the end bits of the first bridge that was built the middle section and the top bit of the second bridge that was built sadly the whole thing was washed away in a flood but you know what is there now it 's our walking bridge yandere that 's what it is is there in exactly the same spot so when you stand on that bridge today you can imagine this and when they built that bridge only a few years ago they found all the footings for this original bridge in the river so it 's a fantastic part of our history and so from this it 's people started to think about a local government for their for their area before then they had district councils which were too large they couldn 't force people to pay any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so but something something like this was the sort of thing that really started pushing the idea that people wanted to um look after their own local affairs in the 1860s along comes the railway and the railway was a huge impetus for the penrith area to really start looking at well you know we need to be governed locally there 's these big projects happening the railway came in 1863 and it stopped to penrith it couldn 't get over the river and so they the state government or the colonial government at that time thought well they had to build a railway bridge and so that would take a long time so the the railway finished in penrith and so all through the 1860s there was this movement of incorporation as a municipality so what happened the first the the first applications for that incorporation um was was rejected and so people in the outer lying areas were saying well you know what 's the benefit to us having a council that 's really only going to benefit the village of penrith which by then had about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge railway stopping there they had a terminus there they had lots of men come and work at the railway they were cleaning the engines they were putting water in they were putting coal into the steam trains and those trains were going backwards and forwards to sydney but everyone knew that at some point that a railway bridge would be built and then the railway line would extend across the blue mountains so the coming of the railway was a huge impetus for the local area okay so there was lots of opposition to municipal the incorporation of a municipality but by the late 1860s the colonial government had made some changes to the municipality act and even though the petition that uh that was put forward again in the late 1860s eve even though there was more opposition there were more people who signed that petition against incorporation the colonial government made the decision that penrith would become a municipality and so that occurred in may 1870 so then we get something like this beautiful little thing uh discovered in amongst all the council 's treasures and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early council which is the seal of the council signed by the first mayor so this is a beautiful little treasure that we have in the local studies room in the council in the library and so it 's an indication of the pride and success of that early council when munici the incorporation occurred it had to be created out of nothing so aldermen had to be elected and also rates had to be collected but before rates are collected people have to know how much they had to pay and so auditors had to go around to every property in the designated municipality of penrith and work out what the rate would be and so that rate book an assessment book was written up by hand by the one and only council employee and that was john price he was our local undertaker he was the local real estate agent uh he was the local um auditor uh and then he becomes and also he was the the local um funeral director and stonemason and pretty much everything else so he becomes the first employee so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's living on that property the street where it is so you 've got the street the occupier the leasi the owner and what is on that land and then it 's assessed for rates then um the rate is is assessed here so what happened back then the owner we would we 'll love this the owner in this very first page is jane woodruff she nev they never paid the owner never paid rates it 's the occupier who pays the rates and that happened all the way up to night around 1900 the owners never paid the rates unless you were living on your property so this very first book shows jane woodruff because penrith is settled on the woodruff estate a thousand acres it goes from woodruff street all the way down to the river from jemison road all the way up to the turn where where castle ray road uh in the big roundabout where the rowers are at the roundabout on castle ray road and so all of these occupiers and leases of that land really tell us the story of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture and so when i wrote the history of penrith i could build up a story about who was living here how long they were living what kind of properties they were living on whether the house was a slab house whether it was made of brick what kind whether it was a shop you know all of those details are all here in this rate book and so penrith council and the library hold every single book from 1871 of this what we call an assessment book and the rate book that goes with it so it 's the most wonderful archive of our history penrith council started getting money to spend and they had one employee of course for a very long time and um but over the years the odd employees you know they started to get a few more and then um but most of the work was done by day laborers so john price would start to sort of um work out how much money they had and then the aldermen would split themselves up into they had a works committee they had a finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work had to be done around the local area so they took over the road trusts and so they started working on um you know we all know about the whole the the um the the saying about what uh councils are all about with the roads rates and rubbish and that 's kind of what it was it was all about fixing the roads and maintaining the roads it was making sure everyone got rid of their rubbish and and kept the place tidy and healthy and and then for the council to do that they needed people to pay those rates and so by the um early 1880s they felt like they were confident enough to build themselves a council chambers so the council chambers just had a couple of rooms at the back but one big meeting room in the middle and so this is a photo taken in the 1920s of the of the council chambers so up the top it says who the mayor was so um it was alfred collis who just happened to run the nepean times newspaper and so the library is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nepean times newspaper from the nepean times office so alfred collis established that newspaper and uh he was the mayor at the time when they built the council chambers so what um the other thing that we have related to the council chambers we 've actually got the specifications for the building this blows me away um and you know all the details about um how this this um this building was to be constructed or all the details so the builder was thomas clissold and he was a well-known local man and builder later on in its life um the council rented it out to the school across the road and so the school students uh is particularly the girls uh at the school across the road um they were they would go in there and have their classes because this building is next to it was next to the old library by the um late 1880s the council was um interested in improving the local area and they were concerned about uh clean water and they were concerned about uh how people um lit their homes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in the 1880s they looked at elect this new form of lighting called electricity and so it was a very very bold move on their part they went around the state and they had a look at electric lighting now it was a bit of a struggle between the ego electric or diego gas at that time and so penrith council thought no electricity was the way to go they were the third local government area to install electricity in new south wales so it 's a very very significant thing on their part and so this building here is the electric station that was in bill moore street in penrith near the royal near the railway station and we 've got lucky that we 've got this wonderful photo inside the building so but it was a huge financial drain for the council and did they know or didn 't they know that a terrible economic depression was about to hit the whole country or all of the all of the colonies at that time they made a huge investment and um even though there were financial concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was an extremely proud moment when um this building was opened in the 1890s in 1890 this is the trail that was used to lay the foundation stone for this building on the 30th of april 1890 and it was laid by the lady mariss at the time mrs smith and she she was given the trowel she turned the you know the sod or whatever she did with it and then um and then the family kept it even though it was kind of part of penrith council 's archive but luckily for us the family uh only a few years ago um donated it back to the council and to the library so we 're very fortunate to have it and it 's a wonderful thing that you can feel and touch and know that it was really you know absolutely part of our history now at the same time that this was done that electric power was turned on at um penrith they also decided to run a water supply from the river uh through pipes all the way up the main street so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lay the pipes and then out to as many homes as they they could that that could afford it and so um again these two huge um uh activities that the council decided was important for the health and safety of the local community was the most massive drain on a financial drain on the council so along with the economic depression penrith council was in dire straits couldn 't pay the loans off couldn 't pay anything off and then went to the colonial government and saying uh we 're broke uh what do we do so um the of government stepped in um looked after the loans took care of that and also with some local people helping penrith council out they struggled they struggled on they were very fortunate in the early 1900s to have a wonderful new town clerk um employed and his name was ernie orth he was only in his 20s and through much opposition from some of the councillors he was employed and he dragged penrith council out of that financial mire and it took him about 20 years to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1930s and penrith council is all you know just starting to sort of come out and be um a bit more financially well-off this is an image of um the high street uh taken in the early 1900s i guess we have we can see the landscape changing by these um electricity poles here still horse and cars everywhere there 's of course there 's no motor cars or anything like that dirt road still so whenever it rained it become a bit of a bog but by the 1930s this road is sealed and so it was a big construction um a big construction on the part of the state government to seal to seal this main this main road because really high street is the great western highway and so back then there was no you know side streets or anything like that the to take you around high street you just went straight down the main street and so penrith is very fortunate to have retained the all the facades that are still there today penrith was able to um with the help of the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression they were financially supported by those two governments to help the local community and so they were able to provide work for a lot of unemployed men and women in the local area but also the munitions factory was constructed at st mary 's which also gave employment to a lot of local people and in particular women who especially during the second world war it was the women who went to work at the munitions factory getting close to the end of the war the state government was real had really been thinking about um local government and how it was being run in in right throughout the state and they believed that they had too many council areas and so from maybe the 1930s they started looking at ways to reduce the number of councils local government areas in the state and so they started promoting the idea that castle ray council saint mary 's council and the nepean shire should amalgamate with penrith to become penrith municipal council a big penrith municipal council and it 's the local government area that we know of today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has had caused a huge amount of angst by um the people and the councillors who worked in those other council areas and so there was nothing but discussions from the particularly from the uh late 1930s and all through the war time period and str and particularly straight after that when the war finished about the amalgamation how these councils would amalgamate who they would amalgamate with and so um casaray and napan shire were kind of okay because they knew that it was they were struggling and they knew it was hard um to to to continue the way they were and everyone did look to penrith they ever it was the bigger town and so um that was that was the place that 's where the courthouse was that 's where the larger administrative and commercial areas were saint mary 's council had a different idea they they were much more based on uh industry they had the munitions factory there and so they were supported by the federal government to create a huge city the city of saint mary 's but what the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and often they don 't talk to each other and so uh who won well of course the state government won and so they created the municipality of penrose and everyone had to come in line with that there was great discussions about where the council council chambers would be established but the state government said no it 's staying where it is in penrith there was also discussion about the name oh should we call it nepean should we call it um some other name or they they started coming up with all these different names about how they would call this new municipality the state government stepped in and said no you 're calling it penrith and that 's it and so you know a lot of us look at our history and say oh you know we made this decision or that decision often it is the state government or the colonial government that had been making these decisions all along and so we need to be mindful of that and the way um the bigger picture decisions are made by state governments uh and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same that that is what happened to to the penrith area and so now today we um we were celebrating uh penrith as a city but that includes castle ray and emu plains and molgoa and saint mary 's and north st mary 's and colleton and erskine park and saint clair all of those areas are part of penrith city but as part of the um the changes that were happening in the 1940s a wonderful person by the name of oswald ziegler contacted council and said hey i 've got a great promotional idea after the war we need to promote and tell everybody about how wonderful this place is and we would like to promote and um tell people about um penrith would you like to uh spend some money and buy some books i 've got i 've got an idea and so this little booklet came out it 's a one it 's just a wonderful wonderful story the the words were written um by with the help of a local historian the photographs were taken by max dupayne and they were very artistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy by the way they were sort of you know shaped and everything but anyway so this little booklet came out and you know what we we still have them so which is fantastic um and it 's what it really is uh tells the story of our history from the late 1840s and in 50 1950s the other thing that happened when the amalgamation occurred was the fact that a lot of businesses contacted councils that had been amalgamated and they said well you need a logo and you need robes town clark robes and you need all sorts of things and so penrith council went out and spent some money and so this is their their crest that they created a lot of people think that it was created way back when we become a municipality in 1871 but that 's not the case it was in the 1950s and so they recognized the aboriginal original owners and but they also recognized the white settlement and the dungaree farmer and they and they looked at the industries that were in the local area and so this this seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official occasions the other thing that happened they said town clark needed new robes so he got new robes and he got a wig to wear on all the ceremonial occasions and so you 'll see in a lot of the photographs that the library hold of all the major celebrations the count town clerk is dressed in his robes which are on display in the library um and will are always in the the library 's research room but the this is his wig as well and so it sits in this gorgeous box and so it was it came all the way from london of course henry 's council in the 1950s realized that it was growing rapidly new immigrants were coming working in the local area setting up business and penrith council started thinking about well what does it mean uh to be a city and what do we have to do to become a city and so they thought well we 'd better find out and so they wrote a letter and they got a response and here 's the response 13th of november 1959 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his excellency the governor and executive council have approved of the issue of a proclamation giving effect to the application by penrith municipal council for the declaration of the municipality as a city under the provisions of the local government act 1919 and so here 's the nice little letter that 's come in from parliament uh and often um we get asked in the library um where 's our evidence um where 's our our you know big problem proclamation or or where 's the big piece of paper or the seal or something to prove that we 're a city and i say well this letter and um it 's in the government gazette that 's it all of a sudden you 're all of a sudden you 're a city and so um at the same time they thought well if we 're going to become a city then we need to have a new civic center and so they very proudly built their civic center with um not a huge budget i must say but built on the corner here of um station street and henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and also you can see in this photograph it 's still a dirt road at the end of 1959 moving from the old council chambers down henry street into the new civic centre on the corner of henry street and station street and they had some huge celebrations this is a photograph an aerial photograph of emu planes uh taken in the 1950s and you can see look at this these beautiful orchards um the main the main road there is melrose hall built in the 1930s and so and here 's the great western highway here and turning all the way up going all the way up and it follows all the way up the mountains and so this area here this square is emu park and that is exactly how it is today it 's the park for everyone in the in that emu planes community to enjoy and boy do they enjoy it it 's it 's just packed full of people all the time this square which is as i said emu park is exactly the same as what was on the convict farm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate to all the paddocks that were on the convict farm that was built in the 18 established in the 1820s and so emu plains you know filled with orchards then was become filled with houses and so it 's a huge housing estate now it 's not only emu planes there 's emu heights and lione that are part of that so in 1963 of course emu plains then moves across to penrith council it 's where i live and so but we always feel like we 're just a little bit different on the other side of the river um the other nice thing if you pay your house insurance it 's we 're in the country by the way uh over the river and uh so but it 's just re it is nice that emu planes who always thought they were part of penrith anyway could never really come to terms with the idea that they 're part of blue mountains council because they were so far away from everything so far away from the the seat of government which was at ketumba and so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains they were always part of penrith right back from the first settlement and when it became a convict farm they were always connected to penrith convicts when they 're in trouble they went to penrith courthouse the convicts when they were assigned they all went around the nepean area and were assigned the convicts traded with local people they swam across the river and then they swam back to the convict farm so life must have been reasonably good on on at emu planes now this photograph was taken in the late 1960s early 70s and it 's one of those ones that say like a 180 photograph taken from the tower tower that 's in the railway station and it looks across to what we now know as jane street but jane street isn 't quite isn 't quite there car park is here for the railway station the red cow is here and the burrick house is being constructed and there was this huge empty space which is now filled up by penrith plaza over here is the construction of the very first penrith square they called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penrith and way over here in this little corner is where the civic centre is today but this one here has just grown and grown and grown it 's like a city in there so it takes up all this space here and now it takes up all this space here and so it is um sort of like a shopping center beacon of light in um our our outer you know western sydney area and from that it then other shopping centers developed in other areas come along to oh 1971 gosh a hundred years of local government and boy did they celebrate they celebrated like we have never celebrated ever again they spent everything on creating a wonderful memory of our of our city and the booklet that goes with it written by local historians at the time thousands of photographs that are now in um in the local archive at the library and so they had [Music] they had sporting matches they had street parades they had a ball they had an art competition everything that you could think of they celebrated at this these events in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of this walking bridge it is going it 's it actually um says a lot about the confidence from the state government in the local area there 's been lots of changes lots of um strategy about um penrith becoming like a you know regional city in the in the sydney um lo in the sydney area but the investment by the state government in this bridge and we know for the future the investment for uh the at the airport and um the changes that have been made with more people coming into into the city it it 's sad in some ways by a lot of a lot of us who have lived here a reasonable amount of time would be thinking um yeah we 're kind of losing that country feel um we 've always wanted to be a city but we 've always been like more like a big country town so this this iconic construction um kind of is the um it sort of reflects what the future is going to be"

    "text": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] well good morning and welcome my name is craig werner i 'm the president of the nepean district historical society and today we 're celebrating the 150th anniversary of penrith council now we would be doing this live but unfortunately covert 19 has conspired against us so we 're doing it in a different format so hopefully i 'll be able to anticipate the questions that you would normally be able to ask me live and throw those into this presentation so today penrith is a thriving metropolis it 's located 51 kilometers or 31 miles west of sydney and it was actually in the federal division of lindsay which was named after norman albert lindsay who died in 1969 he was a prominent painter he was a novelist and he was also an artist and he was most famous for creating the magic pudding now if we go back to the very beginnings of penrith you have to go back to 1789 and captain watkin tench was exploring the nepean river with an aboriginal guide and he came across a section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thames at putney and that then became the basis for where penrith was established so macquarie had set aside 10 towns penrith unfortunately was not one of those towns but five of those towns now reside within the penrith lga now it took a while for um penndot to become established even after it was discovered so the first land grants in penrith weren 't actually until 1803 and the land grants were two fairly prominent land holders around the area including marines and free settlers now prior to that penrith had a prison farm at emu plains that had been there since around 1813 and that farm prison farm still continues to operate today although it 's actually now a women 's farm so we have a sketch looking down from the hills above looking down across the plains and you can actually see the prison farm in the background so now one of the things that the prison farm was fairly good for because the land is very fertile along the plains of the nepean river they were actually growing food at the prison farm to help sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear in mind that when they came to australia they brought lovely english wet weather crops to a very dry arid climate and unfortunately in the early stages of the colony they were actually starving so by the time they started working with the local aboriginals they worked out what would grow what wouldn 't grow and windsor and penrith became major food bowls for the rest of the colony now the oldest church in the area is actually saint paul 's which was part of the prison farm and it 's the oldest church in the nepean area so in 1813 blackstone lawson and wentworth were the first people to actually discover a serviceable route over the blue mountains and onto the plains at bathurst and then a year later macquarie instructed them to actually begin construction of a road but these these three men were actually given land grants at south creek for establishing that roadway and for surveying it so governor macquarie on the 14th of july 1814 asked his friend william cox to establish a road from penrith across the blue mountains and he was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eight soldiers and yourself are required and your services forthwith so the secondly the road must be at least 12 foot wide as to permit two carts to pass each other the timber in the forest is to be ground and cleared away 20 foot wide and all holes are to be filled or completely eliminated to allow passing without difficulty or damage to the carriages now if you go back and you look today you can still actually see parts of the road if you walk up over the mountains you can see the trails that were actually cut into the stone because they did have a number of stone cutters with them and as you get further onto the planes you can actually see the old roads most of it though unfortunately today is on private property now penrith started to become more established so in 1817 penrith was deemed large enough to actually have its own courthouse now the courthouse that they first built was actually in high street and would be today opposite nicholas of myra where the current police station is years later it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the police station moved to high street so they basically swapped positions now penrith continued to grow over the years so in 1828 it got its first dedicated post office and alexander fraser took up the post on the 8th of march in 1828 since stephen 's church the stones began laying for those in around 1837 and that still stands as an iconic structure at the top of high street today of course so when you go to church on sunday it 's a little bit different back then than it is today so you would get dressed in your finest and you would take your sulky out and hop on board and down to the church in your sunday salty they called it so for those that were fairly affluent they would normally have two carts on the farm the sulky which was very lightweight and the one that they used to take to the church on sunday and then they had a spring cart which would today 's be equivalent of the ute to use around the farm so for the heavier work obviously now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the first hospital or penrith cottage hospital was established today if you go and look at the officeworks site in high street that is where it used to be the original cottage hospital then moved over to lemongrave and became governor phillip special hospital and that was built in around 1895. now today they 've retained a couple of things in the governor phillips special hospital and for those of you with a keen eye if you look at the top of the main tower at the front of the building you 'll see a wind chime and if you don 't know take a really good look because when the wind catches it at a certain angle you 'll actually see it 's a replica of the endeavour 1862 westpac comes to penrith or back in the old days the bank of new south wales so came along and now we had banking for the masses of course penrith continued to grow and at this stage in 1852 toby ryan decided that it was time to have a permanent bridge going from penrith to emu plain so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the property called emu hall which is just on the emu plains side of the victoria bridge now running up the side of his place is a street called punt lane and that 's where they used to run the punts from there across to where the old log cabin was now they also used to be a small island there um when they originally set it up probably no more than two meters by two meters unfortunately there were a number of floods over the years and that has subsequently washed away but what they did was they set up a company called the penrith nepean bridge company and they would charge you a toll depending on what you were taking across so for every person crossing the bridge it was one pence and for vehicles with two wheels four pence but you could only be charged once a day that was their regulations now penrith continued to expand and of course the rail line was extended in 1863 to penrith itself and if you have a look at the penrith rail yard today they actually do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the coal shoots around so that they could head back up to sydney unfortunately though by this time the first bridge across the nepean river had been washed away they had built a second bridge in 1859 unfortunately though the same thing happened it got washed away so they shot the engineer for being careless not really but they were tempted to so what they did was they actually called in a proper engineer the same gentleman who actually built the brooklyn bridge just north of hornsby and he came in and he took one look at the property and went there 's your problem you 're sitting your peers on top of clay and of course the clay is not stable so what happens is when the water comes down bang it just washes it away and if you 're an intrepid explorer and you like to go to the downside of the weir at penrith have a look in the heat on the bottom of the river and you may even discover one of the timber joists that held up the original bridges now they began construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got those high sides on it now the high sides were kept there for one reason and that was to prevent anything falling into the water and also to protect the trains that used to go over that bridge because at that point you had a dual bridge so it was running a rail line and it was also running traffic um and by the way some people think there 's a rumor going around that they lost one of those side pieces and they had to pinch one from russia not correct they actually got all them they ended up having to get a replacement for one that was lost at sea but they didn 't actually take it from russia now in 1870 you had now all the traffic coming over the blue mountains and they were bringing stock across so they had huge bullock trains and the bullock trains themselves would be as tall as i am and probably 5 to 10 meters in length and they would weigh several tons they would have anywhere up to 14 to 18 bullocks or clydesdales pulling these enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons are not like your modern wagons where you can just step on the break so what they did because they had very large families because you can 't afford to hire labour so you grow all your own labor and they take the smallest child and they 'd sit him right on the very top so one of these wagons could hold 120 bales of wheat or hay so they 'd have the child sit up the very top and he would then have one of his brothers standing at the front wheel and one brother standing at the back wheel and they have hand crank brakes so as they 're coming to a rise in the road the youngest brother would say going up and then they 'd apply a little bit of pressure so that it didn 't get dragged and as they were coming down the right the dips they would apply a little bit more pressure so the wagons wouldn 't run away and obviously run over the bullocks or the clydesdales that they had so that was one of their jobs so everybody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipality and james riley becomes the first mayor of penrith and that was from 1871 to 1874. now the name penrith actually comes from a town called penrith in cumbria and it actually means chief or head forward now it was the main crossing point of the nepean river so that 's how the name penrith came to be chosen as the name of the municipality for those of you that ever went to penrith high school you would know that there 's a magazine called the towers well the towers was actually a property that was built back in 1880 on the exact site of the high school and later converted for use as a high school it stood there abandoned for many years but it was then re-tasked and obviously turned into the high school now in 1890 penrith got lucky they became the third city outside sydney after tamworth and young to get electricity to the entire town now business continued to expand and what they were doing was that they 've now decided they needed a dedicated rail bridge because at the moment we 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting busier obviously as penrith becomes a bustling metropolis now so in 1907 they began construction of a dedicated rail bridge and that was then completed in 1908 now in the 1920s penrith high street continued growing and if you were out walking around you would see vendor horse-drawn wagons everywhere so everything from the grocer to the milkman to the butcher to the baker would all have their little carts going around penrith delivering your goods so back to the day and covert has now forced this on us of home delivery so we 've gone backwards so we 've gone from home delivery to pick it up yourself and now back to home delivery all in the space of 90 100 years 101 years this year so now they had a number of different businesses in pendleton so you get everything that you could imagine you could come into penrith and you could get your horse shoes replaced you could get glass cut you could even go to your taverns and pubs you could go to your produce markets and all of those things were now available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow and initially the road was all dirt all the way down now when they first laid the water pipes in penrith they 'd actually laid them under the roadway and the water pipes that they laid were actually made from wood and sealed with tar so from time to time if they sprang a leak you 'd have these dirty great puddles up high street and of course now penrith is growing they were looking at trying to solve this issue so eventually in about 1932 they actually moved the pipes under the sidewalk and used ceramic based pipes for those the other thing too is that if you ever stroll down high street take a look from one side of the street across to the other and look above the awnings and you can still see some of the old facades on the buildings right up high street from [Music] the corner of castle race street all the way down if you look on both sides you can still see those old facades in fact some of the buildings have still survived and if you go right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park is there you can actually see if you stand on the penrith westfield side and you look across to the other side you can actually see the scroll work above the awnings on the street so just something to have a look at next time you 're strolling through penrith now obviously penrith continued to grow and the australian arms hotel on the corner of evans street and high street had been established and it also had accommodation now it 's still there today but it 's slightly modified in appearance back in the 1920s it actually had timber facades around the top and you could actually stand out on the top deck and look over penrith while you were sitting drinking enjoying yourself the other thing too is that you can continue looking down at the major intersections and you can see the changes that have happened over quite a number of years the other thing too is that because we now have the rail line to penrith penrith now became a tourist destination and a lot of sydney siders would come out to penrith and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wallacia where there were quite a number of guest houses and they would have their relaxing weekend or they would take the week out now there 's two ways they could go there was a bus that would take you out to alatia or you could take a standard boat which is basically a very very long wide boat with a single motor at the back steered by a giant arm and it had covers across the top so you could take those back and forth from where the rowing club is right up to wallachia now in 1929 penrith got its first dedicated ambulance station not in the location that it 's down at opposite the tennis courts it was pre-dating where it was put into the tennis courts there so now people continued to come to penrith and the weir was a popular attraction so in 1934 you would start to see all these people in their neck to knee bathers of course you had to be conservative there was no two-piece swimsuits back then it was neck to knee or out you go so we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the rowing club so that they could then go and sit on the wall of the weir and enjoy the sun dip their feet in the water have a good time and in the background you can see the bridges as well so but penrith continued to expand and became a very sporting community so everything from the penrith waratahs football club the penrith golf club that we used to meet at thornton hall and the nepean district cricket association and in penrith we have the hal oval which was actually named after the first international cricketer george hal who was raised in penrith the other thing we also had was a speedway so in 1925 you could go to the penrith motor speedway carnival and they had all of the latest cars racing around on these speedways with spectators watching the latest vehicles that have just come out now the speedway was located on the far side of penrith also on the north side of penrith um where the army land used to be the other thing that people don 't realize is that penrith actually had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north army land side of penrith and these were set up after the first world war as a precaution emu planes also had an airstrip as well and they were trying to make as many of these around the place as possible so that if anything happened they had places where they could park their planes away from the main bases if they ever came under attack now businesses in penrith continued to grow and one of the biggest businesses in penrith was the penrith combs cordial factory now it had been running for 53 years in 1920 and it 's located on station street today where the senior citizen center would be so unfortunately it didn 't survive into the modern era but it did provide cordials for over 60 years to penrith so now the other thing too is that penrith had its own newspaper so from 1882 to 1962 the nepean times would bring you all the current news and the ads that came with it they had reporters going around and looking up and filling this newspaper so that you could buy those newspapers and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the carriages to come from sydney and get your news two to three months later you could now get it fairly quickly now by 1940 [Music] horses and carts basically had vanished and they were being replaced systematically by the automobile so if you look at high street in the 1940s you will rarely see a horse-drawn wagon but you will see lots of different cars coming through now also in 1932 memorial park got an update as well and it was upgraded from the original one that was built in 1922 and they put in these new covered walkways and the palms all went in as well around there so people could come in sit there and then you would have the memorials so that people could reflect on those situations now it 's obviously been updated over the years and today we have a more modernized version but again it still retains those parks with all those names from the people of penrith now in 1940 penrith gets its new fire station it 's a solid brick construction and it 's designed to be fairly sturdy because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you bit of a problem there if it does then it was modernized again about 15 years ago and it 's the still fire station you see today on the opposite corner from officeworks [Applause] now in the 1970s we had the penrith plaza and for those of you that remember shopping then back in those days it was a single level very laid out take you five hours to walk around it and loads of shops but over the years it expanded and continued and today we have a two-story monolith called westfield but originally it started out as a single story so again progress more shops more opportunities to buy now in 1958 penrith council chambers were located on the corner of station street and henry street in 1993 penrith council decided that they need something a bit larger to take themselves into the future and they purchased a site at the bottom end of high street and so from 1993 through to the present day penrith has operated from its brand new facility that is at the bottom end of high street now the other thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well eventually that was swallowed up by the westfield shopping complex and westfield went from being on one block to two blocks to basically three blocks wide now the other thing that i 've also given you here to have a look at is some of the ads from yesteryear so some of the things that you would have seen in the nepean times or ads for watches jewelry um tourist if you want to go to england what trains to catch pioneers commonwealth savings bank the great australian bank and also for those of you that are interested kodak cameras the old box brownie type also there were some ads for the guest houses that were here in penrith including huntington hall which is on nepean road and also pioneer motor tours of australia so that sort of gives you a bit of background on the history of penrith so i hope that that 's sort of helped you to understand a little bit about where penrith has come from so we 've come from having five or six land grants of large size to now having over 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thank you very much and i hope you enjoyed the presentation you"

in every yard we played in a yard we played in the women of the house gave the orders and supplied the drinks and and made the rules and the only rule for my parents was to be home when the street lights came on the bottom end of vladv and nepean avenue ran onto market gardens and some of the mums earned a bit of money picking peas and beans in the season two characters stand out in my memory one we call count omar he owned one of the first boats that cruised uh up the nepean river forerunner to the nepean belly and he lived in memorial avenue he had a beautiful clipped white beard and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vintage open-topped car the other man was called we called the dutchman he owns a home next to peachtree creek which became the first headquarters for the um penrith tennis club he had a smart sulky and kept a horse and drove into penis in the sulky uh horses with the horse and sulky probably the last person to do that bonfire night was the highlight of the year my friend 's father who had a garage where the clearwater motel is now owned the lands from weir road to peachtree creek peachtree creek which is now a park and he allowed the children of the area to build bonfires and he kindly supplies tyres to get it started one year a neighbor called out to someone and littered early so we all grabbed our crackers and got the night underway my favorite bonfire in teenage years just before they were banned was out at mccall 's warehouse in regentsville road graham mccoll was in the presbyterian fellowship in penitent and hosted the event his mother provided big boilers of spaghetti bolognese important things in my youth were libraries now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the uh old school of arts it 's um which is now the home of the university of the age and then in 1964 a new building opened on the corner of lawson and henry street and the library was there for 30 years the present one in 1994 opened and has been extended and remodeled since then and has become a hub with modern computer systems learning all supplied by the council tennis the court at the school of arts was opened in 1933 1952 saw the park the tennis court in judges park which is just the back of high street the girls played in private tennis courts in the town when we were in high school the boys used the council courts at judges park there was a big difference now in the number of courts if i took you on a little walk down high street in the 50s i would have two courts at st stevens church two courts at uh the miss ingle elves who have both owned fashion shops one on each side of high street and competed against each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor yurin had kurt courts behind his place we then had the woodruff courts mrs neal had one up on dunmore street uh and there was a lot of private courts now in pennsylvania there 's only the council courts probably because the price of lands got so high paul i learned to swim at the where you have to remember there was no pool in penrith so the primary school children were bussed down to the weir the main teachers were mrs done for the girls and arthur street was in charge of the boys and i remember my first instruction hold on to a rock and kick and that 's how we learned to swim now there was a little diving plant that someone had put there i don 't mean a big tower i mean built up on a small pair of bricks and the plank out what visitors didn 't know and us local kids did was if you jumped off one side you 're in two foot of water if you jumped off the other you were in six foot of water so guess which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular swimming hole which was washed away in the floods was opposite the rowing club it was called little manly had a lovely sandy beach front into the water and all the beautiful trees at the back made lovely shades for picnics you 'd get up to 200 people there at the weekends unfortunately it was washed with the sand and everything was washed away in the flood and that was the end of little manly as a swimming area in 1961 62 we got the pen of pool opened which was great for the schools and carnivals because before then the high school used to have to use cooksons which was a private pool at one of the factories rowing you can 't talk about penrith and not talk about rowing it 's if you go overseas it 's the thing most people know the town for that had our football team the first roof corded boat race was in the early 1850s but the one that most people talk about when australian oarsman william beach challenged the current world champion edward hanlon from canada for the championship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delight of the local crowd beach won by three quarters of a length with the fastest time on record the winner received prize money of 400 pounds and a reception the following week which was held in the town hall in sydney now this explains why we have a beach street in emu plains penrith rowing club was able to stage um its first annual event in that year clubs went and came its most important one was the famous king cup was run here when the fate of the club seemed dire in the mid-1930s the announcement that the empire games now known as the commonwealth games was to be rowed on the european river in 1938 and that gave a huge boost to the club and the interest in rowing penra 's first olympic role was max annette one of the cox four teams which finished fifth at the rome olympics in 1960 since then the depth of rowing progress has highlighted by the club 's success in major competitions the prestigious king 's cup an interstate competition of eight irishmen uh was rode several times from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 to 2000 metres the annual gps head of the river competition between sydney private schools was also road on the river for many years in recent times it 's moved to penrith lakes and is now held at the newly opened sydney international rowing regatta center on gps days my father allowed me to park cars in the yard greatly improving my financial status it was a great day buses came from all the major sydney schools and there was a dance held at the long carbon afterwards and up to 40 000 people lined the banks european theatre provided great entertainments in the 50s and 60s i went to the saturday matinees which included a cereal a cartoon and two movies um on if i was lucky on saturday night my father had booked a book to go to the night sessions they were that popular you had to book um now churches most families in the 50s attended church myself included i went to the presbyterian sunday school and most of them had fellowships and girls and men 's clubs they also usually ran teams in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penrith churches is a bit interesting the land for the presbyterian church the methodist church the church of england the catholic church were all given by one man he said if you give land to one church everybody would be upset so he gave the land for all the churches which was a huge boost q theater when did the q theater opened it officially opened in 1977 and it was held in the old hall and it was opened by doreen warburton her she was brought from sydney to start a theater in penrith um and then in the q theatre moved to the jones sutherland in 2005. my mother and i loved the old cue theatre she was friends with dorian warburton who lived in a house supplied by the log cabin in memorial avenue as part of the package to lure her to penrith she had a lovely collie dog which she brought past our home now if we go on to the joan savilin center was opened in 1990 by mayor of penrith brian king and dr malcolm borland now malcolm borland who was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving force in getting the john sutherland built in penrith so he was deserved to be in the opening party in 2005 the theater was extended the only thing that shows what was there before is a row of gum trees on the outside of the uh joan sutherland center which is the driveway into the council it is a large row of white gum trees they used to lie in the football field of what was then penrith 's rough barracks complete with a guard on the front gate in high street and the women 's barracks they hosted a lot of football games and things and i used to watch my husband play on that field and then we were hosted at a barbecue at the sergeant 's mess afterwards they were very much part of the community i remember steam trains running and going to sydney with my mother who always wore hat and gloves i especially enjoyed going christmas holidays to see the highly decorated sydney shops people used to pick up coal which fell off the tracks you 've got to remember that in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingswood and adamia plains because there just wasn 't a volume of traffic that would warranty bridges in 1862 the first plane train to panels was reputed to have been driven by john herron then there 's a well-known commuter train running now in his name the train terminated at parker street before the station was built the first electric train ran in penrith in 1953 and state rail had extended the station to meet the present-day needs panas show was more agricultural than the present one you have to remember the district was all farms and so you had displays of produce farm animals and lots of horse competitions it was held in february it usually rained and the ground was so boggy that some people wore gum boots one attracts attraction was the boxing tent where the local boys tried their luck against max brophy 's boys penrith at that time effectively ended at jemison road south side being small poultry farms trotting stables and small orchards castle ray where i lived when i was six was mostly farm land and orchards the farm that i live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we first moved to pendleton during the 50s i remember mrs carter who had a peach orchard at carl 's array where the crane enfields factory is now used to come around in an old truck hulking buckets of peaches dr morris renshaw lived in nepean avenue and had a small night surgery a couple of days a week for the locals he bought a farm which is now peachtree estate and would talk to my father for hours on the best way of doing things emu planes were dairy farms and orchards and the orchard has planted bitter oranges along the fence to deter us kids and the famous imperial mandarine was propagated here split up in the early 70s for housing and light industry it now has a great shopping area in lenox which was built on the site of the so-called government house a relic from when emu was operated until 1812 as a convict farm the prison farm was part of the area and often donated fruit and vegetables to fates in penrith kingswood had vineyards and sawmills now it is the important home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all situated in kingswood molgoa i lived there when i was five and started school walking from the farm called mount henry which is now a horse assessment honey producer fantastic views from the home it was it was mostly dairy farms which unfortunately now are all closed and probably the biggest thing we 're going to remember mulgo for the future is the beautiful cox homes fair light being one of them which is being opened up very shortly as a big tourist center my first panera school was actually it 's actually heritage listed because it was built in 1894 and now i didn 't go there then the creek running through the grounds was called typhoid creek uh it was so polluted it combined with high school primary school in 1991. um when i went to the school in the 50s girls were upstairs because we were all but well behaved and had lady teachers the boys were downstairs with men teachers and the playground was segregated by a white short mark the school had a brown yellow and white uniform which changed to red white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people why penrith panthers first strip was brown and white because they took it from the school colours and that of course has changed to i think the favorite one now is licorice with all the colours penrith high school stands on the site of the towers dr barber built the imposing facade onto the old hornsbywood residence taliga murray but the town referred to it as the towers the only thing remaining of that is two posts which are set up in the garden at the front entrance of the high school when my sister was going to tafe in the early 50s you had to go to granville but in 1953 a tafe happened in penrose which was a huge help classes for women were held in the railway institute and the actual building opened in 1961 with provisions for 2 000 students by 1980 the number of students enrolled had doubled and now about 5 000 students at ten courses the college is part

local men who died in the second world war and in the korea and vietnam wars their names were added to the memorial and that was in unveiled in 1989 it was remodeled again in both 2005 and 2008 the remodeling was brought about mostly to include the nurses in the from the first world war um their names of the second world war then the names from vietnam and afghanistan so they all now include judges park judges park back of high street shops was once the town tip it was unsuitable for tennis unsuitable for building um and had the first tennis courts built on it woodruff gardens woodruff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daniel woodruff rn and now part of that grant i found that my home which i grew up in which was the last house in high street 706 high street was part was built on the old woodruff grant i found out this information by going through the files at the penrith library with the help of the marvel marvelous council girls so i can take that house right back to the first land grant now the gardens which were named after him on the other side of high street with woodruff gardens now has the new tennis courts it was years known as chinaman 's garden because it was operated as a mark and garden jamison park was named after thomas jamison who was a granted a thousand acres by governor king the ground is used by local sporting groups everything from netball to soccer to basketball uh use area and extremely popular it is has been upgraded with a new playground nest swings pod spinners rubber flooring as well as paths suitable for children to bike bikes and scooters so it 's and it also has a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born although there had been a racing track at the current pin of paceways 1920s harness racing didn 't officially begin until that day when the first registered meeting was held a special act of parliament was enacted to place penrif outside the 30 mile 48 kilometer limit that was in force at the time and had prevented a license being granted to city now local people will tell you a story they say that dr renshaw 's brother who was then the premier organised that the measurers went three times around the town hall to get the right measurements in sydney giving us the right distance away to have our licence uh it also became a greyhound track and it now holds weekly markets on a wednesday um it has a lovely cafeteria and is a big plus to the penrith area local government in penis began with the formation of the district councils in 1843 in prep incorporation of the town of penrith was followed by saint mary 's castle ray molga and the nepean solo 1949 all these local government authorities amalgamated to form panerai 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared a city 25th of october 1963 emu plains emmy heights and leone joined the blue mountains council with the promise of water and sewage been given to local residents the land was split up in the 70s the site for the museum was supposed to be split up and the council and a few prominent residents said that we had to keep something of the old emu so they decided that the land and the inn which has now become the museum was gifted by the developers to the people of penrif after a lengthy court case when you talk about hunter 's field that was donated by hunter who was a well-known orchardist in the area therefore we have hunter 's field duke 's oval very interesting duke 's very prominent in the area very large family at one stage the emu cricket team had 11 juices so uh it was fitting that the cricket ground is named duke 's oval not a cheerful subject but recognition has to be given to the council for its care of the cemeteries in the area including the historical ones like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now owned by the council since stevens said thomas is at mulga which all kept in good order now we talk about towns we have to talk about fires our first station was built in 1907 and opened in 1908 the volunteer brigade was formed in 1895 with horse-drawn wagons but was mechanic mechanized in 1920 and rebuilt in 1983. traffic lights i got my license when i was 19. i was a teenage driver for one week and we had one traffic light in penrith at the time and i would love to tell ask people where it was the correct answer is parker street on the northern road and one of the things that you had to do when you 're getting your license at that day it had to be on a manual car and one of the favorite testing places was where hill which at that time was an open road which had a lovely slant to it and you had to do a stop start on where hill to get your license um one of the things that is now missing from penrith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police box is it was somewhere that the police who were on bikes and things could stop in have a cup of tea go the toilets do their office work had a garage to put their vehicles in and on the outside it had a phone which the local public could pick up and go straight to the police station this of course was absolute irresistible to the local children who just had to pick up the phone and wait for the sergeant to say burn or blue station here drop it and run like that it was a very useful little building and at one stage was used for taking licenses from the local motorcycle cops as i call them used to have their bikes behind it and as the cars went down high street the highway over to go over victoria bridge if they were doing anything wrong outward with the the policeman waving to my dad on the veranda as he went so the police box was a very interesting little building unfortunately in the 70s a man was coming over victoria and had a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the canberra of the road he came right off the bridge right down the road straight through the fence and straight through the police box which was never rebuilt now if we talk about health dr scott young should go down as a great feminist she opened the first pathology center in penrith she was also mayor of penn from 1974 to 1970s now our radiology units are doing nmri tests and all the latest medical things in my days in the 50s if you had a serious problem you went to macquarie street or to sydney hospitals nowadays nepean hospital has a huge range of units and an extensive range of experts available to to solve your problems governor phillip hospital was prior to european hospital it closed in 1956 when nepean opened the old hospital was re-opened remodeled and re-opened specialty hospital our first hospital in penrith opened in 1860 in a street now called cox avenue this had six beds for inpatients accommodation for the live-in wards person and his wife who between them nursed the patients cooked the meals cleaned the hospital and anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area tennis courts squash has mostly died out but netball is very strong rugby league in the 50s our top players went to parramatta we got our own team in 67 and have won three premierships shopping food shopping was done by my mum she 'd order the food and then it was delivered by bustles which was a shop near the old post office and was her first choice meat was usually from halls butchery lots of small dress shops and jewelry shops with two department stores nails at the top of the hill and fletcher 's in the middle of high street which went on to become grace brothers farmers myers milk and bread was to live and fruit were delivered and mo the fresh food was mostly from shops and stalls in the area emu plains had a very good ones which mostly uh sold local produce which was very fresh you have to remember that the home yards were a lot bigger most people had vegetable gardens fruit trees and often a chook pen one of my happy memories was moving from the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaza which has been remodeled at least three times and expanded and expanded now if we talk about garbage we had one small tin bin nowadays i 've got three great wheelie bins but i think one of the differences was we had a better block incinerator which of course is now banned entirely for pollution we had very little plastic in those days there 's no such things as water bottles milk bottles were recycled and there was no prepared food packaging fish and chips came in the paper all come in newspaper green waste went on the garden was eaten by the chooks people uh people say what do i think about pennies i say i grew up in a country small village i now live in a modern city advantages and disadvantages in my village i knew everyone but in my city i have theaters hospitals restaurants so on the whole i think it 's gone the right way you"

library 's research room and i 'm having a conversation with jim mason who had worked for penrith council for 45 and a half years which i think is absolutely amazing and so i know jim you had a lot of different careers in that time europe council so but i think it would be really nice for you to just say something about yourself your family and your background and how you ended up working for panerai 's counseling yeah right yes my i like lorraine said my name is jim mason i was born in high street penrith on the 27th of august 1942 in a private hospital opposite the fire station it 's not there now of course and i was uh raised in a family of seven i was the middle child of seven uh and we lived in frogmore road orchard hills on a 10-acre property which was given to my father by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended orchard hills public school and then penrith high school where i completed my leaving certificate in 1959. i applied for a position at penn city council that came up at the end of 1959 as at the same time i had applied for teachers college scholarship and i 'd also applied for a job at the commonwealth bank oh okay right i did i did receive the teachers college scholarship to um to to armadale yeah and i was offered a position at the commonwealth bank but after considering the options i decided to accept the position of penrith city council as a junior clerk and i commenced were you were interviewed oh yes yes yes i went through an interview went through an interview oh i can 't even i i think i was interviewed by the then town clerk harold core okay but i can 't remember who else you did right okay so i started on at the council on the the fourth of january 1960. um council at the time had gone through a it was a very busy time for council council had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evan ross who was the old town clerk had resigned retired due to ill health and harold cooper had been appointed the new town clerk at that stage the officers of the council were the old real old council chambers on the corner of henry and and henry and evans street opposite the old little old primary school yep yep and that was the original council chambers it was opened in 18 so that 's where you that 's where we started oh okay we didn 't actually work in the old council chambers or the back of it there was buildings attached right i think some of them were old army yeah and at that stage the um the workshop for the council was still situated at the back of the council chambers they hadn 't moved at that stage yeah yeah so that 's where we started and uh is it computerized oh no computers or anything in those days it was all handwritten and part of my job when i first started was working uh writing up the transfers so if anyone sold a block of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes right yes and we the the um the library still has all of those land transfers going back to the early 1900s so yeah fantastic resource when i first started council part of my job was to take the money uh taking to the council to the bank each day which was the bank of new south wales on the corner of high and castle ray street penrith so was it a big bag of money oh it was whatever the takings were right you just took them you just walked down the street down the street and put them in and took them to the bank oh wow right as well as that um the council when the rates were sent out the council opened their office at st mary 's and uh i operated an old cash register yes which was a vintage one and it was in the side of the building which was occupied at saint mary 's library yes and on the on the other side of the library other side of the building was where the old saint mary 's um workforce for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old council old saint mary 's council chambers yes okay yes it was then occupied by the library partners where the library was yes they had another room there where we collected the rates and next door to that they had a like a workshop garage with the outdoor staff that that were formally worked at some mary 's council i suppose yeah when they amalgamated in 49 yeah they still worked out of the samaria 's deputy so on that corner was this the depot as well yes they had a um a drive a road up there towards at the back of a desk and that 's where they worked out of there yeah so that was the the early days of working at st mary 's office i originally i used to ride after i used to catch the bus just to to work i then used to drive to get to work by riding my bicycle to work i didn 't have a brand new bicycle i had an old bike which caused more troubles than enough i didn 't wear cliffs clips on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to roll my trousers up and halfway into pen with my trousers would fall down and i get caught up in the chain so i was very pleased when i was able to get a license in uh in the latter part of uh 1960 and get a my first vehicle was a 1952 holden a green one a manual one which i reque acquired off my eldest brother who had uh had it repaired after he rolled it over up at stanford in queensland so i still had the fragments of glass in the car i can tell you when i acquired it so i uh i found it a lot easier trying to get to work when i had a car then yeah yeah but uh they were the early days of uh trying to get to work and i suppose the highlight of the year really and the first year i started was there was going to the christmas party right the council had a social club they organised an annual christmas party in those days it was held at the old school of art not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in where the in belmore street which was later the queue theater they used to have the christmas parties there and it involved was one of the few organizations that included all staff yes whether you worked in the on the roads or whether you worked in the office if you remember the social club you 're invited to come along after working in the race department for a number of years um and gaining experience there i also that it 's as part of the role in the rates department i also attended used to go to the counter and answer any queries and questions that the rate payers had yeah and also helped um as taking but doing the duties of a cashier at that time as well relieving and things like that but you had contact with the public all the time because they were coming in querying their rates and so forth yeah yes so then later on after a few years in the in the race department i was transferred into the finance section max baker was the my supervisor he he wasn 't called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a city treasurer and i worked in that section and i was involved in the payroll right i looked after the payroll uh just not the stages to pay master but as a pay clerk and i became the pay master now in the early days of starting on the council when i first started we were only paid every fortnight and we were paid in cash right someone had come around to your desk and give you a a give you your pay docket and pay your pay and your check your money and so forth right so that was the early days of of of the payroll after a period of time it became weekly pay yeah right but we didn 't go on to uh getting your money paid into the bank until many years later no i when i started in 86 it was i remember you coming around in pain and care my little envelope with the cash in it yes i 've still got some of those some of those little envelopes they 've got money in them still but well spent i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now later in 1960 we moved out of the old council chambers and went to the one on the corner of of henry and station street okay right yes which was the foundation stone was laid in 1959 and that was opened in 1960 well that was a real eye opener going into a brand new building uh which uh were certainly different where the departments were split up differently yes and it was uh it was a real eye-opener and um very modern you had brand new desks yeah the you know you were was i suppose we were spoiled because we 're going from a um like an old army hut into a brand new building which which had a caretaker who lived in on site and his wife and uh and we had the privilege then of being served morning tea at our desk so they 'd deliver the morning trees yeah and and so that was part of the the new council chamber set up so and the old council chambers was pulled down wasn 't it yes the old council chambers was pulled down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built in 1964. yes so i progressed in working in the um from doing the payroll progress through the the finance or the in that the finance section under max baker over the years to become assistant accountant to max baker and but we 're still involved with the supervision of the payroll etc and as you said in those days we used to get the mayor have to sign the payroll check so we 'd have to go to the mayor 's office of the morning on the day of payday get the mayor to sign the check and then two two of us would go down to the bank on the corner the westpac was then on the corner of high and station streets and get the and get the check cashed and carry it back to the council chambers where we 'd manually count it and put it in the envelope there 's no security or anything how much how much money well that 'd be thousands of dollars yes because everyone i think everyone but two or three people were paid by cash yeah i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid directly into the bank right and everyone else was paid by cash and we had a couple of wooden boxes that we carried around someone would hand out the you pay slip you 'd sign it and someone else would give you the pay yeah you pay yes and then later in the afternoon we 'd then go out and pay the outdoor staff we 'd first of all we 'd go out and pay the outlying outdoor staff that couldn 't get into the couldn 't get back to the depot to be paid we 'd go out and visit work sites and pay them on the site and we go to some areas and pay the staff that worked out of some areas on the outdoor staff and go and pay some mary 's library as well and then come back to the depot and pay the depot staff and it was a case of paying them we always we always had to balance at the end to see if we had no money left over if you had money left over you have to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mistake but we didn 't have any trouble with security um no no one tried to rob us none of that happened but uh in the later years we had john richardson go out with us and he was more or less a guard he was a fire control officer but his role was to assist us on payday and go out with us and like and be as an extra supervisor guard type of thing but la in in then in latter years council negotiated through the union to have staff paid their wages directly into the bank and for that privilege or for that to happen council gave away a few sacrifices to the staff they allowed them the outdoor staff and extra time off they finished early so they could go and get the money out of the bank and things like that so there are some incentives to have your money paid into the bank yeah right but going back to my work history i i stayed in the finance with under max baker 's control for a while and then management in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's offside right so i was transferred to administration yes which was so you didn 't think about getting qualifications i did yes i did yeah i did study yeah but i hated studying and i got halfway through my studies i even went to to tech in sydney twice a week yeah i went to tech in penrith yes i hated studying and i had i had more interest in in in being involved with um organizing football and cricket and playing those games and doing my studies yeah much to my uh the disgust of my father yes however but they they uh they appointed someone else who was qualified to be max baker 's assistant and i went and worked in administration for a number of years i hated that uh but then there was a bit of an upheaval in the pay office and they came they got me to come back and take over back over the pay office and i uh then looked after the pay office again and again took over the role as assistant accountant in those days you had a bookkeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll slips on an accounting machine right that was that was that was that was all done on a bookkeeping machine and then i 'm not sure exactly of when the computer arrived but i think it was in the 70s we got the computer system into the into the into the council and then the payroll went on to a computer system but in the meantime um i got more involved in the social side of things uh max baker stood down as running the being involved with the social club and handed the reins to me and i became the secretary treasurer of the social club yeah organising the christmas party which was mainly the only thing that the social club ran in those days we used to have an odd cricket game and football game occasionally but it was mainly the social the the chris annual christmas party which was then held at the penrith leagues club we were we were privileged i suppose to have as the president of the social club uh a director of the liege club murray clark and he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cub gave us for having our function at the leagues club and we used to have some great functions at the old leagues club you know on the corner of uh of station street and reserve street there before they moved to where they are today yeah yeah we had many christmas parties down there that went off very well and so my role was as secretary treasurer we just had to organize the christmas party that was all so did you have anything to do with the credit union yeah the credit union didn 't come come in until later the credit union i think finished in about 2 000 something like that and it went for 26 years yeah i was involved in the credit union was the state government involved in encouraging councils to close credit unions no the red they 've got too much red tape right you know you have to get the the rules and regulations of banking and so forth might have made it very difficult although we had a full-time bookkeeper and cashier and yeah person looking after the credit union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the library yeah originally when we started the credit union um we was all done voluntary yeah bob wilkinson was the first secretary of it don hawkins was the president and i was one of the original directors when don hawkins retired i took over as the president of the credit union and i was still president of the credit union when we amalgamated with the police credit union i 've still got my account yes yes it 's the police police bank yes the police bank man yes but i still my original number that transferred across but the credit union served a very good and a valuable support for council staff yeah we assisted a lot of people in gaining small loans i think the most we could loan without security in those days was 2 000 with security you could more or less go up to 4 000 and we helped a lot of staff members and they uh you know with savings and and supporting them with them with their and it helped a lot of people out of trouble yeah yes exactly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the in finance i was appointed as the council 's first personnel officer yeah and as a personal officer i moved out of finance and i had a little office by then council had outgrown the council chambers and had moved their main a lot of staff into the coal button store which was opposite the penrith technical college in henry street okay we took over that whole building it was two stories two floors and all the council staff except once again the finance section yeah was working out of boric house yes i did work out of boric house to start with yes we occupied two different sections of boric house uh on the same floor and at one time before we went to coal buckingham the health and building department also worked out of coal buckingham yeah yes so i also walked out and worked out a boric house so it just shows you how scattered the camera is the council was gathered scattered over two or three buildings at that stage yeah and i suppose during my service with the council i must have worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person in my role of personnel officer i was involved in in in interviewing all the council staff any new positions and i got involved in all interviews and you even interviewed you interviewed you when you started and also in the early 70s it was a big move in council was the opening of the first child care centre yes okay the first child care center was opened it was called your army was opened at wellington and it was it was one of its unique one it was a very large uh center it was built i believe and might it was built after golf with them finished i know but it was built they said it was built with golf 's money i think it was grant money that would have been allocated prior by the whitlam government okay and this building was uh i think there 's a 60 place child care centre um and you don 't you never built any as large as that again council council grew from that building to being the largest employer and construction of child care centers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still do yes so they they really they really set the pattern for child care yeah yeah yeah on our laps we have two interesting little documents so one is the centenary book that was put out in 1971 for the 100th anniversary local government in penrith but this is the um the actual newspaper that came out at the time the penrith press and uh for the fifth of may 1971 and it 's all about the celebrations the huge celebrations that penrith council put on so jim yeah tell us about your experiences and and your involvement yes the the certainly the celebration of of the centenary was a very big um very big part of the history of event in the history of the of anyone that worked on the council it was uh they had a local committee that organized the events but the staff were well and truly involved yes uh the ev the staff really got behind it yep we uh the council allowed us we we grew uh our hair side levers and beads etc and the how real were they yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial yes um dresses etc yeah and um and they had a parade through the street and a lot of the staff the girls were on the float there that we have a photo of there they took part in that they did have a princess competition and many of the girls who worked on the council were involved in that and took part of that and it was very big celebrations that were spread over i suppose about a month i was involved in looking after the um the the function down on the river yes the riverfest function involved with making sure parking was there was adequate parking and parking went uh uh when it was there was no havoc or any problems with the parking because it was it was held down at the river and it was a very congested area yeah i didn 't get involved in running any events but just more or less overseering it don hawkins was was in charge of the council office who was in charge of the celebrations but they went for many over a period of months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest where all the council staff were in a lot of the council staff were involved in this pram pushing contest a contest with three other two other teams where they pushed this pram for 24 hours round the roads the rural roads of penrith right and my role in that was i was a support team i was driving a support station wagon yeah where i 'd pick up uh the the news people that were going to do the running and pick uh meet the runners and relieve them and the new the new runners would come in as part of the team and i 'd take the the old runners back to the or the council chambers where they could have a lie down and arrested something to eat and that would be rotating all the time so it went on for 24 hours so it was two of us that did it yeah and we 've got some photos there of the uh support team and the uh and the team that ran that took place in that pram pushing contest yeah it was and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up yes the the centenary ball was a uh certainly an eye-opener it uh it involved it was held at the league 's club i 've still got the original ticket so i when i purchased my tickets i 've still got the the tickets that i had you had to buy tickets oh we had to buy the tickets and uh but it was a very big good night and it was a very good function put on at the league 's truck yeah and the league 's club went to every possible way in making it a success yes it was certainly a uh i suppose the prime um part of the social side of it yes the organization of the uh of the actual ceremony of uh when the when the governor rhoden cutler came yes and uh and the freedom of the city yes uh by the by the uh granting of the freedom of the city that was that 's the photo of the of the dress up at the ball of the uh staff yes yeah that was after court and that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the that was the general manager and his staff or with their vests on yeah and some of them were dressed up in colonial uniforms etc but it was a great night thoroughly enjoyed by everyone and at that night i took along that night a girl in the office who i later married right right okay i took her to that ball yes we weren 't going out uh steadily at that stage but later on uh she worked in the office in the in the in the account section as well in the finance section uh we met we were able to uh do our courting without upsetting the office or anything like that we became engaged in 1972 okay and married in 1973 and she stayed working on the council until she left and had children yeah after that was in after we 'd been married for ten years yeah i think we had our first son yeah yeah so that was that was that was the start of my uh courtship the council centenary ball yes it went off well yeah but it was a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking and and getting involved in the welfare are you trying to look after them we would see you a lot you would come around and um yeah we sort of got to know you really well much much more than a lot of other staff because she sort of kept in contact with us all also at that stage council appointed new managers to the organizations in various departments and one of them was the human resources manager which i applied for but i didn 't get and so i became part of the human resources department and i was still carrying out the personnel role and at that stage at one time there the we had an occupational health and safety officer yeah he resigned they didn 't appoint a new occupational health and safety officer they asked me would i take over the role yeah and i did that and i also looked after council 's insurance at that stage and i wasn 't doing as much personnel work but i was looking after employee relations and occupational health and safety i used to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i visited there every morning to talk to the outdoor staff before they went out on the job and then i 'd go around to the various work sites at times and then i 'd do the inspection of the child care centres and the offices and in 1994 the this building was opened and that 's again was a big culture shock to the staff we were staff were spread over two or three different buildings and all of a sudden we came into a new building once again new facilities and everything but it was open plan office we didn 't in previous positions i had held in the other buildings i had an office of my own and all of a sudden you had an open plan office but it was a bit of a culture shock to come from a um a little office of your own or a big office of your own yeah into an open plan office so that 's what happened in 1994. before i finish i 'd just like to talk about a couple of my things that going back that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one was in 1961 with the death of a mayor leo spees he died suddenly in sydney i think he was at a meeting or he was a businessman he was the me at the time he died suddenly and i still remember uh his funeral was in penrith at the catholic church and the and the staff line both sides of the of high street in honor of him yeah um so that was um that was a major thing that occurred in the end and then in later years when harold core died suddenly harold core was he started on the council in the 1940s uh as a clerk worked his way up after coming back from the second world war and became town clark in 1969 and then he died suddenly died suddenly and it was a certainly a major shock to us all i realized with the advent of the computer and the way things were changing um technology changing i felt that in 2005 it was time for me to retire i had a long career with the council thoroughly enjoyed it they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home at times i didn 't enjoy the service of the council car it was only through the council that i received the oam in 2002 i 'm sure it was adding through the council that i received that award but i had great support from my wife and family in my career with the council and the council i 'm indebted to the council the mayor jackie greeno and the general manager alan travis who gave me a civic dinner when i retired which i suppose not many uh people in my position were honored with such a such a dinner that 's right upstairs uh very few people were given that privilege certainly senior officers but not a bit of an also ran like me who received that but my i suppose my biggest joy was trying to help people uh and help them in there not you get you got to know them personally yeah you got to know their families you got to know their lives and what they did and so forth because you got involved with them trying to help them and i hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's about it thank you"

    "text": "[Music] g 'day i 'm greg from hr success a difficult time for all of course particularly employers knowing what to do with their staff and and whatnot so i thought i 'd cover today just a couple of questions that we 're getting from a lot of local small business employers the first one being can i require that my staff be vaccinated the answer to that is is yes you can if indeed that is a lawful and reasonable request so what constitutes a lawful and reasonable request or direction of staff to get vaccinated there 's three reasons the first reason relates to public health orders so if there 's a public health order or a government direction of some description that requires staff working in your premises to be vaccinated then yes you can require those staff to be vaccinated and you should require them to be vaccinated so that you 're ensuring compliance with those public health orders or government directions the second reason that you can lawfully and reasonably require staff to be vaccinated is where that decision is supported by an employment contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that nature so in those cases you can also require that staff to be vaccinated and the third and final reason is where it 's a lawful and reasonable direction relating to work health and safety so this is where it gets a bit more complicated whether indeed a decision to require staff to be vaccinated is lawful and reasonable for ensuring work health and safety comes down to an assessment of the workplace so it could be the nature of the workplace the frequency and nature of contact with customers and clients the the location of the premises all those sorts of things need to be taken into account so we actually recommend that all businesses that are considering a compulsory vaccination policy undertake a full work health and safety risk assessment so that they can determine the level of risk that is in fact involved and if it 's determined that there is in fact a decent level of risk then potentially that requirement for compulsory vaccination is lawful and reasonable there are some resources on the safe work australia website that offer some guidance around undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referral to a work health and safety specialist that we frequently work with so they 're the three reasons supported by a public health order or all government direction the second reason is if compulsory vaccinations a requirement of an employment contract an enterprise agreement or other registered agreement and the third one where it 's a lawful and reasonable direction based on work health and safety in which case it should be supported by a risk assessment in our view we also recommend that if you are moving in that direction that you consider developing a formal policy relating to vaccinations and it 's really important that you do consult with your staff and others potentially impacted by that policy before that policy is finalized and implemented the final thing we 'd say about compulsory vaccinations is that you need to be sure that you don 't discriminate against people that can 't have vaccinations for a genuine valid medical reason or for example an age-related reason so just be careful about the requirements relevant to the discrimination legislation the other question that we 're getting frequently asked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide evidence of their vaccination status so can you do it can 't you do it well you can do it if in fact it 's a lawful and reasonable direction to require people to have vaccinations so again as previous there 's those three reasons by which you might lawfully and reasonably require somebody to have vaccinations to enter the premises if you 've got one of those three reasons then yes in our view it 's it 's reasonable to ask people to provide evidence of their vaccination status if however you don 't have a compulsory vaccination requirement or there 's no public health order in place or anything of that nature then it 's probably not reasonable to ask people for their vaccination status or at least require them to provide that evidence you can certainly ask them but can you require employees in that case to provide evidence of their vaccination status if you don 't actually have it as a compulsory requirement no you can 't so by all means ask them but can 't require them the other thing we 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seeking or requiring that evidence we would recommend that the safest option is to just view that evidence so cite it and say well thanks very much and then off you go don 't generally speaking take a copy or retain a record of their vaccination status because that gets quite complicated in terms of the privacy legislation and so on you can do it but if you are going to copy and retain a record be sure that you 're appropriately covering yourself in terms of the privacy legislation if you just want to go the easy route just cite the evidence say thanks very much move on [Music] you"

wagon building brick making and saw milling there were ten shops four on queen street and six on the highway were four churches public school the catholic school the protestant hall mechanics institute masonic temple a post office and a park for outdoor activities the council met in the hall until the lake till the council chambers were built in 1933. this building is now the headquarters of our historical society and forms part of the council precinct along with the memorial hall the art studio community centre and the senior citizens centre over the years there have been some significant events occur the first wall exported to england went from reverend samuel marsden 's memory the first crossing of the blue mountains began from gregory blacksling 's lee home peter dodds

his biplane at worrington park where he gave joy flights and a munitions factory was built 1949 was a big year for saint mary 's on the 1st of january 1949 saint mary 's council combined with penrith castle ray and mulgoer to form penrith municipal council the population of saint mary 's had grown substantially by then starting from when the munitions factory opened in 1941 however it was to increase even more in 1949 when the munitions factory closed the buildings were sold and leased to private enterprise while some of the buildings became a migrant hostel the first migrants to arrive came mainly from the baltic countries the adults went to work in the new factories cooksons baker and proven 3m anthony squires pretty sounded recording to name a few and the children were bused to the school the headmaster mr harry ainsworth held an assembly and told us that these children would be coming to our school the next day and we were to teach them english and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no fighting with them he explained that they had seen enough fighting and they were here to start a new life now if you were near the top of the class you got one of these children to look after all went well for about two days and then the fight started the you of newcomers weren 't involved it was the children who didn 't get someone through careful fighting those of us who did because they wanted to help them settle in as well so we were then told we had to share them in the playground the following year more migrant children arrived swelling our population our sixth classroom didn 't have enough desks so the dining room table was brought in from the headmaster 's residence and placed at the side of the room mr ainsworth spoke to the two school captains and two vice captains thanking us for helping the migrant children and to ask us as the student leaders in the school if we would volunteer to give up our seats and sit at the dining room table of course we agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful mahogany table it wasn 't very long before portable classrooms arrived and the new infants department was built it was an exciting time for us as everyone got along well and i think we learned as much from them as they learned from us queen street became the main street in the early 1950s when the post office moved there the street became very busy during peak hour with workers driving across the level crossing at the station to get to work the overpass on gossip street was opened in 1956 extending glossop street to the industrial area and the level crossing at the station closed so mary 's high school began in 1952 on the munitions site and moved to its current site in 1956 and became saint mary 's senior high school in 1989 with population still growing primary schools in north st mary 's south saint mary 's bennett road and oxley park all opened in the 1960s while there has been much development in the town saint mary 's has become smaller in area

talk to members who had lived for many years in saint mary 's to get a feel for the town i was the last to be interviewed and she asked me if i attended the old school when i replied yes she asked me what event at the school stood out most in my memory and the story of the migrant children was my reply about six weeks later she rang to ask if she could use my story as a result there are now two

dismissed with a large family to support he fell into poverty macquarie allowed them government rations the laterals do not appear to have developed their grants along mulgo creek in any way and in

    "text": "thank you thanks Andrew I 'm quite chuffed to be invited here tonight because I 'm the only one of the three of us that has been on guard in Australia [Laughter] okay so Passivhaus buildings basically take the principles of solar passive design and construction and apply building physics to them this allows us to maximize the return of the various aspects of solar passive design and construction additionally it focuses on a few key areas in greater depth it means that we can achieve better results across a wider range of building types and a wider range of climates it also takes into account condensation now condensation is a growing issue in our buildings it 's been occurring ever since we started insulating and it 's causing some major health and construction issues so let 's look first what is a pair has a passive house building and its most basic but simply one that performs the way we think our homes currently perform so when we close up our windows and our doors to keep the heat out in summer or to keep the warmth in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most houses of an average size will have at least an open windows worth Alixe if not open door or more for larger ones so we 're not actually isolating the indoor climate from the outdoor climate this of course requires extra energy fading and cooling to keep the home comfortable here 's a thermal image I 've taken of a skirting board to demonstrate one of these licks you can probably see the yellow line there that 's hot air leaking in through the wall structure and this is only about a 33 degree day 25 inside with air conditioning on if it was 40 or 45 degrees that leak would be much bigger now there 's a misconception that we need these leaks for our houses to breathe and that 's is not the case we certainly need our houses to be ventilated but unless we do this in a controlled manner we end up wasting lots of energy and we end up with health issues this is mold inside a wall and one of the reasons it 's there is because of air leaks you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framing so if we let our houses ventilate to the leaks we 're breathing in the air that comes through here so we 're breathing the mold spores the rat poo and whatever else might be in there of house buildings actually isolate the indoor climate from the outdoor climate so it means when we shot up our windows and doors we 're actually isolating it and they also require little to no heating or cooling and they 're also much healthier so passive house is actually a system in a nutshell it 's tool to predict a building 's performance some principles to then achieve that performance and really key quality construction and testing to ensure we 've met the performance there 's no other system that mandates testing they actually make sure you 've achieved what you set out to do let 's define performance we want our buildings to be comfortable we wanted to be healthy and we want to do this in an efficient manner I 'm going to go into a bit of detail about what comfort actually is these are a couple of screenshots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the air temperature below that you can see it feels like which is our comfort temperature bit further down we 've got wind speed and then humidity so if you first look at the Penrith example on the left is 41 degree day actually felt a bit cooler at 36 this is because we had quite a strong breeze but critically very low humidity at 18% conversely in Cannes on the right a 31 degree air temperature they felt hotter at 35 partly this is because of a lower breeze but more importantly because we had really high humidity 77% so comfort is made up of these three factors the air temperature the air movement and also the humidity so in a passive house we set parameters for those three factors keep our temperature air temperature between 20 and 25 degrees year-round we want our humidity to remain between about 35 and 65 percent year-round and we want to control our air circulation so we have no drafts from the air leaks no convection currents and no temperature layering this is achieved by preventing a radiant heat or cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we make sure that the difference between the air temperature and the surface temperatures is no more than four point two degrees all of this happens whilst using very small amounts of energy so the heating and cooling costs in a passive house will average out to be less than the cost of coffee a day for an average sized home that figure of 15 kilowatt hours is the maximum allowable to achieve certification we 've already looked at what mold can do inside a building Kevin II from a health perspective passive houses are a mold free not only in the cavities but in the building themselves passive houses do use a ventilation system to make sure we are keeping the air controlled and healthy this takes the stale air out which includes the carbon dioxide that we 're breathing out as well as any chemicals that might off gas from furniture flooring and the like we then bring fresh air in from outside and it is filtered so we remove things like pollen and dust and air pollution again this is whilst using very small amounts of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy for running the whole building let 's look at that efficiency in a bit more detail this is the Sapphire it 's a certified passive house that 's built by blue eco homes completed last year it 's at Faulconbridge and it 's open for tours and blue mica homes are here in the audience if you want to talk to them afterwards its 183 square meters excluding the garage and I 'm using an energy cost for this calculation of twenty seven cents a kilowatt hour which seems about average at the moment the daily average energy bill for this house will be a dollar seventy six now the vast majority the year you won 't need any heating or cooling but for those extreme times forty degrees plus for a week and you want to use some air conditioning the cost of that divided by 365 gives you this number as an example there was a day this summer where it was 42 group 45 degrees outside inside without any cooling got to 27 degrees now that 27 degrees is outside our comfort zone of 25 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning on the ceiling fans which gives us about one to three degrees of comfort we can do is a bit of dehumidification or if you want to use the air conditioning we only need to drop two degrees not 20 degrees so how do we do it spec one is the Passivhaus planning package of PHP P it 's basically a really complicated Excel spreadsheet in it we input all the information the design the site details things like shading are the buildings etc climate data not only temperature obviously but things like solar radiation we 've put the materials we might use we put the type of construction we might use we can then play around with aspects of that like the materials construction and design until we can optimize the performance of the building to get the results were after the reason it 's a spreadsheet and not a software package is because it allows us to easily update the ongoing testing and research of Passivhaus buildings around the world it also L allows us to update things like materials research and science as that comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a building with 95% accuracy what that means is if you happen to fall in that other 5% instead of your building being between 20 and 25 degrees it might be between 19 and 26 the next step is actually the way we build and it 's all about the building envelope and the building envelope is what surrounds the parts of the house we 're living all the time first step is we have an airtight layer so surrounding the whole building envelope a layer that keeps isolates the indoor climate from the outdoor climate it also helps us with our moisture control next we have a continuous layer of insulation again around the whole building envelope insulation is not just good for keeping the warmth in in winter but it 's extremely effective at keeping the heat out in summer and a passive house rated building will generally have more insulation in it than the construction code our insulation layer is only as good as its weakest points and the weakest point in any building is the window windows are notoriously leaky and let air in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation so we need to have a better quality window to match the poor climate the more extreme the climate but more high-performance the window we need the example on the screen is a very high performance window you can see from the cross-section the thermal imaging there that there is no transfer from the warm side to the cool side this is an example of an extremely poor performing window this is a double glazed window but it 's a standard aluminum frame and you can see how the frame is leaking heat into the building this is called a thermal bridge and thermal bridges are the next thing we try and get rid of in a passive house not only things like window frames but corners and anywhere we 've got a change of material now we obviously can 't eliminate corners but we can construct them differently so that they don 't act as a thermal bridge the top left picture shows a stud frame construction with insulation between it thermal image obviously and you can see how the studs are leaking energy and there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly so it 's not a thermal bridge finally as I mentioned we have a ventilation system keeps the air nice and fresh and healthy however it 's no good bringing all that fresh air in from the outside if it 's 45 50 degrees and it 's just going to heat the house up so it has what 's called a heat recovery unit and it literally takes the heat out of the air using the example on the screen if it 's 40 degrees outside 20 degrees inside the heat recovery works 90% effect efficiency so it takes 18 degrees of temperature out of that air so the fresh air coming in is down out nice 22 degrees all of these aspects of the building envelope our best practice when it comes to condensation management and what does condensation do that mold that we saw before and this example is only 12 years old it 's in Sidney 's in the West which is arguably very mild climate so the more extreme the climate the more chance of condensation and it 's built toward us than the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's the only system to do so one of the main tests is a blower door test to make sure our airtight lair is good the maximum allowable in a passive house is 0.6 here changes per hour that 's 0.6 air changes per hour to put that in perspective testing on Australian homes has revealed the average is about 15 change air changes per hour some even as high as 30 or more if your building is leaking to the extent of 15 air changes per hour and you 're calling it with your air conditioning that means you 're calling the volume of that building 15 times every hour that 's costing you a fortune completed our testing we 've put the results back into our PHP P to make sure the standard is met if it 's not we go back and we test again until we get it right so what does a passive house building look like the answer is anything you want passive house is not just about houses it comes from the German term passive house house means building as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's offices multi-residential schools there 's a car dealership including its workshops in Canada there 's shopping centres schools in particular work really well all those kids in a room everything at lots of carbon dioxide carbon dioxide makes you naughty the ventilation system takes the carbon dioxide out of the air and what they found is Passivhaus rated schools the students are far more alert and attentive this last couple of photos is a project of mine under construction we 're turning a little old brick veneer into a passive house so yes you can refurbish and rebuild to the standard however if we look at a passive house and infrared we see massive distant difference this is a wintertime shot it 's a row of terraces and as you can see that passive house that 's been upgraded is leaking far less heat and the rest just to show how well Passivhaus is suited to the Australian climate the beginning of last year in Melbourne we have what 's called an icebox challenge so we built two little boxes Wonder Passivhaus one two the national construction code six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each census inside and outside at the end of 12 days of a Melbourne summer the Passivhaus had a hundred and forty-three kilograms of ice remaining the six star House had none if the temperature humidity graphs quickly cuz I 'm running at a time the blue line is the Passivhaus you can see it 's quite stable the red line is the six star code house which is not a lot better to that and then the outside conditions passive house started in Germany about 30 years ago and since the spread throughout the world this maps actually quite out of date the reason it 's actually being adopted by many councils cities and states around the world as if not the ability code then best practice this because it 's a holistic system that actually achieves the results it sets out to and it works straight out of the box rather than having lots of rules and regulations they can just say use Passivhaus if you would like further information you can look at the australian passive house association website Casa PDA is like our Bible some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute in Germany and yes you can click on the English button and if you can 't remember any of these if you get on my website there 's leagues there for you thank you very much [Applause]"

    "text": "you [Music] it 's a so I 'd like to start as others have by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet and pay my respects to elder 's past present and future and same as Nik did earlier I think it 's a really important starting point for what we 're talking about I 'm Steve Hartley I 'm the executive director of a new area within the Department of Planning industry and environment it 's a new division it 's a new grouping of people it 's a new functionality for the department and it 's deliberately titled as green and resilient places we are taking on that mantle trying to build and work build off and work with the work that people in this room have been doing and actually embed that in the planning system did I feel guilty yes am I in a place that I can make change yes as you all are as well and hence my the acknowledgments country can mean so many things but in this context one of the things personally I think is so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions to recognize the land on which we meet has been in ownership and custodianship for so long sets us up for how do we think about what we 're trying to do into the future so it is something that personally means a lot to me and I think has a really strong connection I am very lucky in the role that I do I am lucky to be charged for delivering one of the 14 premiers priorities each term of government the premier sets a number of priorities for the state and state government agencies have to take those priorities very seriously they are amazing enable us we were very lucky with this set of priorities to the premier set one which is to increase tree canopy and green cover across Greater Sydney and plant 1 million trees by 2022 I know that that sounds yep ok that 's what everyone in the room is charged with but as I say the opportunity to utilize the Premier 's priority to work together to change behavior to change business as usual cannot be understated so what are we doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my team some of which are here today we 're talking people like Beck we 've been reaching out we 've gone had a look at what other people have done we 're trying to learn and work with as many people as possible um we 've got what six project streams that we 're looking at people here probably are aware of the five million tree programme number of councils in the room would have taken participated in the 2018-19 grants round we 're looking at how do we use collaboration through financial mechanisms like grants like partnerships to change behaviour to deliver on some of those things we 've talked about Shawn from roses earlier talked about that tipping point the financials is important we 're refreshing the grants program and there will be a new grants program or grants rounds offered shortly as there will be with the industry and community partnering really important again stealing big thunder the ability to work together none of us and if you think back to the earlier in the day and rod Simpsons diagram of the connected parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're after individually planning system has a lot of control but so does local council so does private sector so does capital markets and the list goes on so we 're really looking at how do we partner with industry and community why do I feel guilty I 'm here representing Department of Planning the you 've seen some of the the outcomes of the planning system in the previous presentation there is real scope and I get that all the time I go out and I expect that some of the questions will be on that same front the planning system is either not the enabler it should be or as a blocker of good environmental outcome so we 're looking at policy and regulatory reform um I think was wrought also that put up a slide that 's from 2020 20 green places and better green spaces better places the Reeb ang percent of people don 't want what we 're doing rather walk away and think actually there 's invalidly thing there 's things that are more important to them now I think with rod that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually that leaves a large chunk of people that if we can work with if we can mobilize if we can make life easier and we can work out what their needs are you 've got a massive part of society that can actually get behind this movement part of that movement is got to be driven by government so one of the major things we 're looking at is what action can government take itself New South Wales government 's the largest employer in New South Wales and single employer in Australia we have massive ability with our purchasing power and the rules that we set for ourselves to change business as usual we 're also looking everyone once an urban for a strategy 30 of the 33 councils in greater Sydney actually have some form of canopy protection urban strategy anyway we would like to leverage off that and work with you to really bring that to the fore and how far greater Sydney do you meet that greater Sydney Commission target a 40 percent canopy coverage by 2036 so I 've talked a little bit about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just give a bit of a flavour we gave about 5.7 million dollars worth of grants to 20 councils across Greater Sydney and we funded a whole bunch of really interesting work really all aimed specifically at how do you change the experience that people have how do you improve whether it 's peat connectivity biodiversity how do you use that tree planting tree tree maintenance behaviour to improve outcomes for people on the ground we 've done demonstration projects we 've looked at how do you regrain suburbs we 've looked at how do you work and encourage people to actually take action and get that communication by working together to improve things like canopy outcomes what we 're doing is also looking at the way we act as government um I think one of the the most powerful things is having a Premier 's priority means that I get to go and meet with really important people across government and tell them what I 'd like them to do I 've had meetings with heads of agencies I 've had meetings with some very senior people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is that that your tree replacement ratios when you do write new roads or Road up roads why can 't we make them higher where does your asset management budget sit in terms of maintaining canopy where how does your behavior when your infrastructure agency affect the local community how you engaging with the local community to make sure where you 've had an impact you 're actually able to flip that and provide a positive outcome spray as well as green infrastructure so the premier 's priority has been fantastic in some of those conversations with big infrastructure agencies to change the way government is acting I was at the Environment offices Network I think late last year council environment officers Network last year and I gave a bit of a talk on in much more detail than this on some of the work that we 're doing I was fantastic we went straight to questions and I think I stood there for about half an hour and heard every single point probably not all of them about where the planning system is failing where the planning system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room have been talking about that 's from as simple as waited to change the the vegetation set to remove tree preservation orders and the replacement clause to as big as how does DCP LEP local strategic planning statements and the broader infrastructure policies fit together to get a whole place-based outcome we 're taking and I 'm very interested here I 'm happy to chat in the break or after we really really want to get to understand your lived experiences with your frustrations in the planning system I think there 's as part of the Premier 's priority one of the areas we 're looking at is policy and regulatory reform and there 's two major areas for reform that 's gonna sound funny I think the short term and long term there 's massive change you could make everywhere what I 'm really interested is hearing all about that and then sorting it through to see what could we do as a department of planning in the short term to change outcomes immediately and what are that what other things could we do legislative change change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not within my power but you need to create a new ministry for green infrastructure yeah longer-term suggestions about how do you change the dial in the system that is part of the remit under the premise priority that 's something we 're very very interested in as every you know I think rod said it collaboration other speakers have said it Becker ianforster we can 't do this by ourselves so while some very very interested to hear about those things in the planning system that aren 't working from your perspective I 'm also really really interested to know how can we support you better the conversation I think has actually improved across state local council and private sector and community if I think back to I 've worked in the environmental industry for 15 or 20 years if I think back to some of the initial conversations and discussions that I was involved in to the that the ability to have those nuanced discussions around the complexity of the system and where do you have different interventions to change things that 's us working together there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid so one of the partnerships were just launched for example is we 're working with Landcare New South Wales and we recognized that a state government a sometimes for a bit on the notes hey we 're from government and we 're here to help what we do recognize as well though is that you guys have a lot of connections in your local community and with people who do take action and people who want change so land cares a good example of a partnership we 've just signed where we are working with land Kenya South Wales to really look at where to plant how to plant what to plant fund addition planning how do we work better with local communities that 's just one of a number of paths an example of one of a number of partnerships we 're striking up I 'm very interested in ideas about how again we can work with you better I think the challenge for all of us is really no last slide I think the challenge for all of us is there is a lot of really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples today to to recognize what is it within our power but what is it that 's in someone else 's power that we know and how do we work together what can I change and what can you change so that we can collectively deliver from my perspective no but increase in canopy and green cover across Greater Sydney is clearly my focus but how do we work together for me to do that for you to do what you 're doing for other to achieve what they 're after I look forward to some good questions thank you [Applause]"

    "text": "unlike my two distinguished colleagues here I am NOT professional in this space I 'm an amateur that 's assert their backyard out of the chaco tree is my website so a lot of the stuff we 'll be talking about tonight is downloadable from there so basically who we are we 've been in western Sydney been Sinclair for the last 42 years as mentioned I 'm not formally trained in any of these wonderful things that these guys do but certainly my wife and I are very interested in living more sustainably where we are because the question is always asked what is the most sustainable home and of course the answer is the one you 're in now so if you can do some work with what you 've got that 's a great thing we produce currently up to 80% of our own veg hundred percent of herbs I would have said 100 percent of eggs but we 've hang some issues at the moment and about 40 to 50 percent fruit we have as Andrew said is a 70s three-bedroom brick veneer house it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not a not a big house we like it that way it faces the wrong way unfortunately it faces face of the house is very slightly south of East the back of the house faces very slightly with north of West which means when we thought that we were buying a house we 're actually buying a solar oven it has an attached garage and while we 're doing a lot of stuff we 're not what one would call off-grid we do have reticulated electricity and water that 's our place number nine file app you can see in the front there we have a lot of foliage we 've got a lot of plants that I 'll show you some more detail on that later but in the back that 's where we produce our food one of the things I should mention that because we 've been at this for 42 years there was no whole encompassing design at the start it 's grown organically and that means that as I 've learned stuff along the way if I was starting out now from scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more efficient but basically what we 've got because the choice is to use what we 've got the best we can or go back to scratch and raised all and they 'd start again and I 'm too old to do that we do have some solar panels this this is a bit old we 've got more solar panels since then we have solar hot water terms of the energy use I 'll go on a little bit about what we use around but we have a system that feeds into batteries feeds through the house there are only two parts of it that are permanently on grid we made that decision when we set the system up one of those is the small aircon that we have in our dining room kitchen area and the solar boost for the solar hot water the electric boost when I talked about it with the guy we 're setting things up with we had a talk about what made sense and it seemed to make sense at the time because we are using the air conditioner so little that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was about three or four years ago and we 've learned that our hassles with that so clay that is what we started with so that 's me looking like an idiot standing in the middle of what would be our block something that fascinated me was they called it the Garden Suburb of the 80s when they actually went through with bulldozers and took out absolutely every tree so of course what we 're talking about here is we 're talking about Heat and yes we grow food we save water we 've got about 19 thousand liters worth of water storage but the emphasis on this one is around feet and there 's some things that we 've done to adapt and obviously one of those things is roof insulation because when we moved in this was a cheap house okay so there were no frills and there was no insulation and we learned the first year what a bad idea that was so I climbed up there and we got again basically standard bats and and put that through and that made just an amazing amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the bedrooms and we have in the lounge as well and again they they do remarkable things for the comfort we have front yard trees the the trees for the most part are natives we 've got three big melaleucas which provide a lot of shade we also have quite a large mulberry tree which of course being deciduous we get a lot of shade in summer and then it opens up for winter we have backyard trees of various we have a banana circle don 't know if people come across the idea of a banana circle but it 's basically a circle of bananas but in the middle when you 're putting it in you dig out the the middle of the circle and that forms a ridge that 's which is plant the banana scene and then you put water and organic matter into the center because bananas are very thirsty and very hungry and they make the use of that and so when I originally had one of these in the front yard and didn 't have any of that they didn 't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water from our bathroom now goes into that banana circle and it 's just made a vast difference to how how happy the bananas are and we have a back deck which basically starts just a little bit into where the dining room in is goes all the way along to the back door so we 've got back door laundry kitchen dining room I was able to build that myself with the help of some friends who are skilled in the art as the saying goes but again it is it 's a vindication of the amateur we have a cover over that I really took heart in knowing what Josh was saying about having covers which are removable so when I was designing this up the cover for the deck was clear fiberglass to allow sunning when we wanted it and then I put over it shade cloth at about 90% to block that out the theory was that in winter I would remove that shade cloth and that would allow more light into the kitchen into the dining room keep the house warmer unfortunately my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay there so the theory is one thing practice another we also have outdoor blinds which I 'll show you what they look like we have a small aircon like I say I think it 's about two and a half kilowatt in the the kitchen dining area it 's not particularly efficient because it 's been there for fifteen years and at some stage we 're going to have to do something about it I don 't want to do anything about that until it breaks we 'll see how that goes we do so have solar panels on the roof we have most of them are on the back now we have some on the garage and a few on the front and they actually act as shades because as we 've talked about before it would be really great to have light roofing one thing I should say when they put our house together I was given no input into its design not that I would have been able to say much in those days because I had no idea you know at 21 you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be it would be nice to have a light or if we don 't have a light or if we have a dark roof so putting the solar panels cladding with solar panels obviously that gives us electricity but it also provides what I would call a tropical roof so you have sheathing which is above the roof and between the roof and the sheathing in this case solar panels you have an air gap that air gap allows for any breeze you 're getting to reduce the amount of heat load which is going onto the roof and then down into the house itself we also have an attached garage now the garage is on the south wall of the house you think that 's not an issue but because of the way our house is kinked and the way the Sun moves the southern almost southern wall does get some Sun in in high summer and so that can add a lot of energy to to our house with having the the built-in garage there it means that 's not an issue from the east that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at it and he said to me that our place doesn 't look anything like any of other houses in the street he didn 't mean it as a compliment from the north don 't worry about the lament oh we 've got this quite large mulberry tree which is obviously quite productive we get mala berries often that 's great but it also means that the front yard stays fairly cool because we have a lot of area which is flat and used for growing in the backyard it 's a little more difficult to organize these big trees but when I when I made that the back deck those are the outdoor blinds which were the 30 apiece from Bunnings they go down and what it does is it puts a barrier between the back of the house the brick which is of course dark and the Sun because as soon as the Sun heats hits that brick it starts moving through the brick and then gets into the house and of course once the Sun Goes Down thermal mass it stays warm and it keeps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees at night that 's not what you want that 's our banana circle there is also a couple of trees there as well again a mandarine tree lemon tree and over the window of my office there is a passion fruit vine so we 're using a lot of cooling things that absorb energy from the Sun and just put that barrier between the windows between the house and the Sun to keep it cooler probably the most exposed window is the bathroom and so what I did is got hold of some polystyrene sheeting this was being thrown out from a manufacturer that I was working for at the time I got a stack of these and there 's one designed and put in for each of the windows in the back of the house but particularly because the the bathroom is exposed I wanted to show you that one that 's the roof including the solar panels you can see we 've got some particularly around the area of the house where we spend our time kitchen dining and lounge room a concept I found about through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the idea is that you create an area in your house where you stay which is the coolest that you can manage the criteria for it are it 's insulated as well as you can manage it 's isolated from the rest of the house has existing mechanical cooling assistance if you can manage it and there is a sufficient area and facilities to be comfortable comfortably habitable for extended periods so it 's not the sort of thing where you want to have your cool refuge being a broom cupboard you want a decent size you want to be comfortable we set up hours of the roof insulation and solar panels basically what I did is I looked at the house and realized that the area covered by kitchen dining lounge in our lounge we do have a fold-out bed because what the lounge is so we can stay in there in extended periods we have window insulation on the back we 've got shutters on the front south wall garage fans and the small aircon helped us out isolation from the rest of the house and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find interesting these days is the whole open-concept theme which makes it very difficult for you to to heat and cool specific areas our house isn 't built like that it 's got lots of walls I like walls but you also have holes there and you need to cover those up what you can do by if you don 't have any other means of doing it or you 're not particularly rich is putting blankets up and we have one of those we regularly put up between the kitchen and the laundry and find it works really well that 's where we do our cooking and also because we have a fold-out lounge we can do our sleeping in there as well so it 's fairly well set up the results our electricity usage in summer is mainly on the aircon because we have a system that powers our house fairly well and the usage for that drop from five point one four kilowatt hours a day to two point zero eight kilowatt hours a day once I set up and we started to use the cool refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction can be ten or fifteen degrees without aircon on hot days so if we 're outside and we 're looking at thirty five forty degrees we 're generally around twenty five to thirty so the comfort level is quite good that 's it please if you if you have a chance you want to go onto the website you can email me through it if you 've got questions or if you have questions on some of the stuff well done we 've done might have a chance to talk to you later on [Applause]"

    "text": "you [Music] and thanks for having me so this is what we know at the present time so wealthy suburbs which are cool and less affluent suburbs or with a lot of people suffering disadvantage and energy poverty in the hottest areas however that information is not just enough also we know that during heat waves the heat urban heat becomes stronger so because the westerly winds are coming in and also to get a better picture of the situation as Sebastian has shown you can deploy a lot of sensors in their own environment but also we need more information or local information the black dots are the beeline weather stations which are at airports or racecourses where and nobody lives because you have horses and your airplanes and therefore we needed to have some urban weather stations this is it actually hosted by Western Sydney University that we installed and then we are crossing old Sydney and the yellow ones are also installed by NSW so providing high quality information we also installed a network of weather stations in the LGA of Parramatta and this shows what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 so the solid lines are actually the stations in Parramatta and the dashed lines are those from BM again measurements not modeling not interpolation in the thing that 's happening is that within the urban environment the Indian temperature are hotter and hotter and closer to the setpoint for cooling so you won 't be able to just open up the window and cool down your house anymore in the future you might need to run the aircon also night time it 's not just the daytime temperature then looking going down in there and the rabbit hole of the l environment again we moved from a city scale from regional skill to LG a skill and then we go to micro scale and this is the CBD of Parramatta and this we see that during a summer afternoon this was a first March of 18 so we collected data with tranzact 's with weather stations all around and then we had our vehicle with a moveable weather station and we took measurements at all these points and this is what we show that the hottest parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had our station and also some portions of the river here are three degrees cooler so there 's a almost six degrees temperature difference between these two points because from from the river we have an inflow of cool air so we have the the sea breeze penetrating the city so this is very much important to understand what to do and how not to block this influx of air so it 's not just all about urban design it 's much more complicated another thing that we saw was achieved by flying with a drone and spotting all the hot troops all over the CBD and the car parks again bringing up the attention on how we manage all these urban spaces which reach 55 degrees or more and then you switch on the car and the aircon at maximum power in another area in epping again Parramatta LGA we so there you have green spaces well irrigated sports field and you have some other spaces which are not well irrigated this is just a small one but it shows that those paces can reach sixty degrees so actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's not actively maintained what it what are the effects of all of this he related mortality on average these are all epidemiological studies of the past 30 years on average 60 deaths per year in the greater Sydney area some years 130-140 will we 'll see what will be over this year because also the bushfire what what 's for the future these of course are now not measured data because there those are extrapolations the feature tells us that in the future we will have more and more heat waves so we will have heat related mortality for longer and more intense an old mitigation that we can do will not be enough so we can plant more trees bit more coo roofing but it will not be enough we can achieve some containment of the situation but this is just bracing for impact we have to do more Elser these are data from from Europe from Italy they did a monitoring about all the actions that they undertook including surveillance deploying the GPS providing extra care to vulnerable population yes they brought down the attributable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero so still was not sufficient so we say okay we can go for what do we have to do we have to act on buildings again this is the 2003 heatwave in in Europe and this is my land my hometown work I 've done some years ago before moving to Australia so again these are the heat related deaths measured and this is the body balance and actually you have the peaks in heat related bad bets when inside the building you cannot cool one you cannot go below that dashed line so these is the response air-conditioning might not be because when you have the heatwave is when you have the peaks in a electricity demand and in increasing cost in transactions so we can provide a price cap or we can find a better solutions it might not be again also that be enough also because as I mentioned it 's when you have the night temperatures exceeding the setpoint for cooling this the thermostats temperature that you bring up the the electricity consumption and have very deadly heat weights because there 's no relief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air conditioning fails so the efficiency of air conditioning decreases with increasing temperatures and B or beyond a certain point it 's not working properly anymore and you have failure so some solutions of course that those were mentioned and you see here the black spot it 's actually white roof detected with with the fright with our drone flight over a shopping mall in Nara and it was a project together with blue scope and Stockland funded by CRC so you see here that what roof is actually out of the scale below at 30 degrees why the the hottest portions here exceed 80 degrees of a metal unfinished conventional conventional roofing another thing of course is to avoid mirror-like surface is reflecting downwards all the all the solar radiation these are the first two measures that need to be undertaken to avoid overheating our cities and having people experiencing walking around a kitchen stove and yeah and this was taken in Parramatta of course we can improve the thermal comfort our doors and this is in Darwin it 's a actually the construction is finished and it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are performing a monitoring on the Indian temperature and thermal comfort up there but as mentioned before we kind of just walk on the outside we have to work a lot on the inside Sebastian has shown some fantastic images of what our cities our neighborhoods should look like unfortunately we have a lot of social housing looking like this we 're indoors that again measured data of a project we we closed last year indoors 40 degrees and during winter time 10 degrees because people cannot afford to operate heating or cooling experiencing a lot of street stress and also more growth on top of that this is in western suburbs and this is in eastern suburbs so we have to improve our buildings anywhere we can do it we can lower the energy consumption of buildings of residential buildings or office buildings with mitigation of course we can bring it down this is the the future this is the present from m2 to m4 is 2050 this is 2050 if we don 't do anything and this is 2050 if we mitigate it again mitigation is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in even building energy conservation we can bring it down very much to the level where we can cope with renewables but it 's not enough so we have to use more aggressive strategies we have to undertake actions so what do we need in green we have what we 're where we are covered actually namely we have a great epidemiologists offering epidemiologic analysis in a very efficient healthcare system here we are working on it as we saw we 're implementing it very rapidly having a bill with the link stock model but this is what we need we need an implementation of heat mitigation Sydney white not just one council because otherwise it 's like operating air conditioning outdoors hot air will flow in from any side if you don 't mitigate Sydney wider regional scale we need DCPS be is to prevent stupid things so brutally said and promote the zero energy buildings we can do it but we have to enforce it and then also we have to retrofit buildings Sydney wide because we cannot wait for the 2% replacement rate in which is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of the building stock and of course inspections to make sure that what is on paper gets delivered on site so to conclude there is no silver bullet to solve the problem unfortunately planting trees is not a silver bullet alone so you cannot just plant trees you can 't just rely on Carew f---ing I love coral Fingal of trees air conditioning and living indoors and you cannot just seal yourself inside and unfortunately business as usual is a silver bullet instead but towards our heat so not a brilliant one"

    "text": "[Music] good afternoon thank you and thank you very much and congratulations to penrith council for bringing together such a spectacular view of different people working in urban heat worried about what we do going going forward from here and i think taking on the challenge of trying to say we need more people than ourselves to actually take on some of this and think how we can move forward together so congratulations and thank you for having us all here today um my name 's bec and i think you know we 've been working here in sydney as john said for four years on resilience and how do we make this thing these sort of things happen on the ground before i started i just wanted to ask a question of the audience i 'm going to do a slider in reverse because i reckon that in this room there 's very few people who are not already engaged in actually in your workplace part of your job is to make a tangible practical impact on what happens in one part of city it might be a street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of the district planning as rod showed us earlier it might be something to do with engineering and infrastructure or building properties put up your hand if you are tangibly involved in putting tangible things in the ground at some level here in sydney yeah it 's pretty pretty good coverage thank you very much um what i want to ask you though and what i 'm here to talk to you about is what information are you using to help you make that decision when you are the person in the hot seat deciding what that little piece of sydney that you are controlling will look like but more importantly what will it feel like when you are standing there because every single person in this room if we 're talking about leadership has now also in your next three years in your job a tangible responsibility to do something about the decision that you will make in the project that you are doing that will change the outcome from today no one of us is going to solve this problem it 's not somebody else 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team sport and i 'm here to tell you a little bit more about why we need to do something like that um you 've seen the definition and my thank you to sean from phrases who i did a presentation the whole of the phrases staff base two years ago and i am so delighted that they 're using our definition they 've really implemented that process you can see it in the projects on the ground great example of what we 're talking about so shocks and stress as we were talked about earlier actually understanding how those systems fit together and work when you have a big event go wrong is a really good way of understanding what will determine survivability and recovery so those shocks and stresses here for sydney we 've talked about it extreme heat is the top shock for sydney it kills more people has more impact on infrastructure and cascading effects through water systems and electricity failures that can and transport network failures that can have really significant disruptions across the city where you live and who you are actually matters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're here in western sydney because those things matter particularly here when we talk about the stresses for sydney and we talk about health services already being under strain in a heatwave event they just get more exacerbated so a shock event actually just shows up what already doesn 't quite work or where the important stress factors are that already exist in the city and they magnify them so that 's why in 100 cities programs now the global resilience cities network we talk about how the shocks and stresses layer together so we put together obviously a program across metropolitan sydney we have all 33 councils mayors involved over these four years we 've pulled together there 's an ambassador for every one of those councils coming together to try and say what do we do about the shocks and stresses in different places in the city we have a strategy oops which was released in 2018 it has five directions and 35 actions today we 're really talking about a whole lot of them but live with the climate and actually getting ready so how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a heat wave and how do we live with the climate better how do we understand heat one of the really we did a big public engagement exercise across sydney and one of the core priorities that came back from the community and this is what these five directions respond to community priorities was a real tangible frustration from the community about a real lack of actual action about adapting to heat and climate and we 're seeing that now in the community story as well it 's coming out more and more but that 's where this program came from um a beautiful example here of a recently delivered housing product and um in in sydney in as it happens in penrith um that i 'm not sure i want to live in so there 's a question for all of us are we making places we want to live in um that 's a good one so i 'm just going to say actually what happens when we deliver places like that is we have a tangible impact on real people people do live in these places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kristen gabriel led um who 's my deputy over here who 's the way of christians is kristin 's work i 'm talking a lot about today this was funded by the office of emergency management through equip grant and through the university of sydney we partnered together actually we did a focus group looking at four different big impacts or big shock events across sydney to try and understand what did the community experience of a shock event not what the insurers told us not what the infrastructure people told us but actually how does the community experience these big events so we looked at heat in penrith um particularly we looked at the experience of the 2016-17 heatwave which you i don 't need to tell you much you can read the numbers which are pretty shocking you know a month pretty much of continuous extreme heat starts to really change the game on actually how livable are some of the places that we 're really making in the methodology for the focus groups we actually gathered together kind of a cross-demographic group of people from across penrith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of differences in age gender income housing type and education so got a pretty good cross spectrum of people it 's not a representative sample but it gave lots of insights and the different types of experiences of heat and some people said oh it didn 't really affect me at all and lots of people said it affected me a lot so i 'm just going to describe a little bit of the process they got to draw three maps in the process of a focus group what how did the heat wave actually impacted impact you what were the things that made it harder what were the barriers and actually what enabled you to do better like what do you need to make it make it easier what helped um really simple questions has anybody ever asked them before not very often is the answer i think when we found got into it so i 'm just going to talk about some of the things that we discovered when we asked those people they put those maps together and then we layered them together and looked at where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are some of the findings um the first one is that the single biggest impact is that it 's too hot and the buildings that we 're providing actually don 't really provide life safety in a heatwave and it makes people really stressed because their life and the way that they normally live it is actually under threat so they have lots of fatigue lethargy inability to get stuff done we all recognise this you 've been in a heatwave but when you 're doing it for a month and your life is really seriously disrupted increasingly as that month goes on you 're getting too hot to care for yourself it 's difficult to do exercise get out and do shopping things like actually cooking food start to get untenable you 're not necessarily going to work if you 're managing other people or caring for people whose lives are really disrupted by temperature and who might have a chronic illness for example and you 're actually already thinking things like actually if the transport links don 't work because then they work less et cetera et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a financial impact so just actually understanding that these problems if you like that we kind of might experience in a small way in a relatively privileged bubble for a lot of people who don 't have access to the same resources as us or don 't have the same building providing the right life safety the impacts are magnified so exacerbating health conditions people stop going out like increased caring responsibilities and those financial impacts start to get very real looking at barriers to coping when you 're starting to think about those you know what kind of resources can you use to cope in these situations actually you need more money you need more money to pay for more air conditioning if you have a blackout you just filled the fridge because you only went out for one week to try and do your shopping and you brought it all in and there you are you got a blackout you just lost it you lost the medicine that was in the fridge to go with it things are starting to get really complicated and you might only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you travel if you 're stuck in the cbd the transport networks go down you have to get home to care for somebody what 's it going to be you know at this point that you are at the whim of the system if you 're in this position the community no they don 't have the buildings that they need they were perfectly able to describe what kind of building and what kind of shelter and services would help them in this situation but they actually could also articulate that they didn 't have them in terms of what enabled them what helps and something we 've discovered through the hunter resiliency network internationally is that the single biggest helping point if you like is actually community connection so how people are not isolated when they have access to people with air conditioning where they have access to pools they have access to friends who support them sharing all those other responsibilities we 've already described the only thing is that they 're not free even going to a shopping centre and walking around it costs you money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might access some of those cool areas for example is usually not free the pool costs money to get into and i don 't know about you but the last time i spent a month with my in-laws was a long time ago and i don 't intend to do it anytime soon again um but that 's actually what lots of people are doing across this part of sydney to cope actually if you can go to someone who 's got air conditioning but then you 're on top of each other and then your social functions are also getting complicated solutions what did they come up with yeah really sensible list these are sorts of things that we 've been talking about but they were able to articulate as well connections refuges information better built environment energy options transport solutions all things that all of you have some control over so when we talk about how that plays out in place at the moment that 's what we 're delivering as a solutions for them i don 't think i need to say we 're not meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn 't solving the problems that they 've really clearly articulated in when we asked them what they needed in order to cope better with heat so there 's all these pieces of the puzzle that need to come in where we actually do we talk about all each and every one of these pieces every piece here has a role to play the trouble is we 're all doing it separately in this example here you can see how all the separate pieces have delivered we 've removed vegetation we 've increased energy use per square meter we 've created an increased temperature microclimate we 're actually delivering heat absorption at scale and we 've actually added in density and reduced airflow that 's the outcome of that product that we collectively are all choosing to create that 's not what we need to deliver so actually if we start with the outcome in mind how can we flip it and start with the community experience at the center whose fault is it is anyone else feeling guilty i am um whose fault is it the trouble is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of all the pieces so we actually we need to work together to understand how the interplay of decisions i make connect the decisions you might make with the connection to decisions that you might make how do those pieces come together so that we can actually make sure that the community experience is at the forefront so my question to each one of us in this room is how are we managing that risk in place how can the place-based view and a user-centred or people-centred approach come forward in the decision-making in the way that your decisions are made in the place you work the community perspective gives a really clear technical accuracy to the outcome of what we are delivering and how can we bring those voices really up front like we did today in the presentation to say this is what this is about this is who this is for am i meeting the outcome and the need of what it is that we are delivering that 's not just a housing product number but a house of people who have to survive through 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question here is how can we bring them in how can all of you bring those people into the story you 're all making good decisions within the rules that you have mostly of course all of you ethically that 's why you 're in this room so how can we do that with that purpose and that community outcome much more clearly articulated in the way that we deliver it i started with resilience as a team sport and i really mean it i 'm really great it 's really great to see so many different types of people here some of the projects we have running in sydney that we can start to see emerging out of both state government local government but also through some of the industry bodies is starting to bring people together we do need to participate learn from each other and particularly learn from the community to understand how we can do a better job thanks very much you"

bear one step two step three under there I might go around the haystack with the little mouths around your baby 's belly button round and round the haystack when the little mouse one step two step into his little house bit of a tickle under the belly button shall we do that again round and round the haystack went the little mouse one step two step into his little house we might count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears fingers and toes one little two little three little fingers pull it to five little six little fingers seven little eight little nine little fingers ten fingers on my hands what about a toast one little two little three little toes fall it to five little six little toes seven little eight little nine little toes ten toes on my feet now I think there might be a B on the foot this is a little rhyme on my foot there is a B now he 's climbing up on me past my belly past my nose on my head where my hair grow but my head that is a B now he 's climbing down me past my belly past my knees on my toes tickling me shall we do that one again on my foot that is a B now he 's climbing up on me past my belly past my nose on my head where my hair grows on my head that is a B now he 's climbing down me past my belly past my knees on my toes dick I mean good little tickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers along we might start over on this hand here come to the middle and then come out and then we 're gonna do legs and tummy slowly slowly very slowly creeps the garden snail slowly slowly very slowly up the wooden rail quickly quickly quickly quickly run the little mouse go a click quickly very quickly all around the house oh it 's good it 's quickly it 's here we go again slowly slowly very slowly went there garden snail slowly slowly very slowly up the wooden rail quickly quickly quickly quickly when the little mouse quickly quickly quickly quickly round about the house well done learn about some finger play songs why don 't we start with some open shut them open shut open shut them give a little clap open shut them open shut them lay them in your lap creep them creep them creep them creep them right up to your chin open wide your little mouth but do not let them eat shake them them shake them shake them shake them just like this roll them roll them roll them roll them blow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Incy Wincy Spider well get off and get together like this Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain and washed poor Incy out out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain so Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again we could do the same one it 's a bit of a creeping up the tummy Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain and washed poor Incy out out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain so Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again what about a little Peter Rabbit you might have a fly upon his nose little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his nose little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his nose little Peter

    "text": "[Music] good morning thank you so much for having me it 's really fantastic to be here i have come here all the way from the u.s to learn from australia i am here on a fulbright scholarship which is a program of the united states government to send researchers to other countries around the world and to bring researchers to the united states i think this year there 's 140 australian researchers in the u.s on a fulbright exchange and we are here to learn from each other so i have come here to find out more about what 's happening in australian cities i 'm a scientist who studies nature-based solutions to heat drought and climate change and i want to share some case studies with you and to do that we are going to go to the other side of the world for a little while so most of the population of the united states lives in the eastern part of north america because it 's wet but i live in the western part so the cities that i work in they really have more in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the u.s even though a lot of the literature and the best practices on nature-based solutions to climate change come from the east they come from the large cities that are in the forested wet part of the u.s we really can learn more lessons from australian cities those of us who live in that semi-aired western region than we can from these east coast cities in the u.s um and specifically i 've lived and worked in cities all around the great basin desert of north america which is the largest desert in north america i lived in las vegas i have lived and done quite a lot of work in los angeles in the southwestern side there of the continent lots of similarities between los angeles and coastal sydney it 's one of the reasons i came here and i currently work and and live in salt lake city the red dot there the other side of the great basin desert it 's quite hot and dry and this is what the natural ecosystem of salt lake city looks like so before salt lake city was built this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average rainfall is about 420 millimeters per year and that is not enough for forests so it 's naturally a shrubland so you can imagine it 's quite hot most of the rainfall is experienced in the winter so the summers really have very little precipitation at all however despite all this i have to say that salt lake city hasn 't had as much as many problems with extreme heat recently and in part that is because this city is massively irrigated and so when european settlers arrived in the salt lake valley in 1847 they immediately diverted water and there has been a huge transformation of the landscape to a really really wet landscape all of the trees in the background here are planted you can see in the foreground of this image how dry the unmanaged landscape is but we have extensive lawns in all of these cities in the u.s um and all most of these trees well these trees are non-native because there are not native trees in this valley it is naturally a shrubland um but unfortunately this approach is not sustainable so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscapes are really over irrigated people are applying more water than the landscapes actually need and these trees even though they 're well irrigated some species are dying back because they 're not really well suited for this kind of climate and so what we 've realized is that there is a trade-off between cooling and water use and we need to optimize this trade-off so i 'm traveling around the world looking at different cities this year trying to find out how people are approaching this problem los angeles has been experiencing severe drought southern california all of these cities of the great basin their water supply is basically snow melt so as the climate warms our water supply is dwindling and in 2015 there was a major drought this satellite image is showing the change in snowpack from 2006 to 2015 when basically there was almost no snowpack at all in the sierra nevada mountains very tall mountain range it 's the water supply for millions of people in california and it is it 's going away in salt lake city what we 're seeing is um a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on this massive lake and it is the receiving waters for the watershed the waters of salt lake city do not run to the ocean they run to this inland lake and it 's drying up and it 's drying up not just because of lower precipitation and higher evaporation it 's drying up because we 're diverting a lot of rainfall to irrigation and that water would have gone into the lake so researchers have shown that mismanagement of water is contributing to this problem so we need a solution going forward that can optimize the resources that we have in the climates where we live and so the strategies that i want to talk about today are these four strategies and these are to use what we have to draw on the natural amenities that already exist in our landscapes um and to use local design themes that is to design for the climate and the ecosystem in which we live multifunctionality of landscapes there 's not much space in a lot of our cities for nature-based solutions to cooling and climate change so we need these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them to cool and we also want them to achieve other goals that we have they might be to reduce energy consumption for aesthetics for social benefits for recreation and we need these landscapes to do all of these things at the same time and then finally i 'm going to talk about um the monitoring for of these systems in many cases and i 'm going to show you cases where we are testing nature-based solutions that may not work because we 're looking at new approaches trying to solve problems that haven 't been solved before and when we 're in this kind of experimental mode implementing nature-based solutions then we need to really carefully monitor the outcomes and use what we 've learned in an adaptive planning process so we can quickly transfer that knowledge to the next project because we don 't have a lot of time to wait um you know to learn about one project 10 years down the road we need to monitor excuse me monitor the outcome of one project and immediately transfer knowledge to the next project and these ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pretty much everything that i 'm going to tell you today um it was very well described by the landscape architect ian mccarg in his seminal book design with nature this book is from 1969 and he was a scottish landscape architect he was trained at harvard and taught at the university of pennsylvania and he even back in the 60s put together highly interdisciplinary teams of designers of landscape architects of different kinds of scientists and ecologists to find design solutions to environmental problems and the approaches that he use have transformed our tools in science in geography and in design he carefully mapped different features of the landscapes and looked at these maps in layers and this became the basis of gis and his site assessments prior to design projects became the basis for environmental impact assessments and so a lot of his projects had to do with water use carefully looking at the natural water flows of landscapes looking at where wetlands were located looking at the infiltration rates of soils looking at where different vegetation types were located and these projects at the time were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he designed have been shown to be several degrees cooler than the surrounding landscapes and so we know that vegetation and green infrastructure and blue infrastructure provides cooling benefits obviously open bodies of water provide evaporative cooling and vegetation is so key for evaporative cooling because the surface layer of the soil very quickly dries out but the deeper vegetation is rooted the more it can pump water from the deep soil into the atmosphere for additional evaporative cooling and for this reason trees are extremely important they 're deeply rooted and of course they also provide shade and in a lot of projects the shading effect can be the most important effect for improving human thermal comfort so there is a place on the landscape where you find all these features together at the same time you have water bodies you have trees you have shading you have evaporative cooling um and those are riparian areas the forests that grow along waterways so the case study that i 'm going to talk to you today is one that i 'm very excited about and it starts with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly protected natural area this stream is called red butte creek and it um it has open water and it has trees it 's the coolest part of the landscape and i didn 't pay a whole lot of attention to this creek for many years while i worked at the university of utah i have to confess and it was brought to my attention by my colleague professor jim elringer he is shown here in this picture with a group of students and he tasked the students with taking a look at this creek and looking at a lot of its functions its ecological functions but also the social dimensions of the creek so the students did a project which they designed themselves where they surveyed the campus community and they asked them does this creek pass through our campus does it pass through the university of utah and 40 percent of the respondents said no or i don 't know and that 's really striking because yes the creek does pass through the campus and it 's it passes above ground it 's not one of those creeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right there you can see it right and so why is this when i looked at this i was really struck by how this is a design problem this was when i really became interested in urban design because the problem with this creek well there 's nothing wrong with the creek but the problem is the interface between the creek and the built environment and when this campus was developed in the 1960s the buildings were built to face away from the creek and there are no roads leading to it there are no paths there are no access points and people are kept away really the creek is just used as a receptacle for storm water discharge and yet this is the coolest part of the landscape and lots of cities have capitalized on this right there 's a movement now to revitalize areas along rivers and streams because people want to be there and they contribute to urban revitalization and economic development so there 's a big opportunity here and this is one way to design with nature we 're taking advantage of a feature that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn 't already there now this area of of our campus you can see it has a lot of impervious surfaces so the discharge of storm water into this creek it 's really high so not only are we sending people away from the coolest and most comfortable part of the landscape and the most beautiful part of the landscape but we 're degrading the creek because all of these impervious surfaces send a lot of runoff into the creek and that runoff causes erosion so this is a very common problem in urban streams they usually after storm events after big rain events i think you all just had lot of rain and these urban waterways they have huge velocities of water and pollution because there 's pollutants on those parking lots and on those streets um and so we 're not only not taking advantage of this amenity but we are degrading this amenity okay so in the meantime our campus is in a hot and dry area and when it was time to look at the master plan for the campus groups came and surveyed the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spaces that are underutilized because they have no shade and they are hot in the summer and yet like every campus i 'm sure this is common here space is at a premium and we are building buildings and we are encroaching upon the remaining open spaces so open space is valuable and yet they 're not usable because they 're too hot this seems to be a common problem for you as well and so we decided to approach this problem from a master planning and design perspective and we engaged a whole group of people at the university to develop a vision for the riparian corridor along the stream and this was led by robin rothfetter who at that time was a phd student in urban planning now he 's a professor at the university of wisconsin and he led a community engaged planning process where we wanted to re-envision what the stream could be and originally the scientists who kind of started this process they wanted to restore the stream back to some kind of pristine wilderness condition so their first instinct was to fence it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild but i think we 've learned now that nature-based solutions don 't work when we separate people from nature and so that is not the approach that we took in the end the rendering that you see here is actually student work students who re-envision spaces along the creek it turns out that there is a physical therapy clinic an orthopedic center is present right on the creek and though spaces along the creek if there were trails there they could be used for rehabilitation for therapy but there aren 't any um so there 's just lots of opportunity here so we wrote this strategic vision and you know it was a little bit pie in the sky it 's a vision but we wanted to start implementing the plan and we needed a place along the creek that was scheduled for renovation a building that was either scheduled for construction or some building that needed to be renovated and it turned out that there was a parcel along the creek that was scheduled for renovation so this is the creek and this pink area here it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow any construction which we didn 't we actually did not have any regulation like that you could build right up to the creek so first of all we made a buffer so that the riparian forest could be preserved and then it turned out that this parcel here which is the largest parcel on the creek it the building on that parcel was scheduled for renovation and with those funds come funds for re-landscaping so this was our first opportunity to put this vision into practice and this is the site this is what the site looked like so it was a really really large lawn one of the largest lawns on campus and it was really irrigated in the summer this lawn is irrigated every day and it 's so over irrigated that if you take a walk in the lawn in the middle of summer you know it 's really hot hasn 't rained in months there 's standing water at the surface because it 's over irrigating it 's not draining it 's fertilized there are pesticides applied to this lawn that water is discharging directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserving the creek and nobody used this space in the summer because it was too hot there 's no shade so the building you 're looking at is the headquarters of myriad genetics the genetics testing company and there 's another building on this site called the williams building which is an energy company and that building needed to be renovated and so this whole area is actually a science and technology park we call it research park you have several of these in australia as well and these are places that are meant to inspire innovation they 're meant to inspire technological breakthroughs and commercialization of research so there are a lot of companies here that are working on solving various problems in biomedical sciences and energy and in the environmental sciences so it 's a pretty good place to test some new nature-based solutions for climate change and so we wanted to redesign this whole lawn area we wanted to get this lawn out and put something in its place that would help us solve some of our environmental problems okay so one thing we wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 've learned here in australia is that um you all call this water sensitive urban design we have other names for stormwater great infrastructure and the problem where i live is that water sensitive urban designs they 're lacking a very successful approach to optimizing the water problem in that these designs are either really really devoid of vegetation they 're really rocky like this one at my university which is not very good for cooling obviously it 's going to contribute to heating also it 's not aesthetically pleasing and people don 't really like these rock scapes or we have green infrastructure like this one this is a very famous green roof on the the roof of the church conference center and it 's beautiful it 's green and it 's planted with a lot of native grasses but it 's irrigated really really frequently so the challenge is to find vegetation that can withstand the summer drought without a lot of irrigation so that we 're saving water and we 're also optimizing cooling we don 't really have a very good design for the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions even though that region is really large a lot of the designs that we use um come from the wet part of the u.s so this is a bioswale design that is optimized for the chesapeake bay region of the united states there 's a big literature on green infrastructure of the chesapeake bay a lot of researchers have studied it but that area is really wet and so these systems are really shallowly rooted our native vegetation because one might think ah the solution to this problem is to simply plant the vegetation that 's native right it can persist under those climate conditions without watering but that vegetation is really really deeply rooted and so this sagebrush species that is the species in that natural landscape it can live in salt lake city inside the city this is a picture of it actually growing in front of my house but it can only survive where the soil is really really deep and water sensitive urban design usually has relatively shallow soil because there 's going to be a gravel layer underneath to quickly move water down through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimize this problem the native vegetation won 't survive under those conditions how should we um how should we vegetate these sites so we implemented this whole site as an experiment but it 's an experiment that 's also functional so if you go to many of our ecological experiments if you come to a university and you go to a field station and there 's some kind of experiment going on you 'll see a bunch of plots and rectangles and it 's not very aesthetically pleasing they 're not it 's a place to do science that 's not a place where you 'd want to go sit down and eat your lunch but this is a functional building the residents of this building need outdoor space and we needed a design that was beautiful that would invite people to spend time in the landscape and where we could also do some scientific testing so we engaged in a participatory design process um with mark morris the principal landscape architect of the design firm vota my colleague sarah hinners the director of the center for ecological planning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who manage the real estate on this property scientists of different flavors including social scientists who could speak to people 's needs to spend time outdoors and we designed a landscape that 's multifunctional the top of the landscape is a garden and it 's this is under construction now so i can only show you a rendering the top of the landscape will be a garden with paths and shade where people can walk where people can sit but underneath the landscape is a replicated scientific experiment testing two different solutions to the water sensitive urban design problem one involving native species and one involving common commonly cultivated garden species and it 's set up so that we can get really really good scientific data from this study and one of these designs may not work and then we can take what we 've learned and implement it into the next study so we asked the the occupants of the building um there were surveys done to ask them what they wanted and we asked what existing features were worth keeping from the landscape and not surprisingly they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creek and a place to view the creek so the natural amenities of the site we asked them what potential new features they wanted to be added and they um said flowers so that is more of a cultivated garden type landscape and and places to spend time outside tables benches built amenities so that they could actually enjoy the landscape and so this is sort of a mix we are they 're natural amenities that people want to preserve but then there are other amenities that people want added that kind of combine the built and natural environment together and then finally the site is really well instrumented so that we can measure how effective this site is at absorbing storm water we want to measure the success of the plant species we want to measure the state of the creek and how much pollution and water ends up going into the creek so lots of scientific instrumentation as well okay so people were pretty excited by this idea and we had never done anything like this before after a couple of years um going through this design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire research park so um our research park was i believe founded in 1968 it 's one of the older research parks research parks started at stanford university in the 50s and they were a place to commercialize university discovery and to promote discovery so ours is pretty large it 's 130 hectares in size there are 48 private companies that rent or own buildings there are 81 university departments and most of those are biomedical because there 's a huge health sciences campus at that location and 14 000 people work at the research park so it is very extensive but people were so excited by the approach to designing with nature at that initial parcel that jonathan bates who is the executive director of the research park and really a visionary in this area he decided that the new master plan for research park would entirely focus on ecological amenities and designing with nature going forward that this would be the theme of research park going forward and our research park has been really successful there are a number of companies startup companies that have really bridged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park is pretty well known in the united states i would say but going forward you know there um there 's lots of research parks now so how can we distinguish ourselves how can we be unique and one way is to really draw on the excitement that people have for designing with nature and for nature-based solutions and make that the core of the of our identity and so the master plan for the park focuses on innovation because that is what research park is for so can we use nature based solutions to foster innovation and the hypothesis is that we can so the ecological framework of this master plan is intended to do a number of things beyond cooling and beyond climate change mitigation in addition to that if we can use cooling strategies to bring people outside and to bring them together to connect different places with active transportation then we can combine an ecological framework with an innovation framework so the ecological framework has several dimensions to it one is to protect the natural landscape that 's is still that still remains and those natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they need to be managed and they need to be preserved and that those foothills are prone to fire as your ecosystems are as well so careful management of the remaining natural landscape and preserving and putting into place the plan for revitalizing the creek that creek that runs along the research park in addition to implementing the strategic plan for the creek people were so excited by the new vision for the creek that they have now decided to daylight a creek that is buried underneath research park so this cholera stream really is a stream that none of us knew existed because it is buried in a pipe and the idea now is to bring it to the surface and now we 'll add another riparian corridor and this is going to be the place where we 're going to get the most bang for our buck and cooling strategies right because it 's got blue infrastructure it 's got trees it 's got shading it 's got evaporative cooling the plan is also to put more water sensitive urban design along all of the streets along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to have all of these transportation corridors including new active transportation corridors including new trails and bike paths along these streams to create a new center of the research park that will be the its ecological heart a new green space that will be the center of connectivity for people and then finally this connective network i want to talk about active transportation a little bit because i 'm really interested in nature-based solutions that combine climate adaptation with climate mitigation and the great thing about cooling strategies is that you can do these at the same time because when it 's too hot for people to use active transportation they can 't be outside to walk to bike to wait for the bus then we 're just forcing people to drive their cars so when cooling strategies that are adapting to a warming climate can also save energy and those are the features that i think are really exciting when we plant trees around buildings and we can lower the air temperature of buildings we can reduce the energy use for air conditioning and so we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat but we 're avoiding future climate change we 're actually doing something to um to make a difference in climate change and this is where i think combining nature-based solutions with connectivity is really key okay so i 'm just going to sum up here that in in a lot of these projects we should look for the natural amenities that we have i mean it 's almost always going to be efficient and cost effective to work with what you 've got rather than completely redesigning a landscape from scratch and ian mccarg showed this decades ago his designs were cost efficient instead of building new water infrastructure he worked with water flows that already existed and these natural amenities they can be tuned to local design themes in the great basin desert there really wasn 't a lot of attention paid to creating design themes assemblages of plants a sense of place connected to the great basin people kept importing design themes from other places but people get really excited when they are connected to the local ecosystem in which they live and this is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide climate benefits and they can inspire and the idea of nature as inspiration has really i think revitalized the whole idea of our research park and the whole idea of economic development actually so the monitoring and adaptive adaptive planning portion of these projects i would say is newer and that is something that if you go back to the original designing with nature concept there wasn 't enough monitoring of the outcomes of those projects people are now going back to the developments that ian mccarg designed decades ago and finding that they 're really functional and we would have learned a lot faster had we done that monitoring at the outset and so these collaborations between different kinds of scientists different kinds of researchers both natural scientists and social scientists and designers are the way that we can gain this knowledge quickly enough to cope with these changes that are coming that are really fast okay so the master plan for research park is on the web this is the url it is open for public comment you could actually read the master plan and comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see comments from here from australia but they would be pleasantly surprised so check out the plan i would love to talk to you all for the rest of today i will be here all day and you can also reach me here by my email and i look forward to meeting all of you thank you very much you"

    "text": "you [Music] so today I just want to talk to you about from the research perspective and the future research perspective of that of where we 're going we 've heard a lot about and it 's it 's true what rod said and others have said is we had a lot of information we can actually move what we need to move forward we need to change what we 're doing but at the same time there 's changes for things to come in that are coming over the horizon or have the potential come over the horizon which we should be taking into consideration as we 're going so I 'm going to cover where we 're going with that I 'm going to start with the fact that I guess everybody here knows about CSR a Commonwealth Scientific industrial research organization we 've been going for on about a hundred years large government-funded research organization and as part of what we have to do we occasionally stop and look at where we where we 're going and what we 're doing in are we still doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do it and a couple years ago we went through a major one and we were looking at all the different parts and one of them was what we were doing in urban and what we actually determined was that a lot of research that we do has an influence into the urban area the number one that we always spook is Wi-Fi we all know that CSIRO developed Wi-Fi and it 's made a major difference the way the world goes but we do a lot of things that have done a lot of things in urban water in energy and other things and and we all this research comes in and when we actually started to bring everybody together discuss the urban all our business units actually said actually yes a lot of our research has an input put into the urban environment the only one that actually hasn 't responded like that is actually the app the space business unit probably too busy looking at the Stars but we think they 'll come in because they are the ones who develop Wi-Fi so we think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and we realized that we needed to do things differently and a bit like the way our Urban development 's exist at the moment we just do our research in the way of no we look at their sewage or water supplies energy we look at it as a bit and see how it fits in and that 's how in fact our cities all develop we get those bits go in here and we saw bits from rod and others that people talk back and forwards forget the approval for the sewage the approval for the energy inputs and there 's very little discussion across the different areas of what happens and we realized that we needed to do things differently to have an influence on what was going elsewhere looks very convoluted don 't get too excited about it except for the fact that you know we need to have a systems approach if we 're talking water what 's the influences on people on the environment on the energy if we 're talking energy there 's huge inputs across the other ways the urban greening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit we need to look at it so that we can take the place and we can actually move our urban environments from where we are at the moment to a new place and try and move as fast as we can to that new place keeping Australia relevant in the global facility and of course that 's what everybody else needs to do so as part of that whole planning process we came up with this concept that I mean it 's nothing new but for CSIRO we would start to do our research in an urban living lab approach principally because we didn 't want to do just research in the laboratory and then try and push it out as researchers as we all know Australia has a problem moving research from the laboratory to uptake it 's a huge problem for our order for our nation and we want to do it in real world conditions not only for uptake of our research but also there 's this and I deal with it quite frequently we talk to people we all we can do these things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in the way of what we 've got to do you can 't delay it it 's because there 's this common concept that see researchers are gonna come in and say oh this is gonna be great just give me ten years I don 't really research it to the nth degree and I 'll give you all this data that you can work with and and by the way I 'll get a couple of conferences and journal publications out of it and of course everybody go but I 've got to get this building up now which is the reality is and the truth is some of us are like that but the reality is we can work side by side and so we need to work as researchers and learn how to work side-by-side with industry and government about how to improve things so to date we have three urban living labs we have one up in Darwin one in Western Sydney here and then we have the old CSIRO agricultural site engine and era which being federal government always moves a little bit slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be active very soon the other two are already moving ahead what we also realize is this is great for us to do our research as CSI wrote national research organization federal government says go out and do this but the other thing the federal government said which we had also recognized ourselves anyway was we can 't do this alone we 're not that great a huge research organization so it 's a place that we can actually facilitate so we it 's actually an open facilitation encourage anybody who has a great idea that they want to test out so we 're not talking about things that we know work now we want to see stuff that come in that is just coming off the lab that is we 're not quite sure how this is going to work in the real world and we want to test in the real world so we 're open for an inviting and partnering with other universities with industry with government in these places to test things out the other thing that we know from a lot of consultation from experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time it city development and and morphing and stuff it 's not like a mobile phone the change and the technology of mobile phone has been huge cities change a lot slower so we need ways we can get in and test these things out to get them in as quickly as possible otherwise you can miss the boat the 10 years is not feasible for getting innovation into cities it 's just too slow so I 'm just gonna talk about these two urban living labs quickly trying to keep to the the time limit so Sydney 's Science Park it 's actually four hundred and 40 hectares out in western Sydney three kilometers from the Badgerys Creek air Airport within the aerotropolis it 's owned by a company Celestino develop a company Celestino who we 've had a partnership with a long time for a long time about various things and when we were testing out this concept of the urban living lab and we went around to a number of our stakeholders I said we got this new place Sydney Science Park we think it fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a developer the developer is keen to deal with all sorts of researchers and other things and again we are facilitating this place it 's a green open cow paddock I think I can safely say it 's not best quality soil it 's been used the cow paddock for a long time it 's got the chance to do things Celestino see it as they have their own vision of turning into a vibrant place of over 150 thousand people living and working on site we 've got the chance to go in and test things as they go on so it 's a great green opens green field but not all places in the in Australia a green field that need research so Darwin came up Darwin has got money from the city deals federal government funding city deals again Darwin has the chance to be the Gateway to Asia on the north it has its own issues it has a unique climate as we all know depending could be 2 it could be 3 5 or 9 seasons depending whether you take just the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take the First Nations who have a very rich form of seasons in fact we ran a symposium in December there and we experienced the change of the seasons while we were there the first two days I 'm from Brisbane and I 'm thinking lecture this is actually easier better than Brisbane at man what 's all the thing about and then stepped out in the winds I went my god this is terrible because the dew point had just gone straight up after the thunderstorms which you can see my photos there but thunderstorms and of course they 've got um unique wildlife and tourism potentials but they want to accentuate on may need to move forward so this is another place where we can work with which is already established city that needs to and wants to change significantly and what 's one of the common things that we have is and of course fitting with this presentation is urban heat we all know about heat related health risks and and hot points and Android and others have shown this we know about the fact we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it 's a in fact this is quite a simple one probably too simple it actually requires a huge input of different parts and that 's what I 'll show case that 's where these ribbon living labs are going Darwin just as an example it 's as I said it has huge amounts have urban heat in a dry tropical climate although as I said it can change from a dry tropical climate to a very sticky wet tropical climate very quickly there 's been some really great heat mapping by the University of New South Wales showing some really hard places so thought is yeah these are the areas to to green and and the likes in a way fortuitously it sounds strange to say fortuitously in 2018 so I claim Marcus came through and Darwin lost 40% of its tree canopy this gives us an opportunity to then go back and say is it just trees how do we get trees back so it 's not just the trees but how do we get new trees in how do we facilitate it what else do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water is it infrastructure with better Adobe or Adobe so everywhere you want to pronounce it all these different things and it 's going to be this systems approach that works together it 's not a simple let 's put in more trees even trees with great canopies and it 's the type of trees we need to put in most of the trees that were lost and non-natives the shallower roots that can 't take these cyclonic conditions that come true and of course Western Sydney we 've already had a fair bit of better I want to lead to it too much it 's been hot and it 's getting hotter then the middle one there is actually some press releases that happen when we first launched the Sydney Science Park urban living lab and it just in a way fortuitously happened while we had a large stretch of I think it was a week-and-a-half a 40 degree heat and the media really picked up on this and the interest from the community was huge in the fact that they we reached over a million people with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really moving towards that so we 're starting looking at what can we do around urban heat is it greening but I probably should have changed this from greenie as I was thinking through it to actually cooling for decreasing urban heat and you know could be trees getting trees in and it 's other parts and where we 're looking with our urban living labs is both that as I said that green open space which is going to be changed to urban and what can we do to design it from the bottom up and learn as we go through that that learning can go out to the rest of Australia but also like Darwin where we can take in existing points and partner with people who are doing research elsewhere to compare knowledge to actually put things into existing infrastructure one of the things we 're doing just at the moment is actually desert Sydney Science Park we 've got sensors in so we 're actually collecting baseline data because as these urban living labs are gathering momentum and people are coming to a saying we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do research there we need something to compare to so we know we 're making a benefit this is Geoff who 's actually here at the moment you can see him at our stall and he 's actually looking around at these things probably from what he told me chasing a calf out of this site because they 've got cows on site still and the cows get into everything and they tend to I had out some water sensors which you 'll see some examples of and they managed to push through star pickets and angles and flatten the whole thing chew on wise the things that we put up with as researchers sometimes is is difficult so we 've got baseline we also have a base getting baseline around weather and an air quality we 're getting baseline around water quality so then we can start to map what 's coming from where there 's one of the systems at the cows trash and I had to put a great fence around it and we can work out what sort of water and how we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things Josh point out it 's planned properly where it is and we can actually work towards smart systems that supply the right type of water at the right place at the right time not just a blanket approach but it 's actually providing the topic we don 't need to be providing potable already water to a tree trees don 't need that they 'd but we have to provide it in smart ways and when you move on from that then we could actually also look at the energy so we 're looking at wind supposably out in western sydney is no good although we 've got a wind turbine being put up at the moment and the first two times after they delivered the facilities on-site it was blind strongest I 've said it 's been blowing out there for a long time but what can we get out of wind that couldn 't be part of the whole picture we 've got core solar and how much solar radiation we get on-site so we can design to make this as as energy neutral as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we do about the infrastructure to mean that that infrastructure again I 'm not talking about what we know already but what can we trial that 's innovations coming across the horizon that 's the aim that we have and then finally just to finish off this is by no means go in six months and then run away the intention is that we 're doing things for long periods of time and the way that we took a talk about it research is of course we put outputs that 's the really research results the things that we put out then from the learnings of that actually could make a change so we 'll see the outcomes where people are building different buildings in different ways and we 've seen those those been built and elsewhere so the learnings are spreading out we 're comparing contrasting and finally we have the impacts we were getting better livability and the likes and of course in the outputs nothing is perfect in research we learn as we go so there 's feedback loops and we can keep on improving because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could talk a lot about this as you can tell I 've given you a snapshot here happy to talk to anybody about this over the rest of the day thank you very much [Applause]"

    "text": "you [Music] esteem we 're esteemed members of the Academy friends I would like to thank you all for your welcome and I would like to acknowledge as as well as previous speakers that we do stand on Aboriginal land and I would also like to acknowledge that you 've all been through an extraordinary traumatic experience the last few months which we all watched with you know our breaths kind of held what you guys went through and I would like to say that it 's a real kind of trauma for all of us and that we are kind of standing behind you in all of this kind of really difficult loss that you have had and also to acknowledge hardness as the ground zero for for heat and that 's another extraordinary thing so thanks for inviting me I have a lot to learn and I will try to say a few things about Athens which actually has several similarities we are a region with 64 municipalities about the city of Athens has about 700 thousand residents but it 's used by 2 or 3 million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the major things are their administrative etc this is more or less what it looks like it 's at the center of this area which is relatively near the sea but it 's landlocked there 's a municipality it has an extraordinary density it 's 16,000 17,000 people almost per square kilometer which Paris is about 20,000 which is the highest density city in Europe and then a couple of cities in Spain are right after Athens as you can see most of the buildings were suddenly built between the 1950s and the 1980s there was an explosion of the city so it 's very unmarked Italy built and about 70 percent actually now it 's even more it 's closer to 80 percent of the of the city is known water-permeable surfaces which of course creates problems with the urban heat island as far as the green data is we have a rather small percentage of green area less than seven square meters per inhabitants we have a hundred and thirty thousand trees ninety four of them are in straight lines and a real majority in mulberries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very uneven redistribution here you can see a mapping that we did in Athens which as previous people mentioned you can clearly see where the dark the dark blue areas which is the really low income poverty line income households are which is the west and north side is the part which has less green and it 's the side which has the most high temperatures as well and this is true like you can read the city as soon as you can see where the green is and where there is no green you can like bet that that 's where the more vulnerable economically and socially populations actually live all over so in 2019 there was a study that came out that that said that Athens is one of the most kind of cities that will face the greater impact in Europe from heat waves out of five hundred seventy one cities and Moody 's also in the December of 2018 basically said that if we don 't do anything about our heat like heat adaptation we 're going to face serious kind of credits issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have about fifteen to twenty five days above 36 degrees Celsius which is projected to rise to well over twenty five days by 2050 these are the projections average two percent two degree Celsius rise of temperatures I mean you can see it we have an herb heat island which is very very strong we have the difference during the the night can be 5 degrees between the center of Athens and the and the first kind of suburbs which goes up to 10 degrees during the day can go up to 10 degrees during the day we have about 200 deaths per year that are related to high temperatures electricity increases we have a high level of energy poverty like 25% of people suffer and they 're not able to use we also went through an economic crisis and the recession and all you guys probably heard about that so so what is kind of interesting that nobody the commercial activity declines which we 've seen this is a tendency also in cities in general but what 's interesting which people don 't often think in cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that we had like these different illnesses like the West Nile virus and dengue fever and stuff like that which we didn 't have before because of mosquitoes that are much more now because of high temperatures and the fact that in the winter we don 't have really cold kind of temper and different kind of mosquitoes have also moved to our country but also there 's a particular bug that we discovered this summer that has affected our mulberry trees which are 25% of our street trees and already 1,300 trees have been affected I put an extra zero there and and 350 have already died so this could be a real change it could be a real change in the city if we start kind of really losing mulberries in a really large so this is an interest another interesting kind of issue of heat so then we started in 2016 I think together with Sydney to r2 there is in the process of creating a resilient strategy and we went to the people which is what we didn 't of course the people did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people actually were more ready to acknowledge it than the political kind of establishments we created their resilience strategy this is a map it has four pillars the green city a proactive city vibrant city and an open city with different actions in the green city we have a whole climate adaptation action plan which is basically a heat mitigation plan which has about 29 actions and then we have a climate mitigation climate a mitigation plan and an average ripple mitigation roadmap and I will speak about the heat mitigation here I just wanted to give you kind of like there where it all belongs these are the four basic pillars in what we 're trying to to achieve which is to enhance the city 's green and blue infrastructure to improve the build environment mitigate heat to protect public health in the most vulnerable citizens and to raise public awareness through this campaign that we call cool Athens and these are specific kind of targets that we agreed with with the people of the municipality and and the people from the city in kind of working together that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put them as specific goals for 2030 like for example that every time that we regenerates a public space it will have at least 20% more green that there will be that we will try to connect green areas to create green corridors so that we have more air movement that we would have 50 reduction of drinking water for irrigation and so now I 'm gonna tell you about the actions that we started implementing first I 'll talk about the blue and green infrastructure and I will start by a loan that we managed to get because of the strategy of the resilience strategy it was a bigger loan but we managed to get a specific loan from the European Investment Bank called NC FF and we were the first country that did so it 's called natural capital finance facility which is only for nature based solutions in blue and green infrastructure and and I 'm I 'm putting this project first because it 's five million and five hundred thousand x for studies and the interest is very very low but I 'm putting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green infrastructure so you know this is like an example of something that was difficult to achieve and I think it was it 's an important kind of issue to point out it it 's it 's five major four major projects in Athens that we have kind of identified and there is money the five hundred thousand years to create studies for them that then we 'll go into implementation with the five million the another very important project is lycabettus hill which is a hill in the center of Athens right across from the Acropolis that people really love we went into a very extensive community engagement and high level and low level and like about a year and a half we worked on this with the two major universities and they rebuild by design a kind of a team that came from from the US and another University and like about 1800 people were involved to create a vision and specific actions for the future of the hill and the first things that we actually are implementing is again at nature kind of based things one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash floods which totally eroded after long periods of drought the hills so depleting the soil and the and the green reefs capital of the hill and so we kind of did anti erosion work and and we took out all the asphalt and created like a it 's about three kilometers of asphalt that went up and down the hill we kind of took it out and put nature-based kind of materials for it and and we have like a whole plan of kind of slowly taking cars off of the hill and giving priority to biodiversity mostly in on the hill this was a project that I think talking to back you have created an even better version of it here in Sydney which is to create all possible multiple ways of cool neighborhood and testing them out and seeing from cool roofs and cool ass for like covers for asphalt like cool asphalt to pocket parks taking cars away shading materials can green walls like all of them and having them at different combinations to see what works and what doesn 't work by having like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very beginning just testing different products so we have we 're like really at the beginning of it another issue which actually was something that we Paris has really focused on this as a resilience action they call it school yard oasis they 've identified because Paris is also very densely built like Athens that they 're the spaces of school yards can be the spaces that can create microclimate like tiny parks for the city so if you have 700 schools you can actually create like a acupuncture for the city which can create different and the urban forests mapping which is which we don 't have and we have started kind of creating which can allow us to assess and maintain properly our urban forests and and try to find what kind of species where etcetera etcetera and and then them the I 'm moving very quickly to the blue infrastructure which is that we created a really important partnership with a main water and sewage company which is half public half private and we started putting public fountains in in Athens the other thing is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of usage in the municipality to create a blue footprint to create more sustainable management of water in the municipality we discovered that we have like this amazing aqueduct from 100 AD that actually takes water out of the aquifer and we throw it into the garbage into the George and we are starting to tap into it to irrigate and to so it 's a like an important resource that is a backup resource for us to cut using drinkable water to stop using drinkable water we have created a a mobile unit that takes that you can put it anywhere in green space that takes Seward raw like brown water and turns into water for irrigation and finally the last thing is like it has to do with what we have done for Public Health we created an application which is called extrema it 's it 's an application that you can put in your data which is basically where you are if you 're male or female your age and whether you have chronic illness or medical or your daily medical treatment and depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalized risk this is based on data that we get from satellites and in collaboration with the National Observatory of Athens and the University Medical the Medical School who gave us who created basically this kind of mapping we of risk assessment for Athens we have created this and Paris got really excited and Paris copied it and made it better and and then Rotterdam also adopted it and there is like extrema Rotterdam and then Milano is now doing it and so now they 're thinking of creating one for Europe so anywhere you can go you can actually access this information and the good thing is that it 's not just for you you can put your grandmother or your whatever and it tells you if they 're in risk and there 's a map to show to tell you where they should go to take protection where there is air conditioning or where there is like the closest kind of lowest temperatures that you can go to to take cover and these this was part of a cool Athens thing which like you guys we created a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in English of what to do and we keep giving it out every year and we also did this NFC tags that you can put your phone and you don 't have to download the app but it gives you all the information about heat and and risk and also we put it in these areas where we have a lot of refugees and immigrants living in apartments in camps and in places where they go because that 's also a very kind of vulnerable community and thank you very much that 's it you"

something that they deserve here in paris you know rather than going to the city together 100 and that 's the thing this is something that feels like it 's been picked up dragged out of the city or out of melbourne we 've been compared to melbourne quite a lot yeah a little bit to sydney one person actually compared to somewhere in new york i think that might have been pushing a little bit but

South Korea if you do that you will have people creating all kinds of things that you can only begin to imagine and that will require a collaboration across all people who are currently in a single City the second thing I think is to really start to think about what it will be like to produce renewables at the point of consumption and there are cities for example like lovins very contaminate which is that 55,000 people that in fact through using renewables in the city of the center of the cities and I do remember how cold of all set with her that I was here they were able to produce all

assistants it 's about understanding it or not that 's your own thing it 's about understanding that you build everything from the demand side not from the supply push side all of our lives retail centers a building supply push the future is I 'm in control of my Bible fine you supply what I want and if you can 't I 'll go somewhere else by the way I would have made that decision before I even

those are starting to understand in the world that i 'm talking about represents the best investment opportunity of the next hundred years so the answers that you come up with today the answers you can offer today i will be setting the framework for the next 50 years and you need to be looking forward to think about what the story of the future is not what 's within the past it 's not that what we 're gonna pass was wrong just like our steam trains were wrong it 's just that didn 't kind of live so well will you gotta electricity so what does this mean I think you need clearly two starter what did we talk about this two diagrams reminded that it was quite interesting it and the fourth one that this one is a building this car being built in our Colombian vodka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as part I tell parvez avances me apart food part retail and part office what makes it interesting was that they actually crowdsource the design and the investment what that means was they said people were looks really good idea anybody who 's interested here 's our website we would like you to come and talk to us you may never come to them to Colombia at all but if you 've got any ideas please help us and if you 're interested any any sum of money over fifty dollars is just fine invest so we 're starting to see a future where the investors and they uses that the demand people are inside design the yet the architectural profession are in meltdown over this of a they thought they did design well they 're used to the 20-city and they 're still necessary any engineers wrong receiving the same one that the second feature is actually aid and you your building called 17 John and the buildings there again it 's a it can be a small aquatic hotel and the guy is crowdsourcing both the investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent business travelers for standby financial district what do you want from us he 'll tell you one thing that no business Kevin wants and its power plugs on floor how do you the number of times at ten o 'clock at night I 'm on my hands and knees trying to pull it out back into the plug was not designed for people like me so what we need to start the do nail is in this future I 'm describing start to see the city a particular Center as in ecology not a machine not a bunch of separate parts and that means in the Ganga want to echo some words are here this morning increasing the diversity because good Ecology 's have lots of diversity lots of difference and you know what difference we get a bit of irritation that 's one of the things that happens and now that irritation comes the things we 're going to see a lot of multi-use we will see increasing flexibility and most importantly we will see people starting to have conversations about how they can add value to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city share one air conditioning system there is a big type of chilled water running underneath the central business district and everybody takes a deep conditioning from the public completely even listening right and then at night the utility takes it back pays very very cheap rates for off-peak electricity chills a water there is used to game at exactly just an example but I can show you example of example people who are really collaborative or second example em Keynes one way from Italy I had a bunch of people in the room they were complaining about their packaging costs so I said okay we 're going to start the conference come back tomorrow bring your packaging list yeah with all the things you want and up which is exactly what you want I said just make sure to lock up my smiley and put a dollop right at the bottom what we did was we then put out a team there between them between will appear in the room I think it was about 50 million dollars with a packaging and they 've got the attention of packaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop 30 seen the pigment kids are competing on packaging so these collaborations that start to make cities with they start to take waste out an assistant right now what I see places like Paris what I see is there are other people away from parents who are making the money out of you so you know when you travel it was enforced the city the oil companies they 're making lots of money out of it thank you very much indeed you know and so on and so forth what we have to do in this new church is capture more value in the city we need to start to see the city at this kind of collaboration space and I think this revolution of work I 've just been talking about and what the bottle even in my definition with this retirement thing aids off into the distance yes if you think about it the way we 've done it you have a kind of had to buy our childhood education and then we had to buy our work time and now it 's going to buy our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take our money office of each point for me and that process who made it up that halle blog was a consumption experience would it that come from I don 't think it needs that they liked it so I can see lots of kinds of which I can see you know people who sang I want to work less often wanting to work though in some quite sophisticated workplaces with other people in here thinking up against people that they might not fall of men I come in to collaborate I see lots of marketplaces and I 'm not just talking about farmers markets I 'm talking marketplaces of ideas i 'm told that marketplaces of collaboration I 'm talking about marketplaces of of music and design and and cities that work really Sam about those marketplaces and of course we got those numerous places because of that demand driven thing this notion of what 's called the experience economy will be seen and that 's about rethinking retail in particular so they are experiences and by the way and I had a great food experience last night a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy fun pretty funky buddha study and coming from melbourne found a haystack I think it 's also about understanding that the word processing of future will be as much about cochlear keeping the kana verb the where he goes together their hospitality spaces as it will be about actually sitting someone to do some work by the way for those of you who resolvers miracle baby boomers even if we continue to work until we 're a hundred and five the reality is there within three years there will be more Jim wise working in the workforce that there are us the power of numbers will finally attach we might run away just here but power of numbers will Nicola coming through the power of numbers will change and their view about how you work where you were what constitutes hospitality and culture is really really different among and so there with spaces in particular as in penrith are really going to start to reflect their emphasis on the step will be a bit but also you know in this kind of experience he caught me totally one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the urban food and fun way this is not just creating packs it 's creating vertical gardens in rooftop gardens and what the best one bars are things it makes you the rooftop garden is stunning and pins will be wonderful other ticket abuse even three or four stories applicant trainees and put so severe growing fences and what wonderful way that we stand to see more through grand city for the condiment block the binding traditions and region is back into the city and clearly it will be about finding ways and means to give people living in the city it is ridiculous to build buildings or only occupied 48 hours out of 24 it 's just a waste of them so my suggestion to you is that to try and figure out how you put the kinds of things I 'm saying into technical terms and the rhythmic payment as part of this 21st century model there 's a possible narrative for your possible space the computer 1 nervous I really want to have under by God please five pips roughly every packet a good partners that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few so for me it 's about creating the story first the second part is look at the whole rather than the parts and by the way figuring out how you can create dwelling time in the city for people who have just got off the train I bet the most of people that arrived at the station go they 're not i 'm almost time they dish with their car they jump in the car and i forgot i can 't we create space and you know there 's many cultures do with us a combat halfway space where they can stop and just me and milan is called aperitivo intolerance will debit ever Tibet designed instructors admittance better speed and it 's also about understanding that the car of the future and I 'm probably pretty close to my faith here but but I think the key messages the car will go from being a master as it was in the 20th 20th century to being a servant in the 25th century and we need to start maggots which they 're here it 's also about retrofitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about prepare with rich a fitting and what we 're starting the binders and the Empire State Building was what kind of what the inspirations that there is a whole way that you can retrofit to you know to really reduce our all the energy and other costs of all the builders create and I 'm talking about half it was right now it 's not enough just to leave at least floor space there the energy costs and the other costs those are the ones that kill the small traders in the High Street not the ring it 's all the other costs now the only interco so horrific was a building near list Ibaka surgeon so retrofitting like them can be partners and should be part of us and you see other work opportunities like the hub in Melbourne where you doing lots of eg businesses coming together in old buildings that were very very good that offer systems as ways to come in use as villains I don 't think that you can have the conversation I 'm talking about in this model you know we won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design a solution let 's try to be heavenly let 's do that 's the model that we 've done everything that tricky teacher it 's called transactional thank you what we have to do what I 've been trying to talk about this morning as we need to understand that many of the things that are most successful are at their limits the world of the future is different the assumptions of which we 've asked yesterday and not the same substance it will clear tomorrow all the fragments not talked about the language of been using in some of you might be quite angry with me right now sorry about it about different planets different ways of thinking and the new design must be informed by that story if you have no story all you have is a collection of proteins and I don 't think that works anymore and you know I can show you is all parts of New South Wales and Victoria there are just collections of things and it looks like it it doesn 't work is unnecessary costs and then you build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Korea vacillations so look vex I hope that that 's been coherent the law of material behind this I 've set of the organizers I 've had to provide any of that IM around until the end of this conversation today and what I 'd like to do before I take some questions is just give you a minute or two of your tables before I take questions a couple of minutes please have someone can put the watch on that marketing coach so my question to you is so what from what I 've seen type two or three minutes of your table to say so what to Penrith out of what I 've said and then I 'll play some questions thinking"

    "text": "all right now um basically basically the platypus is regarded as one of the world 's most unusual mammals and i won 't go into huge amounts of detail about that because but the sort of things that make it fascinating firstly it 's a it 's a mammal but reproduces by laying eggs and you can see the eggs in a jar there at the museum in the picture in the middle bottom um the eggs themselves are not hard like a bird 's egg they 're basically soft and leathery so very similar to reptile eggs there 's something else that 's a bit reptilian about platypus and that 's the fact they 're venomous now it 's only the males that have the venom and they have spurs on each of their hind ankles which is where the venom can be expelled from the venom it won 't kill you but it 's it will cause a lot of pain if you do get spurred but what the spurs are really there for is for the males to fight with each other during the breeding season to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features but the one that really stands out i suppose is the platypus build with this weird uh looking structure on its face it 's not hard like a duck spill at all it 's actually quite soft and bendy but it 's where the platypus has a genuine sixth sense basically what it 's got is an electro reception system that 's a big word for saying what it does is scan and detects the tiny amount of electricity that some of the food items it 's chasing such as freshwater yabbies and so on they produce a tiny amount of electricity and the scanning system picks it up so there are all sorts of other features that i won 't go into that really make this one of the world 's most unusual mammals and if you had to draw up a list of world heritage species this would be right up there now when does the platypus occur basically down the east side of australia and including tasmania on the dry western margins there 's already a bit of evidence that populations are starting to shrink back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in the wimmera in the very western part of the state but we 're lucky that in the act queen bien region it 's still pretty much in the sort of heartland of platypus area at all so um you know there is the possibility that with climate change we 'll see the edges starting to shrink first but that makes it even more important that the populations around queen beyond and so on are protected for the future where does the platypus occur well i guess if you asked a lot of people and stop them in the street they 'll say well you know the platypus it 's such a special animal and oh you know it 's shy and it 's sensitive so you know they don 't occur around here and if you if you say from well you know describe where they do occur they 'd probably say something like that top left photo there they say oh you know it 's beautiful fast flowing clear water and it 's forests and there 's no people and so on and of course you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly uh modified rivers such as the one on the top right there that 's the murrumbidgee just outside the acct they occur in fairly small creeks like the one in the middle there they occur in a wide range of still water conditions both dams and reservoirs and farm dams even so like recreation lakes and so on like the one on the bottom left there but also of course they can under certain circumstances occur right next to people in urban areas such as our picture on the bottom right there of the center of queen bien now i want to emphasize you won 't get platypus equally in those sort of areas platypus are a very good habitat indicator in other words the better the quality of environmental conditions the more platypus you will get per kilometer so you will get many many more platypus in the top left picture there than you will in the queen beyon area but having said that the point i really want to make is the platypus do not live way off there way off in the bush far from people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half of the human population in eastern australia live within a few kilometers of the species and this is very important because the things that we do can be both good and bad for platypus now what are plantables eat well they 're a fairly generalized feeder most of their food consists of bugs that live in the water so things up to about the size of freshwater yabbies because they don 't have teeth they 're a bit limited they have grinding pads to mash food up and so if they try and catch bigger things they really have to sort of gum them to death but basically they can do that with things like uh fish and so on they will catch small fish occasionally as you can see in that photo there so they 're a very generous feeder and the important thing about them is they they 're very good at switching from whatever is in season at the moment and so they are a very quite resilient species in in many respects there are very high energy species uh in terms of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy so consequently they have to eat a lot um a platypus to stay in good condition needs something like 20 to 40 percent of its body mass every 24 hour period to stay in good condition so that 's a lot of food but in round figures about a kilo of bugs per day and that 's a lot of feeding it 's got to do now that then has implications for the way that platypus organizes itself the first thing is they don 't occur in herds of platypus if you 've got lots and lots of platypus in one place they would very quickly eat themselves out of house and home so they occur at fairly low densities if we take the queen river most of it you 're probably looking at two to three platypus per kilometer would be what we would reasonably expect so not hundreds of animals the second factor is a platypus isn 't going to find all its food all in one place day after day after day they 've got to move up and down looking for food and consequently they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home range of about a kilometer but the miles can perhaps have sometimes six seven kilometer home ranges and this again is what we would expect in the queben river that the females are as it occupies short home ranges but the males will come come and go and move in quite significantly and that 's why you get sort of fluctuations in the base level of how many platelets are around at any one point in time depending on where it is in the season and how the food resources are now they 're a quite long-lived animal for a small mammal um they can 't live more than 25 years there 's one in hillsville sanctuary in victoria at the moment that is 27 years long um and we 've known some in the wild that well into their 20s that 's probably a bit exceptional um we think the typical age range is probably about 14 to 16 for the females perhaps 10 to 12 for the males they are fairly good at reproducing there 's no evidence at all that platypus have any reproductive problems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liter they can lay three eggs but that 's quite exceptional they become mature in about their second year of age sexually mature but they probably don 't necessarily start breeding straight away and over their lifespan a female will probably on average produce litters about one year and every two depending on conditions in good years they might produce two juveniles in a bad year if there 's a drought they won 't breed at all but the point is over a relatively long life time they will produce more than enough offspring to uh replace themselves in the population and what this means is that in a stable population a lot of the juveniles are basically surplus to requirements and so the juveniles have quite a high mortality rate mating basically occurs in the spring round about august october is that is the peak of the breeding season um the eggs hatch about a month after mating so typically october is when most of the the eggs are hatched and the young then both grow very rapidly because the females produce a very rich milk that 's high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see in that picture on the right they 're into little little butter balls basically and started to emerge in about like january february when they 're already about two-thirds fully grown after that what i said there 's a lot of pressure on the juveniles eventually to move out in about this time of the year may june the adults decide when they don 't really want the juveniles competing with for them for food and a lot of them get pushed out to go and find new territories particularly the males and that 's when a lot of them don 't don 't make it they often end up in really peculiar places a lot of them get picked off by predators and a lot of them simply starve to death so it 's a tough life being a young juvenile platypus but that 's the way the platypus are very very good at keeping their populations in balance with their resources how is the planet was doing in the wild well the answer unfortunately is not as good as we would like the most recent action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2012 classified the the platypus as near threatened on a national basis and that 's the classification that 's subsequently been adopted by the world conservation union 's red list now what that really means it 's an alarm bell it 's saying look this species has declined in many catchments and we don 't really know you know how populations are doing across the board and some of the causes of that decline are still going on and so we really start to need to concentrate some action on this species before it becomes any more threatened now what are some of the problems well i guess we 're all aware that since european settlement we 've made a bit of a mess of our river systems and sort of things that have occurred we 've cleared a lot of the the vegetation that occurred on our riverbanks and so you get situations like that top picture on the left there where erosion is taking place and if you 're a platypus that 's not going to be a great place to put your burrows likewise that erosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top left the top right there and the sediment build up in some of our rivers in general terms bugs don 't do as well in that sort of silty sandy conditions so less bugs means less platypus we 've still got management issues such as the one on the bottom left there where we have issues of stock still trampling banks making it very difficult for platypus burrows but in addition polluting the water in various ways and of course we 've got a whole suite of introduced weeds both in the water itself or along our river banks in the form of willows and all sorts of other introduced species and so consequently all that productivity has been reduced tremendously from a platypus point of view in addition of course we 've changed the actual structure of many of our waterways very very dramatically so for example in many places we 've built very large dams and as a result we don 't get the natural flows that traditionally we should have so consequently as some of our our river systems the the annual flow patterns the seasonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been traditionally as a result particularly of urban expansion we 've lost a lot of natural drainage it 's been alienated in a way that makes it unsuitable for platypus as you can see in the the top right there but of course the big the biggest problem is probably the fact that we are still over haas over harvesting our water resources and i guess we 've all seen the pictures recently of what the darling river looks like where it 's basically now just a chain of unconnected muddy green looking slimy pools and if you 're a platypus that 's not only reduce your habitat for feeding and so on but also means that to get from one pool to another you 've got to cross over land and be at risk of predators so all those sorts of things have really started to hit the platypus in many of our catchments in addition we 've got issues of predation prior to european settlement there probably weren 't that many natural predators birds of prey perhaps sometimes took platypus when there were a big murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slit open that sometimes would be platypus inside those but in general terms the amount of predation probably didn 't make an impact on populations but of course we 've changed that in particular by bringing in predators like the red fox and consequently they now take quite a heavy toll on platypus numbers and it 's a significant problem in some areas but it 's not foxes it 's not dogs it 's not cats it 's still people who kill platypus in many direct ways um here you can see some of the the ones related to fishing now let me make it clear i 'm not anti-fishing and i think the vast majority of anglers are quite responsible in the way they go about things but unfortunately there is a small but nevertheless quite substantial section of the recreational angling community who do not do the right of thing and so you get things going on like the the illegal use of nets that one in the top left there is a gill net when that was found it had eight dead platypus in it more importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there various types of enclosed yabby nets so typically the the opera house trap that you can see on the top right there now up to five platypus have sometimes been found in a single opera house trap and some of the other enclosed yobe traps are even worse the other one you can see there is that when that was found it actually had seven dead plantables in it now if you bear in mind what i said earlier the platypus don 't occur in large numbers um if nets are left there over a long time as this one was it can knock a fairly big hole in a population now the good news is is opera house traps are now banned in the act and in new south wales that 's from the 30th of april and we 've already seen when the ban was brought into victoria in 2019 that number of deaths dropped dramatically however it will take a long time for these nets to disappear from the system hundreds of thousands of them were sold and i 'm certain there will be many many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river and you see typically a piece of string leading down into the water from the riverbank uh that 's often the clue that it 's there 's a net there that 's set under water so pull it in and just see if it 's an illegal enclosed net and report it to the fisheries offices other sorts of things the big problem i guess is discarded fishing line as you can see on the the one on the bottom left there uh fishing line if you go to almost any popular fishing spot you will see lengths of line and it gets around platypus and causes horrendous injuries and inevitably death and another big problem is platypus often get hooked through the bill or the webbed feet people don 't know what to do they cut the line and the platypus swims off and the line eventually gets snagged on something and they they drown or die of exhaustion the bigger problem though perhaps is litter um platypus get an amazing amount of things around them because they 're swimming along the bottom uh looking for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all particularly any circular ring type things uh their streamlined shape means that the litter goes over their head really easily and they find it really difficult to get it off and in some waterways the the litter rate in urban areas can be quite frightening i mean we 've just done a paper in the analyzed our result their findings around melbourne and what we found is that in the melbourne area at any one point in time four percent of platypus had something or other caught around them so basically one in 25 animals but the actual rate in some particular waterways was was absolutely priming in terms of some of the the inner suburban waterways we found that as many as 30 to 40 percent of the population have litter around them at some point in their lifetime all sorts of things and particularly on the bottom right there you 'll see the one that 's really emerging is quite a significant problem and that is elasticated hair ties uh the little platypus above uh on the top right that was found with those three hair ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been out about for probably three to four weeks it already picked up three of those in that point in time and you can see the horrendous injury that was caused around her neck and that poor animal had to be euthanized and so that in itself is just a real you know indictment to us that we really have got to do better with litter and particularly in urban areas like queen bien it 's an issue we 've got to face up to before i move on to monitoring platforms let me just put in a bit of a plug for this guy this is the australian water rat or better known by its uh aboriginal name rickely and we say to people look don 't even think of it as a rat think of it as australia 's version of the otter because it has many of the features that make otters a cute animal on every other continent it actually fills the same sort of environmental niche it 's the it 's the top aquatic carnivorous mammal but it has many of those otter-like features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see those fabulous set of whiskers quite small ears quite a bluntish silver head uh above it on the on the top right you 'll see webbed feet uh webbing between the toes exactly like an altar does on the bottom left you 'll notice the beautiful fur just like an altar but notice the shape of the tile this isn 't a strappy ratty sort of tail this is quite a conical shaped tail just like otters have to both store fat and serves a rudder and the animal actually sort of swims a bit like an altar as well so it 's a quite attractive animal and we 're lucky in the queen beyond area and the act in particular that we 've got uh roccali quite commonly in their waterways as well now with the getting into this category becoming a threatened we really need to get on top of monitoring how populations are doing across our different river systems so that we can take action in a timely way and particularly uh given the predictions that climate change might make some of our waterways less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on platypus we need to look at how we can compensate for that so how do you go about checking on platypus well the traditional sort of gold standard for research is to do live traffic surveys and to do that you set special survey nets and then work right through the night checking the animals taking them out the nets inspecting them and so on and it 's it 's a very good quality data comes out of it in that you can check the mails from the females the adults from the juveniles check their condition as you can see by squeezing the tile there you can tell how good a condition the plantars is and various other things however the downside is it 's a very technically demanding activity it really can only be carried out by experienced biologists who are working in accordance with research permits and ethics committee approvals and so on the equipment is quite expensive it takes a long time to do the work you work basically 24 hours non-stop and it 's can only really satisfactorily be carried out in fairly shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order but it isn 't as effective for sampling populations so when you 're talking about the queen bien river where much of it is is too deep for these sort of nets there are limitations as to what you can do so are there other things well one of the possibilities that 's emerging is using is what is cameras and the good news is that until until this week in fact uh promising it hadn 't been very promising uh it was felt that both platypus and rochali floated too low in the water to trigger cameras and so the only time they were showing up was when you get a situation like in the top picture there where a platypus had come out on a log to have a bit of a scratch and actually trigger the camera but this week somebody in tasmania has been experimenting with different cameras and different camera angles and as you can see in the bottom uh picture there it 's actually now starting to show up platypus when they are swimming so this is a real break through and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually working with a person to do more research and see whether we can start using that much more widely and effectively another technique that you may have heard of is is environmental dna or e-dna and if you 're not saying what it is basically it 's very similar to the when you see the crime show crime scene shows on tv where the police solve the problem by getting a tiny fragment of dna from the perpetrators so in principle you take samples of water under sterile conditions send it off to a lab and push it through a black box which will look for traces of platypus dna and so it 's a technique that 's i guess a bit more what you can use it much more widespread and cost effectively than live trapping you can do a lot more sampling in a in the same same amount of time but at this point in time it 's not necessarily very useful for actually monitoring populations because what it 's basically telling you is presence absence it 's not telling you how many platypus are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether if you get a negative does that really mean there 's no platypus there or does it simply mean that there 's not been enough dna found in the sample to really do positives but nevertheless it 's an evolving technology that hopefully will get better another important aspect of keeping track of platypus is collecting sightings reports and i can 't stress how valuable you know every time you see a platypus or a roccoli that it is important to report it it does particularly give us a good idea of distribution in other words where platypus occur however there are still some limitations to it one of course is the problem that it 's very easy to make mistakes with sightings you can confuse platypus for rick ali and so on and of course if you get the sort of websites that exist where people can simply enter their own sightings directly it 's very much open to uh abuse and so for example in the middle there you 'll see a sample from from one website where people can just go in and enter it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow log and discovered a platypus well of course he did because he put his toy platypus inside and took a photo and then that ends up as a platypus result now of course that 's not what we want to achieve the other problem though more importantly is the data from sightings is not standardized and we can 't use it to track populations now if you look at this this guy this is a a great report that best produced last year on platypus and brokenly monitoring in queen bien so looks at the the results of uh how many sightings are coming in and beth and i will be working on the next year 's one to make certain that we try and bring all the signings information together so you can see it produces some useful information if you look at that graph there you 'll see that the light green on the bottom uh left graph shows the sort of uh period when richly are most likely to be seen you can see this period now coming coming through the winter when they are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the august september period when the breeding season is underway and by collecting that information it 's given us a much better idea of these seasonal patterns that these species uh have however in terms of actually monitoring populations it 's it 's because it 's non-standardized we have to be a little bit careful so you 'll see that in for example there was an 87 percent increase in platypus in sightings and a 310 percent increase in rochali sightings now it would be nice to think the populations actually grew by those amounts but of course the problem we have is that sightings in this way really reflect you know just how many people sometimes are out there looking and also doesn 't necessarily reflect how many times they saw platypus relative to the number of times they looked did they see one planet was for one look or was it one planet was for 500 looks and so it 's not standardized it makes it difficult to draw too many conclusions about population trends so what can we do about that is there a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working protocols conservatives been working for over 10 years now on trying to get a system up that addresses this using and we 've now launched this called the australian platypus monitoring a network and we think it 's the next generation of citizen science because it tries to bring a standardized ratio to what people are doing it it has its genesis in in the the lady on the top right there is called lynn easton lynn did a pilot project for us in the in the early 2000s um and lynn uh collected a lot of information about where when she saw platypus and when she didn 't and as a result we were able to plot her her data and we found that what she was seeing in the top graph there of the number of platypus she was seeing per time she looked was very similar to what we got from trapping survey results in the same area so she was picking up exactly what we were seeing in live trapping surveys but a lot more cost effectively not as in much detail but was nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time but also when we started to expand the system and got people working in different areas we also were able to pick up differences in abundance and so it gave the basis for tracking populations using the fact that everybody was doing the same thing now what do they do what 's it based on it 's a very simple system people who want to get involved choose their visual survey site some people just have one other people have several so lynnette 's three for example we 've got one volunteer in tasmania who has eight um and what people do is they stop at their site hopefully at least once a week sometimes more some people go out five six seven seven times a week but even if you can only do it once it still contributes useful information and they scan for a set period of five minutes now that might not sound a lot but for various reasons which i 'll explain later in a five minute period if there is a platypus there you have a very very good chance of seeing it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming process it 's something that people fit in with their their other activities such as walking the dog along the river or going for a jog or walking to cycling to work and so on you carry out the scan when it suits you although early morning and late afternoon in the prime time and our computer can adjust for all those sort of things and the key to it is people recall both the positives and the negatives so in other words if you see two platypus in 10 scans that gives you your score of 0.2 that can be compared over time and can be compared from place to place and so we 've done this now for a long period over trials and it works and basically what you then do is enter your results on a website you can either do it through your computer or through an app and that immediately creates feedback you can look at sites see what the results are and if there is enough data if there are 20 data points per quarter you can then start generating graphs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple system but it 's very effective you can either adopt an existing site or you create a new one if you are on private land and you 've got a river running through it and you want your site on private land that 's fine and you can actually then specify as private so that other people can 't adopt that site so you that you 're not inviting other people to come on your land in good news is that queensb already many existing sites that have been monitored over several years in some cases they 're not all shown on that map but if you go to the website and look under findings you 'll see where the sites are and give you an idea in queanbeyan how likely are you to see platypus well let me stress you 're not going to see particles every time you go out and what you 've seen from the graphs about platypus occurrence during the year there are certain periods of the year when you will see them more often particularly during the breeding season but just to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the suspension bridge in isabella street um has it 's been monitored for several years there 's a lot of data there and the figure is 26 so in other words really for every time for every four times people scan there they see a platypus which is a fairly fairly highest figure and you 'll see for that whole section of the river there that goes up to about dane street and carabao um it really averages about that point two five figure so so one in four over the year or over the period um it varies from year to year of course and that 's whole part doing it in terms of choosing a monitoring site well yeah i said that we would encourage people to choose the existing ones it 's better that people share sites because there 's more data and there 's more cover if people are off but you can choose new sites you can register a new site anywhere um very easy to do but what the things you look for it 's got to be convenient for you you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you won 't do it so that makes it somewhere convenient you want to be able to view a sizable stretch of water so in other words about a 50 meter up to about a 50 meter stretch open stretch where you can see comfortably and basically um you want to choose somewhere where there is a reasonable chance of seeing platypus i mean you can choose small creeks and you can choose some fairly degraded conditions but it may get a bit disappointing that you don 't see platypus very often but in queen bien we know there are sites there that are going to be very productive and we certainly encourage people to give it a go if you haven 't seen platypus in the wild before just let me quickly explain what to look for because what i said earlier they can be seen very easily it 's the ripple pattern that gives them away platypus spend a lot of their time feeding um and basically what you see is when they they they dive underwater fill their cheek pouches with food and come to the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food up and take a breath so the first thing you 'll see is those pictures on the top there where they pop to the surface and they float in still water conditions you 'll see quite a circular ripple pattern around them if it 's a flowing river if it 's they 'll always face upstream and as a result will create sort of an inverted v will flow around them and that 's very obvious they 'll be on the surface for 10 to 15 seconds they then take a little duck dive you can see on the bottom left there again that might be the first thing you see is this little hump in the water very briefly they then force their way down to the bottom and that creates quite a strong updraft and that in turn creates quite a strong ripple pattern and sometimes with little bubbles in the middle where the air is being forced out of it further they 'll be underwater for typically 30 to 50 seconds at a time sometimes more sometimes less and then they pop back to the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute period you 'll have six seven opportunities to see that sequence and with all the various ripples that it creates and so if there is a platypus there um and you 're prepared to just scan carefully for that period you have a very very high chance of seeing it and that 's why you only need five minutes if the weather conditions are a bit poor if it 's raining or windy or there 's a fast flow you can extend it up to 10 minutes just to give your eye a bit more chance to to settle it but we don 't really need people standing there for hours people do people do get addicted once they start seeing platforms they do start want to spend hours and hours and hours there so you have to be aware of that but basically five to ten minutes the other thing that happens platypus do occasionally swim from place to place particularly during the breeding season in the bottom left there you 'll see males one zooming along one way one zoom in the other creating quite a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thing you see the other thing you have to be a little bit careful of it 's very easy to confuse platypus and rochali they 're both basically similar in size a bigger accale is the same size as the small platypus they 're basically the same color they do vary in color a bit but when they 're in the water they all basically look brown and they can be mistaken but once you know what you 're looking for it tends to be fairly obvious that water rats tend to float that tend not to float in one place in the way the platypus do and they pop to the surface they swim much more continuously when they dive they do a much more shallow sort of racing dive than a platypus does they don 't create such strong ripple patterns and they really are easy to see once you get started so look if you are interested what we strongly suggest to people is go to the australian platypus monitoring network site and have a look for yourself everything i 've described is in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're interested go and give it a trial first but if you if you 're interested register as a volunteer you then select your sites and what i said earlier we would certainly encourage you to adopt the existing sites but fine if you want to establish your own and then simply you start scanning and upload your data and then as soon as you start uploading data you will be able to start watching for the longer term trends if you produce enough data during the time if you can 't get involved in apmn we still encourage you to look out for platypus and particularly report sightings now you can either report them to the local council beth as i said earlier we 'll be collecting those and we work together to produce an annual summary if you 're not in the queen beyond area and want to report to to us the australian platypus conservancy that 's very easy as well you simply go to our website um the important thing though is that make certain that if you use any other method the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living australia is the national database all our information gets sent there and unfortunately there are some websites around where you can report political signings that do not share it with ala we strongly don 't think that 's a mistake you can report directly to aia yourself through a scheme called light naturalist and that 's another option but whatever you do i either go to the council go to the apc or report directly to to ala okay now i 've covered a fair bit and it 's time for questions"

19 and also the summer 's horrendous bushfires and the impact that they 've had on our organization but I 'm pleased to say the budget delivers an operational surface of 3.3 million and includes more than 167 million of capital works across the local government area now factoring in our capital works long-term borrowing program we are sound in meeting the financial benchmarks set by the New South Wales office of local government and that 's required of all councils some of the capital works include black spot funded road improvements and other road projects including Ontario Road progressing the Queanbeyan civic and cultural precinct along with the Monaro street transformation upgrades to certain sports fields and playgrounds and construction of off street car parks in banger door and also brave wood and more so out 20 2021 budget is around 300 million dollars Yul 's you 'll see it from our operational plan there is quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that about half of all of our income comes from rates and annual charges about a third of our income also comes from fees and charges and the balance from grants we are quite successful in our ability to attract grants from both levels of government on our expenditure side again around about a third of all of our expenses goes towards the employment of staff and about a third again on engaging contractors and material supplies in our in our area so let 's talk about some of the big projects we have coming up in the next 12 months we 're looking forward to completing stages one of both the regional Sports Complex at South Bureau Bambara and stage one of the band or Sports Hub they 're all projects have been what waited on for quite some time and we 're looking forward to delivering those likewise we 'll be continuing our work in completing the the resealing the ceiling and the alignment of the knee riga road because ultimately that will make an important freight corridor between narrow tunis rigueur Raywood and into Queanbeyan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bangor door we 're looking to complete the works to construct the bone and or roundabout at the corner of Melbourne Street and in the highway likewise in bang on door we 're also looking forward to constructing our first off street car park in Bangor door accessed off Elenin Street and we 'll do stage one of a street car park in Braidwood behind the National Theatre accessed off Duncan Street in terms of bridges we have a lot of bridges that are under stress a lot of breaches of course at our timber and not only they are being replaced in the main by concrete bridges or concrete box culverts so the next 12 months we have scheduled to replace the Reedy Creek Bridge on nine fieldname the Gili bridge on Gidley Lane and we 're also carrying forward our works for on the bridges at Rich 's Creek we 're continuing our work on the planning and the upgrades and the designs for the Queanbeyan sewer treatment plant and likewise the upgrade of the bond or sewage treatment plant now both of those works won 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting towards the point of having final approvals from the various levels of government and we 'll look to construct those works in the coming years in the landfill area we 've got to do a lot more work on reinstating the landfill and and rehabilitating the landfill around bang on door they 're all legacy issues that once landfills closed that we need to fix up those sites we continue to open and operate our transfer stations at burner door and Braidwood some of the new exciting projects we have coming up is at South Bureau Bambara we 've received 23 million dollar grant from the from the use of the Wales government we 're committing up to 8 million dollars from council funds to build what we call the enabling infrastructure to go into the area south of Thomas that drive down to jerec Creek that 's the roads and utilities and commune occasion loops but that investment will open up the

their needs are a creek and a new innovation hub they were looking to work with universities to establish we 're also putting on exhibition our revenue policy the revenue policy basically talks around what 's the rating structure what are you alloys and what 's the fees and charges our council proposes in the main council has increased the total rate revenue by the right peg set by the iPad that 's at 2.6 percent it 's also proposed to increase all its annual charges water sewer waste and general fees by the same amount our revenue policy also includes a new harmonized rating structure now that was required of all the merged councils to commence from next financial year we 've used the community reference panel to help us develop that from a number of options that council considered earlier this year what it fundamentally means is that we 're using the same rating structure rather than two separate rating structures from the former two councils but what is also significant is the New South Wales value of general has reassessed the unimproved land value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extent your individual rates may vary as a result of that land valuation but it will not increase by the value of the of that change the total rates that council receives will only increase by 2.6 percent which is the rate pick we all have also introduced an a streamlined financial hardship policy council has recognised that we 've had the combination of drought bushfire flood and now covert so what council has agreed to do is that for those farmland rate category properties that have been subject to drought those properties that have been destroyed or damaged by bushfire and those businesses that have been impacted and closed down as a result of Kovan all those property owners who have lost their job as a result of Kovan we 'll now have two years to pay off their rates if they choose to apply for that that type of relief what 's important is that while you come up with a payment plan across that two-year period interest will not be charged we 've also released full community comment a new planning document called the local strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to produce it it fundamentally brings together the key ambitions of the local environment plan and our community strategic plan but it does set the vision for each of the towns and the rural areas of our of our local government area so we look forward to feedback on that and soon we 'll also release the Ministry of a review of our local environment plan now that 's not a big review it 's simply a refresh of both the former council planning instruments harmonizing the zoning and the uses and the controls and that 'll will also therefore comment in coming weeks little for to your feedback we 're very keen for the community to have us a make your comments it 's very important for all counselors and staff to receive input into our operational plan and fees and charges going forward so the plans are out for consultation until Monday the 1st of June [Music]"

toll was taken on the environment losses of wildlife farmlands townships as well as loss of human life council 's team found itself at the forefront supporting fire services and setting up evacuation centers at the height of the fires national parks and conservation reserves were caught up in the inferno however our urban parks became emergency assembly points and safe zones even temporary refuges

't get in the way of a presentation and i 've already said the sessions being recorded our objectives today are twofold we are here to share information with you qprc as i said have a number of presentations and that 's to bring you up to speed with where we 're at but the second and just as important reason is to hear from you there 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs and projects are still being finalized uh thinking is still going into various aspects of how the project will be delivered and we want to hear from you which are the bits that you might have concerns about or that you want to hear further information on so we can factor them into our ongoing engagement campaign and activities we 've got some workshops and things like that planned we want to put those concerns well into that program of activities so twofold two reasons to be here today fairly simple format that we 'll come to shortly i 'm going to stop now and introduce the mayor to officially welcome you this morning thank you well thank you helen and um good morning all and and and welcome and uh let me acknowledge the uh namboury nanowire people as traditional custodians of the land on which we 're having this meeting and as per the theme of naidoc week always was always will be traditional land and i pay respect to elders past and present and extend that respect to all aboriginal people well welcome to this initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is um as helen mentioned a session for information flow and it 's more about information from you to the council now i was going to acknowledge any counsellors that were present but i know that they 're probably most of them all at work and uh um they will be able to um see a transcript of this and i know most of them will be but i 'd also like to acknowledge the member for eden monero christie christie mcbain 's here welcome christy perhaps monero street 's newest tenant and here in that capacity or any other capacity you so desire christy now just a couple of opening remarks look some of you um back in 2005 um may recall that i called for um through a notice of motion for a cbd master plan very concerned at the time that the early stages of thinking and planning about particularly charlie south jerabombra and gugong developments were in the process of uh putting together a residential and economic strategy for the next 30 years for queanbeyan and very concerned with those greenfield developments residential developments that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't keeping pace with the growth and we needed a reinvigoration and revitalization and council subsequently over several years of consultation engagement drafts endorsed a cbd master plan a 20-year vision and blueprint for the city 's future now following the adoption of that master plan um in 2008 together with the fellow council at the time steve stavros welcome steve we put to forward a motion council let 's move into stage one of that cbd master plan and develop crawford street into a lifestyle precinct then the next phase of that was in 2012 leading up to the 2012 elections i committed to a riverfront upgrade with qe2 park to try and link the make it more vibrant river frontage and link it to the city itself now i think more recently your current council has uh committed to a more holistic cbd spatial master plan with a staged implementation so a significant leap forward in the transformation of our cbd so this monero street upgrade is obviously going to be a very challenging project crawford street was but this will be more challenging given the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wales and being a through road part of the kings highway so we very much look forward to this project this challenging project on the basis of it being a partnership with the businesses and the property owners of monero street and adjoining properties to monero street so challenging but we want to make it as smooth and uh and as as easy as possible although it is going to be difficult so with those few words i 'll uh leave you to your deliberations and i 'll be looking forward to hearing the input from you all as we just go through this very early information stage so thanks very much thank you man okay so let 's get into it we 'll get our first um presentation underway i 'm too short to use this microphone that 's why they gave me one of my own so i 'm going to stand away if i could try and move it will cause all sorts of difficulties and my next task is to introduce the ceo peter heck ticket who 's going to provide us with some i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing down it 's going to talk to us about the transformation strategy and the spatial master plan as we talked about and as the mayor reinforced today is the very early stages of um engagement on manera street but it 's important to think about in the context of what else is going on so i 'm going to introduce peter to give good morning folks and and again pass on my banks and those of our staff for those who have taken the time out to be here today and i reflect on the on the high lux out of course because uh part of helen 's job though she doesn 't know this yet is to record how many times we use the word project rather than project you might recall that hilex hilux add use that that different terminologies all the time this morning i 'd like to speak to you just as a quick reflection on on the pathway that we 've gone through so so of course there 's our cbd and on screen there you can see uh partly as tim was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and stage one of course was the works that are completed that 's the qe2 park uh the river walk from the low-level bridge through to the uh now all the way frankly to ellerton drive extension bridge and the refurbishment of the riverside caravan park and that 's now opened again and the smart city our stage one of our smart city investments uh with smart parking lighting and cbd wi-fi stage two any second up and that gives you that context of where that body of work took place including all the various points of which we now have cbd wi-fi through the parks and through the main town 's main streets of the cbd stage two is where we 're now heading so stage two is the construction of a new uh queanbeyan civic and cultural precinct that will be on the site of the old queben city council chamber site and occupy part of the low street car park what 's important to recognize here and that 's the site just there just adjacent to where we are so to my right to your left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer centre smart hub government offices commercial offices and a glass gallery connecting to the bicentennial hall and the queue a grand four court out onto crawford street and then a brand new public players acidic plaza to the rear are fronting on to the q theatre so it is a significant transformation and a big frankly the catalyst to to the transformation of the cbd why is that because currently we have over 200 staff based in queen and in offices in queanbeyan in the various brick cottages and and clubs and other outbuildings you see around the cbd all those staff will then be able to occupy in the new building and those those former premises are available for redevelopment and part of of course the ambitions of the cbd transformation strategy council adopted in 2017 was in fact to increase the number of residents increase the number of workers increase the foot traffic improve the permeability or pedestrian access through town and activate the cbd through more retail more lifestyle activities and business so tomorrow night in fact tonight tonight we have a report going to council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction we 've completed the point of an 80 design and and that 's now the point of which we can go to tinder for the purpose of construction and uh phil we 'll touch on more details of that but that would enable that uh construction of the tender to be awarded early next year and construction commence early next year for completion late 22 early 23. stage three is our morrisette car park now initially we had intended to have that earlier under the car parking strategy also adopted by council in 1718 and that was to enable a multi-level 400 car space car park to be established on that site but you 're aware of course that the other police then requested to occupy a large part of that car park while they have temporary facilities off morrisette street and so we can 't get onto that site to do that work until they vacate and we understand they intend on current schedule to be able to vacate by the middle of next year so on that premise we 've paused the the morrisette project but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential uh development uh occupying part of that space the other half to be converted into new public domain stage four is across the road from here which is a rutledge car park you might recall the principal features of the cbd transformation strategy was to recycle and transform old infrastructure particularly the car parks where those car parks would be converted either into above ground or below ground car parks and the remaining half converted into public domain or plazas all aimed at getting people to congregate in the centre of town to spend their dollars all those places will be smart in terms of wi-fi sensing and other forms of smart city infrastructure stage five then is what phil will talk about in more detail the monero corridor has now been broken into two parts the first section between lowe and crawford street and the second from crawford through to the bridge uh we 're we 're awaiting and it 's great to see the leaf club here there are some some we hope some significant developments taking place in coming years up that end and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up towards the bridge until we have a full sense of what the scalar development is likely to be towards queensbridge but phil will talk about that that one in particular stage six same deal again the overall increase in car parking the cbd was forecast at around 20 and here we 're also looking at doing multi-level car parking in the crawford car park behind dan murphy 's now that could be brought forward should there be an adjacent development uh which be a catalyst for us advancing the decking of that particular site stage seven which is a new addition out of the master plan that was in addition to that that we forecast with the transformation strategy now looks to create the morrisette street um as the river boulevard the one that we will green uh cause a lot more pedestrian movements between the uh the queen uh the town park uh queenman town park through to the river that 's a later body of work but again as it signals there in very early planning and the new stage eight which is again a recent addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves and ovals and parks to the northwest of the bridge starting from the riverside caravan park heading to the west along the river blundell park and the like so that progressively will be built into a botanic garden sister city gardens where they 'll become connected with with landscaping and developments through there across coming years so those are the eight stages of this grand plan to transform the cbd all aimed at making it a very livable centre highly pedestrianized slowing the cbd down and a large part brought about by the opening up of the elephant drive extension to enable the big trucks and noise and congestion to move off monero street and that enables us now to do this work on monero street so in summary we 'll start to see here are the big sights we 've got around the perimeter for employee parking and then in the center for retail parking again on those multi-level or basement car parks and this is how it all comes together so those are the the various sites that we have forecasts for the public investment to catalyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will ultimately become the spine being the monaro uh corridor uh supported by the green corridors connecting the showground and queenman park through the river and then the the laneways that will connect the suite of car parks crawford morrissette rutledge and low across the town centre again it 's aimed at getting people into the centralized car parks that will be smart out of their cars walking past the shops doing their business enjoying the recreation and lifestyle opportunities that we have and of course in places like this with 580 seats in here and 380 next door a big conference center performance space and cultural centre as we hope to become and helen that should be about it thank you peter yes let 's give him a clap [Applause] it 's it it 's important that he feels valued and that he 's done well uh well that certainly gave us an outstanding view of the context and where we 're going and as i 'm glad you all held your questions as i said we 'd like to hold our questions until the end it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next guest speaker is to introduce phil hanson who i 'm sure is known to all of you he told me that his title as portfolio general manager community connections was something he often had to explain but i 'll leave him to do that thank you everyone thanks helen and just add my welcome to everybody and it 's good to see people here here today i 'm really going to zoom in on to monero street and it 's it 's a project that that council staff will be managing and and we will then sort of arrange separate contracts for the different elements of work as it goes but um i want to start with with what our objectives are you 've seen what peter 's put on the screen as some overall visions and plans um for for this work and and really we want this to be more than just a beautification project all of those things you see on the screen there are important and through the the various things that come out of this work on monero street we 'd hope to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them particularly around sort of smart and connected and those sort of things they 're going to be heavily related to the um the electronics and smarts that go into there but even simple things like lighting and and those sort of improvements where it is and what it looks like and and how it should be managed around what is already uh in monero street um they 're things that need to be worked out and need to be decided this project is a 15 million dollar project for council it it 's funded 10 million from grants and 5 million from council so um so we we have that to uh to work with and um and what we what we anticipate that being able to deliver for us is is pretty much the low street to crawford street section of it like peter said our intention is ultimately that we want to improve from low street down to the queens bridge fully um but this work is really a stage one of that and uh the intention is that we would uh focus on that uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is is not known so we 're not standing here with with preconceived ideas or pre-worked up plans or anything like that um we really want to uh start to work with those who occupy uh the the land on the side of these work areas and and really put down what is going to help deliver those objectives that i had up on the screen there before um so we we we 're really pushing for um for engagement certainly this is a this is a first of uh numerous times you 'll have the opportunity to really get involved in in explaining what 's important to you in this type of work point to be made is that this road is a state road it 's managed particularly by transport for new south wales so that finally anything that happens on there particularly with the travel lanes and the medians and those sort of things we 've got to get transport for new south wales sign off for so they are going to have their own views about around what they want and quite often council discusses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wales because sometimes they 've they 've really got a well it 's a bit of work to get them to see it from our point of view so we 'll do that but i can 't i can 't guarantee that uh that everything that we would want to see there transport for new south wales are going to approve it 's just a constraint we need to keep in mind as we go forward as i said the full detail is is not known and and we we really want to start to look at things along the lines of particularly widening and refurbishing the footpaths the expansion of lighting seating and plantings through there the reduction of the median where appropriate the replacement of the road pavement is a big one for us too we want to remove the concrete pavement through there and replace it with asphalt because that will provide a much um a much better amenity to that site we want to modify the pedestrian refuges and refurbishment of access to car parks and and those sort of things as we go through we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and we want you to be engaged and and part of that and we we really want your input what we 've also got going at the same time as peter mentioned is that the qccp building will be kicking off and the construction of that will will overlap with what we 're doing to monero street just to put that in context from an area ariel they they are close they 're very close projects so the two blue areas would be the areas that we would we would think are going to be affected by construction and and certainly for the for the qccp that whole site is really um is really to be to be changed and uh and altered significantly so in this area here there 's um underground parking to go in so that uh that gets affected and of course the new building the new building is located there of course we need area and space for construction so impacts around that car park whilst we don 't know what they are exactly yet we 're expecting that they will be there so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have have a lot of synergies and so whilst we want your views and thoughts around um monero street some some feedback or any comments that you might have around um what we do because you know oftentimes we would during construction we might try and shift say parking from monero street to somewhere else and the logical place would be the low street car park if that 's tied up with uh construction then we really need to look at some alternatives there so so thinking about how your business is run we want to understand how best to maintain access and keep keep contact all the way through through this construction again there 's another view of the um the new building and as i mentioned um it 's significant work so that 's the outside plaza work underneath that is parking new building goes there and it 's uh it 's certainly going to affect um quite a bit of uh quite a bit of the area there timing timing is this is this is where we are at the moment so as you can see both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraints particularly with the monero street work you may have had previous information that indicated that that date there was 2023 but our funding restrictions require us to get that spent by june 2022 and so we 'll be working to do that as best we can and and that then sort of changes that date so i apologize if that 's been provided earlier in any material that you might have as i said some of these things it 's early days so some of these dates might move a little bit um particularly around approvals because they 're the things that take the the longest time um for us and particularly with transport for new south wales involved some of these start things from an aero street they may they may move around a little bit but we 'll try and keep you informed as much as we can with that now again we i 'm not standing here with a design i can put on the on the on the screen um and really this is the first uh discussion and point around uh talking with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh really just encourage your feedback that 's all i had thanks helen thanks phil uh and as peter said we 're very keen to have your and appreciate your feedback and communication link have been involved in a lot of significant infrastructure projects and construction projects and this one looks like it 's going to be a significant one for all of you as you work in the area and own property in the area and run businesses here an important part of any ability to for organizations like the council to advocate and ensure that they 've taken into consideration the impacted property owners and businesses associated with any infrastructure project actually happens at the coalface and many of you have probably met tracy and joe who have popped around and visited many of the businesses in the region if you haven 't met them they didn 't know i 'm going to say this if you haven 't met them corner them at the end and say hey how come you didn 't come visit me but really these guys play an integral role in ensuring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice uh and and and take into consideration some of the things that might be impacting your business so get to know these ladies tell them your deepest fears um and your visions for the future and know that they will be standing there telling the rest of their organization uh what they are and how important it is that we think about taking those into consideration as we progress through the project did i say that right project but i 'm not sure about that so i 'm going to stop now i 've left my wife down here to wipe the doobie lacquer thing over but i 'm going to introduce tracy and joe who you both know as the project liaison team and hand over to them fabulous thanks helen um good morning to everybody i 'll just get joe to handle that for me if you like thank you um yes well as i said good morning everybody and thanks for coming today i think it 's pretty safe to say that the moneros red upgrade is one of the key projects that peter and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects outlined in last year 's cbd spatial master plan it 's a project that will undoubtedly be a huge change to the face of the cbd but also signal the beginning of the city 's very very exciting transformation across the next 10 years or so it will also be a project that undoubtedly and especially during construction will be challenging to the queen beyond community and to most of you here today who are most importantly the directly impacted stakeholders that are along monero street itself as qprc 's dedicated project liaison team joanna warey or joe and myself oh sorry gentlemen aware and myself i get a bit carried away anyone would think i was italian um do i do myself are committed to keeping you informed engaged and involved right through this project especially through these initial very very important planning stages and then right through to the end of construction the approach that our team has taken to engagement and communication began with talking to other cities other regional cities that have undergone similar projects and what they learned along the way so with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's master plan we 've all of that information has fed into a communication strategy that 's very very focused on what we 're doing today very early genuine two-way consultation and an opportunity for us to get across to you and for you to come back to us with clear and accurate information gathering and for us to deliver that through a huge variety of communication tools and channels the strategy also outlines as as both phil and peter and the mayor and even helen have said for that matter opportunities to have you as those directly impacted stakeholders and more importantly to the broader queen beyond community involved right from the outset and for us qprc to provide you with that support during what could possibly be a very challenging time now as most of you will be aware tracy and i began our initial engagement over the last few weeks now during these conversations we took detailed notes to capture your initial feedback and concerns relating to construction and the design of the street now this word cloud here represents just an overview of this feedback that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to understand what your concerns are right now we will continue to involve and engage with key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project now this will take many forms through ongoing communication as tracy mentioned opportunities to complete further surveys to give us information about your business and also again feedback on how the designs are going but also direct engagement within workshops which will be directly for stakeholders so the first of these will focus on the functionality of the street and will take place in late november the details of which will be confirmed shortly the second will focus on landscaping and design and will take place in early 2021 and the first the third story will finish on business support so we 'll be discussing the ways that we can help support you there 's a variety of ways that we can approach this but we want your input and guidance to let us know what will work for you and your neighbours along the street on the screen is just a few examples of ideas that we 've come across already and i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to helen i just really really want to emphasize how important it is to us here at qprc to have you involved and to gather your feedback right throughout this process especially these critical early planning stages it 's that information that will then inform the final designs and help us to successfully manage and deliver this project for you there 's a current survey and some of you have already filled that some of you have already filled that out for those of you that haven 't it is on the your voice portal which is on the qprc website so if you haven 't gone there and filled it out i really encourage you to do so and finally there 's a dedicated email address and a phone number that comes directly through to joe and myself and also other members of the project team so for any light bulb moments that you have any questions anything at all please don 't be shy and send us an email or give us a call thank you very much [Applause] thank you tracy and joe okay so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all had to sit quietly and uh listen and and get some information uh presented to you and shared with you and the next part of the session we 've got still well over half an hour to go uh is about us listening to you and we 've got a couple of ways that i i would like to do that uh first and foremost i should look at my notes make sure i don 't make it up completely there are two posters here and as i mentioned earlier you all got some post-it notes in a covert friendly envelope and some pens and that 's for you to put down thoughts that perhaps don 't need to be raised in this forum that you don 't need to exfoliate on or talk at large about but that you want to make sure is recorded so it was interesting to see joe put up that word cloud of some of the things that she and tracy had heard as they walked around visiting you all and maybe that 's it maybe we 've got the key things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are only little but need to be added to that so on one side of the stage we 've got a picture that 's got all of those engagement tools uh that tracy referred to talking about early consultation about collecting your information kinds of workshops that we 're going to be running and the project liaison team are there other ideas that you 've got about how you could contribute to this project should there be a regular friday night drinks that tracy hosts for you to talk about the project are there other things that should be done to keep you in the loop of the project that 's where you put those ideas over here is a bit of a sketched out project timeline which is really just to remind you that it 's a long process and that we 've got things to achieve right from the early design and thinking about how the project 's going to be pulled together the project introduction and business readiness has referred to their design and planning construction and a new town centre so that covers everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears about how your customers might access your building uh while construction 's going on um your concerns about the safety of staff when they leave at night uh your concerns about uh how your signage might be covered up by other things that are happening in construction space anything that you 've got concerns about or that you think the design might mean that your door is no longer in the prominent position that it is now and you want to make sure that 's thought about any of those sorts of things pop them on a post-it note and they can go over here and you might feel reluctant to come down in the middle of the presentation while i 'm up here talking away but please don 't come down and pop your poster notes up if you for some reason can 't get up off your seat you might have a sore leg anybody in the room with a sore leg she 's not even listening um then one of our guys will happily take your post-it notes for you and put them up i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access the post-it notes so it might need some help she 's shaking her head at me now okay um so they 're the two ways that we 'd like you to provide your quiet silent feedback if you like because some people don 't necessarily want to participate in a larger conversation the second way is for you to ask some questions or provide some thoughts to our people who presented to you so you might have some questions for tracy or joe or for peter or phil about things that were presented that you wanted to unpack or understand in a little bit further and some of the things that i jotted down that we might think about while we were listening to our speakers was that phil talked about his objectives and they 're quite clear and about revitalizing the city and bringing customers essentially and people into the city and they aren 't at odds i wouldn 't have thought with your objectives from a business point of view how do we ensure that phil understands where that can be achieved in a great way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to think about two projects at once was a really important message that we heard yeah what 's going on out here and what 's going on out there are going to be very close to each other and have significant multiple impacts so how do we ensure and think about those sorts of things you guys know the area certainly better than i do because i don 't even live in queen bee and i live in another part of new south wales the other side of canberra but but you guys know the area better perhaps even than phil and peter because you are there every day so you 've got information that will be useful to the council i did a bit of an account a poor count because i was in the front seat i think there 's about 35 to 40 business people in the room it 'd be great to see nearly that many on these post-it notes returned or feedback provided because this information will contribute to what is discussed at our upcoming workshops the first one is about parking and traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality so we 've already picked that as a key theme are there other things we need to make sure we unpack in that so i 'm going to stop talking for a second and see if anybody has any questions and invite you to start filling in your post-it notes okay i 'm going to repeat the questions i think i said that earlier just so the recording knows so the question is about the clearway that has been referenced before i think that clearway has been mentioned i don 't was mentioned today i wasn 't perhaps paying enough attention but a bit more information on the clearway and how that might fit in yeah as i said before we 're really early days so certainly clearways have been they 've been part of the discussion transport for new south wales are really interested in clearways as well because they have have a lot of particular views about clearways what we 're trying to do is get a balance between how that how that street functions and there 's a couple of distinct times and particularly around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't turn it into a into a traffic jam every morning so clearways is is obviously one tool that we can use where we go with that is going to be very much directed by how we get the feedback and and what things need to look like around that because if it 's you know if it 's not clear ways the other option is to maintain the two lanes through the through the main street um and whether that fits in with whatever uh with with all the other things that we we think we want to see there we 'd need to balance that out so they 're certainly on the page but but definitely not it 's not in concrete yes definitely so like i said we we we 're here to hear what the impacts are okay i 'm just going to interrupt for a sec so that we get the record yeah i i just want to make sure it 's on the recording so the comments that we 've just had then was about um a point made from the audience that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ron made the point that if the majority of businesses felt that a clearway was not the way to go for that street would that be um accepted by council would council take that into consideration phil certainly said yes and then the question was about angle parking and you guys is angle parking something you think would work i know lots of country new south wales towns have angle parking yes yeah so thoughts on that front front to curb or rudicu [Laughter] which one would front front front yeah so again it 's in the same it 's in the same same area where we 're quite happy to look at those layouts of course angle parking from a space perspective perspective takes up quite a bit if if the opportunity is there to um to move lanes around and accommodate that then certainly it can be on the page so ron is that the kind of thing that perhaps we could go into at our um traffic planning workshop and maybe if we get the traffic models along to tell us how you would fit it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too one of the other um things that that we 're interested in doing is really trying to maximize the use of the footpath area now some of that could be in widening the footpath and how that might fit with an angle parking arrangement as well a wide footpath angle parking you can you can see how it 's a bit of a juggling act and what you might see in one part of the street might not be in all of the street so so lots of options yes sir just behind thanks david um the question was why does the concrete need to be ripped no definitely just aware that we are recording this and you 're not microphones so we can 't um hear what that is um so the concrete from from our perspective the concrete um it 's progressing as far as deterioration are concerned you 'd notice a lot of the expansion joints have been um have been lifted out and and you know it 's it 's deteriorating as as we look at it from an amenity point of view and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to try and get get less noise and less impact in that area and and asphalt provides that for us it also helps with the ongoing maintenance of it so to do maintenance on the concrete there you 'll notice that transport for new south wales i you know i 've been working at this council for 11 years and i don 't think there 's been much maintenance to that concrete over the whole time it 's a difficult process asphalt improves that are you concerned about the um how long it will take to rip the concrete up yeah so it 's about the project being extended because of that complexity yeah yeah okay so that 's that 's ours that 's our thoughts on it at the moment so yeah okay i 'm going to lots of questions i 'm also going to ask tracy and joe if you 'd like to wander around and see if anyone 's got any post-it notes but they 're too shy to put them on the uh the boards okay a couple of questions here starting here and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was around the fact that two projects at once um is a significant investment by the council and what bandwidth was the word you use what resources does council think um it doesn 't have enough resources to do that in a timely manner not see delays and things yeah good question so the way we why we deal with that is we we uh staff up for the for the various projects that come along as a matter of fact i 've probably got um five projects on the hop all worth more than 20 million dollars so um you know there there are quite a few things that are that are keeping us occupied so we we will typically resource in for the particular projects so i have i have um staff in our contracts and projects team that will head up the contract work and then typically it 's management of both contracts and contractors there that we would then go looking for um resources to do that we 're we 're getting ready to do that for the qccp building and in the same way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so i 'm going to take that as just feedback that will record and i should have said that in addition to it being recorded we will also write a report from today of all of the feedback so the feedback has been a great suggestion about shifting the seats um during construction so they 're in the shade in summer and not in the way in other parts of the of the year thank you that 's great a great suggestion up the back thank you excellent so the question was about um front access to buildings and what impact may occur during construction and how long and will it be blocked and for how long and i suspect the answer to that isn 't known yet i would toss that back to you and say uh what could you tolerate what would be some of the things the project needs to take into consideration but i 'll give phil a chance to answer that yeah look our intention is that we don 't want to we don 't want to block access at any time during business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would be working hard to maintain that but you might end up having to perhaps go a different way to get into the shop still through the front door but um but it may require sort of walking along the footpath a little bit but trying to maintain that access during business hours is is something that we will be putting in the contract for the successful contractor who 's got that section of work now there may be circumstances because this is one of the things i guess with this project is really interesting there 's lots of infrastructure in the ground that 's been in there since 1930. and we think we know where things are but i 'll guarantee you when we start digging things up we 're going to get surprised so we as much as we can we 'll we 'll try and maintain the access and do everything we can the key would be will we talking constantly with shop owners as they beg as they get affected by the works as it progressively moves around and if there are issues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so the question was about um i guess if alternate access was was required uh who has to undertake that negotiation with neighbouring businesses for example to be able to gain access through a laneway at the back or through the shared access and i i before freelancers i 'm having fun answering the questions on his behalf because i think that those sorts of things are roles that tracy and joe would help you with as well and that through this period they would be able to help build some relationships amongst businesses that are next door or perhaps haven 't had as much to do with each other certainly those are the things that i imagine joe would be and trace you 'd be keen to negotiate and achieve for you exactly that so we want to help businesses um work together to to get through this construction phase so if there 's assistance that can be provided through uh through tracy 's team uh more than happy to get involved uh and and we would encourage the separate shop owners to talk anyway and just work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if things get too hard we we want to we want to help the um one of the things that phil mentioned there i might draw to your attention having years of experience advocating on behalf of community organizations impacted by projects phil made mention to the fact that they would write into the contract to the construction crew that were doing the particular works in front of your shops that access needs to be maintained and that 's a real thing so there are things that can be written into a council contract on your behalf to help ensure that nothing 's foolproof of course you 've all been involved in construction and you know things don 't always happen the way we 've planned but it is an important thing to think about one of the reasons why these things are good to raise early so that phil and his team can think about well actually we can make that part of the contract of the delivery by the construction team that they have to make sure that between the hours of 8 30 and 6 30 every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things we want to hear nice and early boards are starting to fill up on this side don 't have any suggestions about how nobody took up my suggestion about friday night drinks or any other ways they want to be engaged other questions or comments thank you sir thanks michael so the question was about when we do the um cultural precinct upgrade on this side ham and the main street at the time thing so what will be how many um in in and out points will there be in the upbridge street car park oh how many car parks will be impacted yeah so the rally street car park is the one oh that 's what you call that oh yeah okay right legit that one um um so there 's there 's a variety of um construction things which will affect that that in and out at the end of the day um during construction uh once it 's done then access into the car park from rutledge street will still be there no no so we 'll maintain that as much as we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an underground car park there so again it comes down to how a contractor might want to manage that but um but we 'll we 'll do what we can to maintain that or keep it open as as much as we can and it may mean that accessing from low street is about the only way you 'll get in uh at various times but we 'd want to keep it keep as much going as we can so as you 're consider just to paraphrase the com the comments that are made here you 're you 're concerned you 're wanting to understand how much um access there will be from that rutland street side and are you concerned because um the traffic cues to get into it or are you concerned because it 'll take too long to get in and out of the car park yeah yep yeah so it 's about the challenges with the school just there and pick up and drop up at three three o 'clock that that part gets congested yeah and bottle shops so people want to pop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that traffic i think that 's really good stuff to take into consideration thank you yep it 's on that corner there so we we know that the two projects you know in an ideal world we would like to separate them out however the money that we 've got from the grant process has very specific spend requirements on it and i can 't defer that if i defer it we 'll lose it so so that becomes an issue yep so i 'm just explaining the issues about how come these two projects on uh and the second one is that that the um the new building 's certainly been something that needs to get done and uh and we need to push ahead and get that organized as well so phil in terms of our plans for the workshop coming up which was about traffic functionality is that the phrase are you thinking um does that will that extend to the sorts of things that um are being talked about on that side of the car park or is that planning yet to happen for the cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as i mentioned there 's there 's as construction goes on and starts there will be impacts to access into there exactly what they are standing here i don 't know yet but we 'll be working with again with a contractor to minimize that so at our workshop um in november we can make sure we document that kind of stuff and that will inform your discussions with the contractors yes yeah okay we must make sure we get that recorded well couple more questions uh yeah i 'll just get this chat because he 's new so the question from jess is it jess jasper was about whether the multi-story car parks would be paid car parks or other forms of car parks so how expensive they 're going to be so count as council has not decided to put uh paid parking anywhere so that 's that 's where it stands at the moment thank you ron so there 's a record of deferral on the new council building okay so how does that fit into oh i see yeah so so because it 's a it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so it is going through that process it 's not essentially been deferred but they 've asked for more information to come back yeah so that information has been provided back to um i 've just forgotten what that group is the joint regional planning panel and the jrpp and that 's been provided back to them so we 're expecting a decision out of them um very soon so um the question i just want to yeah i got it wrong i just want to clarify so just that deferral that ron refers to is the deferral of the approval process not the project yep so we 've got that and then the question is about whether there is an objection process that sits with that after after the joint planning group has made its decision so the jrpp won 't object they 'll either approve it or not approve it so um once we 've provided the additional information if uh if they 're okay to approve it then that 's that 's what happens but i think you 're asking ron if you can object for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are some questions remaining that you 're not sure whether they 're answered yet around the heritage um aspects with it being in keeping with the buildings on either side of the new one so i think that 's just a point made just a point yeah take take it boy thanks ron over here thank you just anybody 's got new ones i 'm going back to regulars so i 'm going to leave you for a minute and ask somebody new so the point that was made by jenny was it kelly i 'm sorry kelly uh the point that was made by kelly was concerned about how uh how genuine the phrase partnership was uh and in kelly 's views the uh partnership means that when we have the workshop and the views of the workshop are quite clearly formed and the consensus has reached that council will acknowledge uh that those views have been expressed i think phil has already said yes he will but i might just i 'll let you answer that then i 'm going to ask kelly a question yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to get involved it 's a it 's a it 's an indication or um you know really showing that we want to we want to engage we want to hear and we want to listen um things around you know bits of the low street car park that might get affected by construction they 're up there as a as a possibility again i don 't until we get a final contractor and understand how much area they need to construct that building um it may be it may affect some of it um it 's unlikely to affect all of it but it may affect none of it too they might have some other ideas and thoughts around how they might do it so we 've still got a fair way to go and can i say that through this process eventually there 's going to be a design get to council that includes everything that 's been understood and heard and thought of as we 've gone through this process and council are very keen to know that the community have been consulted and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will point to these types of things and show how we 've integrated the thoughts and comments that have come back from the community into that process it is always challenge kelly and and it is good that you seek to hold the partnership accountable for that and i guess one of the things that i would um flag that i i 'm hearing from today that will ensure is facted into the first workshop around parking and pla and traffic and things like that is to get to the finer detail of understanding how your business operates how the 89 year old woman got to your shop where she had to park how she accessed the building et cetera so that we can think about well what other areas for assistance might exist so it and today is not the forum to do that because we need to have information we don 't know exactly how many parks there are all those sorts of things some of the questions that were asked earlier get that information but needing to figure out how we can minimize perhaps the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can have at the school what alternative parking arrangements we might be able to have for your staff so they don 't have to go out every half an hour to ship their cars so it doesn 't always have to be about whether that car park is closed or not it 's what else is put in place to to um to replace what the service that car park was providing so we need to we 'll need to think outside the square and you can 't always solve it you 're right sometimes it just becomes tough but it 's good to hold us accountable that 's very good um um as an overarching point which is that you haven 't been sold on the vision so so you haven 't yet felt that what has been espoused by tim and peter and phil as the outcome of the the expenditure on these projects is really going to make a difference i 'm not sure whether we can address that write this no okay we 'll let peter peter 's going to dwell on that and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of other questions thank you for being so patient sir um i 'm going to take that as just a great idea um so the suggestion that was made here was or the question um was if uh access to a particular office was impacted by construction would the council be interested in providing accommodation elsewhere that could perhaps be shared on a roster basis or certain businesses could access at certain times i think that 's just a great idea that you take away and you might have picked up in the presentation that that um that tracy is already out there looking for ideas on how to support businesses through this process so if availability of other spaces is one way to do that then certainly put it on the table and uh and we will do what we can to assist thank you yeah great one uh at the back thank you for your patience thank you cheryl cheryl there 's a follow-up comment and question i think we 'll hand to peter as he closes today um which is that it 's all very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheryl 's counted 13 near just on the ground floor of me where she is um that how will these empty shops be filled where are these new exciting businesses that we talk about going to come from it 's all very well to create it build it and they will come but that 's peter 's challenge he 'll tell us his thoughts on that any other questions we are getting towards the end of our time thank you sir thank you steve so the comment was about action and consequences and was curious to know what um research the council had done on other projects that it had action and what those consequences had been so that um uh we could test whether some of our ears were going to work or not and the example that was given was goulburn which is angle parking rather than riding their foot paths people are eating inside the restaurants and that seems to be producing good outcomes yep so peter will cover but just to reassure that we we are doing that at a number of levels so certainly uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already been in contact with with some of those and understood or tried to understand some of the problems they face um in addition to uh the fact that we do look at other areas that have had revamps and um steal their ideas but um but a thing to point out is that we want to be specific to queanbeyan as well so what might work in gold will all might work in narrow or might work somewhere else particularly it may not be a fit for for queanbeyan and it 's got a lot to do with how people want to use this uses the area in the space so we 're very conscious of that too and we we want to work through that thank you i 'm going to take a minute to read some of the things that have been added up here because just because people wrote them down doesn 't mean we won 't want to hear them collectively today you can sit down okay river quality water quality for recreation attracting people to the river what 's being done there upgrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease of starting and conducting a business in queanbeyan so that 's some of the things about how do we attract or very well to build this beautiful space how do we attract businesses so some good thoughts there for consideration more street space for alfresco dining and street dining a ring road around car parks for rear access to businesses on monaro a large licensed eatery areas covered and weatherproofing along monero river recreational area water quality so a couple of things there about the river better lighting in alleyways more potential seating for elderly and people with disabilities well thought out foot traffic capability um during construction please yes that we 've had that point that 's very important uh rental subsidies during construction stages certainly some of the things that we should feed into tracy and joe about how we help our businesses rental subsidies can the council provide alternative office accommodation thanks for that one will i be compensated if i have to close my business certainly all things that we like to hear i 'd like to see signage on the external scaffolding and fencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate the businesses very important better curbing or access ways for people with prams can access to the buildings be written into the contract hence my talking earlier about contract and access so thank you for the person who raised that would like a discussion feedback on access and parking in crawford street during the building of the qccp require close and freely available parking and easy access so that 's certainly about understanding that 's a particular type of business that needs to have easy access for their clientele certainly important to have that kind of information a sole suggestion and if it says drinks on friday i 'll be impressed over here regular email and newsletter updates a community notice board for updates on the works actually that 's something that we 've found to be quite successful in a number of projects is that traffic you know those traffic signs that remind you what the bushfire rating is or that we 're in bushfire season sometimes some of those in a in a clear location can help both your customers and your staff and people visiting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's exactly going on one last question thank you yeah so the point that was made which is an interesting one to finish on is that there are currently lots of psychologists in the area and that perhaps we shouldn 't require it but perhaps people who wish to visit those psychologists are keen that it 's a fairly quiet part of town and they won 't bump into anybody on their way in and if we see that part of town being revitalized with many restaurants and things perhaps the psychologists won 't feel it fits their business needs anymore and i think that 's an interesting point because the hardest thing about these sorts of projects is actually uh trying to keep as many people happy as possible so there was a number of suggestions about well if everybody agrees will you listen uh absolutely that 's actually an easier question to answer then if uh half the businesses would like to see this the other half have different kinds of requirements and would like to see this bottle shop providers who want people to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be able to park so elderly can access their elderly clients can access their businesses sometimes those competing needs can make it even harder so that 's where that word partnership that kelly talked about becomes really important thank you i appreciate you all letting me facilitate this kind of thing sometimes it can be frustrating to have a woman with a microphone taking charge but it does provide a greater opportunity for people to express their views and be heard by all means if you 've written something on a post-it note add it to the appropriate board we have recorded today and we 'll be writing up the feedback and comments that have been provided and that will factor in to tracy and joe 's ongoing learnings about what the businesses need in order for the outcomes that feel mentioned to be realised with without you being an expense but rather you being the benefit of that um and uh as i said we have got workshops planned i get to come back and see you all again for those workshops so please if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have that information on it um peter you had two or three things you needed to talk about which as facilitator i should remind you let 's see if i can remember vision we haven 't quite got the vision build it and and they will come how will we attract the businesses here and i guess that overarching commitment of being prepared to listen to what 's going on over to you thanks peter thanks helen what i might do is i might just draw back on a couple of key points uh i 'll just there it is there so so we heard today from from phil that that there are two uh projects that are taking place concurrently uh the queamian civic and cultural precinct has been in planning for many many years the community including yourselves has provided very very positive feedback with the transformation strategy in 2017 the cbd master plan in 2019 followed by the cbd place plan so the broader community including businesses and no doubt folks here today have provided positive feedback on the pathway that council is setting across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression there can 't be any gain without pain likewise you 're all aware of the ambitions of council having heard your feedback about the importance of car parking keep key messages parking remains free parking is increasing by 20 all redundant daggy ugly asheville car parks are being recycled into multi-level modern smart car parks above ground or below ground the remainder of that is being converted into public domain places for people to congregate people places for people to move between the shops why is that that was also informed by your feedback in the retail growth strategy of the last 12 24 months as well what were the key findings that you put forward and the evidence put up people shop in canberra not in queanbeyan why is that the main street is full of professional rooms not retail this is about converting monero street to a high street retail places how do we do that put parking behind the main street get people out of their cars to walk in front change behaviors that the only reason i 'm going to shop at your place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most the congestion in the cbd anywhere is people driving around in circles trying to find a car park smart modern centralized multi-level car parking with the apps we 'll be using the same apps as canberra will be using enables people to find their spot quickly they know where it is how to get there the point of difference it will be free compared to canberra so this is about revitalizing the camp the queanbeyan cbd partly about converting perhaps the vacancies into retail places niche investments niche businesses that will cause people to come here as a destination converting it into a highly visual highly attractive modern and pedestrian friendly high street will enable your bus your patrons to come and walk past the shops to your particular shop it might be via a cafe yes there may be issues with with restaurants we heard before but the early thinking that we had from the feedback we had before was that part of the narrow street will include wider foot paths cafe spots angle parking reduced median strips lighting trees shade seating they 're all the elements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feedback to work out how where when the key feature is i feel to put forward is there is a poor asset called monero street that needs refurbishment the concrete itself adds to the noise the dust the vibration that makes monero street not attractive to businesses not attractive to your customers the ambitions of the transformation strategy and cbd master plan is more workers more residents more customers walking the streets that gets them in your door that activates your business so yes we do have an issue where there is a concurrence of the two bodies of work happening um obviously at the same time but there 's a decade of investment almost half a billion dollars of investment capital investment to activate the cbd incentivize private investment it does involve height it does involve more dense apartments and offices but we are working closely with levels of government to get more workers into here the other feature uh was this that we heard from tracy earlier it is about parking it is about traffic movement it is about noise vibration all those things that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elephant drive extension was open it 's now open we now have this unique opportunity where that body of work can be undertaken it is being undertaken in two stages great ideas about potential pop-ups where businesses may be able to occupy temporary accommodation while their own business may be impacted but as phil pointed out all measures will be taken to ensure that your access remains open the contractors responsibilities will be that you have a means to get inside your street through tracy and joe and martin how we can work with your business partners to get access from their ear or otherwise you might recall part of the ambitions of the monero street upgrade the morrisette street car park upgrade and including the refurbishment of the laneways connecting those places which is all part of this vision and the project ultimately is to give those businesses on the northern side of monero street access to double frontages you 'll have a rear access now onto the new public domain where people will be coming straight out of their cars that adds value to your business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the and the and the patronage of new business is to a larger part up to your own inventiveness and your own sense of entrepreneurial activity the the council with the government is putting the hands into the public purse to make these investments to catalyze and excite that investment by the private sector but the workshops as as we heard before were very important that 's where these views of today come together that 's where the more uh particular matters will come out as phil pointed out traffic transport for new south wales is a key partner in this as well but we 're very keen to make sure those items that you 've expressed again that you see on board are taken into account thank you very much for your time uh we 're we 're right on everyone you want to close now okay look so so again through tracy joe and martin we 'll be in touch we invite you to those further workshops to get more granular detail about where to go but it 's important we work together on this for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you"

    "text": "[Music] council 's weeds inspection process is a systematic approach of inspecting all properties in our localities we treat everyone the same whether it 's a public piece of land or private some of the things that holds back can be we come across like gates or people defer to inspection because they 'd like to be part of it we always encourage people to be part of our inspection program we 're there to provide education on identification those weeds it 's quite often better to see the weeds in their setting on your property rather than looking at pitches because plants change the way they look throughout the season the ways we identify the properties that are going to be inspected depends on the time to year we try and get to most properties over our inspection cycle there is a large number of properties we work on a four year cycle so if we didn 't get some properties in the spring in this cycle then we try and get to those properties in the next cycle and it 's based on priorities especially if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking at trying to get where those weeds at least the optimum time to inspect for those plants councils produce a list of properties that are going to be inspected some of those are just routine inspections others are specific inspections or follow-up inspections that list is then passed on to the inspectors to try and aim to get letters out to the landowners at least a month prior to the inspection the letter has a month that we 're going to come through encourage you to ring up and make an appointment we have two michaels which makes it a bit more difficult so if you 're thinking about making inspection then always use their last name as well it also has a little fact sheet on the process for inspecting what will happen they 'll walk around take photographs come back to the office and enter that detail into our system a report is sent out to landowner with some fact sheets and what we 've found and what the requirements are under the biosecurity act we 'll have a list of the different weeds the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are and their legal obligation a lot of the widespread weeds these will be just looking at minimisation other words like gaws and we will say eradication if you have any concerns or questions in regards to the report please call the officer as listed on the bottom of the letter once you 've received your report the next inspection depending on the risk and impact of that plant and how widespread it is could range from three months to within the next four years cycle if you have a good control program we 'll schedule that in the next four years but if we find some weeds on a property where they are causing an impact we may encircle that inspection within three months if there 's an important weed that you should be controlling then we will schedule a follow-up inspection if you want to make an inspection time please call into council to make those arrangements"

ring the one 300 number that 's one three hundred seven seven eight zero eight zero some of the other services that we can offer is we can provide technical advice on erosion and containment line management so obviously a lot of containment lines came in from the bush fires so we 've got technical experts on staff that can provide you with advice and help try to avoid some erosion happening down the track and help you protect your landscapes and your land so that 's the main things we 've got on offer at the moment but also encourage you to contact the rural assistance authority who @ @

with the Red Cross I 've been in this position since March this year I 've got a background in community services and also worked extensively with fire impacted communities to the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria in 2009 I cover the Queanbeyan colouring Regional Shire Council area and also the Yoruba dollar Shire Council area I am part of a network of Red Cross recovery officers working across the fire impacted States on the ground to inform the Red Cross response to the fires including and financial support through our grants program along with our Red Cross volunteers I spent time in the community to listen to what people need and also to learn about what the community 's concerns are by talking to people in the community I can find out where more supports are needed and then I can help ensure that those supports are provided and I work very closely with other agencies to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery effort is very much for the long term and that people 's needs change over time and that 's why our recovery program is for three years we also know how important it is for the community to lead their own recovery that 's why we walk alongside and help build the capacity of the community so that you have the skills and knowledge to navigate the recovery journey on your own into the future that 's why we offer people a range of recovery and preparedness initiatives to support people before during and after a disaster one of the ways we provide support for children individuals families educators and organizations is through the many Red Cross recovery resources that we have online and also as booklets our online resources can be found at WWE today you but I have a couple that I want to share with you today one of the more important ones relates to a resource that helps you navigate how to support people of different ages so it starts off from infants and goes all the way up to adults and is a fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that you 're caring for in the recovery space looking after yourself after a disaster is a another invaluable resource because it really tells you what happens to people during the course of recovery what to expect and what you might experience and also to reassure people that it 's all very normal another resource that we have for children which is used heavily by educators is copies after the emergency and it has lots of fantastic information targeted at young children to help them through the recovery journey I 'm more than happy to share those resources with anyone that might be interested so I 'll leave my details at the end of this video in case they 'll want to make contact and we can make sure we can get those resources to you I just wanted to finish off this video by talking about our financial assistance in the form of our Red Cross grants we really do want to make sure that people who had their homes destroyed or damaged or had damage to septic water or power infrastructure have access to air grants we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs and our most recent update is our re-establishment grant so this grant is for people who lost their primary place of residence so whether that was a

where the priorities are for the community and to help us do that we 've also put out a survey recently to the business community you may have seen it already it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community 's priorities are and where we can allocate funds towards at the moment the feedback that we 're getting is that tourism is a high priority so that 's something we 've we 're definitely working on with Ryan who 's put together a great campaign around the treasure trail campaign which will be made public soon so we can have some more feedback from the community we 've also got another priority that the business community have noted is business mentoring people are saying they 'd love to have some support and more one-on-one mentoring and that 's something we 're looking to roll out over over a 12-month period as well and the other priority that we have is a local shopper or a shop local campaign we 've had a lot of interest from business owners to to redo that we 've had success with that in the past in the QPR sea area so we 're looking at rolling out another one of those campaigns but that 's that 's all still in the works as I said it 's we 're still getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that feedback I 'm gonna roll out some some more initiatives now on the where like I said I 'm working here out of the bush flyer hub which means that you can just drop in at any point and have a chat with us if you 're struggling with business or if you 'll want to find out a bit more about grants then we 're here we 're in in here five days a week I 'm only out here a few days a week but there are there are number of people that here that can can support you as well and we have got some news through that covered the covert 19 10,000 small business grant has been extended so that was supposed to close on the 1st of June but there has been extended so if you haven 't got your application in for that I do encourage you to do so it 's 10,000 I can really help with the cash flow we 've had a couple of people who have managed to get the 10,000 bushfire grant we 've had three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you haven 't got that one either the bush fire or the covert make sure that you get your application in and if you need help we can sit down and go through that application with you now one of the challenges with grants that we 've identified is that a lot of the primary producers in the area or those who were primary producers but because of the drought or because of the bush fire had to go out and seek other work and no longer have more than 50% of their income derived from the farm in other words they 've got another job and they 're making more money from that job now from the farm because of a number of factors those guys seem to be falling through the cracks and unable to get assistance so if you are I know anyone who has that struggle at the moment they 're if they 're struggling to get any assistance at all you know they need some help then put them in touch with us send them over to the hub because we have some solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some solutions to help those people through that might just give them enough of a leg up to to get them through the tough times so please send them down to the hub which is located in the old library in Braidwood but we do encourage you to turn up now if you have any questions for us we are running you know we 're putting out new prayer programs all the time for for local business owners so if you do have any questions or you 'd like to to hear more please feel free to put in some questions all talk to you soon bye for now"

    "text": "morning folks last night council considered its final position on the proposed full merger and the petition between queanbeyan and paula rang took quite some time a lot of motions and amendments to get there but finally council landed on a position where they decided to conditionally support a for merger of queanbeyan counts on a power n council based on a number of conditions those conditions were around the request of government they provide 10 million dollars to go towards the upgrade of services and systems and bringing the merger costs together of two organizations the second big condition was asking of the government that because of the size of backlog at pallor on council in particular and certainly the ongoing backlog that may come from queanbeyan that a 20 million dollar investment of the government in that infrastructure backlog and a new assets would put a new council on a good footing but there were some other conditions that were important to also consider the council looked at the the situation of equity between staff across the two organizations at the end of the day this is two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to embrace that opportunity should that emerge we don 't know when that decision will be made we expected still be announced in the middle of this year but it may be earlier so there is a section of the legislation the local government act call section 2 and HCA we spoke about that last time section 2 and HCA defines a rural center of a population of less than 5,000 the staff numbers in a town of that size where it has a council based must keep those staff numbers in that town in perpetuity that 's bound inside the legislation and that 's quite different to local government act that the level govern award that most of you are employed under the local government award provides protection asst to your terms and conditions your salaries if you like for three years after the emergences so all of the queanbeyan staff who are not on contract have the protections of the award the powering staff also have those protections on the award however the jobs are kept in perpetuity in the town 's of bond or brave wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council had some had some concerns about the equity between queen minute pal rang staff and but took particularly in Bungendore given their 20 or 30 minutes apart you might recall that when holidaying was formed it was formed on the basis of talla gander and yarralumla coming together at that time many of the staff of what is now powering were actually based in quenyan similarly the 80 odd staff who were based in Bungendore many of which live outside the touch of bond or many live in queanbeyan living many live in acct so the open of council was that there is no real reliance on the township of bond or on the employment of those staff in barn door for its economy and social fabric hence council has asked that they be consideration by the government about not classifying bungendore as a rural center under the local government act if that does come to pass then that means we have great opportunity to blend the two organizations together at least between the queanbeyan and bungendore office both towns will still retain an office presence both towns will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way we deliver services at the end of the day that will be government decision there are further things that we need to also understand the council submission is also based on recognizing the skills at Padres staff have particularly around roads and and weeds for example it 's the powering council has built up a great reputation working with the roads and maritime services and has a contract with many millions dollars a year each year they rely on that contract to a large extent to maintain a number of staff their plant and equipment and certainly the skills we would not want that lost that 's an important thing to retain in a new organization equally there are skills that pattern have around weeds that we may be able to share amongst other areas around councils in the region so we have a real opportunity here to recognize the opportunity to blend and two organizations together council is very strong to make sure that the government understood that there is no force job losses through the blending of two organizations in fact that 's what our understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full merger recommended that the only changes would be the redeployment of back office staff to some frontline services and indeed they propose that we increase the number of staff by 11 to provide additional services in many respects the savings of government anticipates can in fact be delivered by providing more services with the same resources the other feature that I wanted to bring around was the matters of representation the council again reinforce that they expect to have 13 councillors with no awards and a popular liquid mirror that means that we 're 1313 counselors across the larger population base of a combined queen in empowering we actually have around the same rate of councillors to residents as we currently have about 12 4,300 folks we are going through the process of change we 've spoken about this before no change is no option that 's quite clear we have been preparing ourselves since last year about how we prepare for a new council come the new elections the council elections now won 't be held until March of next year so we have more time to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll talk about more about that next time take care"

australia day thank you for the welcome to country uncle warren indeed it always was and always will be aboriginal spiritual land on the 15th of may 1947 my father theodore suris was naturalized an australian citizen and british subject he arrived in australia in 1937 to make preparations for the remainder of his family to also migrate in the meantime world war ii inflicted an 11-year separation until australia reopened immigration and my mother canela arrived together with two children peter and anastasia they were added to the naturalization certificate on the 10th of november 1948. it is unimaginable that my mother and two children endured worldwide depression on the greek island of kythera and the torment of being under enemy occupation during world war ii in that time my father had enlisted in the australian army in 1942 and was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in 1949 in gunadar new south wales where my father and his brother-in-law had established the acropolis and white rose cafes my mother bit the hand of the midwife the wife of the local nissan dealer as i was born two years later saw another gun at our birth that of my younger brother stephen i attended gunned our primary school and learnt to play the piano from the gunned our sisters of mercy but before that as singletonians know only too well the 1955 floods occurred and ganedah was inundated by the namoi river up to the main street our house was ten foot deep in water now last month with keep it damn at one hundred percent gunada experienced flooding reminiscent of the one in one hundred year level and at the same time singleton had another close call i 'm sure i was something of a problem child for in 1961 i was banished to boarding school in armadale a few weeks later when my parents visited for the first time i greeted them in school uniform with polish shoes and the school hat i raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea a reformation of such magnitude in so little time was humanly possible the piano playing gave way to rugby a sport i embraced and paid representatively at all levels by the time i reached singleton however my injuries transformed me into a rugby referee which i enjoyed in the hunter valley for another decade in a parallel universe my wife vasi 's family migrated together to australia in 1957 from the greek from from from corinth in greece as part of the assisted passage program they had to be of good character and pass a tb chest x-ray their first abode was in the greater migrant camp until aristidis was employed by bhp in wollongong and gained his welding certificate soon thereafter vassi 's father and brothers who later operate the operated the mcdougall 's hill celtics roadhouse were naturalized in 1960 vassi 's mother refused to be naturalized until 1970 for some reason only she would understand both my parents and parents in law found their local australian communities accepting engaging and accommodating permit me one more very short story my uncles mick and spiro migrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 11 and 13. they got off the ship at woolamaloo and somehow found their way to central railway station there to board the overnight north west male bound for corindai it 's astonishing they alighted and found their way to a cafe operated by a relative and were put to work in the kitchen where their contact with australians would be minimal so that they wouldn 't learn to speak english too quickly and be off departing to make their own fortune well they soon spoke english by necessity and were on their way they established a delicatessen and takeaway food business in tamworth these little boys my parents and my in-laws were all lucky their sea tickets took them to australia the term naturalization gave way to citizenship in 1984. today 's citizenship ceremonies are one of the most meaningful events of an australia day it 's an honour to be witness and i hope our newly made citizens for them this will be one of the happiest days of their lives why am i telling you all this well because everyone 's story and history is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original fleets were born in australia of australian-born parents of migrant parents or you are yourself a migrant australia has become the world 's greatest multicultural democracy education was and still is the key it enables everyone to pursue a dream work hard raise their families and be successful whether you relate to indigenous reconciliation or migrant assimilation as it was called you are all equally part of the richly cultured modern australia as it

of experiences a lot of a lot of fun times yeah so a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of hard work i don 't think people appreciate just how much work goes into being a counsellor no yeah and you 're the first properly elected man in 2000 in 2012 yeah that was a surprise that was a surprise surprise was it well you know back at that time i was 78. oh yeah and uh over the many years of going to elections i 've been to a lot of elections yeah absolutely well over 55 years yeah that 's right and and when you 're going up for elections they say don 't don 't vote for all those old ones get rid of them and uh that was a surprise here yeah but it worked that worked out well you can 't put an old head on young shoulders though can you no no no that worked out well that was that was a good that was a good council yeah yeah that term so you also you 've had a a a more than significant career with the ses here locally and across the across the state uh tell us a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the those magnificent volunteer organizations of our community yeah well i i joined ses in 1960 and and i 'm i 'm still a member i 'm actually a life member of state emergency and i 've still got a id card which says that i 'm an emergency officer well i i 've done those things over the years i wouldn 't like to have to do that again and many things have happened you know floods here in siegelin i was on a flying squad for floods throughout new south wales where we went and helped other people the singleton the singleton ses has a really good reputation around that i know the singleton branch back in the in the uh the super storm of uh 2015 i think it was were dispatched across the region as well so that that um that that trait 's been passed on through the ranks and through the years yes yes yeah this uh singleton unit of ses is one of the best in the state yeah it is really is they put a lot of time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across and look at the new facility as yet not yet no i 'm waiting for an official invitation well we 're waiting we 're waiting for this covered crisis to to pass this having a new official opening so yeah so you you did you did have another highlight which wasn 't based here in singleton it was as an ses leader you were called upon to provide your service and your experience and skills at threadbay yes i was uh task force commander of 300 volunteers ses volunteers i spent 10 days at uh threadbar 1997. no about 1997 somewhere about that yeah a long time ago and uh that that was a pretty hairy experience i can tell you the um i i took over the ses volunteers the day after diver was rescued but there were still 11 bodies in the in amongst the rubble inside which our people and and others helped to get out and it was cold early i bet it was yeah i 've i i got very sick while i was there and and of course didn 't give up because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i froze and and i can tell you i 've been the thread by twice the first the last time i don 't want to go back there again yeah i can imagine imagine how traumatic the scenes would have been yeah no conditions it was a hairy operation i can tell you here so you 've been awarded the order of australian medal uh for your services to local government and ses yes that must have been a proud moment for both you yourself and and your and your wife chan yes of course yes and uh jan 's always helped uh all the way through all of this we did it all together yeah a real partnership yes yeah yeah you know that that was a surprise uh what year that was was that bestowed 94 94 94 okay yeah it was the first uh the first um australian honours in in the in ses in new south wales yeah yeah first one you know that was another surprise you know nobody tells you anything about all of this yeah they 'll keep those things under wraps yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a surprise so yeah and you know and you shouldn 't know anyway but i never ever knew who nominated me and and all of that and i never bothered i never worried too much and when i was there in 2000 had to read the red file here in council because it all came out yeah so that 's the way it goes yeah but your your participation and your involvement in the community hasn 't just been with cancer and so yes when putting together the nomination for the freeman on the show which i was very privileged to have the opportunity to do um your list of involvement participation as long as my arm there 's our care there 's meals on wheels there 's the senior citizens there was how park tennis club so you 've been yourself and jan i 've got to mention jen again i 've been involved in so many wonderful things for for 60 plus years what drove you what what was what put the fire in the belly community community service that 's that 's why i did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family were community people and i suppose that 's rubbed off and you know how we all how i got started in local government i was i was in apex and i 'm a life member of apex as well so i missed that one yeah it 's probably a number i 've missed oh that 's that 's right and senior citizens but i was president of apex in 1960 61 and you only have a one term one year term as president and after i was president you go onto the board and they asked me to to go into the community and report back to the club about say council and so on so i used to attend the council meetings and i became interested yeah a long time ago i stood for election in 1963 but they didn 't want me then so that was all right and some of the guys around town came to me and they said you wouldn 't do that again would you i said you watch in the rest of its history for one for one moment back in 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'd still be sitting here in 2012 no no no no it 's just all happened just all happened yeah see i was on the uh the municipal council of course until the amalgamation yep went through the amalgamation and uh that was a smooth amalgamation local government we were lucky lucky and i was on the provisional council then when we had the elections for the shire in 1978 i missed out and came back on council 83 yeah yeah yeah and i didn 't go away no he never went away and i knew there was a reason why that little that little break it was it was procedural matters that were being attended to now i don 't want to single out a community group but our care is very unique the services they provide in this local government area and in their reach and their impact um how long have you been involved in now care and and tell us about why why you think it 's such an important part of our community well to start with uh in 1966 uh jannan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives we uh actually started meals on wheels in singleton we formed a little group we started meals on oils in cigarette and that progressed over the years and then we got the building down in bathurst street there and formed the senior citizens association then combined with the pensioners association so it all came together then then there were hacks and those other community organizations here in town and they approached uh meals on wheels so you sits to come on board and and that 's how it started and you know it went from it went from that small group of uh volunteers for meals on wheels to what it is today yeah and it 's a big organization today in town it 's a big organization it does a big job does it mean job does a big job and their impact why it might seem below the surface at times it 's yeah it 's exponential and you you really can 't put a number on no a number on what they on the outcomes that they provide to our community and see that i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board for our care and we work along with leslie haidey who i 've known for a long while yeah actually leslie aidy was uh working for state emergency service and uh she really was the one that said sent me the treadmill i believe therefore yeah yes that 's all that was another story we missed tidy towns we 're talking about the list of groups tiny towns has no one you 've been actively involved in for a long time yeah well you know it 's another it 's another great organisation in the town we 've got we 've got fantastic organisations in this town yeah absolutely yeah unreal the amount of volunteer hours that are put in uh well you could you couldn 't pay the hours to put it by volunteering the i was saying was australia was built on the back of the sheep i believe that australia 's continues to live or grow upon the back of volunteers that 's right and and when you look around and and having been involved in this organization organizations for a long while there 's uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such as ses no and the volunteer fire brigades yep uh we 're unique in the world yeah for that sure yeah and i think and to think those guys come out free of charge middle of the night leave their families behind and go and jump in raging uh waters or or extreme bushfire risk yes it 's just remarkable isn 't it yes just remarkable and and with state emergency see i was a division controller which was a this half of the upper hunter part of the valley before we amalgamated with with maitland newcastle but uh we had two uh volunteer rescue teams that did motor accidents that that was a big job for volunteers i 'll tell you yeah big job yeah and they don 't allow people here don 't do it now but that was a big job another thing we fail to mention yourself and jan have both been inducted in the wombo hall of fame as well yeah last year i think wasn 't it yeah so i was an apology for that function i had other things on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of times down there oh yeah that 's right we 'll get caught up yeah you were checking on me weren 't you kept an eye on you yeah that 's right kept an eye you 've been kept an eye on me for four and a half years so i thought it was only appropriate i returned served well you know going back to 2012 we took the responsibility to put you on so i had to look after you 2016. 2016. yeah it 's been foreign 2016 when you came that 's right yeah yeah yeah so yeah yeah so in terms of your involvement has been more than significant it 's been unbelievable uh you 've got so much knowledge of of this town this region your contribution it 's just immeasurable what i 'd like to hear from you is uh what do you think the significant opportunities are for our town now region moving forward uh i i 'm a great believer in our town of course otherwise i wouldn 't have done all these things and i 've seen it progress from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and you know and everyone knows that we have a massive industry here with the mining industry and and i fully support that because i 've been sort of part of it since 1965. and uh also with that we 've still got uh the rural areas and and cattle and and some vegetables not many now but but we 're we 're sailing along okay uh zealand 's always been the town and we we 've we 've had that little uh saying about singleton 's a friendly town and and it is and and always will be and and that 's brought us up to the stage where i i i believe we 're doing very well and under the circumstances not just the mining but the associated people with mining and and the other commercial uh things that we have in town uh we did we don 't do too badly we could always improve and and i mean that 's that 's the aim of local government as far as i 'm concerned we could always improve and so on but the the the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one thing another over the years and we will pull out of this pandemic yeah we will pull out of this okay it 'll take a little while but we 'll pull out of this all right and we 'll keep going and and we 'll keep going because of the people in the town who are interested in their town i 'm talking about chamber of commerce uh the other yeah organizations agencies all of those other groups here work together and we 've got a good council we 've got a very good campaign we 've got a very good council with that yeah well yeah so put it out there yeah we 've got a good general manager who you 're making me blush john i was lucky enough to be able to tell him you 've got the job jason i can still recall that conversation next door yeah what did i say to you let 's get on with it let 's get on with it if we did that i think you said you got your job to do it i 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on with it well and we did it yeah yeah no that 's pretty good yeah now you mentioned something about and again because the list of credits are so long uh you 're also a life member of the association of mining related councils yes yes that was a um that was a big job that i i was elected to as a delegate and i took it on yeah we we did a lot of work there and and you and you and martin martin rush mutt the road were were the catalysts and the drivers of the crash and the resources for regents program yes yes we uh we we went out on a limb a little bit many years ago and uh we didn 't get the support of the mines related councils at the time so we went alone and and you know the rest of it 's history isn 't it yeah that 's well very much worth fighting yeah perhaps we shouldn 't talk about that too much but we were successful yeah sure yeah and and that 's been a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for governments to to give the council monies back from the mining industries and so on that 's where it came from and it took a lot a long time but we finally got there yeah we 've got to get that fight probably no more appropriate time than right now we 've got to keep the pressure on government uh that 's right return those money to terms that are affected by mining yeah that 's right well it comes from the royalties that are paid to the government by the mining industry and it 's uh it 's towns like ourselves and many others who have the mining industries in their towns and and we have to look after them from the point of view of council and services and so on and and the council 's councils that are involved with the mining in their areas we deserve that money back 100 it 's i know it 's coming from the mining industry but in a roundabout way it 's actually coming out of the government yeah yeah for sure and and and we would i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mining industry in hunter valley were um the biggest in the states yeah i think that over the years i think the average figure for us is around 350 million a year yes muster book would be probably not as much but something similar yes and you 've only got to look at the affectation it 's a pretty clear argument easy argument to run and run and win isn 't it yes yeah well it might be it 's not so easy to win because we haven 't quite won it yet but no we 're certainly running it yeah that 's right well martin rush and myself uh we we put some pressure in the right places back many years ago and yeah anyway that 's that part of it so it 's been quite a it 's been quite a time over the last 60 odd years isn 't it yes yeah it 's gone quickly you know gone quickly when i think back of all those things that have happened not just to me but the town and the council i can 't imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it all actually it 's been it 's been a very busy journey for yourself very busy journey you know and i did work i had a job i had a job as well yeah on top of all that yeah yeah i shake my head i 'm not sure how you found time in the day yeah well yeah there 's a lot on when when uh when you when you get busy and you get organised you can do it yeah you know that yeah organization you 're doing it being organized is an important part yeah you 're organized yeah yeah and who would have thought as you mentioned before uh we 're having meetings virtually counsellor now i bet you never thought that would happen back in 1965. municipal council time there were nine aldermen and uh we met i think we met once a month might have we might have had a finance meeting in in that time but met once a month and uh we used to get our business paper out uh it was produced on the gestapo on rice paper dude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign the checks didn 't you as part of the finance committee to pay to pay contractors and suppliers yeah we had uh i was deputy mayor for a term and the mayor and the deputy and the town clerk would get we go through the invoices before the meeting and sign all the checks wow oh my goodness my year looks pretty that delay yeah and and see the municipality was one and a half square miles yeah it was only about that big yeah so well when it came to amalgamation that was the right thing to do what i mean now five things yeah we have about 5 000 square kilometers yeah yeah and uh you know look at the progress that we 've made for the council for the service to the community and uh you know the facilities we 've got here now yeah really great yeah it was pretty ordinary those days i can tell you the uh the municipal council we only had two to administratively build uh vehicles the uh hill surveyor had a little austin uh a40 unit and the uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah the tail yeah when john flannery came along around about 1970 we we had to get him a car how to get him a car yeah play all the days so you 're around when john john came to our organisation back in did you say 1970 oh 70 71 somewhere about there he had more than 30 years didn 't he was a gm yeah well i was like maleficent itself yeah i was on the interview panel for john flannery my word yeah and there 's a story about that we went through all the process and got the short list and and we 're we 're having the final interviews and you know we i went through all this with you and uh we came down to two find finally got it down to two and one one of the gentlemen was about 48 50 or something or other john flannery was 27. he 's round around about anyway the older alderman and i say that wisely in the sense that they wanted to go for this chap about anyway the mature fella and mick dunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young fellas on the council we stuck out for john flannery and i 've never forgotten the uh the mayor alan bull at the time he said but if we put this young fellow on he 'd probably only stay five years and he 'll go and john john stayed 70 30 odd years and still lives in town and still lives in town still an active contributive community as well yeah yeah no good choice good choice i 've told you before aunty pick witness you know that putting the pressure on putting the pressure on yeah that 's right so john um it 's been a wonderful career a wonderful life well lived uh your contribution not only to our organisation singleton council but your contribution to the singleton community and all those wonderful community organizations that exist cannot be overstated i said beginning of the interview you are a living legend singleton is so fortunate to have you we are so fortunate to have you amongst us i get asked everywhere i go across the region across the state and when i sign from singleton council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just local your impacts across the state and across the country so i 'd love to be able to shake your hand but in the current crisis we 're not allowed to do that even though we did disinfect done all the all the appropriate things before we came in to do this have this conversation i want to say on behalf of everybody thank you very much your contribution has been amazing and we look forward to continuing the future yeah and and jason i 'd like to say over the many years i 've made many many friendships and the success of our council has been the uh the councillors over the many years and and that will continue and uh it 's all i 've already mentioned but my wife supported me all the way we did it together wonderful lady wonderful partnership yeah congratulations john thank you"

    "text": "[Music] well thank you very much for coming down to the presentation today my name 's Scott wit again and I normally give a joke at this particular stage that I 'm deaf in this left ear so if you want to help when we economy loud otherwise it loses impact feel free to ask any questions as we go along I tend to ramble a bit and talk about my passion which is Australia 's trick and invite questions but the talk we can go anywhere would go anywhere from publishing to genealogy to history to singleton specific to where everyone go alphabet train for an hour of of attraction so there we go the first question I always get out just why did you pick well we had fit and I 'll be another workout at a probably was about five or six my grandfather was a steam engine fireman and pieces acknowledge me and tell me all these wonderful story it 's about two tracks and of course you 've got me a train set and instantly I wouldn 't become train driver which I never acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose but ended up becoming an air traffic controller did that for 30-odd years lost my hearing in the left ear which meant for compare of planes so cute awkward so I thought myself what I 'm going to do and I wanted to travel I 've always enjoyed visiting little places around Australia and I had got a lot of trouble wouldn 't work so penny out without then living in Long Reach you know turn out there some people for a couple of years and things like that will be hard from Melbourne boy but got through it enjoyed it and so I thought up I 'll go in Australian this trip and I 'll have a beer in every railway hate self thinking there 's only 20 or 30 of them so worked too hard a mission I started researching and 100 200 300 eventually over 7 100 hotels across Australia had the word railway in their name someone not just specifically near the station but had to be called the railway had to there 's one exception to that will replace in Chiba dialed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little exception to that but there are a lot of other hotels like railway type thing myself like am a total steam engine hotel where a strict gives a single hotel there was terminus hotels all those sort of stuff that it was associated with those so anyway so I thought okay look all I want to do is go and visit these places and after visiting the first few I soon discovered there was a bit of a story in this i stabbed in wonder how many railway hotel ever it was and that 's what I 've got the list there abouts and I started then on a bit of a research project that I didn 't expect it to go anywhere I ended up with filing cabinet full of stuff which I was going to donate Australian National University and say there you go and and we 'll do what you like with it but after Britta kajal and some friends they said once you put this down I heard some of my stories and I said makes it look book you know I 'll never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I went off and put a manuscript together over a couple of years and the first book the Victorian book and living in Victoria at the time was easier mystical e to do that and start with the Queen 's Own bookish rotten and a favorite one of the threads but anyway and I put it all together and show to a cup of publishers and they said an acid too esoteric for us set it up babyletto I publish it myself did so for my little publishing company with the aim of doing as a roughly not-for-profit type scenario quickly discovered that visiting historical societies and museums a lot around the country doing it pretty tough they go from really wonderful resource facilities to one night in canada in wooden victoria where the Historical Society consisted of old built it was not he too i think and everything 's under his bed and you know if anything happened to Bill or his has been been or something then entire history that place has gone so so I figured I want to sort of shrine you know once Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help people publish specifically books on Australian history and and also help out histórico society before so that 's the sort of the book the interesting thing about all is that my enjoyment of social history was bought out through so whatever reason I went through school met hidden features Australia stirring it all about China most of the things but never really about Australia and left a few TV shows and reading a few books but this beat was because in my knowledge of the general history of Australia so as I started putting this together I 15 his stories here trying to get drilled down into why did a publican open up a railway hotel and how was it that the people how did they react when they got there Rob way finally there was that all the stories you know prior to the railway coming at town would have a railway Education Committee and they would work hard to get their railway because I meant so much to them and and eventually the railway would come and if your grand opening ceremony would do a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oysters bizarre for it like it and have a great ceremony and love their railway and then within 30 or 40 years had been a motor vehicle Smith at the railway becoming obsolete and everything shifted to the right so this site that sort of history of the railways odds in to explore so about a third of the book is all about the building and planning of the railways and it 's designed to to show people are not necessarily trying to enthusiasts how big how important that our network laws and I soon found that there was three roughly types of railway hotel where a town existed prior to the coming of the railway often a publican as I didn 't singleton would rename their house as the railway hotel in celebration or as a marketing tool and the situation that is a bit of a race which public funds going to get the rights to say railway first and that offer meant that that particular part was quite a distance from the railway station and so the poor I 'll traveller getting off the train at three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railway Hotel which he thought was just across the road and that being a mile so away from the station and on the way you open past six or seven really quite suitable hotels so they often didn 't last very long as the role a hater I often renamed a more appropriate mode should we ask that the second match work where railway hotels or built specifically for the railway the arrival of the railway is so if you 're in the town area then there 'll be a bit of a flurry of activity because people would see what it 's happened every other town across Australia that when the railway comes as influx of people and trying I sort of so there 's a bit of a flare enough to be two or three hotels built and sometimes if you 're Railway Hotel sometimes a railway view sometimes the railway something other hotel or just generic name hotels commercial Royals although studies also the lot of railway hotels are booked for the railway construction camps and in the very early days I 'm not talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly licensed hotels and all the way up through bounder Valley web tamworth brought up through New England up to the border there was lots and lots of railway construction camps that had attended railway hotel summer pre basic single storey buildings with corrugated iron roof and slab construction others were proper two stories around the hotels that belt off and dismantle take to the next camp put up again and they do that multiple times and sort by the public of the sick of it and sold it or sometimes publicans would take a punt and think a town would grow from that railway can because often though railways department would use the site 's the cans as the place to Google they need to meet at railway stations to achieve convenience for the farmers be able to get their sequence to the railway Victoria for instance that the ideal was to have farmers no more than seven miles from a railway station so that they could bring in a load of wall or high or wheat in the morning day and then return in the afternoon so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an amazing place I 've come across some incredibly interesting stories for the men generally the camp our wild waters place hey days were fighting days to get drunk one of the camps out of tamworth for the first two or three months of this existence it was no pup not even a slight drug team and every fortnight all the men would fall down to the local post office and send the money back to their families and then that very first week the pub was created there was no money at all went back went from you know hundreds of pounds being transferred back to zero overnight so there was pretty hard drinking and fighting and gambling and lawsuits and nastiness but it wasn 't all just men folk a lot of families went there and I uncovered a lovely story when I was researching I had a lot of these hotels all I had was a licensing record so I found one of the other side of gaara little place called bed moment and I had a licensing note that for about 18 months the Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by mr. the hotter and that 's all I had thought was going to be a pretty boring chapter I thought well I have to go up so I went faucet and around gaara and finally found a lady who said I should go and see old bill and I said okay who 's I 'll build a nice the postmaster and a car can sell cool and weird enemy team the bush Telegraph had done its thing and he knew that I was coming and what sort of stuff what time of it down he shook his hand said gay I 'm Scott witty Key said today on build hotter related to the owner of the railway i tell ye is my great great grandfather and he was up to a story and fill me in on a family history research that he 's being sister it done and sends out the veal i came to australia in 1865 i think it was tried his hand at the coal mine it was no good at that and joined the railways as a roller construction person also referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was 29 at times she was about 14 or 15 went on to have a whole bunch of kids about 10 for 20 years I lived under canvas bringing up his kids eventually at the end of 20 years i 'm assuming mrs. Hollis said enough now he like had enough so they bought a hundred acres of land and about 50 miles further north of the rival head and they settle down to to crop the land and run a few cows and we 've happily ever after he 'll I saw the railway was approaching and for short to sleep with him man white pass his front door so he built his own railway hotel and he ran it for 18 months or so until he died and then his missus holler took over and converted it to a what was called a colonial wine license which was a guest house like arrangement but not all the obligations of having a public and she ran until she passed away and then the building was used as a truck shed I 'll be also used to playing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said well bill can you show me where it is all excited because I didn 't know where it was that Daniel was on rayna Creek somewhere and holy and he showed me some prickles over there that 's where the railway had so long but I that he was over statement to the site of fun you wish procurement Saul the culverts and all the bricks they use from building the railway we 're all nearby and you can see the cycle of election mind the clay will actually move make the bricks and then moved on so that the film would move with the camp as it went along to the north so all those sort of things that I went from having one or two lines to a couple pages for what I think is really interesting sort of family history social history sort of stuff and people sort of your gas when I say that white was 14 or 15 for that was commonplace back then and concepts 12 years or PBS or yeah as it was that I also wanted to to sort of start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I do that I go into the third type of low-wage so and that was the railway hotel but we 're still in late half days of railway construction when in the early days in the late 1950s there we had any success the railways will often for mostly look quite private companies before they were taken over by the government basically and they had no no problem at all in Judaism through whole swag houses didn 't matter I 'm going to map in the Victorian book term just out of Melbourne request of Richmond towards riqueza from the CBD when they built the line in 1858 was some about 12 14 houses and the role I got most of them so including one of the Raleigh hotels it was only 8 months old so that is visible dosent matter there was some conversation but not yet not like it is it 's often though towards the 1880s 90s the cost of doing that became too great and also they 're looking at reducing the cost of building railways so things like if you had a major river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the city was town hoo we made the array a real expensive to get down in there they tended to build the railway remote in some circumstances the whole town picked up and move to the station other times the the they would have a satellite town the classic example at supper glory elder we 've got worried old town and the railways 45 kilometres away and they said like town was called Royal derail and there was a railway had to build out there and a couple of shops i think at the time couple houses that was baby not much there the hotel still stands hotel anymore but then that was the sort of situation and often if the railway was built in flat country was built around the edge of the town they end up with the station being quite a distance from the main street not a railway hotel several hotels will spring up near there often the very rough up cyntare frequented by an archetype like railway men and sheeraz and all sorts of travelers and perhaps that have been described as being not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of hotels so you 've got a whole bunch of five dozen and then through the book fairs are a bunch of examples really intriguing examples why did people build hotels in places where there was no railway and four locations across New South Wales have never ever ever had a railway they built railway hotel and the best example that is high school alumni which is down the around Eden on the south coast and second park stood up in Parliament said I 'm going to build a railway down through here and one enterprising public and believed him and he built the hotel and 50-odd years it was called the railway junction hotel because the branch was supposed to happen there and eventually they gave up and change your name to the wall amla hotel and it 's still there and I was down there about 12 months ago cajoling the publicans have changed it back to the railway Junction hotel but old times sake but you wouldn 't be an answer so that they had in a couple of times braidwood their Canberra was another example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government filed is an engine still going to build a railway it sounded absolutely nuts from which a parting celebration people barfing in champagne or Lisa and of course the government renege and end up with Railway Hotel in a railway didn 't last very long pelicans also took a punt on where the station would be and if the survey got changed whatever they 'd end up with the hotel quite a distance away which may be a bit awkward some change the name of hotel shortly thereafter tried a lot closed but the whole idea of hugs back then it 's not what we think of them now to get a publicans license back to say the 1880s you had to be able to provide meals and accommodation traveling public for man and beast so that it involved having stables and maybe a groom blacksmith something like that the hotel look after the horses as long as it with a be domestic staff as well there 's a cooking and housekeeping and the bars so although some of the hotels are quite modest sum was like being end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had done had to be pretty self-sufficient often that cooks superior cow sort of stuff big veggie patch fruit porches bullet sort of stuff at the back and the beat land they had came here for traveling entertainment like circus and animal my nitrous that blogger in New South Wales down again south I had a traveling Wild West Show came in the 1880s and they had a real Indian a real cowboy and a real Negro and it was quite the entertainment they had a traveling animal menagerie headlines and drivers and things like that and talking you know the 1880s been people you never seen a new picture of us about animal there was something coming in a book maybe but not a another rule what we do now and the local paper said yes in the vines are remarkable we saw something like that so very very magnificent person sort of stuff so it 's quite taking everybody by storm so the hotel tended to be one of the first commercial buildings built so end up with businesses by banks service like churches running their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that entertain coming down use the hotel for addicts visiting doctors traveling salesman summer doctors were real some charlatans back in the days when you could not be totally truthful when you 're appetizing used to say they could cure cancer have magic tools so long there was one one fi 'ty or the actually going through he was a son of a faithful and he must have ripped off the peak of the Honda hundreds of pounds because here was amazing what you could do and people just keep coming back it 's remarkable but quick asleep get sucked into that sort of stuff as well that 's good it 's all part of life and the travelin showman they 'll be fantastic come and do their shows and if one particular one up at a bar in northern New South Wales we 're a traveling snake charmer want to come and do a show at the railway hotel and he arrived to find another show in doing a show at the front of the hotel off I can 't can 't cut his lunch I will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and finish course he pushed in cases ones in the court and goes you a couple of years comes out sees keep running down the street guys thanks guys stop kidding me yeah outhouse backyard somewhere this is about to open the door if you get out is like me you scream that well the snakes have got out we 've opened up and he kept running back at aamir miles an hour and go all of a sudden you know picks up which takes you guys I he doesn 't show but I 've got a few stories about snakes and it because there 's nothing like a good snake story like probably now people are honest the only good snakes a dead snake that 's what people think and the stories of snakes coming into pubs a favorite snake story is to the adabelle Reynold shearing team would come into town after they finished up and had plenty of money to spend and they 've got pretty drunk and they all just had an earthen floor and then slit a big old brown snake zero reach down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set since look fellas my pets this company says of course they just probably on the wrist and in those days the treatment what you had to first cycle the boys now can you go to something sharp and tuck away as much as a flesh you could and then you can check them on you into it I don 't know why they did that as they did and then when the patient started get a bit drowsy the effects of the poison you would administer copious amounts of brandy and I did that the kids as well so I reckon I killed the kids with brandy properly or the snakebite anyway say they put this off out of the bed he wakes up the next morning bright as a button say fellas auto pump into last night you know no recollection at all so yeah treating with ammonia like there was a buggy but bitten on the tongue right now but on a how that happens that he did and injecting your mind you 're into his tag market bill up cut hard what they did that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter side of life and had a larrikin ism and one of the story of pub life to sort of be explored so that it wasn 't all gloom and doom because just as there is now there was every every type of crime if you think you have happened back then politicians are probably more corrupt back then and what they are now though that 's pretty arguable very fond of debating the root of a railway and then go out and grant to each other land and back then to actually take ownership land we had to do it 's improve it by putting a fence around it couple of cows on which they did and then salt back to the government and I thought get away with that until I found out in Victoria recently a politician did a shame he actually bought land just before that announcer building the freeway through it and he made money out of that as well so it 's amazing that if you live long enough it 's Jesus big circle so you clean it all before and we keep thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably died probably enough history to workout stuff in the air but strange so so did Aladdin and crimes you know were there I want to explore concepts what could all days what with it would always and really unless you had money in terms of power preferably all three what was to be hard for most people you know used to beat that people traveled everyone travels by train that train travels expensive the when the first railway was built between Melbourne and vinegar Victoria to go about 100 kilometres cost the equivalent in today 's money about seventy five dollars so everyone like today for question 75 bucks to go to make one on the train you would say that 's probably a bit expensive of my drive and today 's train fierce about four or five dollars the same distance so that 's a fair bit of money back then likewise you know only really the well-to-do could afford a horse to ride most people walked push ball barracks and takes a long time that 's why you need a network of pubs did you stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of stance but the other side to that was getting too before about the pub thing different to livonia the public is often build a halt makes their hotel special in smaller communities and that was that would predate a long time the schaibles the things like that now local councils will run their business before that enough money to actually go to the room and hall and dancing this very far from the first time interestingly the public and had commissioned two stages or at musical on his premises used to my son 22 you go at dancing nightclubs in Melbourne all night a nice to get out that 's not very good thing dude young you know if I start this project and realize that dancing you just to go till dawn these these functions anyway so nothing from the child it 's probably only the like just threw the book lots of examples crimes of passion and things like that Fanny days that our our approach to two people and relationships back then for many years in New South Wales if a couple presented at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of forgery marriage certificate went down well that sort of stuff in the old days and likewise i was looking at all of the licensees of hotels customs themselves and it appeared to me especially nailing a nineties anybody you get a public service provider and on several occasions will come across examples with single women try to apply for a license in tolls go away even though the bar was being run perfectly by my farm aid 's just know yeah a woman was woman with second city not capable running the business at the hotel and the situation was the only way a woman could get the license was if she was becoming widow and the license was passed her but only if she didn 't have a son who was 80 aged 21 as a big expectation was the son would take the license which I found really bizarre because through the book I 've got all these examples of women running purpose of 40 sometimes 50 years and doing a fine job being quite remarkable members of the community down at tamura the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years she she was passionate about rugby league she sponsored the local competition they still playing for the Corbett come to this day and that was real hundred years ago and likewise you know that publican to the day who ran respectable hotels right up there with station masters of school principals lots of stuff so I was quite a quite a reasonable profession but like everything else there were some broth people that were used to run pretty ordinary hotel as well and that 's the same with business it wasn 't until about nineteen thirties significant Orion book that the first real challenge to being a single woman taking the license was taken and that was where the public and down with a baseball bannockburn had he was free old and creepy Paulie anyone who transferred license to his daughter who had worked in the pub teachers about four and she was about twenty two or three something like that and the licensing people said no go away silly Billy can 't can 't do that she talked to the Supreme Court and his on said the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 60 70 s actually attitudes have changed enough and I yeah I got hard to get my head around that sort of attitude now but when I was really putting them all together i uncovered an ad in during the First World War and basically said that now that all the manufactured got have to fight them do women failure to stand up and take the load now if you take these pills they 'll make you strong heart stronger mind strongly and they will help you deal with the handicap of being a woman that 's all very well say okay you know we 're going to rely on you during the war when there 's no blokes around but outside those times you know and I just couldn 't believe it as that 's sort of thing and even the treatment of indigenous people early days it was a few it someplace I learn about the human Hubble expedition about characters of now I just expected it to all be the same sort of people but Jim was quite consolatory actually spoke gum is over speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas father was the offices but I really want to do a shoot people and there was a yeah at cry obeying Victoria when they finally got down there there was an incident where he was off skirting around the bay got back to see hubble surrounded by a whole bunch of pre angry conditions men Spears drawn and he 's with it this talk sort of and it could have been a massacre cry oh that would be talking about these days but from those attitudes of you know well-meaning people down in Gippsland in Victoria where rains for nine months the year it would be contacted when you your firm women and indigenous women and European women would ask the ladies to take off their possum skins forget though I 'm wearing for 40,000 years would take them off and use this blanket instead rain overnight and mum and the kids would die in the moment because the blank gets wet and cop it 's possible skins are perfectly dry keep you beautiful water the perfect perky things so this ignorance and bias and I think I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pubs and several little towns of that I know that had about 500 people then up with 15 to 20 pubs in that town which is what comes so the government is a cup of schemes one was a buyback of licenses of it like the back of guns a few years ago when I pay compensation and went through a process of office called local options also the people of the electric ray biturbo on basically and during that period so if you want to open up a brand new pub you actually have to go to the local options bowl and get the support of the community as well as the licensing authority I need some some remarkable areas the community voted for notebooks and they went to totally dry prohibitionist amoxicillin Victoria sharp of ours was one of those areas were up to close down basically overnight and conversation was paid there 's no pubs and that still exists will be here so it 's it 's interesting how their supplies pubs became a little bit less lucrative when things like Motor Vehicles I 'm gonna fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've stalking or a bad investment so much so that the big breweries in Sydney to think oh and be property developers like before runner to okay okay the family was really active area is found in new south wales buying that putz all dosing them and putting up into new ones often in the art deco stop making get money out of mental things like a second world war came along like that the social consequences do in the very first license was issued in 1794 pub of the paramount from that point on we have a very high highly regulated government control the regulator Queen employers and he should serve lots of stuff no alcohol traditionally solutions but the one curious thing is that a couple Republican decide if the child was suitable to take three so stories kids 10-11 coming into apartment being supplied alcohol and that was the time that was how it was back then and it wasn 't until the early nineteen hundreds of actually had proper age based the I want to explore things like six o 'clock closing and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement that worked really really hard behind the scenes the last drawer for the government of New South Wales was during the First World War whole bunch of army recruits at Liverpool didn 't like they can 't very much went on a rampage march to deliver cool drink down drive up at ten o 'clock in the morning combi had a cup of trains drove through the Central Station held up central stations without gunfire one sort of stopped one blood was killed later referred to as one of the most infamous chapters in Australia 's military history and that was the end of free trading of alcohol the government knee-jerk reaction saw that and said I 'll going to close the pubs a six o 'clock no before saw or had the time to think about the social implication of that and the spike in domestic violence alcohol a domestic clients which was always unrecorded unless the poor woman or children were killed and then there 's probably hush up but that was a very unintended consequence here we are 150 years later and obviously beard run around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing things like that on a knee-jerk reaction so there 's another one of those big circles of history so all those sort of things come into play the fun and games the way people conducted themselves all that sort of stuff and the public houses were okay mostly but some pretty bad ones are in the traps and the moral isolated areas tend to be pretty ordinary to deal with a public roster bonus but he 'll I finish on my favorite story and that 's the poor traveler running up to the railway station it 's under one of these branch lines for the train man every week was so and he just sees his train just doing the dishes and yours out before hey when 's the next train is set on Tuesday Wednesday today is Tuesday what can I do where can I stay as well is to pubs in town there 's the railway and the Royal it 's come on man which one 's a better one which would you stay active and the LA doesn 't really bad I a face the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said well it doesn 't matter because it 's right off in the morning you 'd be lying in bed awake wishing in spite of the other and that 's SLA we 're back there as really interesting I family old whole process is so enjoyable and and meeting people traveling the country and seeing that the work that a lot of historical societies do and generosity people 's time to actually maintain their passions to like my patient history it 's really important in this era when there 's government cutbacks the things like the National Library of Australia which is vital that we maintain that little trailers are wonderful and I 'm sure many books in the future we can directly from research control interestingly and when I was doing my research what I like to try and do was actually trying to do a bit of a picture first and in order to prove pretty public works see how our closest I 've got to what 's been written before and there 's one example again in Victoria where one particular hotel was relocated to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local paper wrote it up as being a brand new hotel track and that was what was written in the in the local history papers of Jong Toria by very eminent historian based on a newspaper ad free tribe to iceberg going through a couple more suspect what you didn 't get with some attraction from three days later said sorry it wasn 't we made a mistake so you can 't stop at one if you don 't already searched you 've gotta force yourself to push at next couple of days gian because the Satan and a 0 a place with internet people treatment what 's on that this gospel I 've got numerous examples of photos from everybody from the National Library down there miss caption wrong town on the pub and that 's the iceberg and because written on the back of the original card might be the incorrect information that 's how its presented so it is like she can do about it musical contrary evidence out there saying that here 's a building plan that 's that one has to be that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new research especially internet-based researchers but certainly I think of a lot of interesting concepts there 's being out of compare things that 's my afternoon talk I 've an invoice now i 'll be talking bed pups let 's all repeat [Music]"

wealth of this land and its people by its weathered mountains fertile valleys and vast plains by rich its riches of agriculture and mining bush and grazing land by its contrasts of landscape and

open-mindedness and respect for each other and a passionate and fervent commitment to justice for all continue to bless us that we might be a blessing to others we ask this through jesus christ the lord amen thank you everybody for coming along today and those of you who unfortunately can 't join us here in the hall today because of the covert restrictions i hope that the uh the webcast is uh filling that void for you guys today there are a couple of highlights firstly we 'll have the citizenship ceremony where we have six people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moniker of saying they are australian when i used to play footy locally if there 's somebody ringing come in and somebody said oh what do you play with them for i said as soon as they pull on that red jumper they 're they 're a singletonian and i 'm pleased to hear that the um people are bringing pulling on that green and gold jumper today and i thank them very much for allowing us to be part of this special day for them then we have the citizen of the year award um i spoke last night about the fact that we were awarding somebody um and what i meant by that is most of the time if you you 're around and you you suffer social media like i do and people are always complaining and having things and it 's always somebody should do something about that and the people who are nominated today they 're the somebodies they said no i 'm that somebody i 'm going to do something about that they 've put themselves forward they 've contributed and made a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special the fact that they are nominated the fact that they 're recognized by the people in their community speaks volumes for what they 've done and if you know they get announced today as things as the citizen of the year that 's that 's a bonus but i just want to express my deep thanks for all you guys do for our community and i 'm sure the rest of the people in the hall would want to do the same as well after we 've finished today [Music] we 're lucky enough that even with covert restrictions the lioness ladies can supply us with cup of tea and lemmingtons out in the foyer so please join us and need to race race away although the council has organised that uh the gym and swim will be open free of charge for everybody today so if you brought your togs along wander over there since you 're finished just on a personal note australia day means a lot to me i don 't know if it 's just uh the date 's probably not important i think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think or reflect about how lucky we are to live where we are and within the community we are the fact that um is australia perfect no it 's pretty close but there 's there 's always something to do there 's always ways we can improve and i think if anybody who watched the national ceremony last night could not be anything but moved by the the people who won it now now seniors our australian of the year was grace tame i hadn 't heard of grace tame until yesterday but her her plea and the work she 's done um supporting the people who under underwent childhood uh abuse is just extraordinary and dr miriam roose and gawara balman who 's the senior citizen australian of the year with her work with reconciliation and and making uh the aboriginal culture available to non uh the non-indigenous part of the community is really good and rosemary carraway who 's there about our migrants helping them and developing it so you know today is about reflecting working out how we can our community can be better and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today and um on that i 'd also really like to thank our special guest speaker mr charles croucher um i think it 's very important for us to recognize that um people from singleton have been able to leave this community and go and make their way in the world and can make contributions charles has been one of those i chased his mother about it trying to get him along here a couple of years ago and then for some strange reason he he decided that you know perhaps uh a us placement with the channel nine network was probably a little bit more important than us go figure but the fact that he 's come here tonight today and is going to give us a bit of a perspective on what it 's like to be an australian in the world and perhaps what it 's like to be a singletonian in the world i very much appreciate his presence and look forward to what he has to say he did mention a little speech last night that um he had been runner-up in the singleton sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there um i did tell him that the last person i handed to singleton sports star of the year award to was toby price um and um tabby received an oam overnight so sorry sorry to downplay you charles but we 're really looking forward to what you have to say thank you very much for coming along thank you danny to the mayor councillors the citizen of the year nominees and mostly importantly to our newest australians happy australia day i 'm charles croucher danny gave me a wonderful introduction there and i thank you for it uh most the time though around singleton i 'm known as library lady lee 's eldest son and that 's a title i 'll wear i begin by acknowledging uncle warren and the wanaroo people the elders past present and emerging they are part of a culture and a heritage as old and as rich as forever a culture that is visible in the faces of the descendants here today invisible on the rock walls of milbredale it 's not too far from where we stand right now and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very anglicized name but an ancient drawing abuami stands there his long arms outstretched over the lands of the wanora people it is the only rock shelter of its kind in australia and therefore the only rock shelter of its kind in the world and today it is still standing there not far from where we are the arms outstretched over all the lands and over us here right now it is an ancient indication for all those that come that this area is welcoming these days the physical welcome to singleton 's a little different you can drive past buruna and past the paddocks with the cows that are munching on grass that is far greener these days than it 's been for decades or through the forest of the party past the coal mines that have brought so much wealth to our region and so much wealth to our country or over reddenbury bridge and the hunter river through singleton heights and the expanding community where friends and families have made families and friends and made their home and i promise you as someone who spent a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few years it will always feel like home it became home to a generation of migrants that explored this region in the 1800s moore came to what was the end of the northern line farming families at patrick 's plains or jerry 's planes or belford they carried the nation through federation our first prime minister was the member for this area he carried our nation through its early years time and time again the nation has turned to the infantry that called singleton home when tyranny and hate threatened freedom throughout the world and as the world went back after war it was this region that welcomed european migrants i 'm sure there are many different ways in many different european languages to say the word greeter with a thick accent but these people arrived back saw from the snowy mountains came hand stressed from hours in the fields and the farms and they helped carry the burden of reconstruction while finding any way to make a buck anyway to make life better for the next generation than their own you 'll notice a theme here singleton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not just time and time again that the nation turns to this region but it 's this region is one of opportunity opportunity generations have had to work for the settlers that struggled against the elements as many sought gold in the west or in victoria it was the coal here that would carry us through and out of recession and into prosperity 150 years later edmund barton that first prime minister struggled through the infancy of our nation before taking a new challenge and serving as our first justice of the high court my grandmother lived on a street bearing his name in this town not too far from here generations of infantry have showed what robert menzies described as the unconquerable spirit of man and the freedoms that we 've treasured and people around the world have treasured remain with us today i got to play with the children of those immigrants the post-war migrants sometimes their grandchildren that had fled such hardships and struggled through a new climate a new country and for so many a new language and most of all the guanorua people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and their land as a cornerstone of our community today this is a community it 's one you 'll grow to love if you 're the new australians and one you already love if you 've been here a while it 's a community where fire crews just 12 months ago went back to the flames time and time and time again for five months on end it 's where our wines and our people have delighted others around the world where young sports stars can thrive and lose awards admittedly where musicians can be part of the oldest continuing band in australia 's history where our brightest minds are nurtured where a generation of friends can have a generation of children that become a generation of friends themselves and wear a hairdresser in her 40s can read a lot go back to school retrain and foster a whole new generation 's love of reading and education on this issue of community while the pandemic has taught us that zoom calls can get us fewer through a few things 2010 has court taught us that the online community is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you are they have dreams they have fears they have hopes and in this era of filters and facebook and hashtag and haters instead of collecting followers as so many of us try to do it 's time to be a leader and if you 're looking for leaders there are outstanding nominees in front of us today as the best example we can find finally to our newest australians about to take that pledge while the date of australia day may change in the future to some day more inclusive less painful for so many january 26 will always be your day the day you became an australian with bwami still up in his cave arms outstretched it 's the day you 'll join this community and a day that is certainly worth celebrating thank you [Applause] thank you very much charles i 'm pleased you made it today that was fantastic i 'd like to ask the mayor that you should present charles as a gift as on behalf of the singleton council representing you as our community nothing like a change of script is he charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coming back to singleton it 's great to see your face other than on television see you in person and i know our communities enjoyed hearing from you thank you thank you um i did uh vary from script there a little bit because i now actually need the mayor to come forward and conduct the citizenship ceremony but i thought it was more appropriate that she get presented the gift as well thank you dan um i just wrote a note for myself while you were doing your presentation uh charles and that was never ever ever invite an internationally renowned communications and media expert to speak on the same stage as yourself because it 's just mission impossible so please please everybody be gentle with the rest of us because

little bit uh worried about speaking in front of you guys so he 's allowed a silly old bald fellow to do it on his behalf good morning i would like to introduce myself i 'm a hometown singleton boy and i 've been involved in swing since a young age over my swimming career i have achieved 65 state and 30 australian titles in both age and open events pretty cool isn 't he at the age of 14 i was selected into my first australian open team where i traveled to ecuador being the youngest swimmer in the competition i was super proud to make the finals in 2019 i was again selected for my second open australian team and i achieved two bronze medals in front of my home country i 've competed at numerous events and have won many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion the title of superfish by the singleton argus and last year becoming single the young achiever of the year i 've been asked many times what the highlight has in my sorry what my highlight has been and i would like to say being a role model to young people being awarded this has given me pride and that my dedication and determination has been recognised having a mild disability i 've had to overcome my disability and have shown that everyone can achieve their goals with hard work i 'd like to take this opportunity to thank the australia day committee for their recognition of my achievement by awarding me this honour happy australia day um i 'd like now to invite somebody at this stage who can more than capably speak for themselves i 'd like to invite gary holland our 2020 citizen of the year [Applause] oh there

@ @ @ @ @ at home i hope you your your viewing is satisfactory um i want to congratulate the new citizens and i was very pleased to see the ladies because that might mean they will bring some cooking into our culture hope so and whether you can cook he makes glorious fried rice so something may come out of this but thank you for becoming australians and i hope that you i don 't know how long each of you have been here but i hope you will assimilate into our community because we do want you to because as more and more time passes we become a bigger family when i was young and in singleton there wasn 't virtually nobody but anglos or descendants of anglos our first taste of asian culture was when the original chinese restaurant opened we didn 't have any prior to that and we were quite ignorant and we didn 't particularly want to be disturbed by other nationalities but time has changed that and we are all mixing in together and that 's that 's the important thing if you go to another country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and they will welcome you and that 's what we want to do in australia we want people to come and assimilate and enjoy being australian it 's extremely important to us so congratulations i did prepare something to say so i better get to it otherwise i 'll be here tomorrow and you don 't want that um i want to say congratulations to the nominees you 're feeling wonderful sitting there and look what i got look what i got um i know what it feels like i can remember last year i think we need to improve on this i don 't think we are getting enough people nominated because we are a great great town with a lot of people doing great things so we need to have more nominations just so we can recognize the people one person has to has to wear wear the badge but that doesn 't mean much because everybody does a fabulous job in their area and that 's important because they understand where they are and what they 're doing this gentleman with legacy terrific dolly 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandson um and i really didn 't know anything about it um music i love music but i 'm totally tone deaf if if you 're going to be somewhere in there singing don 't sit near me all forewarned his forearms cancer council great stuff forward witch and and broken and the vineyards and that 's all terrific so everybody is doing a diverse job and that 's what we need that 's what we need in australia if i miss somebody what does he do simon sorry oh oh yes of course yeah well we have to have the fire brigade but god did we what it was unbelievable what we what the country has been through unbelievable and and these people who work with the fire brigade and the ses and all those things we see them on telly or somewhere doing their bit but we don 't see all the stuff that 's done in the background because if the stuff in the background 's not done they can 't come fight the fire so it 's all greatly appreciated and and so i say thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a singletonian i go back to to the convict my convict got sent here um from england for stealing it wasn 't loaf of bread it was jewelry and money so he was a thief and he got sent here um he worked for our first man monroe on his vineyard um ten years later he got this ticket to freedom and at that age ten years later from arriving here he was 25. so when he was sent as a convict he was a 15 year old kid amazing but he also got his ticket to marry on paper it said his bride was 16 but in actual fact she was 13 because people didn 't want their daughters the thing was to get rid of them they didn 't work productive with anything anyhow they were married in the church that was where the church is behind the imperial and it flowed on generation after that generation none of them got any richer they all stayed poor and the poor has continued down the line i can tell you but nevertheless um the year has passed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more correct last year i received this honor and things got off to a flying start we had our bicentenary celebrations lined up ready for a great time through the year a great time of fun and fellowship but then the covet virus anvil fell and crushed the lot it was all gone and had to be the whole world changed before our eyes and i don 't know if it will ever be the same again probably it shouldn 't be i don 't think our country will ever be the same again and i hope not i hope we can come back to being more self-sufficient and not relying on other countries for everything um in comparison to so many places we have been more than very fortunate for a long time i think i thought covert it was just other places we didn 't really have much to worry about because i hadn 't heard of a case in the hunter valley i didn 't know anyone who had coven so it was hard to make it real but real we had to make it and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today and i find that very difficult because i 'm very cuddled colorable that no i 'd like to be cuddled that 'll do so we might get back to that one day um but due to these dramatic effects our charity organizations are stretched past their limits they are more folk needing help than there is that can be helped to the extent needed now you may say well i 'm okay mate that 's all that matters but i tell you that is not the attitude of aussies so you can forget that one aussies would say i 'm okay mate and then ask how are you all the charity organizations in our shire need help and can you help i think you can is there are many different ways to do so the very wrong way is to land them with your junk the charities are not a free pass to the garbage tip and getting rid of the junk that that people dump on them costs a lot of money that could be used in many other areas you may choose to give support with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only real commodity that each of us has and if we all just give a little if we donate a little of our town time then we are supporting our country our community our town and our aussie mates then and only then we will will be come through this together our council works very hard to try in trying to assure that all the requirements and needs of our diverse community are met now i 'll give you a good example of this in nolan park there is a toilet block and it has two doors on one door there is a sign that reads unisex toilet and then has a very large lh the door next to it says unisex toilet and has a very large r h so i 'll leave that with you i wish to again thank the australia day committee for the honor of being the citizen for 2020 i am the 42nd person to receive this honor and for that i say thank you very much and thank you thanks gary and um i was most surprised nearly shocked when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said i was most surprised in shock when you said you liked colors i would never have guessed um and i think today 's out uniform slightly out does last year 's oh yeah you made an impact as well so um gary will come back later on and help present the the award to the our citizen of the year we don 't have any nominations for the young achiever for this year as gary has mentioned that is something we need to work with our community on because we do know like darcy there are there are lots and loads of young people in our community who are doing wonderful things and they 're achieving things way beyond expectations and way beyond belief so as a community on behalf of the committee on behalf of the council i encourage people to reach out identify those people make sure their names are put forward so we can recognize their achievements in next year 's ceremony we do have five nominees for this year 's citizen of the awards i 'm going to read out their profiles when i do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mayor then go back to your seat until you conclude reading their profiles of each of the individual nominees and then we will have mr holland make the announcement of this year 's citizen of the

's just the way he lives a bit like which is the best way to light I think in Mike Bellamy was one of my very best friends which was him and um and him he was in fact my own investor bed now barely had this incredible quality which was I don 't know how you would define it but if i had to put into words it would be stupidity but no one I know has quite at the same extent that they only had how about if I told you the story about bail me in the end no no no I don 't think only told you the story about a medium well bail me was in a terrible terrible position he was in Bahrain which is a pretty bloody place to be and there was his aunt with only one eye and only one leg which is about two miles away from belly who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rikers pretty bloody medicine physician and this bloody hint one I one leg its advancing towards squatter or Bellamy I 'd like to call them different names at a rate about a mile every century really speeding up I keep the animals on drugs yes or heat yes as you 've made Seth and Bill me with his extraordinary calm took it very smoothly and do not he did nothing he immediately did nothing and this stupid the end stopped in its tracks didn 't move an inch or about three and a half years but Bellamy was still very much aware of the problem of the end of all of one leg and all of a my advancing towards sorry you took up a strategic position 5,000 men on one side 7,000 men on the other side all equipped with various kinds of guns and so yes he did yes but what was odd yes go on come on I will was the end understood that the end realized he was up against soliders as good as heroes they had an understanding between people they knew they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous display of courage put up his hands and Turing and the ant crept into the whole of five years laters later yes five years laters crept into the hole and felony was gone now this is the extraordinary thing about Bill me he was never there when he was wanted now Melanie had told me later the reason he always will because it had to go I think that I think that sums up the only for me it 's it 's a sort of a very simple the air these days is writing his memoirs you know sunday telegraph repeal bill neva fuses he refuses to comment on the whole situation yes yes yes just white no just what I think I think that sums up belly for me well you well she retains everything yes all right what I think is a tragedy about Bella is that she goes these days one of these days he 's going to live for with the most enormous well this is the tragedy of a felony and one is attempted to hush it up one is attempted to silence the sound and dull the noise"

families Support Center and we 're going to talk about an initiative that were very very proud of as an organization to be rolling out in partnership this wonderful community organization so good morning Lindsay yeah our pleasure I should say our absolute pleasure at it certainly unfortunately do have to do it but we 're really excited as an organization to be leading leading from the front in terms of acknowledging a very very real issue you know community yeah look it 's really exciting for us in the industry to see a local government come on the warden and it 's really quite ground groundbreaking in the sense that it 's often private business that take on providing that their employees with paid leaves especially the domestic violence people so really many experienced physical from a current or former partner since the age of 15 and one in four experienced physical or sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's terrifying and as fans what that stat is there 's another statute that would live more mi d2 d2 team tell me is that domestic violence is the number one killer of women under 45 an F country is that real yeah yeah and which the which for us you know we 're an organization family is terrifying for us to know that that the women and families that were working with is all around at such great risk of this Seraph life and may I 'm a dad a bit of a young lady and those assistants are alive in contemporary Australian modern science yeah it 's terrible but we must move on from the doom and gloom let 's talk about the really positive stuff we 're gonna do together as a partnership and well I 'm really proud not only that we 're actually tackling this issue as an organization but really proud we 're doing that that with a great label organization like yourselves it 's a good good demonstration 19 of us partnering yeah like at Union yeah definitely and where we 've started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter which is a program funded through women in South Wales which is really targeted on providing domestic violence awareness through the mining industry and so we 're really excited to be able to work in partnership with with the local council in in spreading that message your employees who are members now yeah you know if someone can support their families so how does the program actually look what what do we actually want me I 'll be doing over the next few weeks yes so we start off with some working with your people leaders so working what we really want to do is make sure that when we train your employees that the people leading them have the skills and support to be able to answer any questions that come up and you know people in with the right services should there be any concerns around violence in their home so we 'll start off with many people leaders so really looking at how domestic violence happens what are the motivators for your own domestic violence we know that it 's not anger issues we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that so we know that [Music] we 'll drive up towards that camera couldn 't written power and control within violent relationship so we we like to work with people leaders first to really get them comfortable in in understanding what semester financing and where to go in for support should any of their very employee you guys to be spending a favorite of Tommy our organization have the next few weeks and in the future because it 's not gonna be something ended two weeks and I 'm putting the shelf that 's right something don 't live and breathe yeah that 's right and it 's it 's such a huge part of everyone 's will but it 's so free them there 's so much shame associated with which which prevents people from and telling people so to have a full organization be trained and equipped with the skills to manage a situation with violence is you know it really opens up just so much of your face yeah you know in their workplace to be able to say look this is happening for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're taking a steam we 're saying is your organization perspective mmm I suppose prepare for one of those specific domestic violence isn 't a guy it 's not and we 're not gonna allow happen mm I gotta supportive or a benefactor boy that 's right and ultimately what we want is these people to understand how do I stop there with a very small you know relatively small group of people in the whole community we 're not out there all the time we 're not with your friends and your family so we need each individual person to really look at how they magnified that impact that 's right and mana for the supporter should say that 's right and within their world happen what can they do to help stop some events from occurring it 's really truly by looking at it you 're now organization over fifty percent of our staff a female yeah fifty percent about a senior leadership team will clean up 50 percent of our elected council female never female men so as an organization I reckon we really fly the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good example of how we can continue to support the women in our lives and tackled one of Australia 's hidden issues really bringing it to the forefront and they 're dressing it head-on which is you know really excited yeah well Lindsay thanks very much for your time I really look forward to us working together in the future not just the next few weeks and together we can tackle this issue definitely thanks very much thank you all"

recover from the summer bushfires we 'll also inform you about a delivery of amindaroo pod near tanto angelo and provide some important contact details to help you or someone you know who may be struggling with their mental health and their well-being so plenty to get through on today 's episode of the road to recovery joining us today on the road to recovery is pauline cook manager of the monero family support service and pauline thank you for your time today thank you nathan pauline could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great work that monero family support service is doing in the bushfire recovery space i guess right from the beginning of the fires monero family support has considered the recovery of our of our community to be core business we have been around for over 40 years in the monero and we work with children youth and families to to support them to deal with whatever challenges they are experiencing so obviously in 2020 the widespread impact of the fires of drought and of dealing with covert has meant that many many people if not all in our community have have had challenges of one kind or another to face so monero family support is able to really work flexibly and respond to whatever those needs are and and to ensure that all of the children and young people in our community are given every possible um chance to to develop healthily and to thrive and and to support the parents to do that yeah right from the beginning we 've we 've had a kind of a suite of different ways in which we 've been prepared to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received some some specific funding from resilience new south wales to deliver the recovery support service in for snowy monero and and that is a a personalized holistic case management service that 's able to to walk alongside uh individuals and families who have been affected by fire to to meet any any of their needs that they have whether that be applying for grants or some mental health support um a rebuilding property or infrastructure that may have been damaged and and really just just um providing that wrap around support for as long as they need and pauline this week we 've seen some art therapy workshops start around in schools throughout the snowy monero could you tell us about these workshops and what the manera family support service is hoping to achieve with them that 's right we have seen that for many children they struggle to find ways to articulate the feelings that they have in relation to their experience of the bushfires and we also believe that pretty much all children no matter where they live in snowy monero had an experience of the bushfires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do was to provide a safe and and carefully designed space for children to express their emotions relating to the fires um and so we we have designed a a workshop which we 're rolling out in all snowy monero schools particularly primary schools called rising from the ashes and this is a workshop using art therapy so basically children are encouraged to explore different ways to express and share their own stories their their own narratives their own experiences of of the the fires of 1920s through arts and also using other a couple of other tools like music and sound and and movement and really that expression then hopefully provides a space for the children to process and heal those emotions and and we think that now 's a good time to be delivering that workshop in the schools because we know and we are aware that the next bushfire season is ahead of us and that it 's really important to arm our children with some tools to manage their emotions around the previous their previous experience so that they 're better equipped in the future so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really well with kids to get yeah to express their express their emotions are the workshops pauline been rolled out right throughout the region yeah that 's right we have offered them to all of the snowy monero schools and we 're particularly keen and have offered them to the small schools and our remote schools so right across the region from durango to delegate to adam minnibie um we 've we 've we 're delivering that as widely as we possibly can it 's also part of a package of recovery workshops that we we have offered to the schools um there 's this rising from the ashes and the art workshop is is for all children and we also have a second program which is called storm birds and and that 's a actually a um a program that 's designed um by a body called good grief and and it 's a program addressing grief and loss and trauma and that 's a slightly more intensive program so that runs over four weeks four sessions and we may not be able to deliver that particular program to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly more intensive small group program but the aim is that the first the rising from the ashes will be offered as widely as possible and that might help us to identify those children who might need that little bit more um in which case we will run the storm birds program also in the schools well wayne thank you very much for your time on today 's episode of the road to recovery and for providing us with a fantastic overview of the wonderful work that the monero family support service is doing here in the snowman area thank you very much nathan and um yeah we 're really excited about all the programs that we 're currently rolling out a lot of them are in partnership with uh council and um there 's more to come in that space as well so looking forward to that the first of two mindaroo pods has

    "text": "good morning and welcome to the latest edition of the road to recovery in today 's show we 'll continue updating the snowy monero community on how bushfire recovery is progressing here in our region we 'll chat shortly with ceo of coordinator diane kitcher diana will tell us more about the great work coordinator is doing in our region to help with the bushfire recovery process we 'll have a look at a funding announcement coming the way of the adam enemy snowy scheme museum and we 'll let you know about upcoming dates to catch up with the recovery team for a cuppa so that and plenty more to get through on today 's edition of the road to recovery joining us on the road to recovery today is ceo of coordinator diane kitcher diane thank you for your time how are you um hi thanks nathan thanks for your time and interest could you please share with us diane some of the fantastic work that coordinate is doing in the southeast region so the southeast region of new south wales is the region that we work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ australia and as as you well know nathan um the region was very badly impacted by the bushfires early this year and late last year and we have been working very closely with the community to help support the immediate actions that needed to take place post the bushfires but also now very much focused on helping and supporting communities in their recovery um after the bushfires how is coordinator looking to help these bushfire affected communities so a big part of our focus has been um mental health support and trying to make sure that there are services available for people to be able to reach out and access services and so we 've been able to commission quite a few extra services across the region that people can access and we have also been able to promote particularly in the covered period where it 's been really difficult to access anything on a face-to-face basis we 've also been promoting various helplines that are available for different people so for example there 's a phone line available with headspace for young people there 's particular phone lines available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines available for men so there are different phone lines available for particular people in the community where they will hopefully feel more comfortable speaking to somebody on the phone to support them and help them i think one of the key things just to really acknowledge is that this is a very very uh not normal time for anybody and different people will struggle at different times around different issues and it 's really really important that people feel comfortable to reach out for help the other thing that we 've been promoting quite a bit more recently is we 've got a free community suicide prevention training program that we 've made available right across our region and it 's something that people can do free of charge it only takes an hour and what it 's trying to do is give people in the community the general community more confidence to talk to somebody that they 're worried about if if they do think that they 're someone that they care about is at risk and people really want to help but they feel very unsure about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their loved ones and their friends so it 's a really helpful it 's a one hour training free online it 's called p q r okay qpr so question persuade refers and it 's to give people confidence to have the conversation and give them some tips about how they could positively influence a friend or a family member to seek help because that 's a really important part of you know the recovery process is trying to support your own family and friends in your own community everybody is really really concerned about that we also have commissioned or put out lots of what 's called community small community projects and they 're about trying to help local um organizations not-for-profits local councils anyone who 's got a good idea about the sorts of things that they could maybe activities that they could do to bring people together because we also know that social isolation and people who are potentially needing that extra support do tend to isolate themselves a bit and it 's really really important to get people connecting with their friends and family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushfire supports that 's all one word or lowercase and dot info that will take them through to our bushfire services page on our website and they 'll be able to pick up all of the phone numbers for the various helplines the information about that question persuade and refer online suicide prevention program that i mentioned that people can access as well as all the various services that we are also funding across the region thank you diane for your time on today 's edition of the road to recovery the snowy scheme museum in adam enoby has received a fifty thousand dollar grant to help the town 's tourism industry recover from the

here in our region shortly we 'll catch up with bushfire councillor from catholic care jenny wallace to learn more about the organization 's role in helping the region recover from the summer bushfires we 'll let you know about grant opportunities that are available until the end of september and last weekend we saw a return to face-to-face community gatherings the bushfire recovery team joined forces with the monero family support service to run the first of a series of community get-togethers we 'll learn a little bit more about that and how the first get-together panned out so plenty to get through on today 's edition of the road to recovery joining us on today 's edition of the road to recovery is jenny wallace from catholic care and jenny thank you for your time on today 's episode well hello nathan and all you listeners out there and thank you for having me jenny you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new service that catholic care is providing for the snowy monero in terms of bushfire support counselling service could you tell us a little bit about the counselling service please yeah sure so the bushfire support counselling program is a free counselling service provided by catholic care and it 's um its purpose is to support anyone in the snowy monero region that 's been impacted by the bushfires our funding is from the coordinate south east and new south wales primary health network so i 'm one of five other catholic care bushfire support councillors who are spread out all over the southern new south wales region so this service is specifically a counselling service it 's about helping people manage any emotional and psychological reactions they may be experiencing as a result of the bush fires so jenny there 's a variety of bushfire support services here in the region but what exactly does catholic care have to offer our community through this service okay so that 's a good question because there are quite a few services providing all sorts of supports so this particular service or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can access professional counselling if you find you 're struggling perhaps a visit to your doctor is the first port of call and then counselling can support you to process your experiences of the bushfires and if need be we can work together alongside your gp to provide ongoing support so most of us are just starting to join the dots now even though it 's been months since the bush fires some are only just starting to realize now the effects that this stress has had on on on our emotional psychological well-being and how this stress can be expressed in physically in our body so physical responses to stress are also typical in children who don 't have the words to express themselves emotionally all these responses and reactions to disasters like i said before are very normal responses to abnormal events and counselling can help you adapt to the aftermath of the bushfire disasters and jenny before we let you go this morning do you have any last words for people who might be a little bit skeptical or not used to the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all going through tough times and people can and do adjust to and overcome difficult circumstances firstly once their environment is stable and secondly when they can reach out and connect and i can assure you the service is highly respectful and in regard to privacy and confidentiality so if you just want to chat or to make an appointment you can contact us on zero four double eight triple one six four six thank you jenny for your time on today 's episode

preparing to host a get ready weekend this might be in person or online to make covert 19 restrictions we 'll have more details for you in today 's program and we 'll also let the women of the snowy monero know about women community connect days that are being run by the monero family support service there is plenty to get through on today 's episode of the road to recovery joining us today on the road to recovery is gabriella from the wonderful organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative that is the aus harvest mobile market and gabriella good morning and thank you for your time today good morning nathan and listeners thank you so much for having us on on air and how did the oz harvest mobile market come about certainly so uh off the back of some emergency food aid um new south wales government grant in late april we were able to secure funding specifically for a regional food relief project so that kick started us even though we had had the idea for some years um so it was a bit of a silver lining off the back of what has been obviously a horrendous run of of months for for regional new south wales towns um and the way it started is that we kind of started contacting a lot of businesses and uh local lead contacts from organizations as varied as church groups existing local pantries uh the cwa blaise aid anglica to connect the dots and really find out from people who live and breathe these towns what is needed where and how we could help so gabriella oz harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monero region helping bushfire affected communities could you tell us a little bit more about how the mobile market is operating in our region and how it has been assisting people and we have really loved getting to meet a whole range of people throughout the smelly monero region and so towns such as nibanabel numerola and bregbo even across to butler and tumbarumba and the communities there have been so welcoming um when we run around and indeed visited in person to to find out um how we could be of assistance and what we have been doing and continue to do is arrive in a town um at a time that is you know coordinated with those lovely local representatives um and we create a pop-up market usually for about an hour to an hour and a half whether anyone in a household that is doing it tough for a number of reasons they can go into um they 're invited to come along and not only access healthy fresh fruit and vegetables that have been sourced locally but also as we know is so important and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chat whether it 's with our team or bumping into neighbours they might not have seen for a while um just having that chance to you know get out and and you know share what 's going on with them and and you know see some friendly faces um that is also what our market provides so gabriella who can access the old harvest mobile markets mason we welcome anyone to come along that is doing it tough at the moment and of course the bushfires have really defined 2020 unfortunately um we are of course aware that um our food is helpful to people who may have been going through challenges like social isolation or job loss mental health challenges um you know physical isolation as well so really anyone who is doing it tough not um only those who may have lost part of their property of course any households that have lost property are very welcome to come as well and in the four months that the oz harvest mobile markets has been operating you 've managed to reach many many places throughout new south wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places you 've been to absolutely we 've really i mean they 've been so lucky to get out and see this incredible state uh more and more um so we 've covered places uh for example in the north west uh korendai bogabrai manila kur lewis among many others and in the south of course the towns are mentioned in the snowy region but also um you know windham and kaya mogo and a lot of south coast locations as well so in total we 're now visiting on a regular basis whether that is fortnightly or monthly 28 towns across new south wales um in total in those four months that has equated to 114 pop-up market events when can locals expect to see ozarks back in our region glad you asked so please uh keep an eye out for us coming through on the week commencing monday the 28th of september and from there every

we 'll catch up with d murdoch the coordinator of the blazaid camps at breadbow and umarela and dale tell us about the amazing work the volunteer organisation has been doing to improve the lives of bushfire affected land holders we 'll also provide some important contact details for salvation army chaplains who can help you going through the cleanup process so thank you for your company and plenty to get through on today 's edition of the road to recovery joining us now is dee murdoch the blazaid coordinator for the camps at breadbow and umarella and dee is on the ground right now in the counter guinea region working hard alongside the blazaid volunteers to repair bushfire damaged fences and dee thank you for your time today could you please give us a little bit of an oversight on how the breadboa and umarela camps have been going since they started work earlier this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year and moved up here on anzac day so just to simply be closer to our numerous counter ghani durango peak view property owners and we 've pretty much completed most of the work in the bredbow area dee could you share with us the volume of work that the blizzard volunteers have been able to get through in the wider breadboa and umarella areas yeah i think closer business sunday we 've completed i think about 60 kilometres pulled out of fencing and about 25-26 kilometers put in we 've probably got about another 10 of each before the camp closes at the end of next week so yeah it 's a fair whack the snowy monero has been fortunate to have the hard work of blazaid here for a number of months now and blazat also carries out its work right throughout the country helping bush fire affected land holders and flood affected land holders repair fences but d as our local landholders have found out the work of blaze 8 is much more than just rebuilding fences blazed motto is helping communities recover after natural disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got a back story there might have been a death in the family they might have been you know not only are they getting over fire they 're getting over drought and so many of them when you meet them first up albeit over the telephone at the moment with covert they just say oh we 're still in a fog we don 't know where we 're going and then a few phone calls later and then we get a team out there to pull out a fence and they come back and they say i can see where i 'm going i can see how to get this disaster sorted and you see the spark come back in their eye you see the smile on their face you see you see they 're just their ability to get up and go again that 's the most rewarding part of it by miles dee a very important part of blazaid 's work has been establishing those community connections and just how welcomed have you been by the communities you 've been helping particularly we 're staying down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as allowing blaise to stay there and just pry to covert you know we 'd get fruit cakes brought in you know grandma 's favorite casserole and things but the community now they they know the loan vehicle from high country automotives they know the people are volunteers in

greyhead members of the team um really feel part of the community and a lot of people one of the guys wants to stay here and i think wants to stay in the snow field working but yeah this area has made

in the snowy monero um there 's a good news story happening at the moment nathan the lang o 'rourke bushfire cleanup team are in town and this is really exciting for our landholders who have been affected by the bush fires what happens is lang o 'rourke will contact the land holder and they will arrange a site inspection and discuss the scope and what will happen when the machines actually arrive on ground to take away the fire debris so we understand that there have been calls made into the community which is great site inspections have been carried out and we believe that the machinery will be in region in approximately two weeks time now one of the big messages for this nathan is people must have registered with service new south wales for the cleanup we don 't want

    "text": "hello and welcome to the latest edition of the road to recovery on today 's show we 'll continue updating the snowy monero region on how bushfire recovery is progressing in our community we 'll catch up shortly with sarah blyton the economic development officer at snowy monero regional council to chat about the importance of economic recovery post bushfires and how that process has been further complicated by the covert 19 troubles we 'll also let you know about bushfire recovery assistance points they 're back and there are some dates coming up very soon where you 'll have a chance to catch up for a cuppa with the bushfire recovery team and the agencies responsible in the recovery process so that and plenty more to get through on today 's edition of the road to recovery joining us today on the road to recovery is snowy monero regional council economic development officer sarah blyton and sarah you are taking some time out of your day to chat to us about economic recovery in the region following the summer bushfires how important has economic recovery been in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our businesses these past seven months now and it 's crazy to think that you know the year isn 't over yet and who knows what the rest of winter will bring sorry you know you 're hoping for a better six months ahead but i guess you know so far modeling undertaken by ansten young or ey for the national bushfire recovery recovery agency found the impact to our economy from the bushfires with over 150 million dollars which you know alone is absolutely massive to contemplate but ey have also recently undertaken a report that was commissioned by some environmental conservation groups and it was around the stimulus the economic stimulus that conservation and land management could provide the country um as part of covert 19 recovery so the report actually scaringly found that snowy monero is the most heavily impacted lga in new south wales because of covert 19 and we 're in the top five in australia so i guess when when you drill that down into some of the numbers that means we lost about 15 of our full-time employment over the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1090 jobs um and on top of that around 13 of our gross value added products so you know combining 150 million with another 13 it is an absolutely massive hit and it 's definitely not over yet so those um those numbers are staggering sarah to think that you know our lga is so heavily affected how then with covert 19 how then are you as an economic development officer able to work within this environment and help our businesses recover i get i guess the one thing for us nathan is early on we created the smrt cover 19 local business forum which is a private facebook group and you know we acknowledge that everyone has facebook but that 's been a really helpful tool for us to communicate the ever-changing information and advice coming out from both you know the state and federal government and we 're continuing to use that especially as things seem to be deteriorating a little bit more at the moment but to be honest right now because council doesn 't really have a role in determining any of the legal requirements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where possible helping connect our local businesses with people who can provide support to help them work through you know what what these restrictions mean for their business sarah one industry that was heavily affected within the snowy monero region and the greater southeast region was the timber industry and just recently there 's been some funding come their way yeah that 's right nathan so we 've received some bushfire recovery funding which council are delivering a few projects under but one of them which is really important to us in the region is the softwoods industry so within appointed modules group who are a forestry consultant and they 're going to deliver a bomba region softwoods bushfire recovery study so our intention with the project is for industry stakeholders including each level of government to better understand how the software with the industry functions within the bombala region and better understand the impact that these bushfires will have on you know supply in the industry into the future so you know we 're asking margel 's groom to look at things like supply workforce requirements sustainability future disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any other issues that come up throughout the consultation process so very very excited to see what that project delivers for us and what sort of action can be taken across the industry and in government to secure its future in bombay well sarah thank you for your time on today 's edition of the road to recovery no worries nathan thanks for having me bushfire recovery assistance points are back up and running throughout the region and on saturday the 18th of july between 10 30 a.m and 1 p.m the peak view hall will be home to the latest

here in the region we 'll catch up shortly with christy harvey the community development officer at snowy monero regional council christie is the chair of a health and wellbeing subcommittee who 's playing an important role in assisting our communities in their recovery journey we 'll also let you know about some grant opportunities available through some vincent de paul and put a call out to landowners who share a boundary fence on the nomagi national park so that and plenty more to get through on today 's edition of the road to recovery joining us on today 's episode of the road to recovery is snowy monero regional council 's community development officer christy harvey christie is also the chair of the health and wellbeing subcommittee who 's playing an important role in the region 's bushfire recovery process and christy joins us on the phone this morning thanks for your time today christy now where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start off by telling us a little bit about the health and wellbeing subcommittee sure so the health and wellbeing subcommittee is one of the committees that were recommended to be set up um after the bushfire event in early 2020 in recognition that shaw will need to rebuild and certainly there 'll be infrastructure considerations and environmental considerations but also our community is going to have a recovery journey in front of it from a health and wellbeing perspective and certainly we 've seen that over the last couple of months that everybody has a role in coming together for recovery and that our mental health and well-being is just as important in recovery as the physical stuff and with the work the committee 's been doing over a number of months now part of that has been working with the many wonderful organizations and service providers in our region who are also assisting in this bushfire recovery effort and the committee has been able to award two grants to two fantastic local organizations yeah that 's right so um we were fortunate enough to secure some funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that funding allowed us to pass on some grants to manera family support service and the monero domestic violence committee and those two grants will go towards supporting um children and young people in particular for monaro family support service and their recovery journey and for the monarch domestic violence committee um their project will focus on supporting communities to understand the impact of trauma on family relationships and to raise awareness of domestic violence as a bigger issue across our region a number of organizations have their staff lined up to undertake some important training where staff will become storm bird facilitators could you explain to us what a storm bird facilitator would be sure so storm birds is a really exciting and innovative program that 's delivered in schools it 's aimed at children aged 5 to 16 and storm birds essentially helps young people understand that uh disaster and uh chaos and grief is part of life and it 's not an everyday part thankfully but it is an important um part of life and that we can all work on strategies to work through those processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 've got i think kind of between six and ten local staff being trained up to become storm birds facilitators so they will go off they 'll learn how to deliver that program and then they 'll deliver that program in our local schools and so that 's really exciting that 's going to help and support our local children and young people to understand grief understand loss and learn skills for adapting and recovering so that 's really exciting do you have a message or a reminder for people who might be struggling with the impacts from those summer bushfires i think the big message from all of us is that recovery is a long and slow journey it is a process there are no rules about recovery and everybody will deal with recovery in a different way everybody will feel differently day-to-day it 's completely okay to still be working through some of those issues and those thoughts and feelings professional help is out there and available if people need that but also just coming back to each other coming back to our families and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to give each other that space to experience those emotions but also that support to kind of come through you that 's going to continue for a long time and one of the things that we 've seen in this recovery we 've seen in our communities for years is a beautiful sense of resilience and a beautiful sense of community and togetherness and so i think as we kind of all move forward in this and 2020 certainly hasn 't been kind to any of us um it 's just kind of been one thing after another so just supporting each other recognizing that stuff in yourself and being kind of able to move forward as a community um that 's what we 're all here for we 're all here to support each other there are people and services that can get involved if we need to well christy thank you very much for your time on today 's edition of the road to recovery no worries thanks for having me financial and emotional support is available through this vincent de paul society who is helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were affected by the fires and suffered property loss or ongoing financial difficulties then get in contact with vinnie 's on 13

here in our region shortly we 'll catch up with matt trippit ceo and founder of the fly fishing program matt 's program has been helping men focus on their well-being through connecting with nature recently matt 's program has received a bushfire grant to roll out the monero men in flight program to men throughout the snowy monero so we 're looking forward to catching up with matt and hearing a little bit more about this fantastic upcoming initiative red cross grants have been extended until the end of the year we 'll tell you what grants you can apply for if you 're still in need of financial assistance and the new south wales bushfire community resilience and economic recovery fund is open it 's now time to get your applications in so plenty to get through on today 's edition of the road to recovery joining us today on the road to recovery is matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you thank you for your time on today 's episode could you start by telling us a little bit about this fantastic program sure well where it starts is on the uh the founder of an organisation called the fly program and the fly program 's focus is using amazing nature-based experiences like we have here in the new south wales story mountains and to host retreats or programs with a focus on early intervention for aussie blokes who have been impacted by stress and anxiety and many of the other things that we all deal with on a day-to-day basis in the world today matt how will the monero men in flight program help local men focus on their well-being the monaro men in flight program is specifically designed to reach out to aussie blokes who have been impacted in the monaro region by the bushfires earlier in the season obviously it 's had a catastrophic impact on people directly and indirectly and there 's going to be a lot of stress in the community and there 's got to be some time for healing in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting about 65 guys we will be putting through this program from right across the monaro here in the thredbo valley or close by to the threadbar valley uh in some life-changing events it 's going to be great matt why is nature such an effective tool in helping men connect and talk about their mental health ah nature 's a critical thing and i think as blokes we are not great communicators when we 're talking face-to-face with one another but i think there 's something very therapeutic and it 's certainly been scientifically proven standing shoulder to shoulder in wild environments environments where pathways to help seeking or just having a chat with a mate or a new mate can be a very powerful and engaging way for men to be able to connect with one another and for you you may not be a talker and that 's absolutely fine but i think listening to some of the other stories or participants who may be attending those programs might give you some support and an understanding that you 're not out there on your own and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years now the fly program has helped hundreds of men with their well-being can you tell us about the impact you 've seen this program have since it began yeah the fly program was founded in 2016 and since then we 've hosted uh three and a half years of programs that um in total have hosted over 350 men through a four-day adventure based retreat here in the new south wales snowys called the men in flight program the impacts of this program have been somewhat profound and we 've really seen some wonderful positive impact on men 's help seeking behaviours and also just creating a positive and strong camaraderie within blokes and mental health support for blokes as an early intervention-based program so it 's been quite overwhelming and matt just finally why would you encourage snowy monero men to take part in the upcoming monero men in flight program well i think the first thing is there 's probably a few blokes out there who are absolutely perfect for this program and don 't want anything to do with a mental health initiative and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health initiative through these programs we 're creating a powerful social environment for guys to connect and we 're also creating an environment where guys can get some support if they want some support through some mental fitness exercises but primarily we 're going to be doing all of this out on the river learning how to fly fish spending some time in some of australia 's mainland best trout fishery and we 're going to make some memories in the process so if you are interested in the program or if you feel like you should be on the program but it 's a bit intimidating make that call and let 's connect and let 's get out get ourselves on this uh because we 've got a lot of spots they 're going to feel pretty quick but we 're really really excited to be helping out our local community thank you matt for your time on today 's edition of the road to recovery and for telling us about the fantastic

yourself for an emergency and we 'll let you know a little bit later on in today 's episode what those five steps are so plenty to get through on the road to recovery today joining us today on the road to recovery is expressive therapist jess jess is working with the monero family support service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jess thank you for your time this morning thank you nathan i 'm glad to be here could you start jess by telling us what an expressive therapist is please so expressive therapies is a form of psychotherapy and places significant emphasis on the emotional process it allows deeper aspects of the psyche to be worked with naturally and in safety it 's child friendly it uses a range of techniques that provides a space where children can explore their emotions through visual form art sensory symbols so it externalizes what 's happening in their internal world in a way that they feel comfortable with so jess how long have you been working as an expressive therapist for so i i mean i initially my first career started as a high school teacher with the department many years ago and then i started my clinical work in alice springs where i learned about sam play therapy back in 2012 so from then on i became quite immersed in the area of expressive therapies and psychotherapy and have done my clinical work around around that so jess you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for the monero family support service to deliver the rising from the ashes program could you tell us how this program has come to be here in our region so um i 've been sourced by and approached by monero family support services so the manager from from there pauline and um she thought that i because of my background in expressive therapies it would be good to come up with a workshop that provides children who have been affected by the bushfires an opportunity to tell their story and their experience um in in a way that allows them to to process the grief around the bushfires i incorporated some activities which helps children to tap into the memories of the bushfires so it bypasses what they call left mode thinking talking um to connect with their right mode body where trauma is implicitly stored as imagery sensation so the activities are very much based around really harnessing and bringing forth their own personal experience and they get to then produce and create an art an art piece out of it using watercolor paint what are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're seeing emerge from the children who are taking part in the program it 's quite it 's been quite revealing and you know i feel privileged to witness each child 's personal experience and story around the bushfires and they all share such unique stories and are quite keen to share which allows them to process it and then in the end you know come to a close um so it helps to integrate that whole whole process as you 're saying just before jess the program has been very well received by local school children could you tell us uh how the program 's moving forward in the weeks to come and some of the places you 'll be going to so so so far um i delivered these workshops across several schools in the snowy monero regions and we 've got a number of schools that are interested in booking in for the workshops so how they go about doing that is by contacting monero family

here in our region we 'll catch up shortly with inspector langdon gould from the monero district rural fire service inspector gould will tell us about the hard work the rfs is currently undertaking to ensure our region is ready for the official start of the bushfire season on october 1. we 'll let you know about three grants that were handed out last week to help bushfire recovery throughout the region and we 'll also keep you up to date with the latest grant information available through the red cross and vincent de paul society so plenty to get through on today 's edition of the road to recovery joining us on today 's edition of the road to recovery is inspector langdon gould of the new south wales rural fire service monero district and langdon a good morning to you thank you for your time today good morning nathan good morning to listeners langdon we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowy monero fire season could you tell us a little bit about the work the rfs is currently doing in preparation for this well certainly look uh even though obviously as everyone knows we we 're still doing obviously recovery operations from the fires we 've still been continuing with our hazard production work um and also to fire trial fire trial maintenance works um it 's part of the regular program and people in um in around the kumar area would have noticed just as even as recently as this last weekend the hazard production burn being undertaken by rfs and fire rescue around the chapman chapman street um snowy mountains high snow and highway leading out of kumar up towards the four mile you know those burn programs are important and we continue to do them as weather conditions allow us to do so we 've seen this week a number of grass fires actually get out of hand throughout the region what would you say to land holders who are thinking that this might be a good time of year to do some to do some burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key is planning if you if you wake up one morning and say oh today 's the day good day i 'm just going to go out and like that it 's probably not the best thing to do because uh you know it 's just been clearly shown that those those that don 't plan well often end up with results they don 't want and look it 's very simple firstly you 're legally at the moment because we 're still outside of the bushfire danger period till the 1st of september you legally have to notify both all your direct neighbors and the rural fire service at least 24 hours in advance the next bit of information that i 'd look at is make sure you 've got control lines around that fire so that you know in this car in these cases because we 've got a lot of dry grasses out there frost fur grasses and also the bush now we 've had a bit of rain it 's also drying out as well if you don 't have a control line around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know water and pump hoses etc and if you 're not physically capable of actually doing the work to control your fire then maybe you should consider whether you strike the match or not and most certainly the weather that 's a key factor not just what 's happening that day when you 're going to be doing the burn but what the weather is like in the days and up to weeks after you know if you 're if you 're burning grass and then it 's quite reasonable to expect if it 's just grasses only but that might fully extinguish overnight but if you 're burning piles of timber or anything heavier or bush with timber you can expect under those conditions for that that timber to stay hot for days and even weeks ahead and all it takes is one windy day to come up and stir that fire up and one ember crosses across out of that area out of your control area and off that fire runs again and they 're the risks involved just as recently as tuesday afternoon the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't able to control his fire even though it was a very benign day with very little wind that fire quickly quickly raised threatened his house and two neighboring houses and uh a prompt response from about eight to ten rural fire service appliances and handy a contracted dozer next door at the time were able to you know bring that fire under control at 10 hectares but there was you know for the land owners involved there was some nervous moments as those is that fire race towards those houses so a key message here is you know even though the day looks benign especially in that love grass country where it 's all cured out you know make sure make sure you 've got proper control lines you 've got the right equipment to control the fire and that you are competent to be able to do that yourself before you strike that match and langman could you give us a little bit of an update of the hard work the rfs has been doing post the summer bushfires in terms of the make safe program and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues uh unfortunately the last couple of weeks the machinery has not been able to operate in many places across the monero because of the distinct amount of rainfall we have that 's a good thing for the monero but unfortunately one of the downsides is that you know the heavy plant that we 've engaged you know can 't operate in that environment they end up making more damage and they do good and also getting bogged so they you know they haven 't been able to operate then but that program has been continuing for a number of months now and will go for a significant amount of time there 's a lot of make safe work to be done we 've got a lot of local contractors involved in undertaking those works and that will continue as will the liaison with landowners on that work that 's being done well langdon thanks very much for your time on today 's edition of the road to recovery and for providing us with an update of the hard work the monero district rfs is continuing to do in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush summit held in kurma three bushfire recovery grants were handed out to continue supporting mental health and well-being in our community and to support the ongoing work of the two thumbs wildlife sanctuary at peak view matt trippett founder of the fly program received 42 000 to

    "text": "hi everyone its Cena from the library and Max and I are making photo tile coasters to make your photo tile coaster you will need a tile we 're just using a cheap tile we are using a big one today but you can use any size and the small ones are super cute to turn your tile into a coaster you will need some felt pad circles and they will go at the bottom of your tile to turn your tile into a fabulous coaster you will also need your favorite picture printed on photo paper that you will later cut down to size you will need a marker some scissors next you will also need some Mod Podge which is a waterproof shield and to use your modge podge you will need a sponge roller or a paintbrush and this is just optional but if you want to jazz up your coaster you can use some embellished embellished mints such as some beading or some fun stickers to begin making your tile coaster make sure that you clean your tile with a damp cloth and make sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile over your photo ensure that you 're covering the bit that you will want stuck on your tile max use your marker to trace around the tile good job now you have two options if you want a straight line just use your scissors and cut out your picture if you would like a different effect you can tear along the line and make a jagged edge and that gives your photo type coaster a nice effect you want to make sure that you cut the photo smaller than the tile so it doesn 't hang over the edges the next step is to paint some Mod Podge which is a waterproof sealant and a glue over your tile so let 's begin I 'm going to use a sponge roller because it is much smoother to use than a paintbrush but if you have a paintbrush that 's totally fine I 'm going to place my photo over the tile you will need to use your fingers to smooth out any air bubbles ensure that you hold on to the photo and press down hard so your photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles next step is to simply paint over the photo with some more modge podge and then you just wait for it to dry we 're just going to move things along quickly so we 're just going to use a blow dryer once the first layer of your modge podge has dried it is recommended to put a second layer on if you would like to ensure that your coaster is extra waterproof however we 're just going to move on to the next step we 're going to make our design extra funky by adding some fun embellishments with this black and white photo I 'm going to add some very cute red hearts on the corner of the coaster and to do that you will need a hot glue gun we are to the final stage of our photo tile coaster and we are going to put some soft felt circles on the bottom of our poster so it doesn 't scratch any surfaces and now you have your photo tile coaster it has gone from an a plain old tile to a fabulous drink coaster max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use these colorful cubes instead of the felt soft circles and he 's going to show us how to do it [Music] [Music] now you 're ready to enjoy your new coaster and you can also enjoy them as an artwork see you next time [Music]"

    "text": "good morning and welcome to the latest edition of the road to recovery in today 's episode we 'll continue to update the snowy monero community on how bushfire recovery is progressing here in our region shortly we 'll catch up with james fitzgerald wildlife carer and owner operator of the two thumbs at wildlife sanctuary in peak view james lost his property and the sanctuary in the good good fire in late january we 'll touch base with james to see how the sanctuary is rebuilding and the important work that james and researchers from the australian university are doing to help rehabilitate and study how our koalas respond to the impacts of bushfires we 'll let you know about some red cross grants and some vincent de paul grants that are still available to apply for and provide some important details so you can support those or yourself struggling with their health and wellbeing so thank you for your company on today 's edition of the road to recovery joining us now is james fitzgerald from the two thumbs of wildlife sanctuary at peak view james thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough seven months since the summer bushfires could you share with us the hard work that 's going into rebuilding your sanctuary i guess as people know like on the 23rd of january 2020 the goodwood bushfire totally destroyed my sanctuary and burnt down my houses and sheds and everything and i sort of lost everything but um [Music] you know there was a lot of work to be done there was a lot of koalas out in that forest and other animals that needed rescuing so that 's what we were doing uh with the rebuilding um my niece 's husband has been stewart has been project managing that um so they have a concrete company in canberra bear concrete co and um and then one of his friends is a welder and metal worker and and then one of the labourers they 've been working flat out here building these enclosures following the devastating bushfires james you 've been working hard to rehabilitate and care for injured koalas could you talk us through the rescue effort and how you 've been assisted by detection dogs to locate koalas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started rescuing in november because the fire 's out braywood way i stayed out there for five weeks helping people out that way rescue i 'm also in the rural fire service so when the fire started out here i had to at home and then we were rescuing around here we got a lot of help from the university sunshine coast they have a detection dogs for conservation program and so bear is a detection dog that 's trained to find koala fur and so he 's truly amazing he he can pick up on the wind the koala and he will then find the tree that sits under the tree that the koala 's actually in i remember one day i was i took a bag out of the car that i 'd had a koala in previously and bear was a couple hundred meters away and i watched him follow the wind and come straight to me so yeah apparently dogs have a hundred thousand times better sense of smell than what we do and so that that really helped us with finding those animals that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the new animal enclosures at the two thumbs wildlife sanctuary and you 're joined by a special friend rescued from the bushfires could you tell us a little bit more about the koala who 's with you this quality is named paul he 's named after the first officer of the hercules c130 that crashed just out here after it dropped a load of fire retardant on my sanctuary on the 23rd of january it 's a terrible tragedy and we 've met like i have met the wives and children of the pilots and they 've met these koalas paul had second degree burns um and he was one of the quails that we thought might have for a while he was looking like he might have made it but we had help from the vets at the anu and also tim and villa and they were changing his bandages every day and all that sort of thing and so he is one of the you know success stories or one of the you know the good that 's come out of like what what otherwise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a bushfire recovery grant he received five thousand dollars to help rebuild the sanctuary that was part of a twenty thousand dollar fund to assist wildlife carers throughout the region could you share with us the plans you have for this funding so we 're using that money as part of of like each of these buildings which have four large choir enclosures is costing us just on sixty thousand dollars to build and we 're building a five so you know it 's a three hundred thousand dollar project um and so that 's what we 're putting that and every every bid helps um and so yeah it 's a great contribution that council is making um and you know it helps us with rehabilitating these guys but also as we 've sort of talked about today you know with the anu we 're doing all the research out in the field here looking at and learning about how kyla survived in burned-out forests and trying to understand better about how we helped them post fire yeah well james thank you very much for your time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us your story about rebuilding the wonderful two thumbs wildlife sanctuary as we just heard there from james fitzgerald at the two thumbs of wildlife sanctuary james is working closely with researchers from the australian national university who are studying the impacts of bushfires on koalas and how resilient our much-loved furry friends are when responding to natural disasters we 're now joined by dr karen ford who is out at the two thumbs at wildlife sanctuary and dr ford thank you very much for your time on today 's edition of the road to recovery could you tell us about the work the university is doing here at the tooth arms wildlife sanctuary so we 're interested in looking at how the koalas that have been rehabilitated and then released back into the wild integrate back into the resident population we 're also interested in how those resident koalas are using the burnt landscape so we really want to know whether they 're relying on the little patches of intact areas that didn 't burn in the fires or whether they 're happy to move through all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrowth that 's coming back on the trees and all of that 's really important for telling us how we should be responding to fires in the future do we need to be supporting koalas through those early times after fire when there 's only a little bit of regrowth available or can they survive quite happily on that regrowth is it too early doctor ford to have an indication of what your research is hoping to uncover it is still early stages but we are getting really good indication that the koalas are doing really well so even in some of the areas that have been burnt really quite severely in the fires the koalas seem to be hanging on quite well they seem to be managing to find themselves enough food so that 's really encouraging thank you dr ford for your time on today 's episode of the road to recovery if you or someone you know is struggling with their mental health and their well-being as a result of the summer bushfires then help is available so please reach out lifeline is still running a dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact this service on 13 43 57 that 's 13 43 57 for lifeline 's 24 hour seven day a week bushfire support service both the red cross and some vincent de paul society have grants available to assist you red cross bushfire grants are open until the 30th of september and vinnies they have 1 000 emergency relief fund payments to distribute the people in bushfire affected areas for further information on the grants and for assistance in applying you can always contact the snowy monero bushfire recovery team on thirteen hundred

You Anne um yeah good evening everybody best food I said my name 's Brett Jones I manage the biosecurity or weeds management program throughout Council hmm within the parameters of our Security Act and the state weeds action program and we try and align those objectives with the community 's expectations back during the fires I was heavily involved myself I suppose and sitting the fire trucks particularly in the your Malabar encounter guinea areas and I guess given my rural background and the knowledge of the region 's agricultural needs I was asked to chair the council 's agricultural subcommittee recovery subcommittee which was established a couple of months ago as you appreciate a lot of your major issues been dealing with in the agricultural sector is fence fence repair replacement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcommittee which I 'm a part we focus entirely on issues within the farm gate there 's other subcommittees that deal with issues relating to health work health Melbourne communications infrastructure and other aspects of the bushfire recovery so the owner of the council 's agricultural subcommittee is to provide that specialist advice to counsel counsel overall a recovery committee and to do our best to find solutions and try and fill those gaps in current funding and other support programs so the subcommittee 's represented boy yourself arse farmers local Land Services rural financial counselling service Rural Fire Service blazed a red bow and blazed a the Salvation Army and council ourselves so essentially auspices subcommittee we report to and escalate issues to councils overall recovery committee and to the there 's a southeast regional recovery committee which ultimately feeds up into the up into the state level so that 's more involvement annoyed please throw questions and we 'll help you heal every weekend thank you thanks Brit area manager with national parks based here in jindabyne but my team I guess has responsibility for pests and weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Causey but also reserves up in the northern Manero tender again and ambien through to the bring de bellas on the other side of the acct and sort of further earth to around crook well Abercrombie River during fires yeah I was involved mostly no MTV both in Queanbeyan back in November late November December and then move south to Takuma narrow in in January February so yeah I guess acknowledge it 's been a really tough time for people over the last six months and and and yet we 've we 've still got a way to go to get through that as been explained we 're here in order to talk about fences but yeah I 'm happy to take other questions if time permits or I can take them on notice later but yeah just happy to be a part of the panel tonight

working across the whole manere um first of all I 'd like to ignore is the mega reggae country that we 're on and I respects to elder 's past and present um for tonight I look there 'll be a few links and things like it 's really really ask the people watching to keep an eye on the in the in the chat if you haven 't already there 's a couple of buttons down the bottom if you could just push the chat one that will open up the chat and you 'll see lots of really useful links and information appearing in there and I 'll just pop one in there now but you 'll see that there 's already quite a few important links in there so the big program I 'm going to talk to but to about tonight is is it 's a relatively new one called supporting our neighbors the supporting our neighbors program is is what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and essentially there 's this you know over 200 million dollars they 've been put into replacing fences where there 's a boundary fence has been burnt between private land and some sort of a public estate so that those public lands include national parks forestry corporation New South Wales traveling stock reserves Crown lands Roads and Maritime Services roads and local council roads and and I guess but for those that might or might not be aware of it there 's also a new little new little thing just in the last couple of days has been added where if there were existing riparian fences on onto Crown owned or crown managed rivers and they would been burnt they 're now included as well that 's been another little addition in the last few days so this program for this two hundred million dollars it does it work exclusively with those boundary fences between public and private land you know I I too want to you know really just acknowledge the the gravity of what you have all been through and what the community 's been through this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of you that stress has been made worse by the loss of stock homes properties and some of you for family and friends so it 's it 's been a very traumatic year and and I guess there 's a lot of different programs and all the stuff that Andrea and her team has talked about and will talk about in future webinars and lots of different layers of the systems to to help people as much to begin as I mentioned earlier local Land Services is is actually taking a lead on on the supporting your neighbors program and we are in that we are dealing with and representing all of those different public agencies so that you can just work with us and it 's one of our listeners roles is to go and do that negotiation and and standard type work and and and fact-checking background with all those agencies for you so really ask you and I 'll be giving a really big plug to to this this program and to engaging with local bands services as a conduit to all but whichever neighbor you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this past summer it was around forty thousand kilometers of boundary fences lost between private land and public lancers no small thing the one of the really important things is that you know the money has been allocated is enough to cover all those fences so this is not like your normal funding program where it might be competitive and it might be on what we first in before it goes there is enough for all of them which is which is which is a model relief I 'm not saying necessarily drag your feet and and take take your time but there is enough for all those fences to be to be funded when we come to funding the program what we 're doing is paying cash 5,000 per kilometre of fence loss and that funding goes directly into your activity to you to then erect a fence in in your own manner the the one of the questions that people are going to ask is I 've already put up my face have I lost the opportunity and the answer is no so one of the really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually funded through thee through the bushfire recovery it 's funded through the through the covert stimulus package so what we 're really hoping is that by giving up this money and paying and including you know the people who have already put in fences back paying those what we 're trying to do is have a bit of a cash stimulus into rural economies that will help keep employment and keep cash moving around the communities so yep say so for those that have already put up the fences please apply and you you will still be just as eligible as those that have not yet applied I guess one of the really important things and you know the most important thing from tonight is is if you haven 't already please register yeah those details are in the chat box but to go through them quickly there is on our website at the which is WWll SEO NSW govt a you slash fencing or the phone number is one three hundred double seven eight zero eight zero or probably repeat them a few times once you 've register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch with you personally either by phone or email and and make contact tickets to give no idea about what your needs are and antone distances for those that might have already been through that process hopefully we understand that everyone has been contacted but if you haven 't please just give that phone number a call again will make sure someone gets back to you in touch with you once you 're in the system it can take a little bit of time and and I guess part of the reason for that is is that we local Land Services is doing all that negotiation on your behalf with the agency say sometimes there 's a little little bit of back and back and forth but we are taking care of that and and for that reason it can be a little bit slow plus the good news is at the moment we 've got lots of people registered which is keeping our staff really busy once you once you do that there is a contract that you 'll need to sign to receive those funds and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working days of that contract being paid return signs so again we just want to give that money as quick as possible in fact of that 200 odd million dollars across the state we 're hoping to get 19 million out of a dis financial year which is which is a bit of a stretch but we want to get it out flowing ASAP the the deadlines are important so this is this is not just for this financial year I hesitate giving the date but the deadline to have registered for this program is 30th of June 2021 so over a year away obviously you know we would rather give you that money sooner rather than later so really encourage you not to not to drag on out and to apply as soon as possible but you have got a bit of time and so don 't at the same time we don 't want you feeling rushed into it because there is time and there isn 't it there is an expectation that the fence itself will have been constructed before the 31st of December um 2021 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually get the get fences installed so we hope that time frame gives people time to you know not feel rushed but if you 're ready to go we really help you now a couple of little things I guess about it just just to give you some context there 's been over 800 now applications received in the southeast area but only around 60 of them are on the Monaro so really encouraging people online tonight people watching later yourself to to register but also talk to your neighbors talk to other people you might know that might be affected because we don 't want there to be anyone to miss out we want everyone to to receive some of this funding to assist with the with those boundary fences look although I guess I just want to acknowledge that there are other fences out there in including all the internal fences on a property and private property neighbouring fences and this program does not assist those so there right there is a lot of other assistance available and a whole bunch of those links have been going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to incur to engage with the story Manero recovery team through Andrea Forsyth and her team but the other one is to come in to come in touch with in the rural assistance authority or the real financial counseling service both which can point you in lots of directions and then and in you know service New South Wales because acknowledging that not everyone that was far affected he is a probably produced that say so yep got quite quite aware of that and there are lots of pathways but your first port of call on your best conduct will be the sort of narrow recovery committee okay so I cover a young team look I could go on for a long time but but given that we 're trying to give us a generalist information and really trying to encourage you to then come back and engage with us directly I 'll get those details once more the website is www.martialartsnc.com you Thank You brick Anthony Richard and Luke and thank you Luke for the acknowledgement country of something I forgot about apologize for all alum we 're now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the questions that if we have any in the question and answer box online and then we 'll link to those on the chat room reminder please be patient if the technology breaks down just hang in there and we 'll fix it as soon as we can Andrea will be taking notes from the questions and I 'll ask Andrea to have a look and see what questions we happened refer to the presenters thank you thank you Peter so this is a question for you Luke what it 's come in with winter almost upon us and the cold conditions will disappear program at all the know the cold conditions won 't affect us at all and may effects on people 's willingness to be out fencing but that 's okay you you 've got as much time as you need until the 31st of December 2021 to to make sure that fish is done thank you Luke I think you 're going to be popular tonight it 's another question for you will our local land holders get to deal with the local LLS staff member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look the when people ring up that one three hundred numbers I 've given out they could be speak those though we speaking someone in real estate because this is a statewide project but that 's just the first step that 's just to register when it comes to negotiating the contract so negotiating that what the fence looks like yeah absolutely that 's a bet to local we 've got three people on the Monaro in local Land Services working on it and I think a total of fifteen in the southeast say absolutely you 'll be dealing with the local Thank You Luke and guess what another question for you this is in relation to place a the question is how do you work in with blazeit in this situation yeah another really good question and and really want to acknowledge the volunteers in in place I doing a fantastic job look this doesn 't affect that so more than happy for you to be getting volunteer assistance from from Blais aid as well as the the financial contribution from from this audio neighbors program and that includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the assistance of ways aid it 's just still eligible we want to get that cash flowing Thank You Luke this is probably a question for me so I 'll ask myself the question is can the recovery team help yes we can certainly if people want to talk to us about the program we 're very much in contact with Luca and local Land Services so please feel free to talk to local recovery officers we can provide you with assistance and details and we can also make a referral for you so it 's now for me to ask are there more questions that people would like to raise at this particular point I suspect the panelists have done a fantastic job in giving everyone sufficient information no doubt there may be questions that people think off later that 's perfectly fine please remember you can contact local Land Services or the recovery team please don 't hesitate to call us so with that I might actually hand back to Peter via um sorry Curtis you 've dropped us for one moment I apologize for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is is blaze a still operating yes they are they have a team still based at red bow and another one bombuh Thank You Luke the questions Andrea I believe so okay well once again I would like to thank our guests for attending and thank you for making the effort don 't forget we you can call our recovery team which is 1300 three-four-five 1300 and counsel is here to help as much as we possibly can if there 's no further questions or light questions I will this go to close this meeting thank you for attending thank you everyone"

    "text": "hello my name is Alex Adkins and I 'm the senior stirrer he land use planner it 's named and arrow Regional Council so I 'm just going to take you through a community presentation on the draft local strategic planning statement so what is an LSPs an LSPs so a local strategic planning statement is required under the environmental planning and assessment act section three point nine and it 's an overarching strategic document for the region it gives effect to our regional plan which as the southeastern table and regional plan and must have regard for community community strategic plan the document has to set out the planning priorities for the region and it must also have actions and and indicators to monitor the implementation of the document so it can 't just be a document which sits on the shelf it has to actually have that implementation aspect as well most of us found in Appendix A attached to the document so in terms of the overarching sort of New South Wales strategic planning hierarchy we 've got the state documents and other sort of statewide strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regional plan in this instance and then the local strategic planning statement which is all like all sort of overarching strategic planning for the Snowman arrow there our strategy documents and then later on we 'll come the local momentum plan and development control plan which are our implementation documents up until recently there hasn 't been there 's been a missing link with local local strategic planning in terms of this hasn 't been required but other councils have previously done that and it 's very important in showing that line of sight from a statewide strategic document down to the local level so in terms of our internal process about this time last year we put out a discussion paper and we had a preliminary consultation session where we took on board a number of different thoughts throughout the region on a whole range of local plant as strategic planning issues and now we 've come up with this local strategic planning statement which will be our overarching document so that 's where we are at the moment and then on from there we 'll be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rural land use strategy and then those implementation documents with the like local environmental plan DCP development contributions plan to come later so what is the purpose of this presentation it 's just to give a brief overview of the LSPs what the planning priorities are an overview of what that means in the local context and an overview of the actions and implementation process so we 've got the draft 20-year vision I won 't go through that you can have a read of that and see if it reflects the region it 's been very difficult to capture such a wide and diverse region into a short concise statement but I think this goes a long way to showing what sort of the key priorities after the region and an overall vision of what things could be like in the next 20 years so in terms of the planning priorities so we 've come up with four key themes in our framing economy vibrant places to live work and place its social aspects infrastructure to support growth and change and a sustainable environment with a library connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural environment and yeah built heritage aspects and that these themes also align with the community strategic plan and the themes in the southeast regional plan so a planning priority one is very much focused on promoting growing and protecting agricultural land so we 're looking at protecting primary agricultural land from future threats whether those be weeds land fragmentation and those sort of aspects work out where our core sort of productive agricultural lands are and how we can improve productivity of the more marginal agricultural land so planning priority two focuses more on maximizing the efficiency and growth of business over the coming years so as you can see in this graph on the side by employment accommodation and food services is by far our largest employer followed by agriculture forestry and fishing fishing so how can we make sort of the economy more diverse into the future and have a bit less of a reliance just on one industry sector for employment and as you can see well across the region it varies quite significantly there are a number of large employers in different sectors so and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of agriculture forestry and fishing and accommodation and food services so just looking at ways that we can maximize that growth through our land use planning controllers into the future and now some sort of council will priorities on the side there which are outlined in the document so planning priority three is support the development of the snow mountains as Australia 's premier year-round alpine destination and this is really focused on growing tourism all year round as opposed to just currently it being focused on the winter peak across those three months and it 's really working with the New South Wales Government on their special activation precinct and have those sort of aspects including they can improving the connections up to the mountains working with other potential tourism sectors and growing things like Agri tourism and those sort of aspects which could be a big growth industry into the future as tourism it is our largest industry by employment agriculture second while just trying to get those two to work together a bit more through an agritourism type thing is certainly a focus of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a diverse region this really came out of that preliminary consultation we had about this time last year in that the region is so diverse and there 's so many different aspects to it that a one-size-fits-all approach across the region just clearly isn 't kind of work there needs to be different approaches to land use across the region depending on different drivers whether those be potential future industry current industries lifestyle factors landscape existing constraints whatever they they may be just an evidence-based approach towards different land use planning and the potential future industries and current industries are obviously collective this across the region whether it 's jindabyne which very much has a tourism focus currently kimura 's more your business and administration bombard was very much agriculture forestry and the camper corridor especially Michael I go in those northern sections or Smith 's Road are very much influenced by Canberra so planning priority 5 is provide a variety of housing options throughout the Snowman arrow and this is really to respond to changing demands in housing so as you can see in this graph it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of average age by 2036 the younger age groups getting less of overall percentage share in the population and the older age groups are increasing in terms of their populations share particularly that over 65 age group this is likely to require different types of housing into the future of more focus on Aging in Place options also the average size of households likely to change quite dramatically and an increase in particular Lane person households into the future is likely to require more smaller dwellings on the flip side of that is a lot of people move to the region for that lifestyle change and in terms of having more space for a family to grow and we want to encourage that as well so having well-planned rural residential communities into the future is very important as well so it 's very much about providing a variety of different houses in weather from medium density and townhouses and terrace houses dual occupancies detached sort of single dwellings on urban blocks through to rural residential and larger blocks of a few acres or hectares for people so planning priority sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right types and level of development and this is very much focused on protecting our key transport links into the future and better connecting us with other areas whether that 's upgrades and certain main arterial roads or other regional routes connecting those sort of freight groups whether they be down east gippsland in camera or down the south coast and potential pressures which will come on the snow mountains highway we 've Snowy 2.0 and those sort of aspects but also encouraging more active transport infrastructure in the townships people particularly live and work in a1 Township might be more inclined to walk to work if that infrastructure is in place and whether there 's better ways to connect nationally through whether it 's a snowy mountains Airport Canberra International Airport and internationally with their so planning priority 7 is foster resilient enduring and safe communities using land use planning controls which address of local and regional natural hazards so a recent one is obviously the bush fires which are very much in people 's minds and coming up with better ways to respond to bush fires through land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately mapping bushfire risk or whether that 's through the new planning for bushfire protection measures consider floodplain risk management in land-use planning decision-making so getting flood risk management plans in place for all of our townships is of a high priority so we understand the risk regarding that buried out flooded recently so the risk is ever-present in terms of flooding up just push fire drought is another natural significant natural hazard we 've had quite a prolonged drought here and working out ways to be more resilient to that in future and better prepared for those sort of events which are likely to come more prevalent into the future no planning priority 8 is capitalized on growth and change by preparing you from a new business and population so this is very much about planning for future growth scenarios whether they 're sort of a low growth scenario and main growth scenario most likely to happen or a high growth scenario so if suddenly a lot of people want to move here for some sort of reason making sure that infrastructure is in place for them whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the infrastructure we have can actually provide for any future greater scenario and also actively pursuing further business investment so there 's the jobs to employ people who do come to seek it lifestyle here so planning priority 9 is protecting enhance the cultural and built heritage of the snowy Manero so this is very important we have a number of areas which are very high cultural and built heritage value so whether that 's the important sort of indigenous cultural sites that we have across the region and getting a better understanding of what those are all the European built heritage that we see in many of the towns and villages across the region so planning priority 10 is protecting enhance the scenic landscape of the region this was again something we heard very strongly in the community consultation that people wanted that scenic landscape to be protected into the future so working out how best to do that through planning controls whether scenic protection areas and coming up with policy decisions about large-scale renewable energy projects so we 've got those in the right location act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have weeds and biosecurity risks and providing ways to enhance a sort of scenic landscape across the region and provide for the number of tourists who drive through who expect to see that rural landscape when they drive throughout the region so playing priority 11 is identify protect and encourage the restoration of specific areas of environmental values in snowy Manero region so as you can see from this map on the right hand side there this is just showing can 't really necessarily see the key but it 's just showing all areas of sort of high environmental value of its heritage value or natural environmental values and threatened entities or native vegetation and that 's just showing how many values we have all across the region and it 's important to protect and restore those into the future and do so in sort of manageable land use controls so wherever that 's true land zoning in environmental protection zones or whether that 's through environmental biodiversity overlays and that sort of thing but also protecting waterways and riparian corridors as well which is very important for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecological communities and finally planning priority 12 which has moved towards a carbon neutral future and this is really stimulated from the state government 's move to what 's being carbon neutral by 2050 so over on the right-hand side there you 've got a outline of what our missions are on a local level and this is just carbon emissions but you can see a lots taken up by agriculture obviously being and primarily an agricultural area that 's no real surprise but that 's also an important industry to protect so ways to make that more efficient perhaps through regenerative agriculture a gray forestry and those sort of things to offset potential carbon input there orange there it 's not shown but it 's transported missions so anyways to bring those down true move to what 's new technology whether that 's electric vehicles or more active transport in urban areas into the future but there 's also a lot the council can do internally so look at ways that it can be more efficient and less into the future just through smart commercial decisions whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council buildings so just on a local perspective we 've got in the document outline two key things for the key towns local narratives and character statements for all the towns and the villages outlines maintain it hearts and change so that 's focused on the character for the villages and towns and it 'd be really interesting to hear from the community wherever we 've got those right or whether there 's more aspects that you 'd like to see in those maintain enhance or change over the next 20 years for your local town or village relevant actions driven by the planning priorities all of those actions and implementation aspects and indicative Maps about potentially what that could look like on a local level in the next 20 years so the key themes for the five main towns kimura is the business and services hub jindabyne it 's a tourism hub Bambara is a rural industries hub buried our lifestyle hub and Mickey Lego is a leadership in sustainability and innovation so this map here just outlines the a key sub regions in terms of the rural lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there with Mikkel a yo and Brett Bo and that 's sort of the area just focused on the Monaro highway heavily influenced by Canberra easy access to Canberra women and now it was drivers central Canberra be the eastern valleys area which is just this area which sits in sort of up from just east of Newman well all the way up through that area places which have a very high primary production value as well as being quite scenic not as a successful to Canberra Canberra still has an influence on those areas Kumar which the Monaro which is characterized particularly by the high soil fertility in that area is shown by that beige color on the map BOM Bala again high soil fertility but also quite large areas of State Forest obviously contributes to its forestry and agricultural industry which has been impacted by the fires but why if they recover into the future jindabyne which is this area here again heavily influenced by tourism and where for its agricultural lands can come more productive through Agri tourism and those sort of industries it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body 's range there you can beam just there at a minute beam you can beam this wraps around you can beam there different soil was from the kinder buying and the Monaro and slightly higher elevation through that region so in H the Murrumbidgee mountains area which is just this area north of the AC so in terms of the actions and implementation there are over 80 action strategic actions throughout the LSPs these are all listed in the appendix a and also how they can be implemented so that 's through the timeframe where they 've been funded or not they connection to the delivery plan that council has and their connection to other strategic documents and also indicators for whether they have been successfully implemented and to make it easier in terms of reporting that back to Council so in terms of next steps so any comments or ideas that you want to send us we 'll be taking on board and will be rolled into the final document and that will eventually then go on to the more detailed land-use plan planning strategies which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of land use control was in the LEP and the DCP so that it a detailed settlement strategy and rule and your strategy will be placed on public exhibition later this year and that 'll be another opportunity for you to provide comments and feedback so thank you for listening to this presentation there 's a survey at the bottom of this your so page and if you want to make a submission please do so in writing before 6 p.m. all submissions should be addressed to the general manager and sent wire the email of the council at email address or by August thank you very much [Music]"

    "text": "okay hi everyone I 'm Aaron and I work at kuma library and I 'm here today to do some crafts with you for the school holiday program so today we 're gonna make some foil drawings and it could look like something like this but it doesn 't have to you can make your own like designs if you want you can make an underwater scene if you want like with octopus and fish or you can make trees or houses but I 've chose a flower for today so that 's what we 're gonna do so what you 'll need today is like some pieces of plywood if you have or maybe a little canvas or some cardboard but a pretty sturdy stuff so anything like that you need a pencil you need some cotton swabs glue stick some aluminium foil and some glue it 's sort of tacky glue and some shoe polish and at the end you need some tissues as well or some rugs if you have any it 's making your design on your piece of plywood so you just get your pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plywood so I 've already done this and I 've made a flower so I make it like really simple don 't make X really difficult shapes or anything like that just keep it really simple so when you 've done that you get your glue you just you just follow the lines the outlines of what you 've drawn so you go then you can see it 's nice and thick and that 's how it 's supposed to be so you do all your lines like that so it doesn 't really matter if they touch or if you have like little drops that fall on your plywood it doesn 't really matter so you go all the way around and do all the leaves and everything else until you 've done your whole design and now comes the hard bed because you have to let your glue dry for probably about overnight so if you do it late in the afternoon you just put it away on them on a warm spot and let the glue dry and when you do that the next day it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel all the bubbles where the glue has been and that 's exactly how you want it so now what we 're gonna do is you have your piece of foil now there 's two ways to do this you grab your glue stick and you can glue all over your design on your plywood like all around or you can do it on your foil I personally find it easier on your plywood because your fall might wrinkle so what you do oh my my glasses on for this one say you just go and put the glue over the top it doesn 't matter if it 's got a little bit like bubbles in it because it 's sort of adds to your picture okay so your glue everywhere there you go we 've done that you gently you have your piece of aluminium foil and you 're gonna put it over the top and then you just press really carefully so just like that so you see the outline of your little piece of plywood and you can feel like all the bubbles from the glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so now when you 've done it rough like put it on roughly you take your little little cotton swab you can go along all the edges of your outline and make it a little bit more stand out just do it gently because if you do it really roughly your aluminium for my break so so you got all around the edges so you can see how it sort of looks a little bit more profound now then you see the outlines so you can do the whole thing like that I 'm not going to do all of it at the moment and I can take a while he 's depending on how big your design is okay so when you 've done all of him you can put the foil and fold it over on the edges so you can cut it off but I 've made it look a little bit nicer there we go now you can see your design coming through look and to make a little bit more like you can use your pencil to make see you can see little scribbles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the outlines of your flower or your design you can even make different little shapes and on your on your design to make it a bit more interesting but you don 't have to if you if you 're happy with what it is like you can leave it like that and it 's the last bit what you can do if you can get a piece of paper towel and a little bit of shoe polish if I can open a lid I only need a tiny bit of this so you can do a little bit on your piece of paper and go let 's see if you can get a bit of so you see like a little bit of the black ball come on you 're onto your design so this high akin you don 't have to do this ADA if you if you 're happy with what you did before but it has the legal outlines stand out a little bit more so there 's all different things you can do and you can make them as big as she wants as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you make a bigger one you might have to be sure that it doesn 't get bigger than the outline of your aluminium foil so you can make a little like a long one but don 't make it any wider than that or you get a line of your aluminum foil in the middle and it doesn 't look so good so and that 's the end result what I did with all the black comments so that 's what they can look like when you 're finished so I hope you can make one as well if you like doing one and feel free to share with the library if you want to make a comment on Facebook and you have made one just show us a picture they 'll be really good I hope you enjoy thank you see you later [Music]"

we have a series of recovery committees and subcommittees to look at particular areas around its health and well-being and it will an Ag business and tourism and waste and infrastructure so just so you know that these conversations are happening in the track forward day services to be distributed to the area so the office owners across New South Wales so these fliers have been burning since September in some cases earlier and obviously they 're still going today so we are acutely aware or what 's happening all across the state trying to coordinate with what kind of funding channels can be released and that 's everything we do today afternoon come talk to me back basically anything plugged into two things okay my name is Susan and this is Jude we 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services from the office actually sees people who are not insured so if you know anybody is not insured and they need some assistance we are also filled with information for people who are in truth about cleaner and those types of things anything to do with the actual fire so we 're staying tuned for a while some information here but actually tells you about our program and also put another sheet that actually gives you all of the numbers for all of these systems but you can get clean up I 'll be here to start and wanting to share these things do provide you with you and I 'm jingeos be on with the ruling program or rec wiki suppose health and we normally come in the recovery phase not just about yourself but other people you might be worried about children with primary emotional financial so there 's a small disagreement about small business and family reduces I know that we 're looking for more than happy to talk to anyone which I was people in the galaxy were seeing real financial counselors and in bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that office so there 's a good chance to get in there and talk to people yeah all you have in assistance going down from the front yeah this is all chiming rapidly I 'm going to apologize but print it up on yesterday it was the my stuff tonight minor I bet she grabbed the wrong one I thought we needed to do play in that food speak I mean I 'm being we go far beyond the officer tied the boys here payment period almost sounded like illiteracy management also on we 've been working so we 're filling the slack working weekends and going every day that the evacuation center is open and to support people [Music] we have their places of residence whether that 's there my holes our interest within Enys I 've been helping Georgia prices [Music] just to acknowledge that we still got active fires this is an ideal time for a meeting with knowledge that but this is the first of several levels that will be happening in this area and other areas system a I said we 've already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ba ba ba will be ongoing meetings and ongoing well we are comment that often the model for recovery is incident in moving straight into recovery we have more of a hybrid scenario at the moment where we have really active fires but we 've also had people that need assistance can you in terms of what we 're doing internally to make sure that we have the resources to support people appointed a local recovery officers angry to my right ear angry insurance background we appointed assistant recovery officer that we working the bar bar office and will be appointing a secondary officer assistant recovery officer and we 'll move on that way the role of the recovery officer is to assist you to do access to the grants make sure you have the information so you can get access into all these government agencies and don 't forget that there is also four streams of funding out of the year as well so real properties of many businesses so that 's it this is the first of several of these things in Ambala we had a meeting last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 're ramping up yes the local recovery officer Benina not chill my role is to help facilitate the introduction really I 'll try to make it simple is what 's happening as we heard it seems a changing very quickly and it 's very confusing what boy wait that I 'd like you to have my sheet but again I 'll be around really welcome chatting with you to see what I can do any major issues obviously please elevate them to me so we 've paid we need weight ability to structure so that you 'll have a particular contact point area which any people [Music] who would like one of the couplet issues dr. rice is many of us take it off believes the source was sustained trains basically style stupid it claimed an archive for this plane as many taxes we can everybody aware presence in the region testing and would easily so what 's happening on water as well we learnt the hard way as well that they do have to clean all your down pipes thoroughly just stick them for your tanks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the same problem he 'll start all over again and the second thing is so we 've had that service he 's not here now but was they do a fantastic job and they sucked everything out that 's the good news the bad news is the ash is so thick in most of the tanks the sludge the whole box quite coming out so sudden that we lost like 13,000 liters of warning yesterday that 's the bad news the good news is the army get coming in and they gave us five thousand liters my question is five thousand liters doesn 't go very far and that 's part of the war so is there any plan to get any more water or can we buy more water that 's the that 's the question into the 5,000 good thing we had a massive need so we made the decision right wrongly that we were trying people 5,000 to everyone first from on the basis that we recognize that doesn 't go very far so their plan but we 're trying to meet everybody 's needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army recommended the 5,000 that household would be the best way to go so I guess stay tuned one of the issues which I can 't answer with the ongoing fire activity I hear you concern to get everything clean so what 's the best way to manage it I have to be honest thank you let 's hold the mic we happily executed right row and then that off the minute now me shut up I did an amazing job getting into [Music] any further questions on the water and tanks any more questions just one comment in the national subject where we still have active fires the coordination of this is I just but I still feel well I used we have any more on the trees or any other who else has got a question over the subject that we should and then to where we 're at with that council works with patience possibly patience in this region the dilemma that we 've got particularly here in that would be so there is a and the it 's the flag to me by many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the issues that we 've had is we probably made a safer environment before we can get paid so it 's frustrating on I understand that people would like to get back to normal and unfortunately weight living in extraordinary common guys very different situation so it will happen but I just have to say I 'm sorry bear with us the conditions are right to far away but what we need to do and this is where I talk to the Army is a little bit creative about what they need and they can obviously there can be this and I guess hence this and the travel distance but if we can work something out and that 's what we all trying to do just said you 're very grateful for the assistance because really fantastic and it 's on understand talking to which gives you an idea of the sky yeah it 's a volunteer organization and I 'm not quite sure I call the brain nomads I don 't know whether that 's great but they 're retired people we like to travel around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place a is an organization that has been set up to help people in this situation people have been in fence so what happens is the council works with them to establish a campsite and then these individuals once they receive the information of which property what 's required contact the owner oh I 'll just make a few comments of that belies their strict spin what gets Tiffany mixing their 23 cams go across the style of moment they 're short on resources whatever what typically happens is they go a Jane will go in and in that term they 've got long slices and the West one person that actually know that 's some really good knowledge of Rena fancy they have their own public liability and I do a fantastic job so it is a responsibility of the people where they want to finally be gone to this of water materials so glad I 'm not coming in for thanks off news you still need to have your own materials I think if a property needs cleaning like there might be trees I don 't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task of clearing that boost then it 's another question my name 's Stuart virgin on business but I 'm also president of the local fire brigade that 's that 's typically a non-operational government sting we 're very conscious of the fact that fathers have been spent countless days by the fires often at their own cost of their own expense and so what people we 've been racing with services you South Wales because as people would be aware those people who are self-employed such as far as contractors or whatever else can actually seek funding from me to service New South Wales up to the order of two hundred dollars that they 've done something like 30 days after 6,000 if I had sort of hope that somebody from services and Wales was going to be here today but they 're not but nevertheless we have been constant contact with them the application is very very straightforward all you really require us to sources of identification and what we found yesterday what a girl was sharing with which is the secretary one of the issues is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you 're a married woman done well happily the birth certificate if your marriage is because of people won 't tell you so you 're drinking and driver 's license anything one thing I do share that with you so what we 've decided to do every afternoon now five o 'clock in the afternoon with myself or my car or car or came out of the fire ship will join the aged with push firefighters who as you can see today they 're all that fighting fires they 're not here but most of those people are so dedicated and passionate about the fighting fires what they don 't do is they don 't put in the paperwork to get rid of you narrator for the work that they 're doing so we 're going to make that process easier so as I said Monica process three applications online some people don 't want to do it online will actually fill out the forms with them in the fire ship so I just thought that you know that that 's what we 've decided to do every afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't firefighters fill out the forms then that way I should point out the first ten days you don 't get paid for but every other such a good day you will get but I know people such as Terry Meyers of the world of property premiums 60 days who 's too narrow but the point of that is where we are very conscious about the fact that firefighters have to get paid for the work they 're putting in because it 's out-of-pocket and they all have responsibilities like Buster 's the other thing people also want to just hear further is to be conscious of the fact that that assistance is available to firefighters so if you 're only going to go down to the five shed most days in fact every day to see that there are campus a number of people who are working in a support role they 're not fighting fires but they 're also playing a vital role and I 'm very conscious on we 're going to pursue the fact that we 're hoping that people in a support role will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you know yes [Music] the answer to the idea my driving force around that when the trucks clear the audience and stuff yes explain something since the idea who started working in the Emergency Operations Center we 've been we 've been putting in the tasks that we need to be done Joey what done we put in an application that goes to see they get allocated tosses or the girl order by deity APL the other danger was taken I US defense even County officer this is a similar process we need to know what you made doc done doesn 't matter if you think it 's different or silly or anything what should they do is put something through the angel of jobs which possible things you think they 've done then we can through the Emergency Management Committee and we angel we can put those requests in that have those tasks for an eagle those jobs done without knowing what you want done we can 't get it done so we 've done numerous teams over the time from at the moment if s leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrives at a block that we need to get access and for the trees now there 's that we can talk we can get those tasks with those resources to do it opening up his mind to writers that have been actively doing that they are using the I am doing the watertight employers doing everything there 's other resources that are coming from the state government too sisty just with with our other tasks so unless we know what you want done in this we 've helped advise the things that you they w properties or things are mostly we can 't become action on so they so if you send them through the angelator team okay I 'm actually if they need to come back to the Emergency Management Center Operations Center where we can we can action as part of that because the recovery is still part about of the other leads and that 's occurring so this still comes under my control of my my energy management team up there so that we toss them out so that 's that simplifies the prices then angel amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions you 'll do the stuff that you will screen back to me and we 'll get it done through through what resources with what we still got activist surrounding your whole community right there are probably but what we can get down and what we can 't ask it down to Mike North a secret one that we really very very lucky that everybody every job between poor I think 98% of us have been task at the idea and we 've been getting done with some stage here so so we were pretty lucky so that 's just a pencil but this way they have met more time some of the quick she asked to you need to know you tell us what you want with we 're creating the registers so when the information comes in then we 'll be able to see what the needs are all row clearing in a particular area for water in a particular area and it 's making the best use of the idea of resources that 's what they have asked us to do which is fair enough so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I most likely when I set up the register will be an alternate email address that 's monitored by an assistant that will be working with me one to clean up so if you registered through cleanup yes that oh we not movie coming by the government so when you do have insurance just be aware that cost of your wish my tactic premises is cut by the government well you better see yourself with service New South Wales and Chuck Holly encourage everyone to do regardless of your situation you get a food you talk you through it where your property has been assessed by a assessment team and affirm that your property is date disturbing of all entities Public Works advisory will be organizing contractors local contractors to do the cleanup for you so what the best of doing that is a long process probably works advisory it 's called out to tender and the d 'Avignon secret contractors for each area its we 're talking scallop two thousand two hundred copies across this day so it will be it will take some time so just be mindful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MA and that the other side give you some updates on timeframes if you do want to update keep working with the estimation process will be best either 302 I are the mitochondria reestablish there 's more to do yesterday coming back from Prescott there was portals for vehicles dating up they arrived originally saying that their Christie I think some nutrition if we need to be did with twenty it 'll mean to get those those services reestablished it 's not a simple process it 's not a quick process because it 's all really really stable looking at that so we can give them get back in we don 't know about their services so you need to sort of the angel registers you 'll pass it on to us and then what we can say what we do what you might be one of a number of people that impacted in that area then might be able to get some priority priority and get it done we think we know so this all comes the answer with the snow what 's going on what 's happening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that 's the situation two people [Music] what 's tomorrow I 've got the one in Poland I am then in touch with broadcast Estrella now ask but then you touch with the NABC the ACMs I know [Music] I 'm sorry when you to welcome them that he 's fairly into only shine kansai gaidai and many of you want to take the opportunity to cite water please they super came to say hello and make communities that have been affected by so I like the opportunity please you don 't really interrupt you much of you maybe we understand this really important information that they want to make I think it 's been the festering sore this community ever since Americans are in 2000 they might mean it is absolutely shameful of one of the one of the byproducts or one of the one of the recommendations from this community of the urban fire was the need for that much better mobile phone reception we identified and I wasn 't privy to it but certainly Brian and a number of people here who have far more depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than prove that the best location where that the amount over hour or up on top of the hangman sites were identified which had coverage to the coast and the Lakeview convene where do they place it on a pokey little hill on the edge of mirror and I think clean up and the council if we do nothing this is not the appropriate time little place but I think once we get we can we sit down and do an analysis of this file what worked what didn 't work surely the council will be proactive and saying we need better mobile phone coverage for safety reasons the no other reason if somebody dies because of lack of mobile phone coverage somebody has to be held responsible Rockley of the state and federal government data I say state government also has a vital role in addressing us we have cell phone in the corner here is Titan the matter of Rick guys it 's probably the single most important assets and utilities that unique journey an event and obviously or you 're going to anyway when you go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really growing or representative off this meeting just coming to chat with me Oh need some details address this the agencies to see me down a pretty get super gifted for a few minutes"

    "text": "now we had our two stories and we 're gonna do some crafts and we 've chosen to make a snake craft because the serpent is quite important in the indigenous storytelling so we got one of those that were gonna make for you and then you can make your own of course and then we got another one that is made from wool and we show you a bit later how to do that one there is and then we cook the templates that we can use you can download them from our website and we 've got two different ones oops where is it and that one or you can draw your own snake of course as well like your fare to do whatever you like to do and then we 'll show you how to do all of this art in a minute okay what we do with your snake you just make put a snake put the colors in any way you want we call different materials you can use crayons or textures you can do it with paints anything you like just make him really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many colors you use and how look at that one that 's called a lots of colors so it takes a long time to do now maybe if you have seen a snake in real life and see what colors they are maybe they called really nice colors I just don 't buy too close to have a look there no definitely not snakes can be dangerous oh when you 're all done you get some scissors and I have to cut all around the snake and all around the line so you can do the outside first and just follow keep following the line good day see ya you go round and round and round so now we got a little hole puncher maybe you cook one at home or you can just see if your mom can do and make a little hole in the top it 's a tail yeah I probably ate the tail works best or there 's not very big and you just put a little bit of string string and of course you can make them really big as well if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big snake okay very beautiful well trying to make a snake we fool and this is called finger mating we use our fingers to twirl the the twine around of the wool around our fingers and it might look a little bit complicated in the beginning so maybe have to watch the video over and over again until you get it so you start with the two fingers first so put one two three four five and you used to one here in the middle and we 'll start wrapping and I 'll take two colors because he makes a nice pattern on the snake and you just go around it 's a bit like weaving and you go around and around until you have 2 loops you 're always looking for two rings on your fingers now and even if we increase with two fingers afterwards when you have two on each fingers you just wrap it around as many times like either just it until you have two rings and you take the bottom to put it on the over the top you take the bottom T and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a top and be back now I 've got one loop with two colors I 'll throw them around you 're going sort of round the net eight-figure until it got to you again you take the bottom T and just put them over your fingers at the top inside as well and I 've got one again so take the wool just go around in an eight-figure until they 've got two again at the bottom one on the top put it over the top it 's a bit of a talk at the end you can see now our snake is slowly growing it 's nice the thing is that you don 't need any materials like only a little bit of wool and if you make a mistake it doesn 't really really matter because of the two colors you have it won 't show up too much in the pattern so you can keep going and going and going until you have the length of the snake you want you can have a very short stick or you can make a long snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is skinny and then he has a fat head so to make that fact hit we have to use now or two next fingers for next to it so instead of just twirling around those two fingers we 've just gonna go and use these fingers to enthrall around and it 's like weaving we go up and down and up and down and up and down until we have one T one T one two three one two not quite sure what happened here but okay don 't worry about it Stoney 's supposed to be too you can put your loops over one doesn 't really matter I 'm just gonna no put that at the back is this one over you always have to talk at the back now go I weave now under over under over under over under until have one two one two one two one two take the bottom put it on the top we just talk and I go again under over under over under over under over and they got one two one two one two one two you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't need to hate to be too big I 'll go just once more and so we don 't end up with a sort of a triangle a fact hate we need to make it skinny again in the front so at the moment we 've got four loops so we 're just gonna take this loop and put it on that finger and okay take this loop and putting on that finger and now you 've got two and what we do already have two we take the bottom one put it over the top to bottom on and put it over the top let me continue to just make the nose of the snake meet like to and to really finish up to make the tip of the nose are you going era I 'm very messy that 's okay look him stretch it at the end of it stretches now I would take one loop and put it over the other finger so we got two again I 'll take the bottom one put it over the top and then we sort of have like a loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull it through so it doesn 't unravel and now if you put it pull it a bit into shape it 's got a very short snake with the head shape the very short body put eyes on it and you can always put a red tongue on it or you can make it a tiny skinny snake but you just make knots at the end to make my snake a little bit longer it looks like a snake I like little snake it 's exactly a baby snake and if you have some googly eye you can just stick them on and if you would like to learn it then it goes old too hard you can always come to the library and ask Kira how to do it sure good I hope you like your art and your crafts and hopefully you can make one for a year for yourself and show us what you 've done we would like to know and we 'll see you next time [Music]"

    "text": "hi welcome back to snowy monaro Regional Library and today in our craft session we 're going to make snowy owls I have my book of birds here by Geraldo Valerio and we 're going to read a little bit about the snowy owl the verbose candy acres each huge owls nest on the Arctic tundra in years where there is plenty of prey they may lay up to a dozen eggs lots of eggs the baby owls have soft white feathers when they hatch but they soon turn a blackish gray both parents look after their young and bravely drive away arctic foxes wolves and other predators okay we 're going to make our own snowy owls today using cotton wool and glue and paper and trip by tracing our handprints and googly eyes and textures so just all things that you have would have at home or that you can buy cheaply okay so let 's get started so the first thing you need to start with is the AL template I have the link to this on our Facebook page for you to download and print and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can buy cheaply or if you don 't have those you can just make two round eyes with paper and drawing them on yourself then you need textures okay I 've used blue and orange or you can use other similar colors it 's up to you then you need another piece of white paper to trace your handprint for the Owls wings need a pencil and we trace around a hand just like this nice and simple doesn 't matter if it 's not perfectly neat because we will need an end up later ok so one hand and then the other hand and then we 're going to cut them out let me cut out all the pieces of the owls body and the Owls body the beak the eyes I 'm going to put the googly eyes on those and we 've got but the two claws here okay do some coloring and some gluing of cotton wool on the body so the eyes we 're going to color in blue the beak we 're going to color in orange the claws we 're also going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glue cotton wool on ok so we start by putting glue around the edges like this can we get our cotton bud cotton wool ball sorry cotton wool balls and we just pull them apart a bit so that they 're nice and soft and fluffy and then we gently place them where the glue is then we just keep going with more glue and more cotton balls seem nice and fluffy fluffy snowy owl we need to put cotton wool on our handprint so it 's the same process as the our body we put glue on the fingers and then we get our cotton wool ball stretch it out this one we have to go stretch out even further because the fingers are a bit skinny so I 've got to make the cotton will fit along those skinny finger bits there and then down into the hand bit okay so now that we 've got cotton wool on both our wings our finger print hand print three our wings we can put the out together so the way we do that is we glue the owl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue on the body here like this and we press down press out our wings wings on press down firmly so the glue will stick then we can glue our eyes on and some glue around the edge of the eye as well to make sure that they stick and to have a bit of glue in the middle dab a bit of glue in the middle there for the googly eyes for the AL and remember you can draw your own eyes on there if you 're not able to find any googly eyes for the beak just a dab of glue as well triangle nose down there just sits just under the eyes and then the claws okay because this is the Zephyr that the snowy owl is sitting on a branch their claw is going around a branch yeah well yeah there you go beautiful and here we have our completed snowy owl [Music]"

room just raise your hand please if we do well we have some type ones as well I can 't read them so one of the questions that came through I 'm what if I 'm no longer a resident of the format O 'Jays but I 'm still connected to one of the communities and have an event idea that will benefit a community in the former ljx I would say that would be you that 's acceptable because it is still happening within the community and basically that would be part of the one of the issues that we 'd have to consider but I love my view and it 's only my view would be if it concern if it benefits the community it would be on the list for me consideration should be considered the next question is how much is the total fund ask someone else that knows that we 'll come back to that question in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what will what come back to that question if it 's I came for the person who asked that question I 'll just jot it down so don 't forget we are the next one is there a timeframe between funding being granted I 'm sorry to help you with that one as long as they quit the funding does the person who asked that question hear that okay if not if you don 't if you haven 't got a if you 're not clear on the answer or you can 't hear because of some technical thing please ring back on that number thirteen hundred three four five three four five tomorrow on the next couple of days and talk to our our staff so they you can get the get the answer then what is the maximum amount of funding you can apply for so there is no maximum amount that you can apply for so currently I have the information of the estimated funds that we have available for next year so for bomb Bellagio we have around 1,000 sorry one one hundred twenty two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have 105 thousand seven hundred and forty two point fifty seven cents so these are the estimated funds that we have available for next year so when you are applying for any of the funds um you can put in the project you can put in the whole amount and then it will depend on the committee committee uh when they are going to assess all the applications they will decide how much funds they would want to grant to each applicant can I have those figures again full bath bomb Bala and cocoon manera yes just short you 're looking at it is one hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred and ninety seven dollars for bomb Bala Shire Reserve and 105 thousand seven hundred forty two dollars for kumamon ROI results okay next question okay if the event is postponed until next financial year do jacoba 19 do the funds need to be returned so that 's yeah so that 's a decision that the committee is so that 's a decision that the committee is going to make when they have their next meeting that whenever if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the bush fires or covered 19 how to proceed further so I think we will be able to answer that question after August 20 20 km committee meeting yeah yeah I hope side because we don 't want another surge do we it 's bad enough as the first surge that little one second I 'm done next question okay so this one came in early this afternoon if you 're not an actual organization but you have a project that you believe would benefit the community and you 're an individual can you still put an application forward would say yes you still have as long once again as long as it benefits the community which you 're putting it in for and had the ability obviously to answer to organize it and carry out the project as outlined earlier other questions well we 've been through we 've been

@ @ @ @ @ Gallery and we wish to make an application for a major art award which will run annually for five years do we do that application on the same format for this year with the purpose of it being awarded each year I sort of read in the guidelines that that was possible I would say yes you can do that but make sure you put it on the application so it can be can be considered that the committee would probably have to have a look at that I not a hundred percent sure on that one okay yes I 'm being corrected yes you can I can so long as you are equating the project on your on your basis you can 't do it then you would quit the project each year after you know say you got it for a five year period or something and you would equip the amount of money each year yes okay thank you

    "text": "hi it 's fashion Pacifica and this short video tutorial will show you as a supervisor or someone who manages timesheet approvals within snoring when our Regional Council had to approve review and reject timesheet that has been submitted this is the second video in the series and should be watched in conjunction with the first video Authority we 'll send you as our supervisor an email advising you that your employee has submitted their timesheet in addition to the email you will have the ability to see where your staff are at with their timesheets throughout the week and send them reminders let 's get started what you 'll see as you know is the main authority or menu you would have received an email to say that timesheet has been submitted and needs your approval you can use the my tasks option and just click on the hyperlink which will take you to the two tasks that you 've got depending on how many staff you may have a few of them there but you can click on one and it will take you to the multiple I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show you other options you can also go on the left hand side to the manager timesheet approval we might use that option now so we 're going to go manage your timesheet approval and you won 't be able to get into this if you don 't supervise staff and if you 're not an online timesheet approver okay so this filter here it automatically retrieves timesheets so and based on a no filter okay what we want to do is we want to highlight timesheets but you can see timesheets or leave and you could approve and reject leave and timesheets in this same function I want to include future purely because I submitted a timesheet and at the admin assistant in the future so I wanted to see that one but I also want to see what feeds submitted because I want to review and approve them so then I 'm going to use those tips and click retrieve timesheets and what it 's doing now is it 's showing you all staff or what weeks what has been approved and things like that so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can click on here and you 've got all and it 's going to tell you who the actual supervisor is it would expect to be yourself unless you 're an ultimatum prove up so what we 've got here is the 27th of June the standard hours according to the work pact is 35 hours that normally submitted 29 okay so that can read because it is under the squirt patent amount okay and what we got here is 35 normal is 37 we 've got over time of 2 hours okay and we 've got 35 35 and overtime in two hours so what you would want to do here is you would want to click on the employee that you 're checking and basically you 're just seeing the timesheet and you 're going to see that on Monday that person was a one hour above their work eight hours and Tuesday there were under Wednesday they were over Thursday they were on on point at 00 and Friday and you can just slip through these to see and have a look at them you 'd want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost accounts make sure that their hours as you believe they are if they had any lead that simply goes on things you 'd want to do your due diligence around wanting that should happen if you look at the the Wednesday before Wednesday the 1st of July and use their my standard cost account for 10 hours and you 're like no out on that Wednesday they were out mowing lawn or doing something around a park so you need to they need to change that and use a correct cost account so if you wanted to do that you could unsubmitted and if you answer meet that it will send an email back to the employee to say that they need to do further reviews okay and that would then take it out of your approvals this okay because it has it yet so then the employee would make the change and then it would come back to you okay so that 's what that happens there so say you 're happy with it you could just use the cross up at the top here and then head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your next employer in this case it 's the same employee but you would see your multiple of employees yeah once again you want to check all your work okay so this is eight hours they are over they would over and on time and then you would keep that and then you would unsubmitted you need to invite them there so you are happy with all of that then you would click in these tick boxes and you would don 't approve selected and then that is going to then send it off the payroll okay say for an example so then what we can do there is we might do that now and we might do a proof selected okay so the time sheets have been proved we 're gonna close and then away it goes I 'm just going to refresh that manager time to approval now and I 'm going to come in to here and go include future or just timesheets and I might say show me all of them have been submitted okay there 's none there so there 's none ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been created and entered retrieve and showing you one that 's been created but haven 't yet been sent through to you okay and say that due date was coming up you could click on this and you could email them or you could email all overdue records okay and so those are the things that you can do as a manager if you have got 20 or 30 staff and you know that cutoff is fired and pop tomorrow so you want to go in and find every one that 's created or entered their timesheets from East a period week starting to whatever the week you 're working on and send them an email or chase them up okay and then so then what you would do is you would then just wanna check and make sure that any of beam splitter and if we click on the improve section you will see those are the ones that being approved okay so once I 've been approved they are now in payrolls pockets and payrolls heads so then every week on a Monday morning and payroll will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment asked I 'm seeing an online timesheet lead and can still be adjusted by payroll okay but they can 't be adjusted by the employee or by yourself because they are going to be posted and if the employee goes through them but what you would do is if you know you 've made a mistake or they 've been an error or a change you would need to speak to your payroll team okay at that point payroll will then grab that data move them into payroll and complete the payroll system okay so that 's how you would work with those you could once again use another one and check all the ones that are being posted and then you 'll see all of those ones that are being posted so that 's as simple as that is in retrieving if you have any questions please see your payroll team thank you bye"

send it back to start so if you get in a bit of a tangle okay you 've got select leave tight so you may or may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's online li so if you submit your annual leave sick leave long service leave or any of those leave types that are available using online leave they will be automatically picked up and placed into your online timesheet record once approved by your supervisor so you will see that I have for this example applied for leave on Thursday the second of July for sick leave for that day it 's been approved by my manager so I can automatically see it in my timesheet there 's nothing I need to do okay so as a business process you would always apply for your leave if it 's applicable using the online leave functionality if you can 't feel for whatever reason then you 've got these in this leave type button here so you 're gonna click on and you could choose one of these options so Tommy Liu taken flex taken sickly family legal and you 're late so you can just take on one of them and enter the details in on that day okay so this star is a favorites account so what happens here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you you know you 're going to be using that word for a number all the time what it does is as soon as you search for that it keeps it in your favorites so you don 't have to search for it every single to do time you do that line you can just simply click on that start click on the work order number that you like and then a way it 's already in the details so I 'm just going to reset road because I want to get back to the star and then what you 've got here is comments so I 'm going to now I 'm going to put in a word for a number and I 'm going to click the fourth icon which looks like a speech bubble and for comments so what this is is these are comments you want to send to your manager and this will in turn be seen by the payroll team so you would want to use this if you have higher duties or if you have an allowance that you can 't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is you 'd want to let your manager know and you want to let payroll note about what you 're putting in and why you put a meeting okay so we just don 't cancel and then this search function is search for a cost account so what it 's doing is showing you on what cost accounts you can use snowy manaro will use and cost to work on so you want to click work orders at this stage in that form so we click work orders and what it says here you can come down you can either type in the work order number or you can type in the description so in this case I might type in the word car and I might click Submit and it 's like what Park did I work so I 'm going to just body in parks and gardens open space to a tree and what was that task that I was doing in that Park so I might say no okay and at this point you would choose equal salaries and wages or overtime these are the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be just my normal hours code of salary and wages so I 'm going to choose my 300 and then what our standards it 's populated those details into the cost account so I 'm just gonna tab to the next field okay and then what it 's got here is it 's now saying what rate code do I want to use so this grade 935 our entry this is my pay rate that 's totally on my face system I can 't get access to any other pay rates but what 's going to happen is if you are on higher duties for that day then I would suggest you use the OLT default followed by a comment and then so what you would do is sales on higher duties for this day and it 's saying Oh Ltd for and what was the comment so you 're going to put in higher duties completed like that okay so you might want to put it inside and then tab fruits the next one save it again it 's just okay save that and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can move along and you can look and see if you 've got any other hours code you want to use but in this case you wouldn 't and then you 've got allowance and serve easily you can choose your allowances so on this higher duties you may have needed on call or collaborators or something like that that 's a different sort of our toad he might listen travel and this title might use a meal allowance and how many of those meal allowances did I do for this guy I made one and then you would just hand to turn that and then we 're just going to save that record some water started because I 've completed the seven hours it has turned the date panel for Monday the 29th of June green because green is saying it equals the work pattern okay red is saying it is lower than the work package so it 's lower than the hours expected and then if we go over you 'll see it turn to an orange color okay so if we now we 've completed that Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to do the same here so we 're going to go the the green plus to create a line okay and then what you might want to do here is you 're going to use the favourites you 're gonna click on that and then you might click and another work order okay and you might just choose your right you might choose you did one hour at that part okay and then you just type through cutting all the way through and then you can just either save that record or you can use the sauce to create another line okay so at this point you can choose another work button if that 's what you needed to do and you might have seven hours at this time okay but what you might also do is you might have overtime on this line okay but what happens is that and this is a bit financial but we are costing the ordinary hours you can see to work order 20 tasks 20 and resource code 350 we call over time to the resource code of 301 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in overtime on this line because I 'm already costing to 300 that 's not allowing them to cost to a different ledger account on the same line so if you have overtime and you 're using the work order number you would need to enter in a new line so you could simply just use the same work order number 2020 we won 't put any ordinary hours in and we 'll just go overtime one so Brad guys I made a mistake there so I 'm going to click on this red set road and I am going to choose my standards which is the my standard cost account and then I 'm going to choose my right not doing any ordinary house because I 'm doing overtime and I 'm going to say I 'll give two hours overtime on that day I 'm just on the tag through okay so what we 've done there as we as we have saved that shoes day okay because we 've got here we 've got an error message that we just teaching we 'd like it I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done my standard like that like that reset right so I 'm just going to get that out of that for down I 'm just going to come back up here I 'm just going to travel all the way through just to revalidate those fields I 'm going to use the green I need the red just get rid of those fields so I 'm just gonna put my highlight where I am and go and it 's taking that line away so what we can do now is we can do seven hours here okay I 'm going to add my standard overtime Corrales that 's what 's funny there so that 's how you would normally enter in your overtime if you were costing a work order number if you were costing directly to your standard cost account then you could I 'm just going to go out the line again it 's my standard you could do four hours here and you could do overtime only if you were costing your standard cost account and if some of you will not be costing your standard cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that down so depending on your scenario those are the two ways that entering water time okay what you can see here because I 've got a bit crazy with those times it 's now put it into the orange at 15 hours okay so I 'm just going to come in to highlight this one here and I 'm going to use the red just to take it away and I 'm just going to come back in here and breathe validate that and you go save so it back down to nine hours but still well and truly above the expected hours which is what is why it 's orange okay and then what we 've got here is on the Wednesday by putting on sick I mean angrily form for part of the day so that is coming from online leave and what you can see there is correct so all you want to do is you want to pack in another line with your next lot of days okay so you 're going to do my standard and we might do 3-4 hours which is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have might be on-call weekday just go to the options you can choose and there 's a number of on all and then we 're going into South ok so that 's what you 've got there so we might work on a Friday and we 'll go and a during enter in some French now so we 're going to use the plus symbol we 're going to come over here to our favorite accounts okay and we 're going to choose a baron dolls for we 're gonna do five hours this oval no allowances but we 're using plant okay so if you know the plant number you can just type in the plate number one zero zero zero one okay and then just turn okay just to take off where we left off so what we 're doing now is that I 'll be putting in that cost account because we 're now putting in print on the Friday the third which was a nonworking day so I 'm putting in mice cost account and I 'm just tabbing through putting in my rate and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do no allowances and in my plan so if you want to do this two ways you can put in a plane if you know the plant number you can just do a forward slash followed by the number which is in this case one zero zero during flight and then tap and tap and you 've got the usage home so it 's a coupon job or standby in this case it 's active and then you want to do how many hours you did for that plant okay and then you want to add in another line and you might do something like another work order number and I might returns tap tap tap tap we might try a plant number that is linked to hours for kilometers things like or vehicles and less tax so you might want to put in your plant number and just go forward slash one zero two two zero tap tap and then we 're going to do active and it automatically comes across to the plant home so we might put in here fifty two kilometers okay we 're gonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another work order number and give you another option of finding the bread so might just rip on our tab tab tab tab you can use this search button here thank him you could type in your ID or your description you can type in the word truck and then submit and you might choose the truck that you were working on or whatever you 've got you 're going to choose right number and then there is in the box then if you turn active on job and then we might do one hour okay so that is a simple as how you complete plant if you were working with plant and if you were cost into plant okay so that 's what you would do with plant if you would so then you 've got eight hours on that day okay we might just because I need to just show you how we can do flex okay timing loop so what you want to do here is I might I need to do it on a day that 's on the work happen so I might choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our higher duties and just going to turn that sound to five hours in a second make very clear what we 're trying to do so what it 's doing here is that I 'm not on a flexible work pattern okay so if I don 't my work pattern says that I work four days a week seven hours a day and I don 't really have flex okay so what is doing is it 's actually not allow you to submit your week even though you 've completed every day that is needed you 've got Monday and just under your work pact and hours okay so you can see that the cement week is grayed out you can 't submit it okay because you 're under so in order to fix that and if you 're not on an automatic flex system okay in relation to your work pattern what you would need to do is come into the AG and then you would use your leave time and you might say that 's taken and it might be two hours and then just tap through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that a lot because I 've got five of an hour so that 's not too bad so I 'm just going to go save so what I would do here is I might bring this up to six and a half so the system 's gonna like me might go save and we 're at the Monday the 7th and it 's a now allowing you to submit the week so what I 've got is I 'd only worked six and a half hours that day and I 've taken point five of Flex okay that is you telling the timesheet that you are taking place okay if you are on a flexible work pattern and you can and when I say flexible according to your working roster or working system you can work eight hours one day five hours the next nine hours the next as long as you do 35 hours for the week your position allows you to be flexible okay if you 're in a flexible arrangement you won 't need to put in that flex time if you go over your hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o 'clock it 's automatically going to allocate those hours to your Flex bucket if you go likewise if you go under it 's going to automatically do under and take it out of your flex okay so just to pin you and if your automatic flexible word pattern or you 're not then that 's the way you 'll need to do it okay so those are the different options you can choose um but as Saturday you can and we just don 't have it so just to confirm you can you 've got your cost account to your my standard or you can choose a worker you 've got your rate so you 're going to choose your normal rate if you want something different as a rate you need to do the OLT default and that tells management and that tells payroll that you need a different date so you need to put in a comment when you that one okay saying with the hours comes there is an OOTD fault if you need to do an hour 's code that 's not in this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comic to let payroll know okay once again for allowances there is the same thing although to default if there 's not something there you need to put that in there okay and then you 've got the plank apply kilometres and things like that okay so that 's pretty much sums up entering in the time sheet once that has been done you can now click on and go submit wait okay it 's basically saying your work package 28 hours and you 've entered 38 hours ok so you 've done 10 additional hours on that book okay and what that 's going to do is if you 're on flex that will put you to do flex it may pay you depending on how that works in your Flex all you get flex a lot and then you just go go submit week once you 're happy with that and then that have been to me as you can see at the top here it 's got submitted and then what that does is that sends an email to the person or your manager approving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time check so you 're type your manager will look at that time sheet and if they 're happy with it they will approve it if they 're not happy with it I would expect them to speak to you and they can unsubmitted and then it will come back to you to fix it ok so then it becomes a submission again and then an approval and then once furniture as a project goes off the payroll I hope that answers all your questions if you have any other questions please see your payroll team thank you very much"

    "text": "my name is Bruce agent I work with Mr a consulting and we 've been working with snowy Manero on a new way strategy which we 've titled the tipping point time to transform West I 'd like to start with an acknowledgement of country surname a narrow Regional Council and MRA consulting acknowledge the traditional owners of this country Venera go the wall galue and the northern nanowar people and we recognized their continued connection to the land waters and culture we power respect to their elders past present and emerging so today I 'm going to give a 15 minute presentation you 're more than welcome just to read that online and not follow through on the slides but I 'm also happy to take you through and possibly provide a little bit more detail so you should be able to see there an outline of what we 'll be talking about and I 'll get right into it so why does waste management matter well the traditional reason that we 've been concerned we spent so much time and energy focusing on waste is about protecting human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats cockroaches and the like at least since the 1970s we 've also been concerned about environmental protection so that 's ensuring we manage groundwater from landfills it 's about preventing tip fires and the emissions associated with that and that was we 've got a more sophisticated understanding concern around heavy metals toxic metals and pathogens so controlling such wastes making sure that we meet those first two objectives of human health and environmental protection and emergency response capacity is a subset of that so we know and were particularly aware in stone and arrow that risk and the reality fires and floods and when those happen we need to be able to clean up afterwards to ensure human health and environmental protection the way we manage waste is a real issue for public amenity on your streets odor dust visual impact and noise and around the landfill or the waste facilities themselves and then at least since the 90s we 've understood the waste management is critical to the sustainability of our society so we 're looking to have a circular economy that provides sustainable local jobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even sequester carbon to the way we make composts out of organics and and put them into the soil so what 's the role of government in all of this well firstly waste management is defined as an essential service under New South Wales legislation and as such it should be accessible it needs to be safe and needs to be affordable and when we 're delivering these essential services we 're looking to do it in a cost-effective way this is ratepayers money into your money and we 're looking to spend that money as efficiently as possible if any money we spend on waste services as money we 're not spending on something else whether that 's reducing your rates or giving you better libraries or roads ta governments are certainly central to the provision of waste services and Australia 's a federation so it 's got three levels of government and so the traditionally local governments have been the key players with regards to waste management so they 're responsible for providing those services your curbside services and the like and they 'll either do that in-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more recent times that 's not an outsource to contractors we 're still managed by the local government and paid by local government but it 's not actually a local government staff doing the work on the ground again from a traditional perspective the regulation has come at the state or territory government level so that 's environmental legislation more recently specific waste legislation and of course planning and the like and then the Australian Government is responsible for the imported products and product standards within the countries and that leads to the waste that eventually turns out the form of that waste and how it 's been put together and what materials might be in it and and in very recent times and only since 2000 or so the national government has started bringing these national product stewardship schemes and they now exist for oil and e-waste recycling and under these schemes the company that makes the waste has to take some responsibility for at end of life recycling so that 's been quite a game-changer so what do we need a new way strategy well we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wants to earn tip the size its existing strategies and have a consistent and fair framework for all its Rey ratepayers and those historic member councils and we 're looking to realize potential efficiencies between the council 's certainly since those previous strategies came out there 's been a lot of changes possibly the biggest of that has been the China sword which prevents the export of Australian recyclables to China which is where most of our plastic was going and a fair bit of other products including paper and cardboard and then the Commonwealth has actually banned the export of a whole range of wastes including tires these bans will come in over the next few years and glass and so that 's really changed the market in which we 're trying to do waste management and trying to sell recycles add in stone and arrows case that means recycling now costs twice what it costs to landfill waste so that 's another consideration we need to take on border at the New South Wales Government level the big change is a new waste strategy that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a strategy it 's consistent with that and reflects that so that very timely that we 're updating this to coincide with that and a couple of years ago you may have noticed the return and earn scheme in the posix camp turn up which lets you take beverage containers beer bottle water bottles etc and you get ten cents back and that 's massively changed the value of marriage beverage containers in the waste system and it creates new opportunities for businesses communities sports organisations to make money so in light of that we 're looking at from a same arrow operates at services and how we can take advantage of that so just a little bit of background snow Manero formed in May 2016 from BOM bala cumin Monaro and snowy river it 's some 15,000 square kilometers with 20,000 people living in some 12,000 houses mostly standalone houses but also a percentage of multi-unit dwellings apartments and the like so that gives you guys around two and a half people per household about one point four people per kilometer squared and that 's incredibly low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Namibia it 's lower than South Australia to find that low population density you know you need to go into our back Australian I like and that certainly has an implication to what services we can offer and how much power to cost well for those services so what services are offered snowman arrow has its curbside collection which if you live in town you should be aware of its a red thin a yellow bin and if you 're in Kumar there 's a green bin and the green bin takes garden waste and food waste you 'd see public place bins in parks and the like and then there 's a range of transfer stations to which you can sell all various materials and community recycling centers have two of those transfer stations where you can take specialist materials like paint and e-waste things like that drum muster for farm chemicals and and then the council holds events like the chemical clean-out day the garage sale trail and do waste services of community events that council also has arranges at a public health unit let 's try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste from dumping now if you don 't live in one of the towns then you may have access to a bank of being serviced or alternative form of waste service which makes our probe which makes sense in a dispersed community like this and so there 's a picture there of one of the Bank of being services the council also does waste education so that people understand how to use the waste services that they 've got so there 's a Schools program there 's the website where you can find a lot of information you may get an annual resource waste collection calendar delivered through the post pop up education services and community issues and in the pictures here you can see our new education campaign the council 's been running around hazardous waste with hazardous Harry and then the council does training of internal training and staff so that they understand how the system works and can and can help feed that back to you guys when you ring in or in contact with them and so you 've got a picture here of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside a transfer station and you can see a bunch of staff there on a facility tour so this map it 's very fine detail but you can find it up on the web and it shows it shows the Shire of snowman arrow and the services spread out around there so the banks of bends the transfer stations and the landfills the community recycling centers there 's two of those one at jindabyne and Kumar the ku post composting facility at cream on and the scrap Mart or tip shops where you can take your bulky waste like lounges over pushbikes etc and they can resell them to the community and then apart from the government there are private sector facilities you 've got the return and earn and a range of other businesses providing waste services in this area so fees and charges it 's something close to everyone 's heart Sloman arrow has a range of fees and charges you might see on your rights notice even if you don 't have a curbside service there 's a standard fee of seven hundred and twenty one dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are built and that the Rangers can pick up waste and services that we all use even if we use them indirectly and there 's a picture there and the cumin facility and as you can see it 's a large sprawling facility providing a heap of services to the community and businesses if you do get a curbside service then there 's a domestic recycling service and waste service and if you 're in few month there 's a domestic food and garden organic collection and for rural people who have access to bank of bins and there 's a charge associated with accessing those bank of bins how does that compare to the rest of New South Wales the average fee in New South Wales for waste is 399 so ballpark a little bit less but in a lot of the economies of scale in other local government regions in New South Wales not a lot less and you can see the lowest fee is one hundred and thirty two dollars out in the Riverina right up to seven hundred dollars in some on Sydney 's inner city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know all the fees and charges they 're on the web you can go to the snow Mandara website or you can simply google it and i 've got a couple of links there where you can see the fees and charges for specific thing and there 's a whole range of things you can drop off for free as well so how 're we doing with the performance on the good side you guys don 't produce a lot of waste you 've done a good job of not unnecessarily consuming things and so you 're presenting significantly waste less waste in your household bins and then the typical person in New South Wales on the nadas good side the recycling level is at the lower end of the spectrum 42% and that compares to an average in New South Wales of 65% and a target of 75% but we can see that for the areas that have the bin for food and garden organics that comes up to 56% which is pretty good and indeed is better than most of the regional areas of New South Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at with the strategy is its expanding that third of users so Caribbean performance I 've already mentioned 13 service will certainly help and then we need to get better at making sure we put recyclables in the yellow bin and that we don 't put rubbish like plastic bags into the yellow bin so we need to pull a bit out of the yellow bin the rubbish and put it in the red bin and make sure that when you have recyclables they go into the yellow bin so that 's an education effort and then when we get a food and garden organic system it 's being mindful and trying to make sure that all your food waste as well as your garden waste ends up in that in that gran bin so that we can turn it into compost it 's certainly not just about households it 's the commercial sector and again educating them and as we roll out the third bin system we can start collecting organics from businesses and that 's particularly important for restaurants businesses like that to make a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture for the return and earn skin and I said how about people that can potentially be so that 's particularly pubs and clubs sporting organizations that generate a lot of beverage containers and making sure they don 't turn up in the red bin and for building sites trying to get better on-site sorting and then looking for ways to use the the concrete waste and bricks and the like in construction projects so that again they don 't go into landfill and we can get a beneficial use of that material and that may need more infrastructure like a sorting facility for construction and demolition waste and a game of kuma and stone mineiro being a relatively small area and dispersed we 're probably talking about having a mobile facility on the back of a truck that can go around to different towns in the region and work with them to do that recycling so we try to get the communities feel for this how they think this way system is going and what they like to see and so the council conducted a survey between the 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 258 people isn 't a bad turnout at all and so this is a summary of what those people said back to us there was a general feeling that the waste facilities weren 't being used because fees and charges were too high quite a common complaint and that people found it difficult to access the facilities and if there wasn 't enough information on what they could recycle or where it had to be taken I read half of the people who responded said they wouldn 't pay more even if it improved recycling I wouldn 't want to pay more and around half didn 't believe that the yellow bin material was being recycled which I can assure you it is taken down a camera to the human earth and I think it 's got about 8590 percent of that is recovered certainly all the paper and glass aluminum and steel and we talked a bit earlier about contamination so there is some material of tones up in the yellow bin that doesn 't get recovered and what did you want to see what would what did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third bin for green waste and and they were very keen on a bulky waste collection service so people said if they got a food and organic service that they would use it for food and they would use it for garden waste and when they said they wanted more information the way they thought it was best to get information was either by a Facebook or a letterbox drops and particularly they wanted out what could be recycled and what services and facilities were available and again probably not unsurprisingly don 't do people want to bold your waste service but the people who wanted that service felt but if if we had one there will be less illegal dumping so as a part of a strategy development we 're looking at a number of new infrastructure initiatives that includes new landfill cells so to keep the landfills going every five or so years we in a new cell and we 're looking at that in jindabyne in Kumar and then we 're looking to upgrade transfer stations to freight waste more effectively and we 're looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it makes more sense to close the bond by the landfill to just keep it as an emergency reserve and then freight the waste from Bambara over the criminal landfill it there 's also some work to be done around improving stormwater management and leachate management at those landfills and then there are some 14 old land landfills around snow monaro and so there 's investigations going on around which are those who need remediation and which of those could be upgraded to provide emergency landfill capacity for future issues that might occur we 're looking at fire sponsors which is typically an issue with landfills and the emergence of rechargeable batteries and rechargeable batteries are supposed to be taken to CRC is to be recycled but they often end up in the in the bins and when they get crushed they can start fires so we need to be able to put those fires out at landfills and with the rollout of the bin potentially to to the rest of the snowy Manero we 're gonna have a lot more green waste to compost so we 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just that ongoing replacement of trucks and getting best practice collection trucks for worker safety and of course to have them less noisy and more fuel-efficient less smelly etc so we 're considering a range of services and other initiatives and these are very much proposals they 're not set in stone yet one of those is a community recycling center that that 's mobile it 's a trailer so that means that all the towns could have at least some of the year access to a place where you can take your paint and take your batteries and take some of those specialist waste or e-waste so that the initiative will happen that one has actually committed to and then expanding the business waste collection services and particularly trying to capture some of those commercial organics and I touched on that earlier and so that happens in conjunction with the third in roll that and it did those curbside collection services are likely to be extended to more rural properties and we 're looking to do more of the banker bins which seem to work really well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickel a go business education touched on earlier about how the container deposit scheme greatly increases the value of containers so just making businesses aware of that and then helping them capture those materials so that that money ten cents per container is kept in the community and also for builders because building waste is in the order of a third of what goes to landfill and there 's some really easy gains that can be made there if we focus on that and we 're trying to the costing around bulky waste collection so that 's where you can put your lounge traditionally you put it out on the curb be collected once a year and so we 're trying to cost that understand the waste implications because quite expensive and it does have legal risk implications and this is this age of people suing each other and we 're also looking at other ways of doing that like in the ICT where where they come out and collect from your place on an on call basis and if you 're a pensioner or a concession card holder you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas other people actually pay a small fee for it so yeah we 're looking at some of those options and trying to cost them and of course that comes down to that question of you know what are people willing to pay for more service and remember our initial feedback was at least half of people don 't want to pay any more at all in terms of the circular economy and that brought a sense of how sustainable we can be with the kind of procurement policy and making sure the council buyers as much recyclable material and local material as it can be in food rescue where you work with supermarkets and bakeries and businesses producing food and capture just before it 's passed is due by day and then work with charities to to make meals and to move that to many people in the community so that 's one of those sort of we win social economic and environmental wins I 've already touched on trying to get those two containers to keep that money in the community with sporting communities and the like and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like and then local sorting of recycles because we 'll need that if we 're to pull all the cans out of the existing yellow type bins and back of the envelope from from all that 's already done by the council and from data we 've got yes there 's a half million dollars a year worth of cans sitting in our yellow top bins going down to Canberra recycling and we could potentially save the transport costs thank you a fair bit of that locally part of how we can keep it locally is is taking glass and making a sand product or a gravel product out of it and potentially using tires or mix plastics into asphalt and road construction so things like that keeping products local keeping trucks off the road and reducing costs go time odds we 're basically finished costing the options now and so there 's internal consultation to go around the costing on that and then cancel consultation public consultations been going on this presentation here is a part of that and so was the survey and the draft strategy will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a chance for the public to comment on that and then the council will be looking to finalize their new strategy in the spring of this year and then over the next ten years be implementing those changes and these timelines are a subject to the covert health crisis where we 're hoping that we 're seeing the end of it now but that 's that 's far from certain and certainly there 's been changes underlays due to that including the fact that you are seeing this presentation as a recording on snow maneras website when these were going to be a series of face-to-face community meetings so we want to get your feedback all the time but now is a great time to to make your voice heard while we 're trying to finalize these ideas and now things down so yeah that 's the best time for us to to hear your thoughts so I 'd like to point you to the website and there 's social media platforms that you can rage the council by course you can email them and will rescind ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much for listening and I hope you found this informative and that you can take part in having a sustainable waste system in in the great region snowman err"

Hart through the mayor I 'll pass that to the executive director of corporate and community he 's progressing that item thank you Paul so I 'm just completing the just completed the draft terms of reference for that that committee which I will distribute once I pass the executive leadership team I think Thank You mr. Halton don 't ask you a question look forward to seeing that well on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravan park cabins at that low and I 'm just wondering if there 's any progress on the funding for those and whether or not we 're now able to use any of them for tourism purposes are once again go directly to mr. Halton mr. mayor I think we should actually that 's on the second item so if you 're gonna pass these minutes separately suggest that we deal with the 21st of May item and then when we go to the 28th of May we could answer that question for thank you I different page okay so let 's put the minutes of the meeting the main meeting all in favor sorry which brings me to the extraordinary meeting of the 28th of May councillor Smith you 're moving that way yes thank you Callahan councillor Smith yes the question the question regarding the caravan park cabins that we 've put into Batlow whether we now have any progress on the funding for those and or whether we are able now to use them for tourism purposes so CEO or mr. Holton I 'll start off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith we are progressing the funding for those cabins we have escalated some additional information through regional New South Wales up to the State Housing Committee for recovery and hoping that that will be successful at the moment we understand the Housing Committee has put most of its time towards the Minoru pods and we believe that the Minoru pods are nearly fully extended now and we have a number of those coming excuse me into our area in regards to the letting up those units I 'll hand over to mr. Halton for that one thank you Matt and through you mr. mayor the the we currently have an arrangement in place with the with robot real estate and the office of emergency housing to place people who are in need of accommodation into those units so they 're not yet available for the broaden general public however I say that with one exception there is a meeting of Commonwealth Bank managers in bath alone coming up fairly shortly where they will actually require four cabins for the accommodation for a short period of time and I 'm um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made I 've made a decision to allow that to occur just because it 's only for the two nights and it 's not an ongoing thing that the units will once again be available to do for the purposes of accommodating people who require emergency housing for the bethlo caravan park in general it will return to sort of normal operations in terms of carat parking caravans in there and can be there by the end of this month the good news that will be before the school holidays over there thanks Thank You gentleman thank you nothing further counsel ahem um I just would like clarification in the advocacy plan just I 've had people ask what does an emergency evacuation center and Toomer basketball center look like in our advocacy plan what you know people were talking is it as we thought it would have been this time last year or has that concept changed if I made through the through the mayor Councillor hams the original concept that we consulted on back in 2018 it was a much larger and more expensive option we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basics five million dollar facility as opposed to a 20 million dollar facility about including hopefully in those plans the ability to expand that if there 's the need and the funds to expand that that facility so we are drafting the detail up around that advocacy item at the moment and it is definitely a very different option to what was originally proposed as a basketball multi-purpose stadium at that site the concentration is on the fact that it is an evacuation center as we saw during the fires earlier this year we didn 't have a facility central facility to locate people to and when we held a public meeting interment we didn 't actually have a facility that could accommodate the amount of people that wanted to go and hear the news on what was happening in the area so the aim is to get something very basic that is size right that can be used for other things such as basketball got a very simple in full structure thanks for that clarification and I might make the point that this is that is a community-driven plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time and there 's a dedicated group of people working on it so they continue to look for funds and blue entered to progress the the feasibility of this infrastructure counselors I 'll put those minutes all in favor carried Castle said take sister 's correspondence now I 've had some exciting correspondence and I 'm sort of sure you 've all seen in there in the news that counselor right has been ordered they would have Australian metal so I 'd like to personally congratulate him and I 'm sure all counselors in stock will join me in that and very well deserved and and their congratulations councilman right or the Australian middle ear here yes I 'd also like to to mention Michael Nayland who 's got the Australian Fire Service Medal and and I 've known Michael most of my life and I believe my father took him to his first fire so he 's got a lot to answer for and he 's been given the Australian Fire Service Medal and congratulations to Michael on nearly 50 years of firefighting so we 're very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly look forward to more members of our community and join the the Australian honest group thank you and congratulations moving on no notice of motions or rescissions counselors after and after having some some conversations with counselors Smith I have a Miral minute I 'd like to to read out to you and present and looking for a seconder and that Merril minute is that council request a report to the July 2020 meeting on the detail of the advocacy plan component of the regional cycling and walking trails master plan do I have a seconder athleisure and catholic pick up it 's just a future really is to it we used to be in the middle of nowhere now we 're in the middle of all the major towns and cities in Australia and these people will be coming here for to see our environments that go on that which walking and cycling in general activities and I think in this this time of the covert virus epidemic it will bring more people into the area for the recreational facilities we need to do it in a well-organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion Thank You councillor Pritchard and so so we 're looking for 250,000 towards the the master plan I have individually written to dr. Joe McGuirk I think before Christmas looking for 50,000 to do a detailed feasibility study and independent business case for the Batlow route our proposal and I believe dr. Maggard has forwarded that on to the state government and he 's still waiting back on the funding for that so that 's where that 's up to and we 've got and we 've and we 've also launched our advocacy plan so that 's where we 're up to with the trials master plan any other speakers Thank You mr. mayor the purpose of my raising is with you as you as you know has been the activity in battle a recently and currently the petition that 's going has attracted a lot of attention and a lot of support and on behalf of the Batlow community of raisins issue and thank you for your dealing with it in this way Thank You classifed Chavez I 'll put the motion all in favor it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrill minute which is that we investigate joining the city 's Power Partnership which is a concept that I think we should be embracing but I 'm asking that we get a report on that just to see that see whether it 's going to be advantageous to us which I believe it should be and it may well help our new climate committee so we have we got that on screen yeah I can 't share that on screen but I 've got written down here the council have a report investigating joining the city 's Power Partnership Program fantastic thank you now second [Laughter] any speakers I 'll put the motion all in favor Carrie thanks very much and we 'll see what the what the report says so we 're just calling for a report in Animus I 'll take you there 's no business with that now there 's governance and Finance reports donation from the City Council councillors the last group of council meeting I joined via CERN and the very generous community of Griffith and and their council have given us a donation it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a knot around how to how to best get it out there and we 've come up with distributing it to where the blaze aid camps were not no not not particularly blazeit but to those organizations that have posted blaze oh and we 've done it on a daily basis so I think it 's a quite a fair way of distributing the funds and I 'm I 'm sure that Griffith the will be will be happy with this and and I know that those community organizations will make very good use of these funds and also use them to leverage further funds and improved facilities at their the places do I have a mover castle ham castle a 'right any speakers castle ahem well first of all gratitude to Griffith City Council and as with everyone has donated towards people who are bushfire kill it 's been gratefully accepted and will be and I think this is a great way to distribute it but I in this report isn 't that incredible that we 've got four hundred fifty nine properties registered with blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that days these people that have just come from all around Australia to be here to help clear and refits and it just blows me away and and you know those people can 't be living in the most comfortable positions at the moment and you know every time I see anyone Blaze 's it 's with a smile and they 're just getting into it and doing it and to the quarter ladies who just keep it running smoothly it 's I that I had heard about crazy but to actually see it in action is really something and congratulations to all involved there in my thinks absolutely and I don 't those comments as well it 's been wonderful to see I 'll put the motion all in favour so it 's unanimous thank you TenPoint to enterprise risk management framework for adoption counselors there six recommendations there would someone like to move all six councillor ladder council across council a Lada get ready to move all 6 thank you any further comment put the motion all in favor unanimous thank you 10 points 3 draft gifts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public exhibition for 28 days for recommendations there councillor Schmitt Cancellara can submit I think it 's important that the the public have a an opportunity to look at these policies and to comment on them because they are designed to give visibility to everything that we do as counselors and as council staff so that there is no thought or accusation if you like or doubts about the fact that the council is operating according to these guidelines and we appreciate and approve of course to see a public comment on these issues but I think you 'll find that they are very comprehensive and cover every contingency thank you anything further put the motion all in favor as unanimous 10.4 adoption of volunteer framework documents counselors before when I asked for whether anybody who has had any conflicts of interest I would just like to point out that I actually have completed the volunteer induction at snow valleys council and sometimes work as a volunteer so I would be having a non-pecuniary interest in this non significant moving castle ahem castle across mr. mayor and just on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in the debate and the vote I will and and mr. mayor I 've also done and and will both hand their forms in yes for the waiting okay so we 've got both counselors for the same the same metal yep all the driver kept coming can we speak okay counselor who was the mover I wasn 't either but happy pool counselor put you had to go first Oh Kathy pitcher have to support this oh yes but I 'm not very happy about it because it 's an extra way of bureaucracy for very volunteers many of them volunteer because they and maybe have touches of modern technology and many of the people you know don 't have employment and the troubles getting through schools and things like that and this will be quite a Bureau kind of obstacle for them to cover to cover will it be a liaison person in Council to help people through the hurdles to get registered as a volunteer can I get go to some refitted the Chairman mr. mayor yes that there will be staff members that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those groups to do that induction process thank you the library would be a perfect opportunity perfectly placed to support people with that with the online forms Thank You castle cost yes Cass ahem um I have to agree with counselor Pritchard in the fact that you know we used to volunteer and turn up and volunteer and you know it was great and it is incredibly bureaucratic we have to go through and I thought I 'd be humid Saul come about because of litigation over the years having said that I have done the induction course and it was very quick and it was very easy and yes that freedom of just turning up a volunteering I understand has gone but we can 't put council in a position that you know we we get sued for something and that 's about where it comes down to I have to endorse these documents Thank You counselor counselor Smith mr. Muir isn 't the case also that the whole process is aimed at protecting those people who do volunteer against the damages or litigation of any sort it covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the motional oh sorry Catholic Ross I just like to point out that we actually had 301 registered volunteers online already which is as fantastic to see that 's a lot of you had something to say I was just fighting yes oh thank all in favor yes thank you anything on to me Oh unanimous all tell me when it 's not about I did financial report 10.5 cancel ahead castle Lada thanks mr. mayor I 'm just going to I noticed there was a letter in the paper from my comments last month saying how pleased I was with the financial report and and and I want to put that in context that when you look back at what our budget was going to be nine months ago and to what it is now I just think it 's a real it 's it does does show how closely counselor is watching resources and spending money and keeping it very tight and I do agree that we have got financial concerns there 's no doubt about it and that 's why we 're looking to enter our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be continually updating that so that we remain a viable Council so I think you know it is looking like you know we will have a surplus and yes that surplus is buoyed by grass however that is not uncommon in this financial environment in all councils but I would ask if there our CFO might be able to explain a little bit closer about how much money we 're getting back from the fire disaster it looks like some of the money is coming in and I 'd be interesting her opinion on how that 's traveling safer véra thank you through you mr. mayor and council ahem we have received about 900,000 under Section 44 claim we have still outstandings on the section 44 climate about 1.4 million we 've also received earlier in the year the 1.3 million from the Prime Minister 's Office overall it leaves us short about 2.3 million dollars of unfunded expenditure that we had during the bush fires and some of the expenditure oh it 's predicted income that won 't come in like water rates and things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come in as in we have already issued those water notices and as well as that we this is the loss of funds for development applications for the most people that have lost houses into the future for the next three years all right any further questions across pilot officer she could just give us a summary about finances at the moment please so fo you mr. mayor council across the summer is on the first page of the report it summarizes that our year-to-date actual income is 48 million dollars and the expenditure is approximately the same so we 're breaking even at the moment we are currently having a surplus of 4.2 million dollars now there will be adjustments year-end financial year end is nearly on us we will have a fair few adjustments in the depreciation particularly because we are still waiting on evaluation and there will also be capitalized station of major projects but it looks like we are going to make the revised budget for the full year thank you sir pass anything further counselor 's Catholic picture that 's a very good result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't presently in a recession and I feel that we 'll go to it into a depression if they if and when the governor virus hits so we 're for a long rocky road ahead and just a caution that we try and conserve as much money as we can and not go into any projects that we we don 't have a fence or anything further put the motion counselors all in favor that 's everyone mr. C yeah give mr. mee and thanks to the CFO for answering those questions statement of investments counselor ham counselor cross um just a question for the CFO again now we 've received our fax grants of financial assistance grants advance payment is that as expected are we expecting some more you know from the federal government is there anything more coming because of the bushfires anything in that area any increase at all super through you mr. mayor and council ham this is not easy to answer we are expecting obviously the section 44 claim that 's not federal that states and we will account for that in our financial statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this stage I am not aware of anything the this financial assistant grant now that 's federal money that comes in that 's correct for you mr. mayor yes that is correct and this comes in regularly every year in a 50% payment and then four installments and over the last few years it 's always coming early okay okay and that will help us with our surplus by the end of the year and is that is it something have we been lobbying or advocating to try and get more money with this grant because of the bush fires server so you mr. mayor I think I need to defer this one to the CEO sorry thanks very much through the mayor Councillor ham we generally has a local government body for Australia trying to lobby for an increased amount of the federal money available to local government has dropped significantly and that 's recently been reported in the local papers it is of concern to us we are the government that 's closest to the people and doing the most on ground and we do require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant drop over the last ten years of the amount of assistance we get and so that is a regular thing on the agenda it is on the books for LG New South Wales to continue to lobby on it and they do provide updates regularly for us for that and also the local government professional bodies also lobby for an increase in the allocation and it might be something that with a candidate since with the by-election coming up that we could mention certainly years and it ties in very well with local government constitutional recognition which have we hope to see back on the agenda in the near future as falada mr. mayor just thought I 'd highlight the fact that our our electorate in fact there our council has never received any of the drought funding it seems quite bizarre to me that you know during two significant crisis and on top of that a drought that was there was felt here they didn 't say the deputy Prime Minister 's seek there 's been two million dollars of allocated funding for drought but noe valleys council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something we need to take up with these candidates to find out you know how al that 's just one one Avenue as to why we 're being neglected here in this in this region yep and the drought cause of course the bush fires good point okay do we need a notice of motion on that feeder are you happy just a write off to them and ask them about it because I mean it 's it 's a significant amount of money I think we should write another letter yeah could we ask the chief financial officer if there is any significant dangers in the investments I 'm looking at the pie chart here there 's no comparison with last month but it has there been any significant change in the way that these investments are made well you mr. mayor Councillor Smith no we haven 't had any significant changes you will see in the second table in the report what the movements are and we have just basically reinvested in expiring investments thank you thank you I 'll put the motion all in favor it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure program was theirs or recommendations then do I have a mover Kessler Smith Cass la la de casa Smith and yes in relation to 11.1 i think it was the intersection at Tremont that was the subject of such a horrific accident can we report any progress on getting further works done than the current works that are happening at the moment which perhaps are quite inadequate in terms of their extent to make that intersection truly safe for people to negotiate how are we looking at any further improvements in the near future Catherine Smith it 's a bit of a long bow on on this report but it does relate to roads I think possibly we will have some I believe Minister tool may come down and I believe that the mr. Tanner from the from the roads has arose a maritime service or whatever they call now has been in contact with a CEO or Passover CEO on that one Thank You mr. mayor and council Smith yes and why 'd he get a phone call from Lindsey tenner the other day and he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day looking at that intersection my understanding is that they are preparing some designs for some further improvements of that facility and mr. tenor has asked to speak to Council at the July workshops we booked him in for the July workshop to talk about the gohkappa Road intersection and also the Batlow intersection there on the snowy mountains highway the traffic advisory committee has also made a number of recommendations and mr. Tanner spoke to me about those recommendations the other day so hopefully we will see a response on that that those items are on councils agenda today to consider that 's very good I 'm sure people will be very happy to hear that Catherine I just want to comment how pleased I am that the King gellick public toilets going to be upgraded because they value seriously worried need of it great to see Thank You Casas I 'll put the put motion all in favor that 's unanimous thank you some good projects their draft asset management policy for public exhibition for recommendations still have a mover Callahan castle Radha Callahan just great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it make make any comments as needed very important thank you for putting it up Thank You councillor how many further speakers put the motion all in favor its carried unanimously Sherman aerodrome access policy for adoption Casa Han counselor costs because I 'm happy to have uncounseled a lot of speak on this that 's a lotta oh just it 's just common sense but it 's nothing really further and it 's just part of appropriate policy for the year ago just just one point I do notice that probably the submission summary probably is not cat 's eyes but cat heads or maybe even caltrops I 'll put the motion yeah I just did remind me I know that Murray Bulow had pork up 4.2 million dollars this last week and we got 150 mm which is better than nothing but disappointing because of but there 's a reason for that mr. mayor look as I understand it it 's 50 funding and we just don 't have the funds to put in deal is that correct mr. data yes mr. mayor that is correct the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're using the whole of our reserve to advance that matter hopefully we can advocate with the politicians to look at further improvements due to the use of that facility for fighting fires and they will hopefully give us some dispensation for the fact that we don 't have additional reserves to match the 50 funding and counselors I forwarded through an ABC story today online story on the on the chin Airport for you so we 're we 're out there on the front foot but they 're just the funding well and look we 've got 150 mm as a blast Saturday which was so it 's a it 's a start but it 's only been over 1% so we 've got to keep working and the thing to remember too is that you know we 've also got to include in those infrastructure upgrades the water main being put on out of the airport yeah we do have some money I think in the waterfront so that 's another infrastructure item that we need to tick off pretty quickly because it is a it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that 's something we can consider and that might that might be another about a 50 funding we can use through the mayor council oh no we are going to include that water pipeline as part of the advocacy document critical infrastructure Casas automation all in favor or castle across did you want to say something first I understand the aerodrome is being used for the helicopter for the hospital whilst it 's being repurposed is there any possibility of getting funding or making that a case for that to get more funding for it for the airport for the upgrade given its being used as a helicopter pad as well it 's always an option so we 'll keep it in mind Thank You councillor cross motion that 's unanimous thank you councillors some 11.4 snow bellies council local strategic planning statement draft will s3 is for adoption three recommendations Cancellara councillor hand Cancellara just happy to move this ring nothing further anyone else the mice and all in favor carried unanimously 11.5 the standing Aboriginal Health Service Committee liver castle across Council ahem I think at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was very timely that we we had this kind of committee as we progressed and met further it became quite clear that it wasn 't going to it really wasn 't doing what it should do and it became a much much clearer that we should actually join in with the hospital and with in with the local health advisory committee that was always that was in place already as a great partnership because health is not really knowing that its core business and I went to my first meeting last week and it was actually really good to be involved in the discussions and to learn what was happening in on the health front thank you I don 't think we should forget that we still need to continue to be very much advocating for the removal the yes yeah and that 's something that through that committee we can progress all of those things that we think are important cough up return maybe I 'm missing something is just kidding I don 't think we should be getting rid of waiting health services committee for example with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being put down at the attention simply building put down near the railway precinct regarding the corona virus testing I still don 't know and I understand it 's been called the respiratory clinic but there 's no sign down there for it so we 're not quite sure what truth of the matter is I had problems if they are caught in a respiratory you know that people who have not coded suspects will be going down there in some makes at times with some urgency to have their respiratory problems fixed so people have got an exacerbation of the chronic bronchitis or semiological severe asthma might be 10 you know as people who 've got some health disability to go down to an area where they 're testing for coronavirus for some greater risk and that would be if they went to the normal Hospital and so I think that basically clarified and not don 't know how it 's we haven 't as I understand any formal information from health service I think we need to keep involved with the Area Health Service this committee this this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health hopefully we 'll be more involved with American health but the the fact that this this committee was basically almost redundant and not an AA meeting so you know it 's it 's always good to have some sort of a renaissance and hopefully that will be the case with renewed enthusiasm especially going forward with our new hospital castle cross it became quite evident that people were not attending I think people people judge with their feet you know it so it it really was at cross-purposes and I think we 've got a much better voice if we 're actually part of that just health committee that is dedicated to health and I would be really grateful if counselors who have serious concerns can give them to me so I can take it to l-haqq to discuss and get clarification around those isip I understand what council approach I was saying about it being a respiratory clinic I would also like to add that with intimate we are the lowest up takers of being tested for covert five percent of our population has has lined up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New South Wales so I would urge people if they do have feeling unwell that do go down because it is a respiratory as I understand it is a respiratory virus okay yeah object of putting people to chronic lung disease down of a covert virus testing place where they will have an increased risk of giving them the covert virus the virus hasn 't hit us yet but it doesn 't hit us hard and I think they have confusion about where you go do you have a test an or will you go too heavy that 's serious assessment of tech I think that 's a separate issue to the one we 've got here on the recommendation but it 's certainly something that I 'm happy to sit down with you and we can we can get a letter away to Mirimichi health or setting up this that that 's being told what it 's all about right to the Health Minister I care for him um I 'm actually go to vote against this man yet I I think it 's a different voice than l-haqq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year and an advisory capacity I think it just does give a wider viewpoint on health and you know I I thought the I went twice and I actually got a lot out of it and I thought it was quite wide and to disband an advisory group but he 's actually led by counsel I think he is a bit of a loss so I I think yeah I I will be voting dances any other speakers for or against Catholic cause I think if we are going to keep it going we need to really think clearly about who should be on that committee so that it can have that broader voice because at the time it did not have that broad voice we didn 't have an average was in there we do have on l-haqq we didn 't have a voice from disadvantaged people there are a whole range of people who did not have a voice so I think if we 're going to keep it and I 'm happy to keep it I think maybe twice a year meeting would be we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about who is on it and I wonder without I 'm health and education bushfire recovery meeting that is still happening or maybe about to be dissolved whether that will transform into this sort of meeting committee so you 're happy I will vote against disbanding yes because I think for reasons I stated well would you consider an amendment or well if if if there was a motion at all it would be to further investigate disbanding or alternatives suggest you may wish to consider deferring this item if the councillors would like to have more discussion on it and we can put it back I 'm on to our workshop scheduled to discuss further and provide the same report back or an amended report with further information actual future meeting move and second are you happy to defer yes yes so motion is now that we defer the consideration of item 11.5 on the agenda to a future council meeting yes good same move in a second okay put the motion all in favor casts the picture yes I think we should address it immediately disbanding it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need it ever for you my question to you is are you voting for or against the motion that we just defer I think you put the motion and see what happens or I 've got a motion now that we defer that 's what I 've got so I 'll take that as a as I know so we need to put the motion or put the motion I 'll put the motion that we defer through the chair if I may just clarify that 's not deferring the committee that 's deferring the report to a future council meeting so I 've got cross for council a lot of for councillor Smith for councillor handful that 's the right for intensive preaching again yes okay and I 'll vote for the nation 's past not unanimous moving on Thank You counselors minutes about my Development League we councillors we 've got four recommendations there castor Smith yes I 'd like to just a second that Catholic Ross thank you so much Casas with a couple of points that I 'd like to speak to recommendation 3 they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better I can recite which we can 't at the moment do council support Batlow Development League in seeking funds to secure as use of the rail corridor from Batlow caravan back to the Apple site I think that 's a very good move that we encourage the bat low Development League to seek those sort of funds for projects that are specifically related to bat low and if they they can organize funds themselves then it would be a very good thing for bat low and for the area of the the LG are generally so and the other one of point four that we make application to of the electrical substation to be demolished will I think we 'd all agree with that and happily accept that that we seek funding the point for their recommendation for that we seek external funding to undertake an assessment of the vacant for McHenry site in order to establish and evaluate the range of potential development opportunities available I 'm not sure whether that 's a recommendation that we are able to handle at the moment and I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was just going to us with us see I might talk on that you know things like beyond that point three point three the cannery office building uses tourist information center are those things in the mix are we like these are good ideas but how are we being developed so yeah with the chair mr. Merrill hand this across to our executive director of corporate and community mr. Holton mr. Hogg you and through you mr. chair the those recommendations from the Batlow Development League have were made at the meeting but they haven 't been they haven 't been through a process of brought a community consultation in relation to those those recommendations and you know I 've already been part of conversations with other groups like the fellow Rotary Club who also have an idea for how the deformer cannery office feels so there are a range of competing ideas out there in the community that are worthy of consideration that child would require I believe a bit more investigation as to what is possible on the site so recommendation 4 is a recommendation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake a an assessment of the the various portions of that land to determine what can happen in in in those places because as we know there is also some contamination of the site with the specialist of various places and I think the site is worthy of further investigation so that we may actually be able to you know put some ideas to the community for consider for further consideration thank you with the whole nightcap ahem uh so we we did have quite a bit of money for business case for these cannery is that money still available through you mr. mayor the given that the cost of demolishing and cleaning up the site was following the bushfires as far in excess of what was budgeted for originally all of the money allocated to the site including the money that was allocated to the business plan has been expended in the project to clean up the site thank you anything else councillors castles I 'll put the motion all in favor [Music] that 's carried unanimously thank you 12.2 minutes of the Development League this is their their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross Castle Smith there are four recommendations on my copy of that did you say there were three I 've got three there are four online as three three parts councillors meet with the third I having full sub oh I beg your pardon yes I know I was looking at the fourth some heading and that is that the that low to mid rail trail be placed as a priority on the snowy village councils recovery advocacy plane and that video to continually monitor the success of the tamborim borrows wood rail trail well that 's I guess matter for them if they want to monitor that that 's not something that we would need to have any resolutions about or to accept particularly but I 'd like to make it known and know to that through the mayoral minute today that the tumour to battle a rail trail has been discussed and has been considered by council and that in fact it deals with that point for of number three Thank You Catherine Smith cast for him now I 'll just back capsules made up on that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district it 's suddenly very much being considered and it 's not being taken lightly at all Thank You councillor have cast I wrote so yes you know we can say I 'm very much an advocate for the rail trail and I 'd love to see the treatment by rail trail go ahead but I thought I 'd like to make sure that we said we would do and make sure that we ensure the Tampa ramp the riders were punished he 's fully utilized in a year 's time but I think we should always came to the back of our mind it 's on the everything advocacy client oh yeah we are really still for in a lots of Weis in summer somewhere or other Thank You castle right any other councillors casters I 'll put the motion all in favor I 'll cast the preach out sorry let 's not confuse the medicine regarding the so-called bet loads human rail tow I don 't think it 's got much to do this bet alone or with Chairman I think it 's a matter for the Gilmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L or a bicycle the trail mating that were talking about and I think it 's something that has not got that much support in the Gilmore Valley and I went to the last election saying I was opposed to it and I still retain that position until those wagons except as the Gilmore Valley people to change their mind if they want it supported let 's say that part of Ayrshire and you know I don 't think outside groups should be trying to railroad you you 're more Valley Thank You council picture and certainly with with a detailed an independent business plan all those people will have a chance to have their say and the in the financial viability of such will be explored as well as the cost Cancellara but I 'll just make the point just for a clarification that I can 't personally vote in favor of those unless they 're individualize because it 's saying that it will give priority to that project and as much as I endorse the the the gaining of further information than a proper study on costing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have all the information so I can 't make judgment on it do you want counselors do you want to mirko 's to do those individually one two three reven is that gonna happen to you happy with that I 'm happy for it to go as it is because it 's not a decision that we 're making to do anything it 's simply a recommendation that we consider my question to you counselor Schmitt is are you happy to move to for us to foot number one and then number two and then number three or do you want to move all three together I 'd like to move all three together your choice okay we 'll put all three together all in favor against okay so it 's it 's passed with with two voting against counselor Pritchard and Kalevala moving on Minister committee meeting disability inclusion and access reference group just the hand uh mr. mayor I attended this meeting and it was by zoom which was very very effective it was excellent we had people from you know count Cove and all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually being part of this these the diag group want to come and speak to Council and they are going to put some I don 't know what you 'd say you know put councils in awkward situations so we to know what it 's like to have impaired movement impaired sights in period hearing so that will be very interesting and we had a couple of new people who join the committee and they have got tremendous ideas for how we can make snowy valleys council a lot more inclusive positive that 's great put the motion all in favor carry unanimous can cabin-fever meetings can cover community committee meeting caster smith councillor have three recommendations [Music] can i speak about the number three yes you can following the discussion earlier in terms of the three four five committees there is to approve the you can you test of all and I would certainly recommend that we do have proved that because it is a going to be a very positive thing for the community and they 're very excited about it and a lot of works going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cova committee structure well it 's already happened and we can 't do anything about that now so I hope that we can in fact pass that for their sakes so that that festival can happen for them and give a boost to the open community thank you anything further counselor mr. C yeah mr. mayor man may I just make a comment that item three that councillor Smith spoke about council may want to consider a couple more words on the end of that being that so long as we can comply with the code restrictions don 't know what those will be in September this year I think it 's good to be pre-planning for that however if the restrictions at the time don 't allow for that to occur then I think we should just cater for that in the resolution moving second a happier that yes no no I 'm happy I just I 'm just in the report in here they did Coover contacted Justin Clancy office asked him for 10,000 grant for the painting above the shopping center around the walkway people may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get a one-off grant for that which was very well received that 's good okay put the Nicene all in favor return unanimously thank you our local traffic committee counselors we 've got three recommendations there with the third recommendation having a 2h do I have a mover Castle right Castle across castleroy he 's on mute but can we go into committee we can go into committee if you 'd like to move that way second that counselor Schmitt all in favor okay we 're in committee who wants to say first cancel ahem but I 'll leave a doctor counselor right you were having a good check there yeah all of them very long really good discussion on everything in there and must i anthony around the Birchwood meaning at least traffic and command Yvonne the work he 's been putting in he 's been really yes and look everything there looks pretty good I reckon it 's that good meeting and we considered all those things very very carefully plenty of discussion oh I I would just like to talk to the sorry you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation of roadside barriers between Hibbert vehicles leaving the tumor road of the Christopher Lord Hill I 'd like to talk to the director of the infrastructure about that because I investigate it 's not good enough but in the past four years I think five cars have gone over it 's an incredibly steep hill and the fact that no one 's died and that fellow who went over just the other day it was a remarkable he is not dead and and then if he if he wasn 't killed in the accident then it was freezing and he had to call his way up the hill and how he made it alive I mean we 're talking about a barrier that 's all and if if we go to investigate or can 't we just put something temporarily there director executive through you missed mr. mayor thanks for the question cancel him you know oh and had a look at it last week myself yeah great it is a very steep abatement it is long a straight section of road which which was interesting I understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing traffic safety initiatives we do need the support of the relevant agencies recommend that we we progress that investigation get that support and then proceed with the installation yeah doing the in school with it without getting the endorsement transport the New South Wales and agencies I can very much understand there is urgency behind this I 'll make sure that gets pushed to here as quick as I possibly can and when you say that it doesn 't mean twelve months six months three months I 've done I 'd like to think three months from me out to when we install thanks very much it 's in there it 's done I 'm sure was anything further just in regard to the the intersection there at Capistrano I think it would be remiss not to thank dr.

    "text": "g 'day uh trina and i thought we might have a bit of a yarn this afternoon about the issues that were discussed at yesterday 's council meeting and give the community an opportunity to see what the council deliberated on yesterday and probably one of the most important issues and obviously the one that promoted the most controversy within the community was the notice of motion pertaining to both the airstrip and the evacuation center in tumblr and tuber look this this issue came about because of a perception within council that we needed to know more about what the issues that were involved in this process were and one of the main concerns that had emerged during the the first three months of our term here was the fact that there was a lot of information that wasn 't available to the present council and to in some way endeavour to bring that to the fore we uh the notice emotion was presented and and look what it did was certainly galvanize the community into action it also galvanized the organization into action to ensure that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of the issues that came to light was there 's a concern about casa 's requirements for the airstrip and the fact that we as a council didn 't want to proceed down that path unless all those issues were addressed because we didn 't want to end up with a facility that didn 't meet the requirements but both uh hansey and trina had concerns about the exercise and as such they put in a notice of motion and i 'll let trina make a few comments on that look i think what 's really important for people to understand is that we are a new council we have six new members and and three previous councillors and the new members are struggling at times to fully understand what some of the decisions or how some of those decisions and particularly ones that that come with an enormous price tag not just for the construction but for the ongoing and so last year when the special rate variation meetings were held and we went from 24.7 up to nearly 38 uh it came to light that two projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the candidates had raised those so when elected we we endeavored to find out as much as we possibly could and we just didn 't seem to be getting the details so councillor alma and i did decide to put in a notice of motion we do apologize for any any great distress and angst that it created that was not the intent our intent was for us to understand fully what the financial implications of of two massive um projects were going to be and and in particular with the evacuation center was the the location and unfortunately it was only after we had put the notice of motion in that we were given the opportunity to to have a briefing with the project manager and even that still has some some concerns for us but we 're now working through with it and we want to we want to see it work but we also want the community to understand the implications and those financial financial implications that are going to be going forward but as i said counselor armor and i certainly had no intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that but we also understand that part of our role is that our question yeah our council needs to be fiscally viable and look we 're here to represent the community 's best interest also we 're here to represent the impact of all these these capital projects on the bottom line of the organization and particularly the effect it has on the rate base and that 's where the srv comes in and the integrated planning and reporting chat that 's right and that 's where we 've got to have people contribute you know the what 's being proposed here is a special rate variation of 38 the council at this point in time is prepared to look at a a rate variation in the coming upcoming financial year we would look at that from the point of view of giving us time to better look at the organisation and identify where efficiencies can be made and the way we can go about our business better to achieve better outcomes for the community and we 've got the ipnr hitting the road that 's right next the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various towns and communities in in the snowy valleys council area and we 've got batlow on tuesday the 5th of april at 10 a.m that 's a meeting in the rsl club and trina you might identify the others there look tumba umber is is actually tuesday april the fifth as well that 's at six o 'clock on on that tuesday night at the high school hall and then the following on the thursday the 7th of april is that montreal community theatre in turmerit and that 's at 6 00 p.m it 's a great opportunity isn 't it for people to contribute but people you need to come along and you need to actually hear some information share some information and talk to us about the things that are concerning you have a look at the documents it 's all available online uh yesterday at the council meeting it was actually put that it go out for public exhibition for the 28 days and that 's you that is the public you need to have your input you need to read the documents and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to discuss that you need to get if you 've got an issue that you want to discuss feel free to contact any counsellor about the issue look i won 't be beating around in the bush here it 's a they 're hefty times there 's a lot of information in there but at the end of the day they will gauge or set the way forward for the the council certainly for the next 12 months and into the future and look it 's your future this is your community we would like this council to be very representative of how you people think and look you 're not going to get your way all the time but we 're certainly out there prepared to listen and let 's not guild a lily this is you know we 're in a a fairly powerless situation as far as finance is concerned that 's something that we 're going to have to address over time and we would like to to engage with you people to have your opinions on the way forward you know chaff but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i suppose sessions that are going to be held in in tumbrum but butler and tumor but there are also pop-ups in lots of the other communities there 's online there are opportunities to do surveys we really want as many people as the public as possible that 's why it 's called public exhibition you need to be the ones who are actually helping us to determine what you want for the future and you need to do that by understanding the decisions that you 're asking us to make we want to be guided by you we don 't want it we don 't want to impose we don 't want to don 't want to dictate to you we want to listen to what you people feel about the way forward look there 's one other issue that transcript that 's right during the course of the year the meeting and that 's the transgrid and the hume link situation the impact on the communities that it will go through in the future whether that goes on private land you 've got to look at the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact on the environment and you 've got to look at the impact of the amenity on or on people 's amenity because these are massive structures they 're however we 've got to also realize that these communities our whole community won 't function without electricity so how do we best reticulate how do we address these problems the council put a series of resolutions at the meeting and we 're going to pursue those with the appropriate ministers to see if we can get some engagement now it appears from a meeting we had last week with transgrid that there 's they 're prepared to be a bit more engaging and i think that it 's important that we continue that process to make sure that we get the appropriate outcomes that best suit our our environment our community and and cogniz make sure that the urban dwellers who stand to benefit most realize that the impact is significant in the rural communities in getting electricity to them uh i think sometimes though even in our communities chaff is that people tend to think if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact it is this this issue has a significant impact on our entire region and that 's why again people need to be informed it 's it 's easy to stand back and criticize if you don 't fully understand what 's going on and there 's information there there are people willing to talk to you so please take the time to engage get into it you know really find out what 's going on the impact that it 's going to have across the whole region and look if anything we need to act as a community not in individual groups but collectively you know what are the issues that affect our shire our local government area and and once we get that community spirit going we will stand a better future we 'll also be able to better enunciate the way we see this community and look it really it 's all about you people thank you"

do i have a mover for those counselor ham castle larder i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then i suggest that we move into into a committee so i 'll never move her for that but i 'll ask the ceo first thank you mr hall thank you miss thank you mr mayor um tonight 's meetings about adopting our operational plan and budget and all the associated documents the 2021-2022 operational plan and budget sets out our coming year 's actions and budget the draft plan contains 112 actions and 73 million dollar budget of which 35.4 million is to be invested in capital works including 13.6 million investment into our transport network as an overview council 's financial planning addresses our financial resources and our impact on council 's ability to fund its services and capital capital works there is a deficit before capital grants which indicates council 's inability to sell fund capital renewal and council 's reliance on external funding for these our budget position reflects council 's focus on continuing to deliver services to the community at the levels of the community expect a capital grant income expenditure reflects the income expenditure for renewal upgrade and building of our assets and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results the operating result excluding capital grants this is simply the operating income less the operating expenditure the result tells us where the council 's operational activities are fully funded by operational income this is currently not the case the operating result including capital grants this reflects where the council is independent sorry is dependent on capital funding to cover its ongoing capital renewal capital funding is received to fund capital expenditure which is separate from council 's operational budget in this budget proposal we also have a proposal to consult on a special rate variation and the long-term financial plan includes council 's preferred option with an srv from the 22-23 budget without an srv and or cuts to council services councils forecast budget deficits for the next 10 years and beyond considerable operational efficiencies resulting in savings are required in addition to the srv to make council financially sustainable into the long run council will continue to rely on an extra for an additional external grant income although to a lower degree in this option thanks mr man mr hyde councillors uh can i have a uh a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor unanimous thank you who would like to go first do i have a movie to move out of committee now councillor smith thank you on mute counselor smith i would like to extend our thanks to the chief executive officer and all of the staff who have put so much work and effort into preparing these documents it 's um i don 't i think that not many people would be able to envisage the work that has gone into actually preparing these documents and i know that we have been talking about this for some time now and had a number of workshops to put all of this together and and to i guess gather in the information supplied to us by the staff so i really want to give recognition to that and i also want to encourage all of our people in our area in our region to closely look at these documents there is there are many hundreds of pages in fact of documents to look at um and to go over them and to really think about what it is that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have to assist us when we look back uh again at these documents once public exhibition has been completed so that we can put forward and in fact vote on some really good measures to take our council into a sustainable and a bright future so i think it 's really important to stress that we need our constituents to actually give us feedback on these documents thank you councillor smitten and well said um certainly do we have any specific questions regarding um the operational plan um budget et cetera or i have one to the um cfo given um the the amount of money that we 've got invested have we got um a clue of how much we will actually have in the budget from interest from those funds that are invested for the year we do have um a reasonable idea at the moment we 're returning just above one percent on our investments and we 'll update you at the qbr3 on what we expect at the end of the year thank you very much so one percent we can we can work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes thank you councillors other questions councillor pritchard microphones off microphone still off cancer picture thank you thanks here the thing that worries me is a special rate variation can normally a special rate variation is something for a specific purpose and it only goes for as long as it takes to fulfill that purpose and then it reverts it goes it 's not something that 's in built into your long-term planning could you give me a bit more detail about the reversed svc yes i think hand over to the ceo um thank you very much uh mr mayor councillor pritchard there 's uh in the long term financial plan there 's three uh proposals so um and council is recommending going with uh the option two so the first observation the first option is a baseline scenario which is continuing what we 're currently doing and what we 're saying around that is that that 's not sustainable and even with implementation of the sustainability plan creating a lot of internal savings the fees and charges will increase in line with the cpi and there 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years and cash holdings will be depleted to blow the allowable restricted cash cash levels and there 's an inability to fund required infrastructure renewals so that 's under the business as usual council 's preferred option that we 've got in this report is a 25 special rate variation which we 're calling the srv scenario and that that srv would kick in from the 1st july 2022 the 25 special rate variation will be implemented over a two-year period and it requires increases to the fees and charges based on community acceptance of user pays required savings in all expenditure lines with some moderate service level adjustments as per the sustainability plan returns operational to profitable territory within the 10-year forecast period and it has a reduced reliance on additional capital income from state and federal sources there is a third option which isn 't which we 're calling the optimistic scenario and that is for a 10 special rate variation from the first of july 2022 and it assumes condition considerable additional operational funding from state and federal government higher fees and charges major service reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the 10-year forecast so like many other councils have had approved in their srv application in recent times it has been around sustainability of the of the operations and it is uh intended that there will be a 12 and a slightly more than 12 in year two and that that that money will be retained into the future so that that 25 overall um under the srv scenario would be ongoing so in the past some councils have had an opera um an srv in place for a period of time and it 's dropped off so the former chemical srv dropped off a year ago and there were savings to to the rates line um in in the order of uh 650 000 this is intended to continue forever but we do have to go through a process of community engagement to see whether the community is is willing and able to pay for that srv and that comes back to a service level discussion um as well so if that consultation will happen council will have to lodge its application to ipad in november after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then council is able if ipad agreed to that to implement that from the following financial year so the 2020 22 financial year in what ways is it different to rate pegging so the rate pegging um is set um at two percent currently so what council 's got in this budget is the two percent rate peg in there to the maximum value but as as you would know from our discussions in workshop uh things like the emergency services levy are well outside that two percent uh the growth in wages the competition currently to have capital works done you know all of the contractors are busy and there 's higher prices coming in so our percentage growth is well beyond that that two percent however it is important to note that um part of the documentation here is a sustainability plan that actually demonstrate a number of different actions that council itself will be doing a whole lot of processes continuing those from previous years and making a more concerted effort in some areas to actually create some savings internally but we can only do that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service level so the other options basically include a service level a reduction a using up of our cash and getting into a position that that is not sustainable into the future so we 're asking council to take on and consult with the community about making informed decision to early enter into a process that keeps us as a sustainable organization providing great level of service to our community councillor right it sounds to me then that if we want to keep our parks and gardens in particular sporting grounds everything looking as good as they do and maintain as well as they are bicycle tracks in the works we really don 't have much choice thanks councillor right uh councillorism mr mayor um i understand that um levels of depreciation that we have to take into consideration on everything that council has an ownership of is quite high and the level of depreciation required is imposed upon us by state and federal government is there any chance we are able to lobby for that depreciation level to be reduced um i 'll hand over to the chief financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr mayor there is um this is not set by the government or federal or state it is set by the australian accounting board and there is unfortunately no way that we can lobby to change that what we can do is assess each asset for the best way to depreciate it and for the most efficient way to depreciate it but we cannot go against the legislation and of course the more assets we own the more depreciation we are due certainly now the appreciation is a concept that um is probably poorly understood in the wider population it actually is a proxy for the using up of an asset so you capitalize an asset at the beginning and then you use it up over the term of its life so it 's it 's actually a valid concept that you are using an asset that you have built and not actually expensed at the beginning but as i said australian accounting standards are set and lobbying for dolls is probably outside of our remit thank you thank you thank you thank you thanks for the question councillors when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who own their own homes wouldn 't appreciate the fact that depreciation of your home ends up with nothing when you 're when you own it fully out right well council goes a different way depreciation in in normal business is possibly a tax advantage for a lot of people but whereas depreciation for a council is is a liability uh councillors kessler ham did you have something to add no counsellor larter i was just going to draw the community 's attention to the um the sporting uh fees and charges in particular just because uh there was a lot of uh well i won 't say criticism but essentially uh what happened uh in the last 12 months was council had raised those fees to be in line with the previous tumbarumba council 's chain of fees for um for our sporting codes to use our parks and gardens um on an ongoing basis so what what what essentially has occurred to um adjust that um which tumber umbreon i think will find very uh very good for their uh end is that we 've met in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think uh i think it 's 500 or thereabouts for the majority of venues for the pony clubs for the soccer clubs um that 's across the board not you know i i think that 's a fair fair uh fee and you know it encourages local sport uh for for kids and uh and for adults socially so i think it 's a great thing for us to to subsidise thank you council any other councillors um counselor issuemen again i thought she might say that um thank you mr may um the fees and charges on sporting fields are they are they determined by how how high the fee is charged by whether the the actual sporting facility has food outlets at the time of usage and if so have those particular activities been investigated fully before the charges have been put on the individual sporting groups i might ask the ceo to direct that question thank you mr mayor i 'll just direct that question to uh the executive director infrastructure services heinz kaush through you mr mayor thank you for the question council esselman um i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is related to recovering part of the cost for looking after the playing fields so if clubs are able to you know include kiosks and get income off that that 's great for them but for us it 's really just about trying to recover part of the cost for looking after those fields and maintaining those those surfaces to a higher level thank you uh kathleen um i 'd just like to ask a few specific things um i 'd like to ask about the local recovery plan 1.6.5 um what does that mean i know it 's through the lm ec but exactly what is that meaning and then further on from that i 'd like to ask about rotary place the retirement village and snow view and what is the plan for the next 12 months well we 'll start with the first one um see yeah maybe yes uh mr mathik for that question i 'll hand that across to um the executive director corporate and community now i 'm sorry i just missed that that question if i could have it again um i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ln ec and um if you could just explain what that is and what you know this time next year what will we have and then after and then i 'll ask you another question after that right um the local recovery plan i believe is um is a uh a plan that we put together uh in advance of um uh experiences like we just had with the um the bushfires that were um had um in 2019 2020 so it sort of puts puts together a plan uh that details you know who does what at what time and a time frame over which um uh we can expect to recover following you know any sort of event of that nature i suppose that 's why i 'm asking is you know it hasn 't finished the council is still working towards recovery and and um you know are we still being funded for this or now does it turn into council funding things um just right now we are still receiving funding for recovery activities we have a community recovery officer on board they are currently funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the canberra regional joint organisation of councils to extend that funding funding for another two years in the affected municipalities but we haven 't got confirmation of that at this point in time so recovery initiatives still continue um and there are a range of um players and agencies undertaking those that recovery work and post june 30 2021 should no more funding be received for continuation of that work the recovery activities will be integrated more into our community development and our um place activation uh roles so that we can continue to support people and um and try and assist the municipality to get back to where it was pre-disaster um through initiatives ongoing thank you mr holton and if you just stay on screen i think the second one comes to you as well councillor han um i just was fighting just a 12 months what 's planned to be achieved with the snow view estates retirement village and rotary place particularly i think snow view because i imagine that it is on the move through you mr mayor snow view estate i 'm very pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application currently being assessed by um by uh an independent uh the uh employed um da assessment officer the at the same time the project scope is being developed so that it may be we can procure a contractor to undertake a design and construct project to deliver that project so we would be hoping uh i suppose we would be very optimistic that the da will be um assessed and ready to go by uh the middle of the year and if we do the procurement alongside that process we should be in a position to let a contract for a design and construct which would see the design occur in the winter with construction beginning and in the spring and the construction is of all the footpaths the footpaths of the caribbean works that would include all the civil works um drainage uh reticulation of um water reticulation of electricity articulation of communications all those sorts of um and and you don 't think council will be able to do that that will have to be outsourced oh the the decision has been made there 's um internally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on with uh this particular project is better to be done as a design and construct it 's more efficient and more effective because the basic um design documentation has already been achieved so it 's just a matter of ground truthing what that was and then developing up the specific detailed designs so that then the construction can occur and um that is a is a is the most efficient way of us delivering this project okay thank you mr and rotary place was question well the rotary place um this is rotary place is the um i guess supported accommodation it 's a it 's an it 's not the independent living units so rotary place the plan is just to continue uh to deliver that service through 2021 2022 and ongoing there are no plans for extending or upgrading that at this point in time and what about the independent living at this stage anything to build uh any more uh independent living units at this stage i believe what we will be doing is undertaking some investigations as to a business case around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that needs to be uh considered here is whether the private sector um is better placed to deliver those sorts of um uh facilities um they deliver the the those sort of independent living units in other places not just uh you know apart from tumbarumba so it may be worth evaluating how much council can sustainably continue to be involved or develop those sorts of those sorts of initiatives because they do have they do come at a cost thank you mr yes so are you are you thinking that it might be something that we are still to a private operator is that what you 're meaning or just in the construct well what i 'm suggesting is that um the private sector often meets that sort of demand because there are uh that they can construct it and do things in in ways that council can 't and um they should be you know in in all these sorts of um initiatives the question should be asked whether the private sector is better better positioned to deliver that service than council um given councils um got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and um and and a lot of commitments in terms of service levels and and a very broad and diverse portfolio of services they need to deliver it 's always best to maintain i think what 's called a restless eye for the public good and um that includes you know consideration of when and where council should be involved in delivering um those sorts of services thank you mr holt council has any further questions customer benjamin thank you mr mayor um just got a couple of questions i 'll start with um the operational plan 1.6.1 can i just get an update on where we 're at with the crime prevention plan please um through the chair councillor benjamin the crime prevention plan has been adopted it 's got a number of actions in it and this item under the operational plan talks about advocating to have those actions in place because a lot of those actions listed in the crime prevention plan need associated funding with it part of doing the plan was to have the strategic planning document that allowed us to apply for funding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adelong progress association is using the crime prevention plan to make application uh for their town center to do some improvements to to help improve the safety of people in the in the thank you and my question number two is um just some clarification for the community on um in the operational plan of 1.7.4 um i 'm all for um getting you know younger younger community members into um apprenticeships and and traineeships but do we know what positions will be available um in regards to those uh 1.7.4 um councillor benjamin yes um we do have a very strong entry level program and when we did the organization structure uh last year we went um through uh that and actually outlined what those positions are over a three year period and have investing uh half a million dollars into that so uh next year we have uh specific positions that we 'll be targeting uh we have employed quite a few people locally uh recently and uh towards the end of the year we will start our advertising for next year 's program so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year but also we try and match into the university year so some of these courses around engineering and environmental health and planning actually have different start dates and we try to capture those people where they 're at the point in their um their training that it is appropriate for them to come and work for us and we assist them with that training and hopefully they stay in our community and assist us to deliver those services to our community excellent thank you so much thank you benjamin anything further kessler um i just want to go to the budget and um the operational budget cb cb05 is um we 're getting solar panels on the roof in tumbarumba which is excellent thank you um just wondering what sort of saving does that get like it 's 24 000 in the in the budget do we save 24 000 within a year or what 's the life on when we get that 24 000 back which i presume is what will happen through the through the chair i 'll uh hand that across to the executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham um yeah it 's it 's variable depending on on what rebates you get feeding back into the network so it 's hard for me to to say exactly what that return is what the payback is but normally it would be we 'd be trying to get the pay back over over half probably a handful of years thereabouts so yeah it just it just depends there 's a whole lot of variables in there so it 's really hard to to give you exact numbers on that except that the intention is yes um to get to get that payback get it back as quick as as quick as we can and yeah and hopefully that would be in that six seven eight years sort of sort of mark and so it makes fun of a natural stance doesn 't it and and the other thing um i might as well keep you there through you mr mayor if it 's okay i i note that the only hall which was burnt down and i know that um the locals have lobbied very hard for that um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at eight hundred thousand dollars um just want to make sure that 's all through grant funding and just what 's happening there yeah through you mr mayor cancel ham yeah very much fully fully funded no cost no capital cost to cancel and another example of utilizing solar panels efficient as possible lines you 're just cutting out so if you can just speak a bit louder into your mic that would be great thanks do i need to repeat that or is that yes please yeah okay so yeah in regard to hall completely uh externally funded the capital works which is fantastic and the design is very much focused on being very self-sufficient in regard to energy consumption so it includes solar panels and a whole lot of other energy efficient devices which would be great great outcome thank you thank you okay something thank you mr may i have three questions um on the ipa the first one i wondered if someone could actually give me a very brief understanding of three point four three four point four integrated water cycle management strategies and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water that 's there in storage for the supply to various communities i 'd say that 's mr course through you mr mayor councillor island yes very much it includes water sewage it also includes storm water and very much takes into consideration the availability of water in the catchments yeah and drought tolerance drought resistance so they will in that strategy there will be a a view to taking a look at the betlow dam water sort resource for most most definitely fantastic that 's excellent i 'm really pleased about that critical part of the iwcm fantastic um the second one my question is probably to you again mr kush but through you mr mayor the weed action plan i noticed there 's quite a lot of consultation and meetings and so on but the finances of actually eradicating weeds in the in the council in the council area has not increased if if at all um are we in facing this particular problem in the correct manner you feel we 've got more room to move to get more finances to eradicate particularly of course blackberries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and and mr holton will be able to help out with responding to this in that we have been successful in securing some funding to do some weed eradication works as it has become a high focus following the fires and i might let might let paul take it from there mr holton thank you through you mr mayor um yeah council is very successful at um actually achieving funding to to to tackle weeds the and we we probably have been able to um secure more funding than a lot of other municipalities for that purpose over a fairly long period of time unfortunately these the size of the problem is far greater than any sorts of funding that we can possibly source to to actually make huge inroads into say eradication of weeds like blackberries in particular we were very fortunate in in achieving 150 000 worth of funding to [Music] deal with a lot of the weeds that have started to grow up with the removal of a lot of the roadside vegetation which has created a huge opportunity for the weeds to just take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start working on minimizing the impact of those those weeds now i say minimize the impact of those weights is because that 's all we can possibly hope to do with even 150 000 but uh there is a plan you know we we do target particular weeds that are um i guess nominated by um our partners in the state government as well as uh attempt to deal with particular areas where there are gross infestations of weeds um particularly like blackberries and we have had a crack at some of the blackberries this year that particularly the ones that have been springing up in the um the areas adjacent to the burnt out forests which have largely been removed so the blackberries have sprung up a lot there um i don 't i don 't personally uh have the greatest understanding of the dynamics of weed eradication but i can my my overall understanding is that we we have a program the weed action plan which we deliver pretty well in partnership with with other agencies thank you mr holton uh i might also direct you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing some concern along the road so um just note that um caster island do you have another question no thank you mr mayor that 's fine thank you very much any other questions from the counsellors do we have someone to move back oh councillor ham you 're moving out of committee i 'm afraid i have another question thank you i just have to ask the annual question about about swimming pools to um um if it 's all right with you mr mayor to the cfo um i noticed that we 're running out of loss of 914 thousand dollars predicted for swimming pools if we were and um if if we were to reinstate fees what difference would that make guesstimate um questions direct to the cfo i believe yeah thank you through you mr mayor thank you councillor ham um i will have to take that question on notice the current income is approximately the same it was when the um entry fees were abandoned so we have made up some of the losses through other streams of income but how much exactly every in-statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first oh okay so but i do get that we still bring in that 's sorry we 're still bringing in the same sort of income that we had when we charged things but because of the swipe card and because of the charges for usage and things like that we 're pretty well plattery through you mr mayor um council ham yes that is correct it 's also through additional sales through the kiosks there 's a number of um aspects to the swimming pools so council ham as as i understand it when we i 've got some feedback as i are you getting feedback missed so yes we are getting a little bit of feedback i 've just muted everyone so see how we go my understanding is that um when we when we got rid of fees we were the the the income coming through was 133 000. uh the document that we have in front of us has the income uh at now 139 000 so we 've stopped collecting um money at the gate for people entering but we have increased the the income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basically through increased usage um swipe card access uh fees and swimming lessons and of course canteen sales so uh in effect it 's um it 's proven that um you know we we can um you know we haven 't run it at the predicted loss calculus thank you counselor is someone you 're meeting um and if i might just comment on on council ham 's question mr may um there 's no way of putting a dollar fee on the social um outcomes that we 've got by having the fee having the pools open not the amount of positive um outcomes for the use of the pools right across our shire and having them free and the holiday times in the summertime is immeasurable and it 's a wonderful outcome and our crime rate has decreased so it 's it 's a bit like the solar the solar panels they um the pills are only used much when when the sun 's out so a bit like the solar panels council i am do we have any other questions do we have somebody to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimous so councillors we have the recommendation there that council receive uh the report there 's uh one and two and two has a to e because uh mr hyde mr mayor if i may um if the movers and seconders uh councillor hammond council lada would be willing i suggest that in uh 3b uh currently states draft 20 21 22 fees and charges schedule and can i just say we 've tabled an amended version uh to that to councillors today and gone through that in detail with the councils in the workshop and we will upload the amended version to the website so if i can just add the as tabled at the meeting to the end of that sentence if the movers and seconders are willing to do that counselor counselor how are you happy with that um i 'm just thinking i did oh sorry i i just want to do whether we should just discuss the sustainability document i i didn 't realize that i 'd only got to the operational plan um i i suppose um matt really did talk about it yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motion are you happy with that amendment that the the ceo just spoke about that we yes i 'm very happy with that yes okay anything further did you want to who was the mover maneuver was councillor hammond the second it was councillor lara did you want to close debate councillor hand i just would like to bring um people 's attention to scenario um the document scenario the sustainability plan the snoring valley 's council road to sustainability plan march to 2021 it 's i think it 's uh well i think with anyone who runs a business sooner or later you just have to step up and say if we keep going this way we 're going to be in trouble and um some of the things in there i 've really struggled with and particularly i have a lot of trouble with the fact that it 's um we have to be careful the grants we apply for because if we get to our assets are too high our depreciation is high and we end up with a greater loss that 's taken me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's one of the you know just i think this document is very thoughtful um i appreciate that we 've been through it well three times really to go through it and look at how we can remain sustainable i 've talked to lots of other councils across the board councils are really struggling at the moment and i do like the fact that we 're looking to start lobbying to just say we you know we can 't have this cost shifting and remain viable so um i do support at a sustainability plan and invite anyone to come and chat to me about it because um i think the the decisions made in that are very uh prudent thank you councillor ham in fact a chat to any counselor if we wish i 'll put the motion all in favor let 's carry unanimously thank you um so yeah there is a 5.2 like report bring that up on the screen just sorry i 'm not aware of that document i can 't find it so we did have a late attachment but um yes thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late attachments to 5.1 okay thank you so that concludes our meeting correct thank you everyone thank you for your attendance"

show of hands for those in favor of that so councillors to go into committee council can you move your um bag please thank you councillor hughes councillor ham council a lot of councillor hayes in favor councillor livermore and those against councillor armour and uh counselor thompson so that 's carrie i know who wishes to commence discussion well look at it doesn 't surprise me that some members don 't want to debate this because what we 've got here is an absolute tragedy unfolding in the community of what i consider to be a disgraceful notice of motion absolute disgrace we 've got a situation where the previous council has resolved to build an evacuation centre and we 've got a resolution where the previous council has resolved to upgrade the turmoil airport now in respect of the tumor airport it 's like we 're going back in time and i draw the councillor 's attention to back to the future first of august 2014 where the previous uh on a previous council uh that was headed up by mayor thompson at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a casa approved airport to basically a cow patty which had no safety inspections had no uh no ability to hold aircraft coming in an emergency and it was done without consultation and we 're big on consultation but there wasn 't any the raw following well i 'm just making the point here man uh that yeah well they might have done but once again we 've got a letter here from the air ambulance back in 2014 saying that that decision which was made with that consultation of the emergency services was going to put lives at risk and nothing changes today what we see before us today is nothing more than putting the community at risk the airport upgrade so one of the uh one of the things that the previous mayor has charged me with uh during the the previous four years was uh was assisting to get some leverage and some uh upgrades of the consumer airport given the the problems that we 've had over the years with that facility not not being up to an acceptable standard and not being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during fires and during emergency situations now i 'll draw your attention to the fact that during the most recent fires the rfs made the strategic decision to base themselves at tumen which turned out to be an absolute lifesaver not only for our communities but also the communities of canberra because they couldn 't fly out of canberra or wagga at the time to get those residents saved they flew out of truman now the reality is here uh mr mayor that we 've got a situation where the existing runway is too short to allow the rfs bombers to take off with full capacity we 've known this for some time so they 're able to do essentially 60 flights a day at two-thirds capacity and the argument is that if we upgrade the the runway length then we can basically uh have the same amount of flights per day but we 'll have full capacity which would be the equivalent of 90 flights in addition to that uh we we 're now aware that considerable investment in the emergency service sphere has resulted as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we 've been advised that a number of operators have potentially agreed to base their bombers here permanently at the airport because of that upgrade and we 've also been advised that the rfs and steph cook the the minister for emergency services has essentially approved the upgrade of the rural fire service control center in conjunction with a full-time full-time uh helicopter response based at tumit which will bring jobs and will bring safety this is something that cannot be downplayed it is a 24-hour twin-engine winch capable multi-purpose multi-weather capable helicopter that previously you would only have found at bankstown or sydney in in in this situation here we are now uh asking and putting the community into a fear that we are going to stop all this and put them at risk we 've had considerable investment from true north helicopters our whole sphere of economic uh future is based around softwoods and protecting that softwoods we want to protect our communities we want to be able to land an air ambulance at two o 'clock in the morning to get our loved ones out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point man uh and the evacuation center i mean here we 've got a situation i 've just come back from corack i 've spent seven days up there in what i would classify as a war zone volunteering i tell you now those people up there would give their right leg to have an evacuation centre of the quality that we want to build here they wouldn 't be arguing about a paper loss of 300 000 they would find it absolutely sickening that we 're even here discussing it and i find it sickening and so does the community it 's reprehensible that this even came forward anybody against discussing this in committee that surprises me secondly um as a rural rate payer and more than 50 percent of our our community are rural ratepayers 50 of the the money we get in is from rural ratepayers and i don 't have to tell you and i don 't have to tell rural ratepayers that we get very little for our prayer rates this these two facilities uh very much help the rural ratepayers it 's like insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those planes out there if they 're fully loaded and they can move i saw what the big planes did and saved adelon i went around and saw the um the marks on sheds between houses and sheds where where the retardant was dropped on rural properties that saved those houses i saw all that and yet here we 've got a notice of motion that 's both naive um thoughtless and doesn 't take into account people 's um the the suffering that people went through so i look i 'll be voting against it um well in actual fact i just to make it clear it 's only point one that 's been that 's been moved and seconded which is to receive the report it doesn 't take in the others the concern that we had one the notice of motion does not say to not proceed with it it was asking that we could deal with it and get a greater understanding it 's fine for the three councillors currently around the table who were part of the former council and understood all of all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been asked questions in the community that we haven 't been able to answer we have learned more in the last 24 hours in relation to the specifics and you know i acknowledge all of the presentations that we had but in particular to donna for her presentation but if it has taken this for it to become something that we 're actually discussing and understanding and we 're now working as a team and not in individual silos it was never indicated that it would not go ahead it was asked that we could deal with it once we had finished with all of the special rate variation and ipnr this council has inherited a lot of things that we 're dealing with and this we wanted to be able to dedicate as much time as possible to make sure that we understood to make sure that we had been fully informed we had our first briefing last thursday after the notice of motion was actually put in place so you know i um i thank donna not only for her presentation but for the phenomenal amount of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've received more information in that period of time and that is why i 'm counsellor armour as the mover and myself the seconder of the notice of motion decided that we would only put forward recommendation one that the report be received very good thank you very much is there any other may i read out what i had what am i supposed to do okay may i read out what i had written to present today saying we 've gone to this point um i 'm requesting that we consider putting a break on the latest two major projects the evacuation center comes sportscenter come basketball a function center and the airport improvements to bolster our fire emergency protection the reason i believe we should do this is really quite simple for me the amount of workload and documentation for this meeting is beyond reasonable all you can do is skim through the mountains of paperwork and hope you get it right and you know that really you do no justice to anything we are overloaded and to be honest i have no idea how our mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how our staff is coping we as a new council i believe have not been afforded the time to deal properly with the ipnr suite of documents that are due to go out for public exhibition next week and completed by the 3rd of june we are told that the new south wales government will not grant us an extension of time despite having lost more than 3 months due to the late election six out of nine of us are new to this council and to the role three of us have no experience at all yet we are told and have taken an oath that we will make well informed and transparent decisions and i quote as far as possible ensure the financial stability of the council and engage and communicate with the community implementing the community strategic plan we cannot get an extension for our ip and our documents but i suggest we should ask for an extension for these projects so we can concentrate on the rpnr suite of documents for the next three months i for one am not convinced that i have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that a street community plan is now amended even now truly reflects what the community wants having been through the changes we 've been through bushfires floods covert the last three years since it was originally written and i would be looking to revisit that document sooner than later we can now in the last few weeks at the ukraine water the changes in our life with a 30 increase in diesel impacting on all our budgets these are scary uncertain times and demand extra care in the decisions that we make our project should be self-sustainable and have business plans before we start spending our grant dollars until last week 's workshop the tenth of the third a week after i lodged a motion the motion the third of the third we had absolutely no information i 'm not saying it wasn 't out there but we had no information in this room on these projects please do not say the previous council committed to it because i was told by a ceo before i committed to stand for this role and i quote um the 20th day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been signed off and yes you can decide to reverse that decision that there will be a cost attached i may not have wanted to stand for council under the circumstances otherwise casa has not approved the extension of the runway yet we want them to nothing is guaranteed in this world the geotechnics have not come back yet with a report via the project those results could well determine where and how these projects should be built and that changed last night there were some issues with that yet architects are busy drawing outside consultant research in ways to make the project sustainable and i 'm told being delivered and according to the minutes of september 2021 it 's all okay despite the cost for the ratepayer and ongoing maintenance whole of life costs lots of incomes the sale of the 17 lots a capital expenditure estimated of 25.5 million into the community cost for provision of service etc etc there are always these brick walls i 'm sure we don 't need to have those losses if we just get a little bit more clever we need time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do that other airports like ours work profitably with the expertise in this community we can cut and they 're sitting in this damn room they 've all come out of the woodworks these experts which is what we achieved yeah yeah yeah yep can i just a little bit more with the expertise in this community we can come up with a plan that will meet all the needs but we need to spend the energy and have the commitment to do that not to be forced into rushing rushing making decisions without all the information and that 's how i feel i know that 's not how you feel john just as long as we spend the so-called free money as for the evacuation center and go figure we 're still debating networks versus coffee shop versus function facilities counting versus commercial pitches and larger windows to take into view and a large deck overlooking the same whilst we 're depriving the adjoining residents their view an outlook that they paid for when they purchased their homes please let 's do this properly allow the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most needs and not at a cost that the rate payers can 't afford because there are those out there many of them that feel they can 't afford and feel threatened by it in the same way as the other side does we need to get next year 's financials on track and from my personal perspective be assured that the safety of our community will always come first john always thank thank you very much for your presentation is there any other comments that anyone wishes to make yes i 'll just make one for the comment if possible look i i i personally just cannot believe i i mean i i hear all that but i mean i cannot believe that you know we are putting these volunteers through this there were there was plenty of mechanisms to ask these questions behind the scenes in fact i don 't know how many times i gave you advice on what was happening at that airport i don 't know how many times we had briefings it was a previous decision of the council to put these volunteers through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just it just defies belief now we 've now we 've put the whole infrastructure program with relation to the rural fire service and the government in jeopardy because now they don 't have confidence they don 't have the confidence i mean it 's highlighted by the fact that commissioner well i think it 's an issue because [Music] [Music] not we 're we 're not committed to this project we 're not fully committed the information is correct motion is correct me if i 'm wrong receive the notice of motion regarding putting on hold the tumor multi-purpose center and the tumor aerodrome upgrade project so we received something paying for them making us out to look like idiots um um why don 't we i 'm suggesting an amendment to say to clarify that we are continuing both projects i 'm suggesting that we added an amendment number two that we are committed to going forward with both projects actually [Music] and item two the council is committed to support both the china multi-purpose centre and china project that 's one and two i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know why we need a motion to progress what we 've already decided on it 's if this is just what are we just reaffirming what the previous council said was 7.5 but i would vote positively for two so so i 'm in i 'm in conflict [Music] well i 'm not [Music] thompson the second it was councillor armour not for the amendment no it was it was decided that rather than amendment the move in the secondary included that as part of their motion that 's correct yeah there 's a in my opinion there could be a bit of a problem here because the received emotion notice of motion sorry counselor i 'm just not sure that emotion makes sense no neither am i that 's right i 've got a problem with the veracity of the the argument yeah that 's the way i said so are you happy are you the mover sorry the mover of the amendment and the seconder right happy no we 've got we 've got it we 've got to put the motion sorry provide a suggestion yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receive the report and then the second one be that uh where is it gone committed to support the tumor multi-purpose center and then your second one could be the council is committed to support the tumor aerodrome project no i don 't think that 's right councillor hayes if you would like to you could move an amendment which is just not well just a moment we 've got an amendment in front of us they don 't have an amendment you 've changed the original motion right so what is one look the the issue that i have here is if you i can 't see how you can move to without one because you 've got nothing to move there 's no reason to move too through the chair if i may counsel doesn 't have to move the motion to receive the notice of motion and those emotions on the books you 've dealt with you can just move a notice uh you can just move a motion that says that council is committed to support both the tumor multipurpose center and the tumeric aerodrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most appropriate mechanism to be quite honest commandment amendment righto is there a second second council of ham i 'll put the amendment if there 's no further debate all those in favor against carrie sorry can i can i there was one council who didn 't raise a hand are you voting against it or are you obscenity it 's a bit calm can i take you back council armor is that okay yeah yeah because you knew yeah it 's okay it 's gone pretty fast so what 's happened is councillor hayes has moved an amendment so that puts aside the original motion and he has moved the council is committed to support the tumor multi-purpose center and chairman aerodrome upgrade upgrade project so what happens now is we have a vote to say about that amendment and if that amendment gets up then we actually vote on it becomes the motion right yes that 's right the amendment becomes the motion right no counsellor lara and councillor ham put the amendment forward sorry counselor sorry look look look i i don 't think we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest we 're going to record the minutes though so just make a decision so councillor hayes and seconded by councillor ham yep that read the motion out again please sorry the amendment the council is committed to support both the turmeric multi-purpose centre and the turmeric aerodrome upgrade project if there 's no further debate i 'll put the amendment always in favor against carried right now the amendment becomes the has become the motion i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried right unanimous again unanimous again righto councillors you have to raise your hand if you 're not raising your hand your boat is counted against as as a negative right right a mayoral minute transgrid i 'll move the uh the mayoral minute i don 't think we need a second do we you do no you don 't need a second one sorry just move it that 's right is there any debate councillor ham um i 'd like to just publicly thank thank ceo brett redmond for coming down from transcript um he 's come to a pretty acrimonious environment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet with us and with many of the stakeholders however he was he listened he went away looking a bit disheveled and let 's hope that he did listen and what 's more that he will act so i appreciate the council 's and the mayoral minute put forward um and just hope that we see some action which really is parallel to what our landholders are saying and i i think quite simply can we just revisit going on public lands instead of private lands more so than anything else thank you very much just just a small addition if you wouldn 't mind before community the snowy valleys community in general any further discussion i would just well make the point that i noticed there 's some lively debate occurring in in the river arena regarding the distribution of electricity and the impact of solar farms so i think that it is now becoming a more of a focus to the proposes eg transgrid that they have to deal with the issue rather than pretending or hoping that it 'll go away and it 's also a responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried urgent businesses without notice we don 't have any ten one is training opportunities for councillors lg new south wales been moved by councillor thompson seconded by councillor hughes i 'll put i 'm sorry any debate councillor hughes any debate if not i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried we 'll go to 10-2 an endorsement of the draft integrator planning and reporting suite for public exhibition now look if i can just make a comment here before we get started um these these issues are hefty tomes uh there 's a lot of information and material to be digested i think it 's important that we get them out there for the community to have some sort of input so based on that [Music] i 'll thank someone to move some motion let 's just ask a question a question counselor thompson in 2.4 in the um attachments i 'm not sure that the draft strategic asset management plan actually has on the front cover it doesn 't through through the chair that 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah because it doesn 't you 're right anyway it 's been moved by councillor ham is there a seconder council thompson any debate button um we 're all this council i think who agrees that we want our communication to be better and we want public consultation to be done well and through you mr mayor can i ask whoever is in charge of communications and engagement how is that actually going to occur if i don 't like something in fees and charges about you know the tunnel run by the stadium how is it how do i put that forward and how can i make an amendment to that oh before the public speaking it 's a public name through the mayor i 'll hand that one to mrs jones um through you mr man counselor him thank you for the question the normal submission process applies however we would reasonably expect that with the amount of engagement contained engagement opportunities contained in their engagement plan that sits inside of this particular suite of documents that whilst counsellors are out and about that you would be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a um on behalf of rayquaza absolutely and is that just through info at svc or is there a special portal no so even vip last week will be on the engagement [Music] also suffice yes ask in relation to the uh valley 's community strategic plan attachment uh document page 13 the sustainable development goals there 's 17 of them there it says that they 're adopted from the uh united nations why is why is that in there the standards for integrated planning and reporting have lifted somewhat over the couple of iterations uh this is considered best practice at the moment there is still we recognize there 's still a little bit of work to do to be able to make sure that those links are stronger um however this is council 's plan to adopt so if the feedback is you would like those removed by all means please put that forward considering yeah i 'll i 'll just uh flag that off i will be asking that that be removed i mean i don 't see that i understand that uh you know we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sustainable development goals you know on a on a local level not be you know that should be something the federal government 's worried about not us i don 't know that that should be in this documentary i 'll just note it 's all very well to say it 's on the web but a lot of people don 't engage in that process and and we do have a uh a program of pop-ups and town meetings to explain and listen to the input that the community want to give us so that 's another forum that we 've got available to us right code of meeting practice adoption moved by councillor hayes is a secular council larter sorry councillor livermore any debate on the code of meeting practice i did notice that the code of meeting practice includes a whole section on a uh access so uh it 's uh that 's something that will be uh going on into the future so if there 's no further debate i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried um committee men membership recruitment application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does have an interest here and has previously stated that so it 's been moved by councillor hayes is there a seconder council thompson i 'll put the motion all those in oh sorry any debate if not i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried review of procr procurement policy for public exhibition is there a mover councillor ham seconded by councillor larter any debate councillor ham push the button please a builder that i 've known quite well for a long long time um recently he said to me look why am i getting any work from council and somehow another he something slipped through the system that he didn 't know that the tendering system had changed so once again i 'm just wondering how our communications go for people to find out how to be part of the procurement for council i think what we 've constantly highlighted here is our communication strategy and whilst whilst we go about the process i 'm not sure that we 're getting the people engaged in the process right we certainly got people engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we 've got to go down that path every time to get people engaged i don 't think that that 's an appropriate way so maybe it 's something that we should give serious consideration to and how we can better do that you know i don 't know whether i 'm i i know what you 're saying councillor hayes you 're wishing us well what why would a builder be looking for work you can 't get a builder yeah but the reality is that that 's not the solution of the problem it 's the problem that we have in people being able to access or understand the process to access right council does that type back into our buy local policy uh it doesn 't matter last that is standalone so it 's in this policy so that means like we 're still getting um for instance that we 're still buying cars locally you know or leasing cars locally or we 're getting you know builders through you so mr mayor yes in accordance with the policy if it 's best value for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tolerance producing a tolerance there was like a yeah so you 're mr mayor there there is a waiting criteria in our attendance that has to be at least 10 percent for local content that could be whether you 're a local business a local employer or you 're supporting the local economy and community but it 's not a waiting that is price related very good um motion all those in favor against carried statement of investments 10.6 age 49 i have a mover is there any discussion anybody wish to make comments on the statement of the investment council um through you mr mayor i 'd really like to talk to you talk to the cfo i 'm responsible for her lucky [Laughter] i am looking and i 'm sure we all are looking at um our economy throughout us you know locally state federal global and um there are a lot of market influences at the moment and i jokingly said when i looked at this all it 's good the interest rates are going to go up because that will mean our some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you just tell give me a little bit of a insight about how you feel this market we 're in at the moment is going to be affecting us investment life thank you counselor just a note you go to one button hud opening and you become the button police that 's all um yeah it did couldn 't miss um just just there there 's 45 45 and a half million dollars um roughly how much in interest rates are we are we bringing in per month there so mr mayor um thank you councillor hayes i haven 't calculated it but the average interest um is 0.51 yes then you 're a teacher any further questions if not i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried we now go to the management report tumor hall we 've got a late report here so are you moving the late report it 's not so much sent shockwaves into every small community group and it 's um and i think we 're we 're going to be voting on something that really we should have around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the right way to go i will support that okay happy to move okay i 'm happy to move [Music] well i 'm happy to move the updated report i just think we need to discuss it yeah well point aren 't we moving to receive the late report oh yeah we 're receiving the late report at this stage and now we can move into committee and discuss it um happy to say that i was able to write a letter of support you were for the german community community and i can 't get past the irony that the actual um basis of of this funding is for an evacuation center so you know i find that quite ironic um happy for them to have an evacuation center i think it 's uh it 's a lot of money um it 's an enormous amount of money for a population of of you know basically this is a hundred fold more per capita than the tumored evacuation center so that 's a hundred times more per person dollars than the tumored evacuations here but i 'm happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an existing facility it 's an existing facility no no but the new one is replacing one so so that 's uh that 's what i just wanted to to get that point across button thanks councilman councillor hughes apparently i 'm going first um so the uh they are the idea is that we 'll be having this on our books as maintenance and depreciation we 've got it there already so we 're going to be putting another million dollars and at least three is about an extra 14 000 is that true yes so would we that 's all that 's a bill on our account the maintenance and depreciation if this if this if we accept this look we 've got to make a decision by the 23rd of march [Music] i think to you mr mayor and to brent i i 'm hearing this third even fourth hand that at the meeting the other day was indicated that 10 if not 12 of the money would go to story valley 's council and the way it was got to me chinese whispers it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i i would like that to be clarified because since then i 've heard from the orni hall i 've heard from cycling organizations i 've heard from quite a few organizations is this our policy that we just get a little bit of profit making from any grant that comes is another option i i i can tell you from what from reading the grant application that there is some money there looks like for council which is through their application for their sewerage and the like for their permits but they propose to manage it and to project manage the show and they 've got 90 000 i think 90 000 in there for contingencies committee i i did press it um yeah there 's a few issues with this um that at the meeting the last meeting at the hall committee um when it was announced no the grant had been successful there was a few things discussed there now one of them was within their grant application they 've allocated funds for them to do the project management probably via their architect okay now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if they wanted council to project manage it that with all council projects i think it was 12 or 12 and a half percent is the the current rate that they would come back to council for the provision of their project management so look whether there 's a bit of a gray area about that or not but but there would still need to be some involvement by counseling at overseeing parts of the work or verifying that the work 's been done in accordance with councils was it the project framework um so yeah so i don 't know that that will be a big issue the other issue yeah this because it 's an existing facility i mean council has got the responsibility for the ongoing maintenance and depreciation and so on so this project will actually lessen council 's exposure to that cost because it 's um it 's it consists of uh capital renewal plus you know new work there 's some new work and then there 's capital renewal refurbishing existing work so or existing facility so the breakdown then in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been calculated out um to about 14 000 a year now the other thing with this uh committee there they do do all the maintenance and and so on i think they typically probably spend about 15 grand a year on uh on maintenance and what have you um i mean there 's some some information in there that the uh in terms of council 's total rate that works out to be about 0.152 of rates um now the other interesting thing there is they 've looked at the sort of rate income that comes from that area it 's about 337 000 so um the bit that 's getting spent on that facility for that community is pretty miniscule in terms of the rate income that 's coming in from that area the other look there there 's one big other crucial issue with this and i know in the recommendations it 's talking about transferring the ownership now i can see a problem with that and this may be some confusion about the classification of the land but this land is um certainly to my knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ownership so well that that 's that would be asking council to commit an act outside the scope of the legislation so um from my reading of it i i don 't really think you can do as per those recommendations um now the critical thing of course is the mayor mentioned um the response has to be given back to the funding body by the 23rd of march otherwise the the funding offer well may lapse now i know the committee have written to the funding body to get an extension of time but there 's been no response so at this stage you would nearly have to assume that the deadline is the 23rd of march now at the end of the report there is a heading there of options so that 's on page 8 of the report and i mean i 'd i 'd be certainly happy to move that that resolution because i think that would um that would achieve you know the ends the committee there are trying to achieve it would allow the project to proceed yeah and then that ownership thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't transfer the ownership um so there might be other things council might want to look at down the track in terms of license agreement or something the act does provide that you can do that um but there 's limitations on that if you can 't set a licence agreement the maximum is 21 years and i think it 's more than five years it 's got to go through another process that 's yeah that 's the the impact on the council bottom line think we have to accept the grant get on and do the work it 's the reality of managing anything that you know it doesn 't matter if the department of education asks us to do a driveway we we put a bit extra on um you know i know when i was at snowy works and services on the board there you know they 'd lose on some they they win on others you know roundabouts and look it 's you just have to do it and look look the reality is i mean this depreciation i mean it really annoys me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what goes on i mean you just got to build it haven 't you yeah i mean these people need it we 've got to build it now what happens with these depreciation everyone carries on oh the poor depreciation you 're a good accountant but you know what happens with these halls and these poses we never touch them and 30 years later we get another grand and we lick a paint and we put the you know nails back in the floorboards and we go again for another 30 years that 's what happens that 's right it 's just crazy stuff let 's just get on and do it okay and i 'd like i agree with captain um thank you i 'd i 'm just wondering how we go about it have we moved any of the recommendations so it was and no but i know but in order for us to get into committee we had to move something to start with so what got moved the receiver report so there 's the opportunity for us to when we come out of out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grand and that down the track we can negotiate with the people of the tumor hall committee and see if they are wanting to become incorporated and do it at a pace so that it 's not reliant on that for the actual grant funding to go ahead if you look at option three [Music] um there are a couple of things in here and uh thanks to council livermore for that making that clear on the um on the community land which confused me even more um i i just find it difficult to to understand how you can 't transfer community land to the community but maybe there 's a way out of it i 'm not really sure about that but um you know that was that was the basis around what what the letter of support i wrote to them and they accepted that and and submitted the letter so it 's it yeah it shouldn 't shouldn 't it shouldn 't surprise them um the the other thing is that in reading it i was i i was sort of reading that the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that correct did you read that the absolutely the sewage system was upgraded some years ago weren 't they now they 're going to put a new sewage system in but i think the grey water was going into it as well which surprised me if i can just comment there um well actually under the sewage management requirements councillor the grey water should be going into a treatment system uh not that a lot do in rural areas um there was an upgrade um last year i forget the actual time of the year it was following uh when i had the blaze aid camp there and because there was a number of people there for an extended time the the system that was there wasn 't quite coping and they they got the tank it 's quite a large tank in different chambers there they got that cleaned out and they installed some new um trenches and part of this money they 've got for here is in building the new facilities or amenities is to upgrade that sewage treatment system so they 've they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively yeah well it 'll be that that would be subject to a section 68 approval so yeah thank you mr man any other comments councillors can i just say it at no fault of the committee this was received at late notice because of the way that the funding approval came through and we 've had limited time to write the report councils have raised some very good questions as you can see we 've updated the report with further information as we 've been able to do that but it doesn 't contain all information in respect to whether the land is community land or not i 'll have to take that on notice and look at our asset management system and see what it is classified as thank you that document 's in the lep i believe isn 't that right or part of the lep um yeah um the leps contain a schedule which identifies it only identifies um land that 's been reclassified um by way of the lep amendment so historically um just so happens i used to work for tamper i 'm shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2007 uh of all the community land and that one clearly identifies the doom erect reserve has been community land and there 's been no subsequent lep amendment to change it so on that basis you would take it that it is um community land so any further discussion if not i 'll think somewhere to move we go back into a way out of committee moved by councillor ham second invite councillor thompson any discussion if not i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carrie ryder now we we have before us a motion to receive the report does someone wish to add further information to that motion or just to prepared to accept that who were they airman hayes right fair enough it now becomes the motion i 'll put the motion unless there 's some debate sorry there was no amendment the mover and the second are agreed to include included no amendment no amendment it 's the motion now because they 've accepted that i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried right [Music] um i couldn 't agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public exhibition of the former batlow cannery site has everybody read that particular report so the recommendation is that the note of feedback received regarding the form of battle cannery and so forth two is adopt the former at low cannery community consultation findings any sorry is there a mover um [Music] anyone wish to speak the recommendations yeah um it 's just that it is already dated this um this report 's already dated things have moved um around in that space in involving that space already so um it 's just worth noting that um some of that information by now since things are happening fairly rapidly in battle um so yeah just thought it 'd be worth noting that even even this is a outdated six months since since or for more than that since we saw that no it 's more man it was on the exhibition of last year yeah so things have moved on in those last four months yeah well we 've had the uh the cannery sites um itinerary worker spaces taken a big chunk of that area the menshed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant applied for and except approved or won by for another chunk of it and yeah so there is things happening in that space already um thank you mr holden for your work with this i i do like the long term development concept plan i would like to remember dick cedric who was always very much in favor of having that um big block of residential so that 's exciting to see that now if that 's that is council land so then we 'd do like a snow view estate there um council could um sell sell the whole block area to a developer who wish to put into place um facilities uh for i guess um independent living um or any of those sorts of facilities have we identified any issues associated with the land from an environmental point of view part of the process there were two studies done on the uh on the former cannery site one was a an environmental or a contamination um first first pass contamination uh study an investigation that came to the conclusion that it that as developments occurred a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being undertaken on those sites so if it were to become a available for residential purposes then an appropriate stage two investigation should be undertaken for that when we we have um with the itinerant workers accommodation that work was undertaken that 's stage two environmental assessment and it did identify some hydrocarbon uh presence on the site but it was of a low level and uh easily remediated just that there was a lot of asbestos with most of that that 's cleaned up um but we don 't know what 's on the concrete very good if there 's no further debate i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried tomorrow chamber of commerce requests for funding this i believe deals with the can cabin hall oh my apologies you 've identified councillor a little more living there too is there someone prepared to move the recommendation councillor lada councillor uh is there any debate on this issue cancellation can i just ask we 're um we 're not just putting the roof on why we 're sort of putting a membrane over the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure is held up by external girders and the roof is supported underneath this idea is to resheet the existing roof structure so that the ingress of water doesn 't occur and it 's the cheapest option that 's my understanding would you like to comment the placement of the membrane would be to um i guess eliminate condensation so the coldness on the concrete from the outside causes you know the moisture in the in the hole to condensate and then drip so the revision of a membrane eliminates that issue i was just hoping that you know we 're not going to end up with a problem in 15 years i don 't believe that that 's going to be the case um first of all i 'd just like to thank the tumbarumba chamber of commerce and we 're coming to the end of um this very long project and thank you to mr holton for your work on it there 's been a bit of negotiating so um i would really strongly recommend that the council accept all three recommendations and that we get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good cancer any council has i 'd endorse what uh endorse what uh council ham said for the community of can cabin um it 's good for them to get their hall back i 'd also um highlight the fact that the tumbrember chamber of commerce has been highly critical of snowy valley 's council on numerous occasions for not being able to manage um grants and the like so um you know you 've just got to be careful i think so what they did take the issue on um and and that and that 's that 's good but um anyhow it 's it 's good to see i will point out that the gilmore hall did a similar project where they um put battens over the existing roof and clad that and that seemed to work fairly well as long as you keep possums and the starlings and the like out of it so um it 's universal it is it is so uh yeah um you know a good project um and hopefully they 'll have their hall back soon very good it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed consolidation of lots and boundary adjustments from the right leg counsellor glad you remembered him we 're dealing with the wandalga road coolies creek d.a is there a mover second if i cancel him do you wish to go into committee to debate this or sorry to discuss this yep is there a mover councillor livermore is there a secular councillor armor the look uh i i know i know this area i do know the the applicants and um and i think one of the things that we really need to do this this area was an area that was very very closely settled in the past and there 's been a lot of consolidation and aggregation of property in that area over the years there is an actual um old residence on this property not that i would consider anyone would like to live in it but it 's um it 's something that we need to do we need we need to make sure that we 've got people particularly young people um living living on on the land and here we 've got somebody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been purchased by uh by the family and i i 'm sort of a great advocate for that um i 've got issues in that um with with this one and that and and the the following um one where i 'm not sure whether the commit the the actual neighbors have been informed of the development and uh that would be the only thing i would say that you know i 'm i 'm happy for this to to go ahead despite the recommendation there i 'm happy to to to endorse that we go ahead with this um with this this project or the people will be allowed to to develop uh this land and build a house on it as long as the neighbors are informed and also that um access is safe what you said but it 's not consistent with the recommendation moved right no that 's fine i 'm just pointing that out counselor option one and option two on page 81 and what 's the difference because i 'm thinking of voting it i will recommend you that we vote in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh recommendation for counselors to consider if they were to um determine to approve the the dea application it basically just it 's saying you know determine the application um by you know and and i guess i 'll delegate to the ceo uh the uh the authority to develop the standard or apply the standard conditions applied to this type of application option two is the recommendation it 's the option two is the one that 's uh that is recommended at the at the front of the uh the report only uh summarized or much much smaller but so we have provided that option one uh in the uh you know in order to ensure that the the council councils were able to have an option to to approve as well thank you uh mr may can i seek a clarification please so um in because we 've now actually moved all the recommendations in open council when we come out of council we can ask that we vote on them separately so we can vote on one and pass it and then not the second ones um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor hayes has said earlier is that i think the lot or the parcel gland that we 're looking at going into two two parcels was actually seven parcels to start with so it 's it 's actually doing what what our aim is and that is reducing the number of small small lots and i believe there 's a provision that it can actually if we put that up and put it on exhibition for 30 days is can i just this this is presented to you for decision today yes should you make that decision uh should you go with a recommendation that will you know mean the application is refused but if you go with the option one the alternative motion that would mean that we would just get get cracking on getting the subdivision completed with the standard conditions applied my suggestion over putting them all up would be to have an amendment [Music] no it 's it 's option one we want yeah sorry i by apologize two means that they actually almost contradict each other so if when we 're going to back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass recommendation one and not recommendation two would be my understanding seeing as both were moved initially we 've got those on the books sorry no because that 's yeah well i 'm suggesting that it 's being moved to receive the report no it 's moved both and they conflict each other so if we vote on them separately it means that we can vote on one and then vote on two is my understanding any further debate just to raise a couple of points more on a planning basis um because i 'd hate councillors to be you know jumping in and think well that 's a good outcome um which it is a good outcome but i was very surprised in the planning report and even the legal advice i must say um there is a clause in the tumor lep 4.2 c which will allow this to happen okay now the planning report makes a statement that there is no mechanism in the tumor lep to cater for this the legal report did make that same comment however in the legal opinion as they do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there was no question asked of them to give any advice in regards to section or clause 4.2 c of the uh of the lep now it it is i must say it is an unusual clause it 's you could look at the hundred leps and you won 't see that clause there but it was introduced here for a reason and uh and that was this application 's the very reason um it 's uh it 's come in um so there is in my thinking there is quite a valid planning ground to uh to approve the uh the application very good and oh well just as councillor hayes pointed out um they may well have it it 'll be subject to conditions and they may well have some issues that they need to address uh in providing access to the uh to the new block um so i think they were proposing to use a crown road but the position where that comes onto the wondelga road just may not give appropriate sight distances but they they own the rest of the land so um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was raised in this report was about the isolation of the other smaller lot um now there 's some uh information there that the the applicants may be in the process of purchasing that but either way it doesn 't really matter um but the uh the surveyor was quite correct in that that 's not part of this subdivision so this subdivision doesn 't isolate that lot it 's it 's been isolated since before we were born probably um [Music] and the issue is that hasn 't been addressed that if if the owner of that land if it was a different owner and there are precedents at law in uh section 88k of the conveyancing act um they can go to the court and a court will impose an easement for access over someone else 's land and there 's as i say there 's case law and precedent for that to happen so yeah so i think there 's there 's sound planning basis to approve the application discussion back in the council then remove the council of ham second by council i 'll put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a motion before us can i ask that we can vote on the recommendations separately please be moved is there a second seconded by councillor hayes moved by councillor thompson that we vote on the recommendations individually put the motion all those in favor against carried right so will someone well if the mover and second are prepared to move an amendment that addresses those issues so it 's done oh yeah i know very good kevin i know we 'll deal with i have one item one is the remover sega moved by councillor ham second by councillor thompson i 'll put the motion all those in favor we deal with them one at a time it did get all moved for debate but then councillor thompson moved our procedural motion that we vote on them individually [Music] that 's what we 're doing that 's correct yep so i 'll put i i 'm sure my putter will already put item run so all those in favor against kerry is there a mover for item two well it so are we moving item two no no we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh just someone else can just move the alternative right move the alternative motion option option one yeah [Music] and that we advertise well do all da 's approvals get advertised or only some um a decision [Music] in accordance with uh the the relevant uh parts of the dcp um i think councillor hayes you are moving that uh the the neighbors be notified that doesn 't necessarily mean that it 's it needs to be advertised that 's outside of the that that process so the process uh has been considered but the officer determined not to um advertise it at that point so i can make a little comment here mr i think there 's a bit of confusion about the term advertising um i mean a subdivision like this is probably yeah you wouldn 't advertise it um i don 't know that neighbour notification would really be necessary and i think what counselor thompson was maybe getting at um there 's provision in the legislation that after a consent has been given if it 's formally advertised that ensures the validity of the consent so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to object to that development has got three months in which to lodge an objection after that that 's it that the gate 's shut no one can ever come back and challenge that that consent uh and that i think might have been the a bit of confusion there if i may just clarify that all of the council 's decisions on these matters are advertised and published on our website as a matter of course it 's required under legislation right oh so we have plus notify the neighbors haze has moved if you don 't have a second to yeah so this is the second recommendation if i may can i suggest that we add the word just to advise the neighbors because notify has a uh like council limous livermore has indicated people might get confused with that so maybe if you use advice yeah so can i read can i read it down for classes definitely the council determined development application 2021 0106 seeking development consent for a boundary adjustment consolidation of lots and transfer of a building entitlement to an unrelated allotment by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply a standard set of conditions and development consent to the note to to the notice of determination ensuring that the neighbours are advised so that 's recommendation that 's recommendation too that 's what councillor hayes is moving but we don 't have a secondary yet by councillor thompson is there any further debate if not i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried right d.a 11.5 d a 20 22 0 0 2 3 consolidation of band and boundary adjustment gubra gandra road the recommendation someone prepared to move the recommendation or an alternative seems to be a bit of a lethargy sneaking in here [Music] moving on item one which is received a report i 'll put the motion all those in favor against kerry how do you wish to to handle the balance of the recommendation [Music] so you just you just want to move one and two in the options in the report one one and two on pages move options um carry well i i better kick this one off of space um this one isn 't really quite the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amalgamating lots and transferring a building entitlement from a holding that has an entitlement uh to another smaller lot in the land now that 's why i specifically asked the question was there 's still a uh an idea that you would retain a building entitlement on the large residue lot and it might seem silly in terminology but the little lot is the focus of this subdivision the large lot you would consider the residue even though it 's 410 hectares so the issue is tied up with again the use of this clause 4.2 c which allows boundary adjustments typically on small lots and the ability to move a building entitlement from one to another but the the clause is very very specific in that you cannot create an opportunity for any additional building or dwelling entitlement on the on the land on the subject land so i guess it 's an issue for this particular one if they want to use clause 4.2 c i believe they can to create that little lot that they then have to forego the dwelling entitlement on the 410 hectare lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably aware of that there today i mean alternately they could there 's plenty of room there on the on the land available to just do a rural subdivision of 250 hectare lots and they 've both got a dwelling entitlement if it depends on what you know their end result is they want to achieve do they want to dwelling entitlements or do they just want a dwelling entitlement on that that small lot so whilst you could approve it um there would need to be a condition there that there would be a um you know a section 88b instrument created over the residue lot to indicate there is no dwelling entitlement or they alternately they could subdivide two rural subdivisions of um 150 hectares and have two dwelling entitlements um the other issue there will be i 'd imagine access um because they 've got to come through from gubergaan to road over the river which there 's a bridge there i see on the map um up through a parent bit of land and then um through a section of national park and and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licence agreement just with national parks to allow access um so they 're some of the little little things that would need to be done or if they 're coming up little river road um there 's some issues up there that would have to be flashed out and that 'll just have to be made aware to them because i mean the uh actually constructing a traffickable road into the property could be an issue it could be quite expensive and relatively difficult and they do say there 's an unacceptable level of impact on their locality yeah i i mean that probably hasn 't been fleshed out greatly mr holton can you speak on that um i it 's true i know nick wilton who is now he 's a he 's a town plant yes he is available on uh in the zoom room i think at the moment that would be great to have peace why he 'd make a statement technically than i there he is he 's very big through the chair the access arrangements um i think he 's got a bandwidth issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space catch go ahead through the chat can you hear us nick yep excellent yes in relation to the actual um accessing an egress from the site um this is being considered as part of the application through council 's engineer it hasn 't been considered to be appropriate for this development yeah internal access arrangements would obviously be a consideration for the the developer or for the proponent but in terms of accessing digress locations to the actual site it 's been considered to be satisfactory on this occasion so why in the recommendation that we 're not discussing what it 's written there two point um e to e the site is considered uns no no no um d the proposed development represents an unacceptable level of impact of the locality environmental planning and assessment act so the chair in relation to that i think it relates to the level of clearing that 's required in order to provide those accesses i believe ah okay yeah fire protection weren 't there what [Music] can you just repeat what you said please i believe the um the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of um bushfire but also accesses and aggressors into the site i think that 's what that uh that reference is referring to it 's clear accessible yes so it 's it 's only a bit that is clear but it 's currently used for rural agricultural uses well it 's pretty heavily timid isn 't it most of it 's stinger other than that excess bit because i 've actually been on site to have a look at it it 's it 's as steep as you could want so how did you get in [Music] and that was a reasonable access to get roughly to it to get to it yes but if you when you got to it i would have thought if you 're going to have to build a road for two-wheel drive or whether gravel road you 'd be looking at even though it 's a short distance and it 's clear of timber it 's going to be very expensive for 20 hectares of steep timberland and i 'm not sure under the bushfire today don 't you have to have two access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's with a new development i think even i think there 's a requirement under that but anyway whatever right oh well is there any more information what 's the council 's decision if there 's no more debate we 'll go back into open council and discuss the recommendation i think i think we need to know what access they plan and and once again whether the neighbors you know given that it 's going to be going the the access to this property is not straight off the wendell road it 's through various people 's properties i know but the last one was straight up from delga road this one goes off you know through people 's properties unfenced roads so we 've got to be aware of that so i don 't think there 's enough information for me to uh to to to um in favor of option one unless i get more information so i 'd be i 'd be asking personally to defer it and get to come back with more information and um and make sure they 've got consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff does does worry me in fact all of a to worry me for bushfire i don 't okay do we wish to have any more discussion if not we 'll go back into open council is there a move sorry councillor hayes when we get back in um the current motion before us the option one doesn 't are you happy to put forward another motion in relation to deferring and asking for further yeah thank you moved and ladder oh sorry and yeah ham moved and ladder seconded so you can withdraw that and then move to defer if the council wanted to do that because we haven 't would you like you 're going to do that i can 't yeah i would agree with that okay so if we go back into is there a mover go back into council council thompson second of all council ham i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried the mover and second order of the motion are you prepared to modify your motion it 's just so now what is it uh what 's what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information regarding access yes and and fire and also make sure that the the neighbors are aware that they have you know that access is available and consult consult or advise notify it would have to be a consult would it not be i think it 's advice advise is you know you just don 't know it 's going to happen this is going to happen well we haven 't voted on it yet have we but i 'm saying in the recommendation whereas consult you 're going to listen to what they 've got to say back so happy to consult themselves i am personally yeah you two are putting it now you 're amending yourself are you happy to consult no the original and with those additions yep i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carrie 11 6 is the review of determination uh rev 2021-001 proposed dwelling and ancillary structures on lot 11 bob marley avenue uh moving the recommendation uh any debate i i 'd just like to say um i voted for this last time and i 'm afraid after seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unprecedented disasters and things like that i am not a i 'm just not qualified enough um to oh i don 't have a crystal wall to see into the future and i 'm i 'm afraid that i think they should go to the landing environment court to be decided well they have that option so that 's an option it 's not removed and seconded any debate council article you wish to speak uh yeah i 'll speak against uh doing that i think we 've asked him um in a reasonable manner to uh provide information um on a number of occasions to which they 've answered the call and as an elected representative i 'm not a technical expert but you know i have to uh default to the experts that they 're provided and they 're provided to hydrologist reports uh both with significant uh experience in those uh areas there are other dwellings in that region that wouldn 't have had that i 'm not using that as a as a yardstick but uh i think they 're put in place of plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we can ever be risk-free in australia you know that 's evident so i think if they want to build it the hydrologists say it 's okay and uh it complies with with everything else then i don 't see a reason to stop it um it would be really nice to be able to just say to people yes you want to build wherever you want to build and i think that that what we 're looking at is in relation to the the disasters that we have been having whether they be fires whether they be floods is that we 're now starting to realize that it 's not always responsible from a governance point of view for us to be able to just let people build wherever we 've just been through the other discussions of access and and fire and for me personally i just see that i would feel irresponsible by saying to somebody go and build here because i think that we 're learning more and more about the true impacts of climate change which is impacting on our weather and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter period of time and i don 't think any of us can predict what even 12 months may be bringing so if they you know i 'm unfortunately they they it will probably cost them with the land and environment court i don 't want to be the one who 's who 's has that decision mr holt can i ask you a question regarding the process of the land environment court yeah well if they wish to um to take the matter to the landed environment court they can they can submit it there it may take some time for them to get a hearing uh in in such case we would then need to uh prepare a uh a response to that uh we would uh we would probably employ a land use planner uh to to to prepare our response in respect of that um we have sought uh legal advice on the uh on the uh i guess the potential for these uh this refusal to be um upheld uh the advice is uh from the uh uh legal advice is that there is uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatic when it comes to those things so i think a reasonable chance uh that the uh the decision would be upheld in the event of it not being upheld and the land environment court gives permission does that absolve the council of any responsibility uh yes that is uh that is the decision of the land and environment court and that would be uh in their entire um responsibility and council would have no no longer have a risk council would not be able to actually even question or or review that application or that decision any further discussion if not i 'll put the recommendation and the recommendation is as printed is that correct all those in favor engaged i 'll declare the motion carried council ladder against did you have one right running only later did you put your hand up i didn 't so you 're against counselor armor as you don 't know before right now thank you review of determination [Music] two zero two one slash double zero two lot 12 on bali avenue did somebody care to move the motion happy to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any debate you wish to go into committee if there 's no debate i 'll put the motion all those in sorry counselor well i 'll just make the same point that i made in relation to the previous one um that once again you know we 've got uh information and we 've ma asked ask them to provide that information in fact we deferred it we deferred both of those matters subject to further information and i think uh that they have uh uh provided provided that information and you know the expert advice is that it is okay uh to proceed and i note that we don 't have any expert advice uh which deflects their expert advice so once again i you know i i think their application uh you know is is reasonable and as much as uh uh you know i i would be concerned about um the flooding they 've obviously uh taken that into a into account and as i 've previously stated there is a number of dwellings uh closer to the river than these particular ones so that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that some other things i think this was the one that it 's the one that was checked a long time i think it 's only fair that if they 've asked for a deferral we should do that rather than knock it on the head another move who 's there ceo i 'm very happy okay good pick up even more are you both prepared yeah before you go down that track thanks without interfering in the debate um the decisions relating to these applications have to be made prior to the 15th of april 2022. the next available council meeting is on the 21st of april i understand and therefore these applications will be out of time at that point so a decision would have to be made prior to that date for them to be in time it 's 12 months from the the date of the decision um usually it 's six months but due to coping it 's been extended to 12 so again the decision would have to be made before the 15th of april 2022. thank you very much for that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very long period of time we 've had a number of reports up about this the information from officers hasn 't changed along the process so then i stand with my first motion okay i 'm happy with that council liverpool yeah if there 's no amendment no further debate i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried against the latter and [Applause] the minister of the audit risk and improvement committee i 'm happy to move that having attended councillor ham is a seconder yeah council livermore any discussion if not i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried we 'll go to minister the disability inclusion access reference group happy to move those being moved by councillor thompson is there a second hour cancer ah more not just like any debate discussion [Applause] um can i just encourage councillors there 's currently the um they 're working on the disability inclusion action plan they 're looking for people to make contribution and comment in relation to a a whole range of things about inc inclusivity it 's not just about wheelchairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it 's something that 's really important that we do because i correct me if i 'm wrong but my understanding is that at current snow valley 's council doesn 't have an inclusion or a disability inclusion action policy so you know it 's maybe something that we need to consider but please contribute your thoughts and ideas to the disability inclusion action plan and could i just add to that that like you don 't have to go along to any of the things it says a survey monkey it 's it 's quite yeah and uh the level engagement that the consultant is getting at the moment is incredibly low so i suggest if you 've got contacts just can you just send it around to everyone please very good value for money it was it was also mentioned at the meeting that you and i attended to do this today i don 't know what it was a lifetime ago um that inclusion is not part of our community uh action plan and where you should look at putting that into that as well thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a second thompson enamel automation all those in favor against carried and they 're dealing with the minister of the local traffic committee on the 23rd of february the remover councillor hayes the seconder council later any discussion any issues that anybody identify just that it 's good to have an active committee uh seemed to have a few items for discussion yeah there um and you know one of the things we looked at was the tumbarumba um main street closure and obviously um found an option there which is good so yeah that 's great to see i think councillor thompson item c um under number three i think that 's been cancelled it 's the night market yeah sounds good very good if there 's no further discussion i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried minister of the glenroy heritage reserve committee i will say that uh councillor hamm and myself went to the opening of the button hut yesterday at glenroy and there was a a real pride in the establishment they uh they 're obviously a committed group of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that proposition the display of buttons was absolutely amazing and it was a good memorial for one of a better term to the lady who connect collected that mrs jackie fox if i 'm correct uh obviously was a passion of hers and and for the family to donate it to the benroy heritage reserve is quite a significant uh addition to what they have to offer so it was a really well it was a quite a oh i suppose an emotional some extent opportunity we got an opportunity the abc sally bryant and simon turned up to do a live broadcast which was great they interviewed a lot of people and processed and it really got a good exposure and i think we need to for all our tourist activities if we can avail ourselves of those opportunities i think we need to do so anyway i 'll just leave it is there any discussion if i could just add thank you for your words because yes it was a terrific day and the pride but also our thanks to all the council staff because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny mickey mouse yeah so if you could pass that on what a wonderful job they do very good i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried item 13 is confidential when someone moves that we go into the committee as a whole confidential i was no longer called committee of the whole read out your papers that 's fantastic isn 't this let 's just just read out the two reports and the reason for them going to contribution so if we moved into it 's just going to say well yeah right the reason we 're going into confidential report is to receive either two items of discussion one writing off of debts and two is the alpine way slope rehabilitation works that 's the reason why we 're going to committee of the whole so someone moves that we 're going to the committee of the whole confidential confidential sorry confidential move council hey second of the council hand all those in favor against scary"

does give from this art following budget and i really appreciate that thank you very much i am um there 's so much discussion at love about sustainability and um our budget and our money i i 'm just wondering how the bushfire recovery is affecting our budget and you know are there costs still coming in and how much out of pocket are we with the bushfire is it ongoing because i know advanced it is just you keep coming across more and more things that have been affected it 's how are we sitting there counseling we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor cleaning that stands currently at way over 5 million dollars but it is all claimable it is affecting our budget obviously because we have to extend it before we can claim it and we also had some um items that we were able to claim this financial year that were actually financial years um bottom line rather than being able to claim them ongoing it 's mainly the recovery effort through our recovery officer and certain events that we 're um passing but lots of that is funded so so with you know money being outstanding what is the what 's the time lag from us spending it to when we 're getting money back student chair counselor here um time lag can be a couple of days or it can be we started cleaning up the road corridor probably about april last year and beyond just have been able to put this flagship so we co we carry the cash expenditure did you just save four million five five million and we 've carried that yes that 's really very good information [Music] takes us to government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know five ten years ago when it was substantial yes so good news if you buy it any further counselling yes i noticed that there are there is support on local banks as well as the major banks in their investment policy um are we spreading that round to a number of different uh banking organizations um we have an investment policy that requires us to spread it across a number of um [Music] institutions and also according to rating of institutions and it includes our local branches and our banks thank you thank you councillor i was just going to say in regard to those local banks are we making sure that uh those that we 're supporting are those that are putting back into the community in some other fashion rather than just the comparing interest rates that 's a lot um we do take it into account but it is not part of our reinvestment policy we we always take it into account if it is a competitive injury i 'm just looking at the road stabilization ceiling roads i 'm just wondering an update on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um it does take a long time to get down to can cover at the moment and just like how that 's going with it so many investments i guess yes do you miss mr chairman um yes the fire recoveries and and what was the total cost the total work was in the order about 2.3 million recovery claim is a separate claim to bushfire the removal of fire damage trees is fully recoverable and so is the stabilization works and the bushfire recovery so we 're not out of nowhere review of investment policy and public [Music] exhibitions this brings up what was discussed last time was about um using local banks over major banks i think we covered that last time thank you emotionally okay has been untended but sometimes would be good to see it in the hands of a private owner who 's able to maintain it to a reasonable standard and make good use of it yes so yeah this is more a question about process so we do get two feedbacks about maybe um that it could be called alex henkel or um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through you mr chair yeah we um we considered those submissions um but yeah they weren 't being to change the original proposal and request um in that yeah a couple of different different reasons um so it was yeah the determination of the officers was that their own drive as originally um concerns that darren wouldn 't not likely to be approved by the geographical and the other requirements so okay so any changes we have to go through that ball uh yes yes so we need to get approval from the graphic so they check that road names aren 't double up being used elsewhere and then there 's certain conditions that um require to be met before they were named policy for public exhibition what is bank flow and how would people know whether they needed to have got that actual facility so that their water how do they know that their water yeah is you mr chair um the backflow prevention device is instead as part of a beta installation so it is part of part of your your meter uh generally all residential connections include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an irrigation system connected to the attack for example with a burst or that wall as well or into the articulation system which could potentially contaminate it so this is really a formality of a process rather than everybody needs to worry about whether they 've got the signals you know yeah and they need no need to worry their mr smith thank you um i noticed that it is a progress report or an update of what is uh is in fact happening um i note number two on the recommendation that a council might progress and made on delivering the actions renewable energy install renewable energy on council buildings can we have an update in more detail from mr carson yes once again through you three years mr chair um they were very very active in whenever we 're doing any work on cancer buildings or new infrastructure opportunities to energy efficiency um i suppose yeah that includes the installation of solar panels um and as detailed in that in that report we installed solar panels [Music] as well a new very much consideration of the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progresses and certainly incorporating energy efficient devices and solar panels design process for that project further to that question the upgrading of the street lights across the lga how is that progressing yeah large largely complete [Music] um any idea of getting battery backups to batteries to store the energy that 's generated yeah yes certainly giving consideration to that at the moment it 's not quite stacking up for us but uh certainly it gets considered as that technology changes and uh i noticed that you 're going to be reassessing that in 25 months giving away technology and movement i 'm looking forward to see it 12 months to be reviewed after that so my understanding is that electric vehicles do not require servicing so i 'm just wondering why there 's an additional authority around cost associated with having an electric vehicle yeah after three years this chair i think that that 's quite quite reasonable um yeah we 've done a review just recently as was referred to um probably the area of the biggest concern for us was the resale of the electric english mustang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around town is that going to be part of our master plan with the trails that we 've just got right yes yes that 's that 's my understanding it includes in there so that refers to actually making sure that they 're located in the right sorry just another question would be climate change we had a put out expressions for interest for climate change adaptation advisory community we have an update on where that state is it 's through youth chair uh we did put out expressions of interest for faculty we received only four um expressions of interest as part of that process um three of those expressions of interest work with people outside of the municipality and one uh internal to the municipality that 's not enough really to form a committee at this stage so we 're exploring the options is there an option available to us these councils one of the options that i 'd like to put forward to councillors is that the council come together the council elected councillors to form uh upon change adaption um and that we um put something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can look at on the challenge production i think if counsellors are that would be a really powerful way of looking at the issues that we face here and how other people in other areas of the world have sorted those out so certainly once we get our group together which is our counselors workshop i think it 's disappointing that we didn 't get anybody any more than one expression of interest that is very disappointing everyone 's interested in change that 's a lot can i just add to that i think it just demonstrates just how important some of these you know some of these uh so-called climate change experts that are out there whinging about what we 're doing in relation to finance and everything else how you know incompetent we are where are they putting their names forward they 're not because you know they 're empty vessels and they 're not interested in doing anything productive just happy to sit back and smile i think there 's a comment so uh anything further no thank you that was very comprehensive thank you possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] climate change can you believe this that someone wants to put three amazing sculptures in it 's just like you don 't often get sent a little by that and wherever you are out there thank you very very much it 's just very very exciting and it looks like it 's the beginning of a sculpture trail full of snowy valleys so um just so delighted i i suppose just because we put our toes in having our sculpture in tumba rumba once and at two o 'clock in the morning someone climbed it and fell off and we got hurt that we have to be careful that that can 't happen but um and the other thing i 'd like with it is um just wondering whether the um in tumbrama they 've got a excellent um artists community artists of grade just wondering if they 're involved in any of the decisions about where it goes what the sculpture is anything like that um there 's been significant and wide scale um consultation with art groups across the whole municipality by in the lead up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i believe this included uh artisan parade it included the tumet byways art society um and i believe he had over 40 meetings with individuals groups and businesses in the lead up to that so um additionally um a local territorial committee has been uh identified and will participate in the selection of the of the artworks and the sculptures in addition to a broader um curatorial committee that works with sculpture by the sea as well so there 's a fairly comprehensive uh consultation engagement process having taken place and one anticipated to take place should they be successful in getting yeah oh well and and certainly with these three coming to tonight just very very great there 's been a lot of discussion around depreciation of assets and the depreciation costs would there be any anything for us to worry about in that regard through you mr chair um myself and susan have discussed this quite um at length and we also received information regarding other local governments and how they manage those issues in relation to public art and so it 's proposed that the sculptures live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such they will not be appreciated other councils there are presidents sitting other councils where they don 't appreciate their credit card largely because it 's very hard to put the value on it and a lot of it is irreplaceable [Laughter] i 'm very impressed with this project in the contribution of 45 jobs within inspiration groups and that 's a significant contribution to our process okay 11.6 uh block 12 monbali avenue bali attack stance for the garage and shed but we have two of these in a row but this one is not twelve that 's the benjamin council of heaven council mentioned thanks mr mayor um just a little bit disappointed with um this and the refusal of it um i don 't agree with refusing this particular recommendation but um yeah hopefully we can come up with a resolution for it that 's hopefully successful councilman then i suggest do we have consensus mr benjamin um in reading through the information that um has provided for a background of this proposal i find very difficult to to figure out the various opposing used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good understanding of where we actually sit on this uh this whole thing and therefore it might certainly my view that we accept the recommendations of our council officers because they clearly have a better appreciation of the detail of the various reports that are given to us here and it is their view that there is not sufficient information on which we should overrule the zoning rules and accept this application and granted development application so it is certainly my view that we should accept the opinions and the views of the qualified council officers and their advice that they have sought counsellors that the um if the if we do move that way and it 's we accept those the applicant still has the opportunity to go to the landing environment so it 's not being processed cancer-wise yeah look i do have some issues with the with the process and unfortunately it 's like a lot of things uh local government gets stuck you know with the responsibility of making the decision really that of other authorities to intervene you know i 'm not sure that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide about issues that relate to flooding when you know there 's expert authority areas that could intervene on these um i i think the real sad thing about these these types of things that we see is that it 's it 's a systemic problem so you know like it 's not it 's not the fact that we 're the end person saying no the problem is there 's a building right and people just automatically think that a building right means that you 've got a right a right to build but that 's not the case you know you don 't just have the right to build you have the right to apply to build and the difficulty i have here is that i think there needs to be some more owners and more responsibility put back onto the seller through the real estate to advise the the purchasers through their solicitors that this is the case because as we 've seen in this this circumstance and the next one um these people have made a decision to build a house on a property that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously off the view that it would be approved uh otherwise they wouldn 't have made that outlay of money and so you know they 've now got a block of land that they 've paid 500 000 for but you know in theory the value of that is probably uh diminished because there isn 't realistically a legal opportunity to build a house so you know what we end up being the meat in the sandwich here i mean there should really be a traffic light system um you know when you buy a house you you refer your documents to a solicitor and this listener says yeah we 're good to go i don 't see any problems with this document you 've got a building blah blah blah but there is no real look into the detail about whether it is going to be feasible to build a home on that block of land now there should be a traffic light system like a green an orange or a red and you should get advice from your solicitor and say look uh it is possible to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know there 's probably a 10 chance you 'll build a house here because there 's a lot of things to tick boxes for to get approval orange you know 50 50. green 95 but you know without that advice these people are just left paying on on having made a major investment and you know i know the director feels dreadful about making this decision because it 's not in our interest you know we want to encourage people to come and live in our in our area and we want to we want to promote living in the region but you know it 's not it 's not an easy task when you 've got these documents which are basically saying if you make this decision uh and it all turns to the custard you people are going to be held liable and that 's essentially where we 're at so you know we we we really don 't have any choice in my view other than to say no and agree with with the with the you know the professional advice we 're getting from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you know technically we 're liable for the decision so i mean ultimately this has to go to a higher authority to to be to be uh to be ticked right i think it 's a real issue i was just wondering if we could have the director speak on it on the two garage and the proposed rule dwelling and your opinion oh so the i i 'm i 've written a lot of this report particularly the areas related sorry through you mr chair um particularly the areas related to the risk and i 've consulted extensively with our risk management team who provided me with the advice that i 've included in here the assessment of the actual va was done by our qualified va assessment um contractor um and uh we went through a lot of these issues and and a meeting in particular with the consulting um uh surveyor uh for both of the lot 11 and 12s we were obviously we had differing opinions from the survey the surveyors report um suggests that both sites are blood fringe um low hazard our uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high hazard um uh flood flood uh floodways so these are two people same qualifications uh well now the surveyor the surveyor is not a hydrologist it 's a land surveyor he does um you know he does um uh subdivisions uh the um the internal council um engineer um assess this against the um the floodplain development manual as well as our development control plan and i think there was it was even in respect of the development control plan the surveyor tended to see that as being an optional document whereas we view it as an absolute you know that is what council you know the development control plan is very clear that within a floodway uh no building should occur unless it 's additions to existing um uh buildings that aren 't of so consistent with that we ca we received no requests to vary the development control plan and so on on that basis uh and the fact that there is a it 's not just the possibility of the flood it 's in there is the inevitability of a flood um that without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment councillors don 't have the information required to make a decision in favor of the um of the application so there 's a range of factors um affecting this but it all leads to the same place um to provide consent is a high risk approach and consistent with council 's risk appetite that the recommendation is to refuse but it is worth noting that we have applied for funding to undertake a decade but study this will take some time but that will certainly make the job around assessing these sort of applications a lot clearer and a lot easier uh for the future and address some of the concerns that you you 've mentioned there john because at least there will be a single document that is contemporary in nature that um that actually says this is what happens this is the flood mode of modeling for this area so i mean obviously there 's a lot of um expense and heartache in this application um and in a way you say oh well you know we 'll we 'll get a proper flood plan and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case it 's through mr chair that 's not necessarily the case the the a detailed flood study may actually rule out any further development along you know in a wider area as well so the real estate agent could say no it 's not going to happen so there would be a contemporary flood structure although the the current flood study we have um which goes back to the 80s um actually identifies in in the absence of detailed modelling it actually says very clearly that the immediate the the environments of the river should there no development should occur in those areas in the absence of the detailed flood uh detailed platforming so that 's where the dc and the dcp has responded to those uh to those paragraphs in that 1987 flood study yeah my name is the applicants have made mention of the fact that other dwellings are in existence in the proximity of this land that they 're applying to build on what 's the difference between the particular blocks of land that we 're talking about and the other areas where housing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference as to whether it 's within a you know a a floodway or whether it 's in a flood fringe so the further you get away from the main flow and a lot of that is dependent on where the river breaks its banks and where the water you know where the water goes from there and um and in and in general the um the location of these two allotments that are on just on the other side of a um uh a i guess it 's a an embankment that 's been placed there for the fomboli footbridge the bombali avenue footbridge um i think there is an assumption has been an assumption made that that actually creates some less turbulent water on the other side however the photos illustrate that that embankment is breached as well at a uh at a less than 100 year flood level uh creating uh you know a current that uh could be in the order of anywhere between 0.5 and 0.9 uh meters per second um which is i guess considered to be high hazard and uh and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ses um uh guide guidelines for this is you know the um the safe passage of a vehicle would be impossible through through that that water that depth and that current also for a you know a reasonably capable adult to actually get through that water it does put people into danger and so therefore though not it 's not just the likelihood of flood the likelihood of a adverse outcome as a result of that flood if people would you know you know people 's behavior is unpredictable if someone were to attempt to um evacuate that property and they they got themselves into trouble and the worst possible outcome could happen it still you know the question would be asked to approve this who approved this gi and this is the issue that concerns me i think the risk the risk uh response to the risk questions within the um within the reports indicate that you know it 's not just council that 's at least here it 's actually the potential inhabitants of any dwelling that 's that 's built on that site would it be fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its processes might have more information available to them than we have at this time through you mr chair very hard to say what um the landed environment there is no other flood study than the 1984 and that they would take into account all the information that we 've taken into account and um and so therefore uh it 's very hard to say which way it would go in the london environment course because you can never predict that but um that is an option that is the option available to the applicants uh as of now um and and as of and should council are determined to refuse the application but they have had that option available to them for the last month or so if they wanted to on the basis that this these reports very complex very you know time consuming to prepare um means that the time it has taken to get and it 's taken to get into a council meeting uh means that they would have had the option to um to uh seek a determination at a different jurisdiction so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they should uh determine in favor of the applicants would that then pose any risk to council or would that absolve us from risky council would not have made that decision council would not have made that um decision so council would no longer have that risk available to him but the risk would still be there in my opinion to occupants of any potential dwellings that occurred on that so um you know i know i guess some questions following the more recent flooding events in other parts of new south wales and uh knowing that there are people these days who are uninsurable because of where they have lost their their properties um or with that where they 've located their properties it does call into question the wisdom of putting um putting dwellings in particular uh in in floodways uh uninhabitable dwellings or uninhabitable buildings that 's a completely different matter but um but anywhere where you um a human being is going to reside there needs to be i think quite a lot of scrutiny and due diligence applied to the question thank you thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that in deliberations of whether we 're going to accept or reject this recommendation that it 's time due to climate change that we avoid abusing and thinking along the lines of having a 100 year plan or an unexpected event or an unprecedented event these comments are well beyond where our thinking should be we should clearly recognize that climate change is not going to have an unprecedented event ever again we have to expect the worst all the time and in making our liberations [Music] because it was it was approved and that to me makes this one apart from anything else very problematic and also they 're thinking of their floods up more some of those people have to pay 30 or thousand dollars in insurance so what will these people be having to pay for their insurance to get if their building is impacted to be able to replace it [Music] if council adopts the recommendations put forward by the officers then the officers can then attend the land and environment court on council 's behalf to um i guess defend or put their case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true if the council counsellors put a recommendation or don 't adopt that recommendation in this case it wouldn 't go to the landing environment the council has had a different third but but where officers and councillors their opinion differs in that case then if the council doesn 't support the officer 's decision then you need to have legal representation um my understanding is that with the land environment all costs are retained by each party [Music] that so 11.6 lot 12 monthly avenue recommendations are there 2003 on favor against which is alongside this adjoining lock mr holden this is the adjoining lock hey yes mr chair this is the adjoining rod so do i have a move i would simply say that it 's a very very similar case and could be treated the same way saying you uh further right of reply to us so if they come up with any further reports or expert opinions or like that further evidence yeah through your chair um not unless they put in another application they would need to submit a further application for a different application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three there and lock the left and right ball out of your own favor and against it 's counselor benjamin against thank you um 12.1 minutes council again slovana you 're right i 'm just i 'm just watching um like in the report that was i don 't know what uh council mata you 're there just to discuss how the 12.5 is going and i i 've um you talk about the benefits for our community particularly in the bushfire um aspect of it well i looked i think this plays very significantly into the argument about where we are in in whole of life costs um last night in tumbarumba we obviously copped a lot of criticism about building infrastructure and and the depreciation of that and the monetary cost from a council point of view of having to appreciate that of life asset i suppose what what this 12.5 million dollars does in relation to the airport and our advocacy plan it just provides [Music] the public with an opportunity to see what the other benefits are to the community rather than just seeing that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to this particular funding announcement the previous council tried to downgrade the truman airport to an airport that would not have been maintained to a standard that was acceptable by casa which would have meant that the standards that applied to that airport were non-existent and it would have been just like another bush paddock with a runway strip what that meant for the community was that you couldn 't do an instrument arrival for an air ambulance or a helicopter or for the firefighting increment so we were putting the community at risk weren 't so they didn 't consult with anyone they didn 't speak to south care helicopter they didn 't they didn 't do anything they just basically wanted to downgraded so they didn 't have to send the engineer from council out once a month to look at a bit of money which was absolutely ridiculous what this council has done is proactively gone about securing future funding and future proofing this aerodrome which are part of a significant transport carbon link and access accessibility for our communities for our businesses for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism operators like the good people out there true north helicopters that are running you know wonderful community based tourism programs and firefighting capabilities but what it 's done is it 's future-proofed our safety so we 've been able to now put 12.5 million dollars into this airport so that we can guarantee that in the future we can land in our ambulance aircraft here 24 hours a day in marginal weather or at night we 're going to strengthen the wrong way we 're going to we 're going to widen it we 're going to lengthen it we 're going to put equipment in that 'll make sure that it 's safe to land 24 hours a day and what that means for the community is under the current arrangements which do meet catherine approval but are obviously not to the specification that we 're achieving under this 12.5 million dollars we were able to take off 60 aircraft a day for the rfs to go on bomb tumbler umber and turmeric and butler and yemen creek and hellbingo and rundle and all these places even canberra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our current airport we can only take off at two-thirds capacity with water so by upgrading this airport so that it 's longer and wider and heavier pavement strength these fire bombers can now take off with a full load of water and a full load of which means it 's the equivalent of 90 flights a day so another third capacity so how many more houses could we have saved uh how many more properties could we have saved how many potential lives could we have so add that to the you know the the benefit of having that 24-hour air ambulance facility and you add the ability for snowing hydra to fly in a park uh busy to flying apart to keep their businesses going for our local community all the tourism operations the flying training all those sorts of things just an economic boost for the snowy valleys region and joining into canberra and while we 're in all these places connecting up so to all those doom sayers out there that say you know john larder owns a plane you know he 's only doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because i can land an airplane on the current strip i mean it 's ridiculous to say john larder owns a plane you know he 's got a conflict of interest it 's absolute rubbish because councillors all own cars councillors make decisions on a daily basis about what roads we 're going to fund so it 's it 's complete nonsense there is no advantage to me whatsoever absolutely none of none at all all i 'm doing and all the council is doing is basically ensuring that we 're protecting our communities into the future we 're making it safe we 're making the connectivity and the viability of our region more prosperous through these sorts of initiatives with the with with the assistance of people like michael mccormack and john baralaro we are really really going ahead so these are the sorts of things these people up tumbarumba need to take note of and get their heads out of the sand and have a look at the good things that are happening [Music] thank you so much with that new landing history would it be possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they used to yeah look that 's not the that 's not the initial idea certainly it will allow us into the future to look at you know a more um a more regional spoken hub type arrangement um certainly not the bigger um airplanes but certainly the bigger charter type airplanes the visit jets um you know possibly even the you know the smaller rex airplanes or honestly um definitely a possibility because i think they used to compete thank you councillor i 'm very impressed by spellata 's comments um and his enthusiasm and the question i would ask is how um how much effect this will have on the southern communities of airshow well i i think that 's the the proof in the in in the pudding uh uh council 's met at the end of the day we 're going to be able to take off uh now with the equivalent of 90 flights a day uh in a fire instead of 60. uh so that 's you know we 're essentially putting another third capacity in the air to water bomb properties that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for the southern area um you look at somewhere like kurubaya wines down in the southern region you know some somebody down there that 's really really having a go like that they 're doing great things with those vineyards all they 're all fantastic i mean the tumbarumba region for wine is probably one of the most understated regions in the world it should be right up there being held on a pedestal because the chardonnay that comes out of tumbarumba is the best in the world in my opinion absolutely fantastic and for jim and bridget ryan at true north helicopters to be able to take people from from tuna and the region from that airport on winery tours and the helicopter up to up to the purify wines and all the other vineyards up there and have lunch and sample some wine buy some product and and help that visitor economy what a great thing that is perfect thank you probably said enough on the airports at the moment you know this is the airport committee mean um did you hear anyone else from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee i um i have a concern with traffic and this comes from the rail trail and i will segue a little bit um just to say i know it 's unusual however if anyone was there on friday and on saturday on friday there was a rail trail forum on saturday there was the um official opening delay by a year of the rail trail and look it was just such an exciting day the the whole atmosphere was electric people from all over from melbourne sydney southern highlands orange um northern rivers came it was just and um every section of the rail trail had face painting or a clown or photographers or petting zoos or gin bar or musicians it was just really outstanding so just my personal thanks and i think i on behalf of all the counselors thank you very much to the organisers and that is the organizers over 15 years to getting it up and going of course the only complaint we 're hearing in tupper rubber is we now have to walk to our shops rather than having to park straight outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that 's been very very exciting i have a personal concern um having been the mother of um three children but one of them was just particularly enthusiastic on a bike and it just terrifies me though that that rail trail um goes through the wagga road and also the link road and i know how i drive on those roads and others and then trucks they just can 't pull up if a little six-year-old on a bike comes flashing out it just really worries me and i 'm just wondering if there 's something that the local traffic committee could they review it i just it 's it 's a concern we can ensure that that 's mentioned thank you mr mayor i need to seek some advice on 4.1 um all those points are relating to the um the village at thunder under the retirement building as a resident of that village should i declare a huge interest and not be involved in the discussion i don 't think but um are you intending to comment on any particular in there because this is a committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to council so it is your choice if you wish to declare and always recommend that you if you 're unsure to declare um but that 's not that you can either abstain from that yes i would like to understand from the vote um if if he has if the abstinence doesn 't and you 're going to be involved in the discussion no you 're not going to be involved in discussion so you 're going to leave the room now a chance to stress back to the room um [Music] it shouldn 't be and they should have been looked at well let 's see [Music] to see if there 's any other additional treatments that we could do very much so could i just follow on that and just ask the question i have been asked by people the public could we make traffic slow at those points but we can 't come in like we couldn 't put a 40k or 60k zone and that would be determination made by transport is it possible that we could maybe look at something like a boom gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop maybe just hit a green button just lift the boom up or something um yeah sure i 'll see similar agents like chicane um [Music] requested some consideration disability access and that so it 's a matter of finding the balance between safety disability user uh user experience etc on the side i think the safety assessment is a great way to start that one thank you okay let the minutes be accepted only favor thank you can we bring back probably yeah um minutes of the extraordinary district advisement committee this extraordinary meeting was called because there was a lot of confusion amongst the new transport committee about what their role really was and what had happened to uh to how their position had evolved from being a grant to being under transport new south wales so i 'm inviting mr holden and um just to come along the way to clarify and mrs jones clarify some of the issues that they were having around their committee we since have another meeting and at that means he was deciding to resolve jesus and that they would be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with now on which i think is really good because i think in that way they will get a much better uh community engagement getting their drivers and from the community to coming to sit down and have a casual couple and then chat about any issues [Music] [Music] i 'm just wondering um particularly light of our recent discussions how are we going with the right people with you what what is happening then it 's um so we 're not the only council going that we 're the pagans too tough we need yes exactly all councils are finding it very difficult and certainly um talk around the table is uh that they 're all struggling to uh to stay involved and and is the facts grant has that been financial assistance grants yeah yeah well they 've dropped significantly over the years and i think they 're around 0.31 and now it 's going to create a car yes it 's one of the things that impacts on the the other the what 's happening with the emergency services levy which is followed by something like 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of d because and what they 're saying is that that can come out of rates or in a regional rural community as well that it just doesn 't seem to add up that we can take 684 or whatever thousand dollars out of our rate and uh paid this emergency services maybe that 's right it 's gone up 65 last four years and it 's currently 748 per year [Music] why should councils bear that cost when traditionally the state government walks yes and i have camera jo is in there yes yeah yes i noticed on the agenda an incoming counsellor 's induction um and i 'm just wondering if there 's any plans put here in our region around our council to uh encourage potential candidates for the next election yes this is across the whole crjo so um and yes it is um the australian institute of company directors in some bridge course um and uh it will be available i would assume given that if council adopts um adopts at the new council uh that 's correct we have a training budget included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we may get some counsellors that don 't have uh experience in that area and the benefit that the council saw doing the company director 's course previously the bonus of uh what uh canberra joe is proposing is that there 'll be mixing of councillors from different councils or learning different experiences it 's a short course and because it will be offered at such a large scale across all the jo councils there 's going to be a very good rate for that if the councillors who participate from snowy valleys uh see that experience is uh worthwhile we can then expand that course out to the former company directors and the work that they have done um give some credit towards the full study eventually um in respect to your question um councillor smith regarding the pre-work with the councillors i might into mrs jones to just give us a briefing on the sessions that can be available currently consolidating a program of pre-candidate sessions information sessions for people in the community who we 're waiting um for some dates from local government new south wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently negotiating with the australian association for a dedicated session to encourage benefits across the australian valley 's region and at this stage we 're keeping that for late may so once those dates are confirmed and the program 's locked down we 'll be able to circulate that obviously to counsellors to disseminate to the community relationships having done six of us having done that course and how valuable it 's been to us as councils [Music] and the local government provides the council may close and publish that part of the meeting that deals with matters of confidential nature section 10 2 list such matters the ground on which a meeting is posed to the public must be specified in the decision to place the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the

councillors that 's on page 20 electronically benjamin wish to speak counsellor [Music] just to say well done councillor pritchard i think it 's great that you 're going i look forward to hearing what you get out of the conference you 're on mute the account for the picture that 's very it seems fairly remote to us here in china but last year i went to the ocean hadn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become much more robust and a lot of politicians who are interested in their decisions do have an effect upon us up in the catchment area it 's something i think that we should continue attending these association meetings no further i 'll put that motion all those in favor again that 's carrot dynamics the waste 2020 live conference two recommendations there you have a mover counselor here councillor pritchard um i i just like to say well done kate for finding out about this conference unfortunately i cannot go but having kate and i gone together to over to the biega valley and seeing what they did there and now we 've got all this money for fogo and for zero waste strategy i really commend you for going and think it 's wonderful you can go virtually um and i look forward to just hearing more about the circular economy and the organics and um appreciate your time kate thank you nothing further i 'll put those two all those in favor against let 's carry unanimously uh 10.3 the governance and financial report uh five recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost that you suspect i think this is a really important document to give clarity to our community about exactly how local government works my only question is around clarification on personal people being able to ask questions at the start of the meeting it 's set on page 12 it says that people can ask questions at the start of the meeting and i just wondered whether that needed further verification as here we say that people can ask questions prior to the start of the meeting so if we can have some clarification [Music] um mr acting may council cross yes we can the recommendation is put it out for public exhibition and those are the matters that we can tidy up through that public exhibition period um most councillors do it at the front of the meeting but whether the meetings actually started or not the kind of media practice is flexible flexible about that so we can reflect what our actual practice here at snowy valley 's council is during that period thank you anything further nothing further i put those five recommendations all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending a financial management policy two recommendations councillor smith you 're moving those yes do we have a second council across you should speak to that counsellor no just simply that it hasn 't been superseded by current policy council quick question um as we move into this harmonization of all our policies and wondering whether how many more policies we are outdated and how many policies they need to be still undertaken to upgrade james to respond to that please yeah so you 'll have to repeat that i 'm having a bit of trouble connecting today yes we can hear you okay the question uh is in regards to how far progressed are we on the harmonization of council 's policies ah sure okay yeah not a problem so just to put some context around the size of that particular job there were almost 400 policies procedures and forms that needed to be reviewed as part of the harmonization process and at this point in time um as of this week we 're about 71 through that piece of work and um there 's a lot moving towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a really big effort thank you that 's really great news all right there 's nothing further i 'll put those through all those in favor against so let 's carry unanimously uh 10.5 is the statement of investments do you have a member kessler ham councillor smith castle here i just had a couple of questions if you 're clicking acting mayor um the first one is probably to the cfo or the cfo the financial grants are we get anywhere on lobby for you know i mean we we should have double the amount of money we 're getting is that is that happy the reason being one we used to get the same amount of number in the same month for germa we have had no traction on that front okay and and through the jo is there any discussion there are we the only councilman of this predicament thank you very much sorry i was just trying to work on another connectivity matter um so thanks uh councillor ham through numerous acting man the j.o has been discussing the financial assistance grants and the mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here for tumba trek and had that discussion about financial assistance grants unfortunately um it is a large impact on local government has been for a number of years when it was frozen and we would like to return to one percent of uh revenue uh from the federal government however that is going to be a very difficult uh battle and certainly our discussion uh with michael mccormick uh he was receptive to hearing more but uh felt that the federal government did give quite a lot to local government in in the form of very different grants um as you know we we have many uh financial sustainability issues and uh we will continue to advocate for an increase in the federal assistance grant i 'm speaking at a general managers meeting next week for all new south wales general managers on the financial sustainability matter and one of the ideas for that is it is around improving the financial assistance grant to to local government along with a whole variety of other things so i think when we review our advocacy plan next we should consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our city absolutely thank you and my other question i 've got this over there um it 's about the removal of the fire damaged trees it 's a bit of a long go but i 've been talking to the people of moragal and they 're very nervous about um fire preparedness and i believe with the rfs council is going to run out of number can we have some details on that please town meeting yep um thank you very much uh councillor hammond through the acting mayor uh yes the the town meeting will be run by rfs next week we had a discussion with the rfs and the police and the leo con yesterday we 've produced some information to assist the rfs on getting that out on their social media we believe that that will be out soon if not already and council will share that information on our social media as well the venue does have limited capacity so we will also be aiming to live stream that information on that night it just in case uh there 's more people that want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the covert safe social distancing requirements so we will have presenters there from the leo cons of the local emergency management committee and the leo con is the local police officer stan wall he will be presenting uh bob noble will be emceeing the meeting we 'll have presentations from telstra about uh connectivity as as well as the rfs who will be the main feature of the meeting uh talking about bushfire safety and evacuation plans and all those sorts of aspects so great to see that that meeting is being held by rfs in tumbarumba at the rsl hall and keep an eye on our social media i suppose to see more information on that and the rfs social media page so can you tell us the date and the time and the venue sorry uh yes it is um at 5 00 pm um and i 'm just looking at my calendar on wednesday uh next week so wednesday the 24th of march at the rsl memorial hall in tumbarumba 5 pm 24th of march thank you very much counselor across yes i 'm distracting now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of fire damaged trees 450 000 case sounds an awful lot of money to remove the trees is that an accurate costume is that possible is that cost being paid for by the bushfire should be taken um through you mr acting mayor i 'll pass this on to the director of infrastructure it 's only a tiny tiny proportion of the total cost uh but uh mr porsche will give us an update on that thank you cancel across through here mr deputy mayor um yeah i 've overall we 've incurred expenditure in the order of about 5.2 million dollars for the removal of uh vegetation in our road corridors impacted by them by the fires to try and make those road corridors safe that work is ongoing and what you 're seeing there in the financial report is only one one month expenditure we have submitted a claim to recover the cost of that works through the natural disaster recovery funding arrangements and we have been in discussion with the administrator of that funding and they are indicating that they will cover those costs for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of months and then those emergency works provisions um and we 'll have to look at how we manage post fire every indicated previously that we are at some risk into the future because the dfra funding does run out at a point in time and the risk with those trees and our rogue corridor council is going to have to bend in those ongoing costs and as we 're already aware we 'll work through an area but with a significant rainfall um adding additional weight to the trees even though that arborist has a system sometimes unexpectedly can fall into our corridor and that 's something that we 're going to have to manage into the future which will be significant costs and you can see just the monthly cost at the moment and so you can imagine what that will be ongoing for the sally valley 's council and something that we haven 't had to fund before but we will have fun into the future mr deputy mayor i just wanted to add a question about the higher trucks that we 've hired for moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to why we need to hire extra trucks um through the through the chair i 'll just uh refer that to mr cauch as well thank you councillor council smith through uh acting mayor um yeah so part of the removal of the post-fire material from our road corridors are generated a fair bit of debris that debris gets gets shredded um some of it 's been available locally and reused locally we can but just because there 's so much of that material i think in the order of 200 000 cubes or they 're about um we 've had to find other use that material and hence we 've been transporting it to uh processing facilities that will then chip that material process it value-add and make it available as compostable salt and conditioner so that 's how that expenditures come about that you 've seen there in the financial report thank you mr deputy mayor one following question if i may if um the changes occurred to council 's term deposits um i know there it 's the me bank i don 't recall having seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment that they 're making um through you distracting me i 'll refer that to the cfo thank you thank you councilman for your um helping me you know this is not a new investment this was just a purely role we had that investment before with me thank you just while we 've got to see about not just pages to um won 't be on everyone 's charts but to see if i was giving us an update on the uh on the graph that 's in the public documents there was an error deposits a and p is missing the lodgement date which was the 18th march and the interest rate was 4.9 and it matured today just for your information council benjamin thanks mr acting there um just a question in regards to the 5.5 million dollars do we have an estimated time frame that will get that money back three mister acting mayor i 'll pass that to the cfo as well thank you very much um we don 't have a firm time frame we have launched a claim for 5.2 million this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a month to assess it and then probably another month to um consider the payment but there is no firm advertisements so we will get it before the end of the year because that 's a substantial amount of money for council this is certainly substantial money yes and we are hopeful that we will get it before the end financially thank you um could i just ask a question too just in relation to some correspondence by dr hamilton in the local paper with regards to allocation of resources and funding towards the uh uh in the tumbarumba region specifically is it possible at some stage if you 're not able to now just uh debunk that theory that that they haven 't received anything certainly mr acting mayor we can produce a report for councillors on the distribution of that funding um not only has there been significant funds spent in the tumbarumba area but with uh dedicated significant uh council staff time invested in the majority of the tumbarumba community is very aware of that as are the other communities um along yavin creek that low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult year i mean following through on the cleanup and promotion of economic initiatives to help our our local government area into the future especially the amount of time that we 've invested with the software 's working group and advocacy to various politicians about the long-term economic impact in our area i think it 's only fair that we get an opportunity to set the record straight on those matters because unfortunately sometimes people believe what they read like madison it 's not always the correct situation as in all right if there 's nothing further i 'll put those recommendations in photo against let 's carry your nose all right uh the financial performance uh templates test one recommendation there do we have a movement councillor ham councillor pritchard mr speaker thanks um john uh can i can i just ask about our income i mean it looks lovely that the income above budget for the caravan park and ross corner medical center um are a budget above budget and the commercial works um however we 're looking there above budget um i know you can 't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um can you just tell me particularly with the caravan park and ross corner medical center are they running at a profit or a loss thank you mr acting mayor the roth medical center is currently running at the horse the caring park is undecided because we haven 't actually done the depreciation calculation so i mean the figures there look pretty good for the caravan park and we 've taken a loan out so does it work that if we 're making a profit it goes straight back into paying the loan back to you mr agreement the operational profit goes into operations obviously and operational expenditure includes loan repayments okay so that 's just an annual repayment no matter what the caravan park makes that is correct all right thank you council cross yeah just for clarification the operating grants and contributions in the income section of capital grants and contributions they are done by a huge amount is that because we 're waiting for money to come yes that is a timing issue um particularly the operating grounds that are coming in for the bushfire recovery will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's there 's a timing issue here um with capital grounds it 's mostly that the milestones need to be acquitted before we get the money i just need to complement um the team that are doing the clarksville tumor row cutting up bushfires it is outstanding and i am i 'm not i i well i know there were a few concerns before the bushfires but certainly i think um what they 're doing now that that road should be stable for a long time now so if you could pass on that very much heinz um it 's an excellent to me it seems like an excellent job being done that 's the concept i 'd just like to thank our cfo for putting me in my it really looks so much easier for me to read you know thank you yeah just like the comment on the tumor wrote in terms of the previous comments uh that not much work seems to be done around the tumbarama area um that road that i and i traveled quite regularly with that project um there seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushfire damage along that road every time i go faster there are crews there working removing multiple damage and i think that 's a great job being done um i 'd like to ask a question additional issue um in the procurement section of this report for december and january no tenders were advertised and i 'd just like to ask if uh since that report tenders are now being advertised if i 'm a uh mr acting there typically over the christmas period we don 't do tenders because it 's a time where a lot of companies go into a shutdown and we won 't get the best procurement outcomes at that time so typically december and january we try and avoid tenders we have had tenders back out since so in your next report when you see the february and onwards figures you 'll start to see that more tenders are coming out thank you another question are you saying no capitalization of wages have been undertaken what what exactly does that mean um when our employees work on a capital work and building an asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs the cost of employing them which takes it off our operational expenditure and relieves the pressure on our on our operational expenditure it then becomes part of the asset value maybe consolidating uh yeah um mr acting man mr cash if you can just respond to us um pulling contracts together in our procurement efficiencies and our processes and how we make choices around purchase of equipment and plant etcetera yeah uh through through um acting there um different different strategies depending on on work focus and work workloads we always look at trying to bundle up projects and deliver them as as a higher value job to try and make sure that it 's competitive and we get the best prices we can i suppose an example of that is our resealing program so we 've um just about to kick off a million dollars worth of real sealing program covers yeah multiple roads multiple kilometers i suppose that 's an example where we 've bundled all those project all those smaller projects up into one put that out to the market to making sure that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had a look at before about buying our own equipment to do our own resealing program but yeah just because of the size of our cancel and everything else that 's associated with that it 's a very competitive market we 're actually finding that we 're getting more efficiency and more value for our dollar by going outside rather than trying to do that work ourselves and purchase that equipment to do that work that 's probably an example that i hope helps answer that question has there been any follow-up on these councils of using products like glass and recycling in their bitumen and that like is any of that worthwhile or is it um yeah look there 's some really great initiatives going on out there um using recycled concrete yeah using uh crushed glass in in foot paths and even in in road pavements in lieu of sand and other and other other materials for us i suppose again we 're a fairly small municipality so we certainly don 't have that product available to us locally in any quantity um we 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger recycler and yet it just doesn 't stack up financially for us at this stage but we do continue to monitor and watch for those opportunities and yeah if we can if we can make it work for us sure we 'll we 'll take it on is that something that jays are helping us with certainly the general managers meeting with j.o last week we talked about uh regional procurement options and how we could uh facilitate some of the reuse options into council 's work can you also help us about our uh commercial works program and how we maximize the the local content in our processes uh yeah through through for you acting acting certainly we 're always with our commercial works and um we 've got a tender in the um in the confidential section it 's an example of this we 're always looking for local content and particularly with our grant funded works it 's very much geared at trying to maximize and and stimulate the economy and using local contractors to do that so i suppose a really good example was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the main street and that we used our own guys engaged some casuals some local casuals to help help out with that work rather than contract it out and that proved that 's proven to be really successful in that we 've delivered that original project under budget and then expand those works to get a whole lot more value for our dollar the aerodrome project that we 're currently early planning stages we 're looking at opportunities to make sure that we 've got both local content involved in that there 's also potentially an opportunity to engage an indigenous construction company to help us with that project and then there will be aspects of it that will be fairly specialized which we will have to go outside of the municipality to engage people to do that but i suppose you 're very mindful of trying to get like use our locals as much as we can trying to build that economic stimulus out of the funding that we are getting and we apply the same thinking to our commercial works thank you [Music] let 's carry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonization process and community feedback we 've got two resolutions recommendations with the number two having uh a through to d we have a move a lot of different ways of getting community feedback around this issue because it is something that um all of us are going to be involved in um the rates calculator there were a lot quite a few people who accessed it um and the web page but we haven 't had any feedback from anyone then i thought that was rather rather disappointing but perhaps we can conclude with that that everyone is quite happy with what the conversation has been around counselor here um in contrary to what kate was saying um i 've had quite a bit of feedback but quite a lot of it is um off people off off farms can i just is it right that the farm valuations property evaluations that was updated last year is that correct it 's through the uh chair that 's correct councillor so so people on farms might get a bit of a double whammy because their harmonization may make their rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their property values have just gone up as well that 's correct uh councillor ham and if the people are interested use the calculator and have a look at their rates notice and check the valuation changes between the years that will also assist them to understand that there 's possibility of a contribution of an increase in man and rates that relates to their valuation and that may not necessarily reflect fully on the harmonization process however people will feel that look at the bottom line and go well here 's my increase and that 's all because of harmonisation we 're quite happy to help any of our constituents understand what the breakdown is between the evaluation difference as opposed to the harmonization process council has uh workshop extensively with the cfo on this matter we 've done significant amount of community engagement and i 'd suggest that the low feedback in some areas is because people have had so much information over the last six months and are very clear about what 's going to happen and have gone in and evaluated that but certainly that impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the harmonisation and council has workshopped those percentages for uh in a bell curve so that the council has understand what the impact on our ratepayers is but we 're not in control of the unimproved value the state determines that and it 's in relation to sales so where farmland for instance in the area the sales farmland and you know quite rarely for residential properties as well has risen significantly then valuations will go up it 's important to understand at the end of the day we collect the same bucket of money plus our percentage and that 's it so while one person might see an increase you might not hear from the person who doesn 't uh say anything but they 've received a decrease in their rates that 's all it 's all just a mix in within the same bucket and tell me how how often are the valuations done is that every five years we are um consulted uh by uh the revenue state revenue uh vehicle and um it 's generally every three years but the council can request it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and say there 's been something significantly different in that interim period and would you like to have an interim valuation so and council then assesses that and goes back but it 's at the end of the day the state values decision about whether that valuation will occur or not thank you anything further now following on from that discussion um would it be reasonable for council now to consider requesting such a re-evaluation in the next budgetary session because of the vast past of the large amount of exchange of properties and people moving from the city to the regional areas affecting our values quite considerately in this area through you missed acting mayor councillor smith it 's a very careful consideration there 's a lot of factors in that um one of the factors that you may wish to consider is about how a revaluation may actually confuse the community at the same time as what a harmonization process is undergoing but there 's certainly other factors and maybe the cfo would like to add to that now um look three years is a reasonable time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we were thinking that there was a huge change within within our council area we would possibly go to the value general and ask for a re-evaluation for this year it 's too late um the earliest we could have one would be for [Music] 2022 so um towards the end of next year as as the ceo outlined we don 't get more rates just because the valuations change but the rating burden would shift from certain areas to other areas no i would have to take that on notice so you see i 'll just ask whether the cost of the valuation is ours or the value generals that yeah i can 't want to stay tuned given that it 's too late anyway it 's probably a decision for the new council thank you council across i 'd like to just reassure the community that we 've done extensive extensive overload uh looking into this issue to get that carmelization fair and equitable and i think it needs to be that council staff needs to be committed on supporting us through that and the community can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can i add to that to commend not only the rates and the finance staff but the customer service staff and the engagement in communications and engagement team who have done a great job in making sure that there 's no secrets here we 've published documents been very transparent we 've promoted we 've offered to meet with people we 've talked to individuals i 've done that extensively i certainly don 't believe that we could have done that any more than what we have so the staff have done a great job and thank you for those people who have rung up and asked the question it 's great to have factual information rather than assumptions well what if there 's nothing further we 'll put those two recommendations all those in favor against that 's the current analysis uh eleven point two the rf best bombali brigade hangars six and nine councillor benjamin councillor ham it 's probably there but i can 't really see is this going to be owned by the rfs and so there 's that question you know who who carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to council for it uh i can probably answer some of that for you and mr casper probably i was involved in a fair bit of this because it was quite quite a complex arrangement because in effect what it what it was was the rfs had a situation where their initial preferred site for the bombali brigade couldn 't go ahead for um various reasons and so it was therefore identified that there was an opportunity to put that fire truck at the airport in little bit being on another piece of crown land nearby the complex arrangements around that were that the rfs were keen to basically keep all their assets into one precinct and a private two private members of the community owned the hangar in between the rfs and where they want to have this so what ended up happening was uh with the assistance of the community members who had nothing to gain out of this but they were they were very very uh honorable in what they did they gave up the lease on their hangar so the rfs could move in and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different site which wasn 't as good so they were being very generous and essentially that 's what this is about it 's about the crossover of that so my understanding is that council owns the land the rfs will own them anyone that builds anything on it owns it but it 's on a lease and council is a contributor to rfs as well and so it 's a win-win for us and you know personally i 'd like to thank john gregory and uh and mr cash uh for all their uh and their teams for all their assistance in getting that to where it was because it looks simple on paper but you know when you 're dealing with that level of complexity it 's not simple is it so it was a job well done by all involved so just a quick question there 's no financial information of course knowing those things not that i 'm aware of unless unless we uh give them um a discount on the on the hangar edge i 'm not sure um mr actually merrill passed that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fees and charges paid to rfs yeah um yeah no no costs no cost to cancel rfs had had some money to to support the project we helped them deliver the project through providing the provision of project management support and yeah as the acting mayor described through the helping them with the legalities hence this report that you 're seeing today it just um gives us approval to go ahead and sort out the lease arrangements we own the land not the not the building so it 's not a depreciation issue for for us um and all costs incurred by cancel will be fully recovered is my understanding thank you nothing further or i 'll put those four recommendations all those in favor against that 's carried unanimously 11.3 the draft snow valley 's children 's services strategic plan there 's three recommendations for evan councillor ham councillor cross chancellor well it 's a great day the day that we get the snowy valleys children 's services strategic plan up it 's um i 've had a quick look at it congratulations it 's excellent i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks about the children 's services and and it prides itself not only on the child care part of children 's services but certainly of the early education part of of of children 's services within our council area and we 're really lucky to have car cooler the can coburn preschool the toy library puggles and before and after school care it 's it 's um a real credit to the snorri valleys council and the fact that it 's user pays um and is not a financial burden on the council is full credit to the people who run the business um that there 's only one thing that i would add to it is um that it needs to be linked we have very uh highly trained teachers who are now accredited under the nesa standards the same as it would be if they are in us in a school and we um should link and acknowledge at those teachers are part of our staff congratulations and counselor um yes i 'd like to add to that uh three of us yesterday three councilmen including myself visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what 's happening there the manager of the services gave us a rundown and a lot of the operations and the possible opportunities for further expansion and and that that service is in fact running out of profit at this present time and council is you know council stands to gain from running this service so again i add to the comment of congratulating them on a job well done and the the children certainly were very happy and engaged and it was a very good sight visit [Music] i think he missed acting there i might also add that the greater leadership team visited uh recently and we had about 20 of our senior staff from all across the local government area and we met with the educators on site and we went through a tour through all those facilities there was very informative and great for our staff to understand fully how that business operates and the great work that they 're doing in our community um and uh we had so many favorable comments come back from the staff saying you know we knew we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our community but we didn 't understand how big and how complex it is and how involved the rostering system is for the senior staff there at cooler and all regulation around that and how they have to meet that and also our managers on site have done a great job working in with their finance partners about fully understanding the the financial costs and evaluating the fees and charges and making sure that 's fair to the families and it actually runs a very good business so very impressive where that staff have actually taken that and one of the best strategic plans i 've seen to council it 's real it 's linked into our ipnr documentation it 's got some great kpis and some great uh future aspirations for that group to to go and work forward in the future years and the families that use that service or are likely to use that service in the future will certainly see that this is a growing business and a very well-run business of council thank you could i just add to that please um mr mayor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does bring up that um there is a shortage around tumblr particularly for babies under the age of two or three and how the strategic plan is working how that that shortage can be addressed so i i particularly like the way that it 's quite dynamic and um is looking to the future and i i know it 's a big concern particularly as um we have lots of young families in tumba rumba at the moment but just to you know the council is very much aware of that and hopefully working with the community so that we can um do something about that shortage for early education and care within the snowy valleys council it 's early to add to that too we have a significant entry level program in child care and it is difficult to get staff in that area and that is most child care areas are experiencing that at the moment and certainly an opportunity for the new people uh to the snowy valleys area to get employment and um council will assist them with their training and skills in that area too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different services not child care you know we 're uh do you know whether the patient 's offering um training locally absolutely the training comes from uh counselor ham were you aware of that yes yeah and they 've just recently been advertising they that unfortunately only got one applicant and um for an apprentice and yeah with it i think we 're all aware that there 's very generous apprentice schemes and traineeship schemes at the moment so um looking at ways of re-advertising but personally i can understand why someone who was 18 may not look at our council advertising area it 's not very enticing to you know to advertise for the um children 's services in in a different way and the other problem is with trainers and apprentices at this stage you have to be over 18 to be able to work in a children 's service so um you know whereas previously someone in year 10 or 11 or 12 would leave school to go into an apprenticeship full of training because you have to be over 18 because the working children 's check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit hard with trainees and apprentices so it 's possible we could identify what training opportunities we 've got or employment opportunities and then ask the tafe to let those that apply know that did we have yeah absolutely certainly can our people and culture team are working with tafe and trying to work with the schools etc and promote the opportunities in local government for careers and as the last restructure we had half a million dollars invested in um entry level programs into council so and we 're expanding that by how we 're letting people know the variety of work available in local government excellent just to come to the strategic plan i think it really it 's it 's very commendable that that strategic plan is invest the national policy framework the early years learning framework and the early childhood code of ethics to embed all of those layers of complexity within that document i think really is very commendable because that would have been very very challenging all right there 's nothing further i put that all those in favor against let 's carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment number six arts and food and drink industries there 's three recommendations council of cross councillor benjamin this is right here and all the league has been around the other towns have got that planning ability i think this is just going to build uh capacity with attracting new businesses and it 's a great thing we 'll bring it on council pritchard did somebody explain to me in simple terms what 's artisan food and drink thank you i 'll pass that on to mr holton yes thank you for the question councillor pritchard through you mr mayor um i was in food and drink um things like micro breweries small uh cheese manufacturing uh could be artisan bakeries those sort of things um but uh it 's it 's those sort of activities that are common in these kind of locations however the current lep uh that covers the tumor area doesn 't allow for those sorts of activities to happen within the cbd and uh given that we really do need to diversify the activities that happen in this in our cbds uh largely because um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some to some degree uh these sorts of um more slightly more manufacturing type activities that are partisan based um uh are going to add something that 's uh attractive to to visitors as well as the uh the general population so uh you think about uh small sales cheese cheese manufacturing um uh it could be uh like in uh uh over in june there 's a a lolly factory there or a chocolate factory that 's an artisanal um uh food and drink factory as well or um uh industry as well we already have a couple of breakthroughs in town don 't we i think you 're subbed yeah we already have bakeries don 't get me wrong i just try to work out what it 's all about i think the most pertinent examples would be cheese chocolate licorice and of course beer or um or uh gin or spirits of those sort of things so they 're big with tourist attractions as well so currently we 're limited they 're limited to the industrial zones thank you councillor um i i i agree with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're three and a half years into a new council are we any closer to getting a snowy valley 's council ellie through you mr man yes sir yeah we are we are quite a bit closer to good together which is um which is good um following advice from the department the department of planning industry and environment we deferred doing a harmonized lep and are actually undertaking some strategic work through a rural land use study which will uh inform a new lep so it 's more than just a harmonized led so it actually looks at how we are using our land and we and determines the highest and best use of land as per the context and and it 'll be a it 'll save us doing it twice yeah well that sounds good but any timelines on that so the rural land use study is underway at the moment and we would be anticipating um undertaking the uh the new lep in the next financial year thank you very much yes i 'd like to make the connection between this uh issue and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing particularly out of normal business hours people who want to set up somewhere to do that is this covered under this program or is it a separate issue that people need to apply for planning to be able to to do that because i think it would add to the vibrancy of our towns to to have coffee vans and food vans available over weekends and holiday times and the tourists are in town and the shops generally are closed through the acting mayor um this this lep amendment does not cover that activity but a planning scheme amendment or um lep amendment isn 't required to achieve that outcome um so i will be presenting a report to the april meeting recommending a number of different areas within uh our towns that can be um permitted for mobile food coffee vending um there 'll be a limit to the number of that can go at each area and there will be a permit and and fee required to under oh to do that well that will be recommended in the report um however yes we will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the case is it is it uh is it is there any way we can make it a requirement that those proprietors except for fakes and whatever uh are locally based i mean because we don 't want people from uh you know middle of south australia popping in here every weekend to you know take business away from the coffee shop in answer to your question mr acting there um yes we can we can put whatever requirements that are uh are needed in there i guess what we need to uh be mindful of is balancing out um the diversity of offerings that people might want to have and at various times uh we do look for um you know other vendors to come in from other places because they do have products that aren 't normally that aren 't readily available and you know in our local and and vendors from here people who have those food vans and coffee trucks they regularly would travel to other municipalities as well to benefit from events and activities over there but in terms of um the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a weekend so it 's you know let 's say um adjacent to the um the bull paddock uh where the skate park is i 'm sure parents would enjoy it being able to access a nice warm cup of coffee while the children are um on the on the skate park or up at the lookout for example uh in and i 've only mentioned tumid in those two examples but um there are other places throughout the municipality but we 'll bring a report with a range of options for council to consider and and i see it as being uh something that needs to happen sooner rather than later or in terms of the report that is there 's nothing further to put those uh do we have enough what i 'm saying is do we have enough industrial land to keep the demand in that area at the moment through the acting mayor uh no this won 't impact on on our industrial land as such it will provide alternative locations for this type of industry um we do have a shortage of industrial land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's lep amendment number five rezoned land out at gilmore for industrial purposes now that um that amendment is uh is very close to being wound up and should be completed in june uh ready to go to the minister for uh signing and ultimately being gazetted so we 've been working on a couple of strategic planning initiatives thank you further i put them through all those again that 's carried unanimously 12.2 the minutes of the disability inclusion access we 've got correct meeting we extended the contract for the external but internal volatiles the internal audited with the external touring organization their contract for another year so that gives a lot of independence and checks and balances to what happens in council i think the the role of eric is smoking all of those things that the council undertakes and i think it 's um you know the community can be very assured that all very robust uh things around what what happened what happened to the being council we also farewelled that is francis the chair who 's been a very very capable wonderful chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her we uh invited carol and rosetta to join us she was interviewed sometime within that timeframe we didn 't need to go out to advertise again we were able to contact her and we wanted to continue again that 's carried unanimously uh 12.2 minutes for the disability inclusion access reference group two recommendations there to mover council cross council of benjamin council yes i attend these these meetings and at the last meeting uh it was we the current disability action plan has expired and we need to be doing another one so that will be happening in our subsequent meetings any further well i think i 'm sorry just to add to that i think one of the very important things about that that community is that it brings the services together for services that provide disability support services together so it uh it gives us an idea to hospitalize what you know what 's happening in that space what 's needed how can the council support it so i think it 's a very valuable community [Music] well i 'll put those minutes all those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of the development league council smith moving them yep council ham second speaker suspect uh yes look i 'd um i think the banter community is very fortunate in that some good input has been uh made into the battle area particularly since the fires i know that our community and corporate director attends the meetings um and we 've had a lot of input from the member for warwick dr jeremy gur a lot of input has gone into the battle community and a note that the development league is going to be incorporated in the not too distant future and i 'm wondering if there can be any comment made from the director of community and corporate affairs about the changing relationship between council and the matlow development league following their incorporation and if there is more that they will be able to achieve that council need to be involved in too directly uh yes i can answer that through you mr acting there um so fundamentally if the bentload development league becomes or when they become incorporated and as has been explained at the at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down that track it doesn 't mean that um so for myself i won 't attend their meeting i have a commitment to attend as well the i 'd say the tumor chamber of commerce and industry meeting they 're an incorporated association not a section 173 committee um that hasn 't lessened my commitment to attending and then and providing updates on the activities of council and also um uh seeking uh input from those committee into committees into um activities and initiatives of council what we 'll cease is um the presentation of these minutes in particular to council meetings regularly the groups will have much more freedom to be able to apply for and receive and actually determine how they spend funding through initiatives that they may wish to put into place the the groups will also have the capacity to um still put their opinions to council as as a as a representative body that is operating within the terms of reference that they determine through the incorporation process so the fundamental difference for them uh will be that um they won 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly onerous um requirements that are there under the um the local government act uh section three five five um and for council uh you won 't see these minutes regularly but you may see on occasions uh letters coming in and and maybe reports that uh that are more specific to initiatives and activities thank you anything just looking through those minutes um they asked whether um about the accommodation that 's going to happen in battle for itinerant workers um and they would like it to be expediated just wonder if we could um ask the director of infrastructure just or or maybe of community and corporate services um when when is that predicted that they will arrive in battle um thank you for the question and through the acting there um so i advised the committee at the at their march meeting that the project you know is clearly subject to our project management framework and as such there are a range of you know gateways that they need to to go through so i can 't say precisely when that project will be completed and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that specific issue but it 's not going to happen overnight i know that much and and it will need to get all the relevant approvals and and the designs and there 's quite a bit of work to be done in terms of managing that project but i 'll hand over to uh heinz there thanks thanks paul through you acting acting mayor um yeah projects scheduled for completion in december this year so early planning stages at the moment sorting out designs some of it 's on crown land so we 've got yeah so we 're working through getting getting those planning issues sorted um get a da in and yeah working towards december completion and will they be built on site at all uh um hasn 't hasn 't been confirmed yet we 'll we 'll go to the market and see what the see what the market comes back with as far as that goes so we 're not wedded to um must be constructed on site or or you know some other mechanism it 'll be depending what we can get best value for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best outcome excellent thank you and a part of that best outcome clearly for the battle community and the apple industry would be um the timing of getting it completed because of the accommodation needs in the early summer or late spring for the identity workers just a couple of things just as uh obviously recommendations to cancel there i know that uh most of them have been covered off through um customer requests and so forth through the council already but uh just two things that stand out to me um is the possible look at subdivisions that 's something we 've spoken about previously and i think you know covert and you know the bushfires and everything has sort of distracted us something a bit from that but that 's something we need to focus on for up there you know where it 's you know snow view type of state or something could i just ask mr holden to respond on that in regards to the development forums we 've got coming up thank you for the question yes mr acting mayor the um we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be doing one in tumba rumba during the afternoon and one in entombment during the evening at those meetings it is planned that we um we i just present to the developer community the real estate community and any other interested parties um base essentially we 'll start with a planning 101 just in case anyone in the room doesn 't under understand the planning system but we 'll move through into where we have land availability uh for residential purposes and you know we we know that um in battle in tumbarumba in turmeric in most of our towns there is adequate land zoned for the purpose of residential um the issue is uh that the people who own that land um have not have not shown interest in the past in developing that land for that purpose now the other thing that we we want to do at this forum is to um i guess present the opportunities and the demand for residential housing in terms of data so that that may encourage the owners of the land to maybe work in partnership or network with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and and and maybe develop some of that land for that purpose going forward um up until this year all population predictions for um the snowy valleys uh basically had the population going backwards but we know that situation has changed and that sort of information we will bring to the table and i 've i have been in discussion with um department of planning uh industry environment about them assisting us to get our population predictions more accurate based on current trends rather than what we traditionally base it on and that has been the past um and the other thing i wanted to just bring up quickly is the toilets i think yeah they 're obviously asking for some um urgent um upgrades or something on to the various toilets around the place but i think there needs to be and i know it 's a discussion that is going to take place hopefully about what what the service levels are at these particular establishments you know because we just can 't uh you know like keep on going like in the good old days and servicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just ridiculous so we 're going to have to make some hard decisions about what stays and what goes and consult with the community about that they cost a lot of money to obviously update and to service so you know we just i think the feedback back to the community is just be prepared you know that 's the debate we 're just going to have to have in the near future is is is what service levels of those those facilities are going to be i mean we want to have good facilities and we want them to be clean and we want them to be first class and if that means uh cutting back on a few of them so we can do that well that 's what we need to do thank you mr acting man certainly a very valid point for us at the moment and meeting the standards of those facilities has been an issue and that 's why we have a number of very old toilet blocks that are currently closed because they don 't meet the standards and i believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before council in a workshop next month and i know councillor pritchard has also spoken uh you know with the coveted outbreak about having toilets that don 't have um you know doors that you 've got to touch and all that sort of stuff you know they 're the sort of things that we need to look at urgently rather than you know the soldering on the same hole yeah absolutely i think not only too much excruciating detail you have to battle to get into the ones down at biller park yeah they 're modern new ones but they really are a job to get in there without having to get hold of everything which is in complete contrast the one down at the basketball court which you really don 't have to touch anything extra that is yes i 'd like to ask the director for infrastructure regarding um forum that you 're talking about have you or will you be contacting directly possible developers around the the region generally to come to that forum and be involved or will it be a general invitation or advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of our media channels including social media as well as um directly inviting participants that we are aware of that will include people like um you know surveyors who are involved in you know developments uh as well as um people who are actively um i guess resourcing developments thank you very much through you uh miss acting could i ask paul holton if we could get a list of all the people that we contact in regards to the developers forum through you mr uh acting there certainly uh when we have that list developed we 're working with i 've already i 've been working with the tumor chamber of commerce on on this uh project and so i 'm looking for to them to assist with uh through their membership base and uh and i will be reaching out to the other commerce in the same way thank you once we have that available i 'll certainly furnish you with it thank you paul what i 'll put those minutes all those in favor against that 's carried unanimously we 've got the minutes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel a hand counselor right i attended this meeting um once again that look they do an amazing job out there and i encourage everyone to go and visit it thank you very much to the people in council who put the big blue sign out on the right on the road near the rail trail because the number of people dropping in has um increased greatly um councillor wright and i were out there last monday i think a meeting with the committee because there 's sub-committees and there 's three different committees and and with the new governance level coming in and should they incorporate or should they not um and we had the director of corporate services come along as well and i think we um hopefully we are laid fears and saw the positive in getting an mou and moving forward because it it really is um an outstanding museum within our council area and you will get it right all right put those threats all those in favor against karen uh 12.5 is the talbingo progress and rape post association council of cross councillor benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to report that they that organization is moving towards being an incorporated body which i think could be a very change so it provides us with a conversation to them about what 's happening in council we need them to have a conversation with us about issues [Music] mtv project thank you mr acting mayor um i 'll pass that on to the mr okay so um the bingo mtb um report has been delivered uh which is uh the feasibility study and business and associated business plan uh that 's been completed and i believe an application has been submitted for funding to uh undertake the the bigger project fantastic thank you [Music] welcome further put those minutes all those in favor against that 's carried unanimously uh 12.6 is the minister of the chairman district community transport advisory committee three recommendations council costs you can run them those two items together so long as there 's no prospective uh vote against those items so mr acting mayor if you 'd just like to clarify whether anyone wants to vote against those items and once that 's done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those elements together all right so 12.6 we 've got three recommendations uh and 12.7 we have further two recommendations does any councillors see any uh reason to vote against those no so if you want to move that way councillor across do we have a secondary combined council of benjamin all those in favor against it 's carried unanimously so we 'll deal with uh 12.6 and 2.7 concurrently and deal with the five recommendations and you 're moving that way councilman uh do we have a second council of management councillor cost yes there 's been a lot of confusion for this committee they are a section 355 committee that they don 't they no longer needed to be that way they uh were very unsure of what their role actually was because initially they were responsible for running community transport but since we had since 2016 i think it is the council has received the funding for community transport in uh from directly from transport to new south wales rather than through grants so based on my i attended the first meeting in february where i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a series of issues that they really needed to have clarification around so i said to them that i would invite the director of communication community and corporate with cfo and the governance manager along so that they could put those questions that they had to those to those people and that happened as an extraordinary meeting that we had on monday and i think at the end but they were really um they really understood much more clearly what they would become and what their role was nothing further i 'll put those five recommendations all those in favor again let 's carry it unanimously uh so that draws a close to the ordinary uh section of the councilman um just before we move into confidential i 'll just remind everyone that the uh there is that uh uh meeting at the rsl memorial hall on 5 p.m wednesday the 24th of march through the bushfire and tumbarumba um it 's an opportunity for the community to to come and ask questions and speak to all the representatives there from the various agencies and once again i i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief superintendent bob noble um for not only chairing that meeting for us but he 's been a wonderful advocate for the snowy valleys region and he 's positioned as the chief superintendent of police for the area and he 's been you know a great ambassador and a great friend of this community through that role and uh you know we certainly couldn 't have achieved what we 've achieved today with with the likes of the very um capable dealings that he 's offered us so um you know i 'd like to you know personally just pass on our congratulations and our sincere thanks from the council for all those efforts over that uh period along with everyone else involved with that uh bushfire recovery it was you know it was certainly a torrent time for everyone after that uh horrific event and we 're trying to move on so all right uh where counsellors participate in meetings remotely by an audio visual link they can they continue to be obliged to protect any confidential information considered at the meeting where meetings are close to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they participate in the meeting in a location where it cannot be seen or heard by anyone else in confidential today we have 13.1 right of the debts 13.2 proposals to release ross corner medical center 13.3 10-20-21 the mr677 alpine way slope rehabilitation works 13.4 the confidential statement councillors and 13.5 the chief executive officers annual performance review from december 2020. do i have a movement seconded to move into confidence cancer speed cancer benjamin all those in favor let 's carry on"

those minutes from the last meeting be accepted please counselor hand move counsellor hughes seconded any are there any corrections if not no no but i would like to speak on the um on the point of order which i found a bit confusing at the time that was upheld and it was upheld on the grounds that it was um disrespectful and and i don 't see that and i went back and had a look at it and all i basically said was what i considered to be um responsibility for the merger and uh you know i just i just can 't see that but i but i did go back i had a look at some of the correspondence that that has been appearing on facebook and i said and about me excuse me yes we 'll ask you just to wait we 'll move in second the minutes and then if there 's business arising you can discuss it there because unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change if we 're actually going to be voting on them so the minutes as they have been presented and then you can raise that in in business arising okay thank you yep so the minutes have been moved and seconded and if there 's no corrections to the minutes i 'll ask that the everybody they are correct all those in favor against its carriage unanimously thank you now we go to business arising councillor hayes yes so so i went back and look at some of the some of the um some of the facebook uh rants from from when when i was the mayor and in it i 'm described as a goose uh i 'm described as being gutless by yourself that 's it uh and and i think that 's disrespectful so you know i i 'm saying that to quote the truth which is the facts which is what i 've done shouldn 't have been uphold but i will i will say that to call me gutless on facebook is disrespectful and and there 's a there 's a plethora of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from up from other people and i don 't think that 's fair and i do think that 's disrespectful and i think people should know that that 's all i have to say thank you councillor thanks for the opportunity to present that any other business arising from the minutes if not we 'll go to page sorry we 'll go up to report 11.6 as we have no we have no correspondence petitions notices of motion and nominal

early childhood education within our tumblr and surrounds uh this report asks particularly there 's four recommendations there i 'll speak to recommendation number three which is to determine in principle to make council land available for the establishment of a new principal intel rumba now at this stage the land has not been identified and that that is something we would not be presumptuous enough to state because that is a discussion that comes back to council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all neighbours stakeholders before we make that statement about what land it is but um so we 'd like that in principle that should we be successful in the grant that we could approach house to get land and also before we get there we 'd like a little support from council for our application thank you do i

very much thank you councillors will return back to the or move back into the order of the agenda page 29. and i 'll call report 10.1 councillors training opportunities the local government new south wales courses for councillors there are four recommendations i 'll move the recommendations sorry council move councillor hayes do i have a second one sorry councillor idol 's already seconded councillor hayes did you speak to the recommendations yeah happy to endorse this happy thank you anyone against did you want to close debate councillor hayes no thank you i 'll put the motions then all those in favor against carriage unanimously thank you councillors in relation to the business paper we moved to page 33 i call report 10.2 that is the 2021-22 delivery program half-yearly progress report for july to december 2021. there are two recommendations someone like to move those recommendations uh mayor chaffee sorry and seconded councillor ham did you want to speak to the to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair thank you does anyone have any questions or speak against if not then i 'll put both motions all those in favor against ben carrick unanimously thank you if we move to page 38 of the business paper i call report 10.3 which is review of the procurement policy which is to go out for public health exhibition there are four recommendations on that page do i have somebody to move and second those recommendations could we perhaps just move um recommendation number one madam chair um sorry recommendation one has been moved by council livermore do i have a second and for that council a hand i 'll put that recommendation all those in favor [Music] just yet did you want to speak to the motion um counsel a little more well the the reason i 'd uh um receive the report item one there i think before it went out on public expedition there 's a couple of changes i 'd like to see made with the draft that was with the procurement policy statement um it 's basically saying that the policy does not apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um the procurement does um cover disposal of assets and so on uh my point there would be that if uh we should be sort of looking at creating a livable playing field if you like um i 'd see no reason why the provisioning internal services shouldn 't be on a par with any procurements for external services so we should be benchmarking if you like against external services the other change i 'd like to see was in clause 4.1.4 it 's under the heading of ethical behaviour and fair dealings the third paragraph in that i would like to see the the words wherever possible deleted um that 's right at the end of that where it 's talking about uh procurement should always be done you know with integrity and honesty and fair dealings and so on and then wherever possible so my point there would be if those criteria can 't be followed then perhaps we shouldn 't be looking at the procurement so well basically what what i would um propose there that the the sentence doing um to the uh in the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh internal services or the leasing or the sale of council land and then with uh clause 4.1.4 sorry council a little more can we just clarify where that is in the document um well the statements right at the uh pretty much at the beginning of the document under the strategic purpose yeah the statements here at the front of the document ah from internal so you 're saying internal should be included in it it should apply yeah to uh policy does not apply so you were saying it should also apply you should apply to uh council 's own dealings [Music] if our cfo will actually make a comment in relation to that point please thank you from the chair internal services can range from financial services that we provide internally to our departments or government services can also range from our stores being utilised to distribute oils or ppe and if we don 't exclude that from the procurement policy then we will basically have to request clouds for all our internal services providing reading council now irrespective of the value of the service in accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd obviously go through the procurement process and we would acquire those oils once they sit inside the organization if we use the oils for that high lux or that camryn we don 't go through a process of procuring that oil for that so it 's procured into the organization through these procedures that are listed here but inside once it 's inside we don 't go through any procurement process between different departments to then allocate that out but um council livermore you may have a way a way that you 're interpreting that we 're not interpreting what you 're trying to say well mate perhaps the uh the wording should maybe clearly articulate what your counselors may i suggest that we move into committee because we 've moved beyond the point of speaking too and we 're looking to put some wording together so it 's appropriate that i think we move into committee for the purpose of discussion someone like to move in second that way please move council a little more seconded councillor arnold that we move into committee for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with one which we 've got on the table and we leave two three and four till next month because there 's significant changes being talked about here we do have a procedural motion thank you i 'll i 'll put that we move into committee for the purpose of discussion or those in favor against councillor masters against all of the councillors are in favour it 's been carried um councillor hayes did you want to elaborate on what you were saying please no i think i think it was fairly clear um yeah we can vote on one and we can receive it and then we can deal with it over at a workshop and and then then bring it back to the next council meeting did you speak i 'd like to support a councillor hayes because um to me it 's my understanding if i 'm not corrected if you receive the report that does give us as well 28 days to make changes and um so and if we 're still not happy we can bring it to the march we need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today um my understanding is that we 're only doing one which means that we 're not sending it out for 28 days okay so it just means that we 're just receiving it today which means if we want to have a look at it but it won 't go on exhibition for 28 days correct me if i 'm wrong that 's correct so the motion is to just receive it if counselors want to provide comment and operational way through we can represent the report to the march council meeting i 've just um i could just ask the cfo if she has any comments in regards to timing and our order requirements around this particular matter it gives raw declare um there is no timing requirements of dispatch the auditors have been looking at this and requested an update by the 31st of december 2021 but further months not make any difference thank you you have an existing policy place thank you so council as my understanding and i will be corrected if i 'm wrong is that we 've received the report and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report in the march meeting so if someone would like to move back into council and we will just moved council a hand yeah secretary councillor livermore that we move back into council all those in favor against it 's been carried in unanimously no okay so it 's been moved and seconded did you want to close debate council a little more um no look i think that 's all right as i 'm saying and other councils might have some other issues um with it but if we uh yeah discuss this further then and have a further report of the next meeting in march i think we can thank you because any of those i 'll put motion one that received the report on the review of procurement policy for public exhibition and ask everyone those in favour against it 's been carried unanimously councillors to page 41. i 'll call report 10.4 it 's the community assistance policy and it 's again the public exhibition we do have four recommendations i 'll move all four move councillor hayes do i have a seconder yeah councillor livermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-explanatory thank you thank you is there any further discussion or debate in relation to the motions there being no further discussion i 'll put the motions all those in favor against carriage unanimously councillors to page 44 oops for report 10.5 and that is the statement of investments for january 2022 there 's only the one recommendation i 'll move sorry who was the councillor oh mayor chaffee sorry mayor chaffee has moved the recommendation that 's been seconded by councillor ham did you want to speak to the motion country i think it 's self-explanatory madam chair there any further questions or queries in relation to the report there aren 't i 'll put the motion all those in favor thank you encourage unanimously counsel us to page 47. i 'll call report 10.8 which is the quarterly budget review as at the 31 31st of december 21 we do have two recommendations smooth counsellor hand second and councillor ival councillor hans did you want to speak to the nation i was wondering if we could go into committee events yes certainly so you 're moving that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand that would go into committee do i have a second one we have mayor chappie secondly against councillor hayes are you or against it i 'm full um well you 're looking for your place councillor ham i might just ask a cfo if there is any comment that you would like to make in relation to the you don 't have to if you don 't want to thank you this is the regular quarterly update on council 's finances and you would see in the quarterly budget review statement that i recommend that it is adopted and my opinion is that we are currently offering to achieve the budget with the adoptive changes to it thank you counselor um why your mask is off if i quit through the chair um can you just explain to me in the operating performance ratio minus 5.6 as an indicator and we original budget minus 3.3 like to me that shows alarm bells [Music] it simply indicates that we are currently forecasting a larger deficit than original it has to do a lot with ground funded um income also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable increase to the deficit so most of the increase in the deficit came at cubia one not cuba two currently this one only increases the deficit by 175 000. and you canceled 50 when they approved qvi 1 had good reasons to make these changes so from my understanding simplistically we 're getting more grant funding to run the council at the moment than we are operational okay that is correct that 's the answers of writing revenue on page 11 of the statement shows that it is deteriorating meaning that we actually are increasing our external income from grants and in proportion our own source is reduced thank you does anyone else have further questions while we 're in committee hello finally um did you remove your last capsule story big questions more clarifications um just going through a lot of the uh actual year-to-date figures oh well it 's right through the statements page 61 62. um well there 's uh situations on those statement pages where there 's sort of some fairly big discrepancies in year-to-date figures and rejected year-end results and so on now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to timing of payments and capitalization of wages and various things but so without going to necessarily individual explanations for these i 'm just thinking for clarity in the future where there are those sort of discrepancies that are fairly significant if there could be just a notation to explain what they are just because otherwise we see a major discrepancy and that there 's no explanation as to what it 's about and then a lot of the times just a simple you know administrative process that hasn 't been undertaken yet so but i think just the clarity of reading these will be handy those explanations could be given thank you does anyone have any further questions in relation to that madam chair if i might ask a question of this cfo uh you might notice noted here that unrestricted cash reserves are estimated to be 2.9 million at year 's end which is within council 's policy requirements could you just tell us what the policy requirements are um four million dollars free cash thank you very much indeed thank you no further questions or discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move council a hand if i have a second one counselor either i 'll put that motion all those in favor that we move back into council it 's been carried unanimously we do have the two recommendations do we have the original mover and seconder for that we did just verify for the minute taker hammond thank you so if there 's no further discussion or debate i 'll put those motions all those in favor against being carried you know thank you councillors to page 53 and i 'll paul report 11.1 that is the can cover vacant land lots 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 of dp 220570 requests for purchase there are five recommendations on that page moved by councillor hand all five no no no i i wouldn 't um like to receive the report but i would like to have an amendment to um yep so i think what you need to do is to foreshadow the amendment before we call we can actually because it hasn 't been moved and seconded if you want to present 0.2 or something different you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just kind of um no real i 'm not a real estate um expert here but i do spend a lot of time down at cancub and i hear a lot of the discussion i an expression of interest is probably a nice way to go but in this hot property market i would have thought an auction would have been better and i was fairly sure that 's what we discussed at a prior certainly workshop if not council meeting that um make the most of this hot marketplace okay so no i have to say could we change it especially if you just do get an option so yeah so you 'll just before you move the other part you 're actually stating that point number two or recommendation two is approve the sale of lots 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 through an option so that means that we will then need to change point three and i 'll seek advice from the um ceo in relation to the wording for that to ensure that we 're it 's just changing the word so approve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess and determine the successful auction bids for the sale of land as described in item trees so you might want to change that to to the successful auction or to the allocated auction reserve for the sale of land reserve right i think we need to stick to our reserve so can you just give me five minutes and i 'll copy and paste this and work on it if you wouldn 't mind thank you then i can share the screen we can work on that so we can move and version you would like to move on the changes you proposed and i will work on the wording as you 're in the discussion that suits at this point i think counselor ham has decided to adjust um [Music] thank you are you happy with that council enhanced that 's been moved by councillor hand do i have a secondary for that councillor ival did you want to speak to the the martians counsellor i would be interested in other viewpoints of other councillors mr mars i would be interested in the viewpoints of other councillors um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interested would you like to move into seeing as it 's going to be an open discussion and not necessarily okay thank you very much council moved by council a hand that we 're going to committee for the purpose of discussion do i have a secondary for that council of livermore so it 's been moved and seconded by council as ham and livermore that we 're going to do into the committee for the discover for the purpose of um discussion can i ask all those in favor against this councillor hayes council or lata but it 's been carried thank you councillor i uh canceled him um yeah i i just want to say knowing those blocks they 've got views over the cancun it 's a very beautiful place and i i think it will draw a lot of interest so council on thank you madam chair i am i also agree that we should go to a an option process because these will be sort of afterwards [Music] any further discussion or queries in relation to the um yes i would we 've recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticized quite strongly um and repeatedly and and quite seriously i think as well um about that process um and and i think that um the expression of interest um means that we 're when we wouldn 't be as uh as much at risk um reputationally uh as we were following the sale of the unpaid rates so that 's that was just it 's it 's just uh something to note um before you know there was as i said there 's no advantage to council for um for some of the claims that were made that we you know the the the process was stacked uh and we brought in outside bidders now i don 't think that 's the case and there 's no advantage to council but we did cop some reputational um damage there and i think it was very unfair and as i said there 's no there 's no advantage but this does put us back in the position where we um we uh could suffer some some more risk and uh certainly that expressions of interest are quite common these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there so they 're just my thoughts um but i 'm you know i 'm happy either way okay any further comment any questions councilman sorry sorry that 's just brought to me a question because um if we could i 'm not sure which directive to talk to the financial implications from being an expression of interest to an auction is there is a is one more expensive than the other the ceo is probably the person who will explain that to you um [Music] my understanding was that they they carry with them the one has different costs associated with it because you 're actually then going to be paying the auctioneer then you 'll be paying a percentage of the works but i 'll ask the ceo to outline the difference in cost between an expression of interest and the function thank you madam chair for summing that up because i didn 't hear the pre-entry into that concentrating on this um so for an auction of uh sale of land we will have to go out through a procurement process to determine uh what real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a process involved in internally costs with that and there will be a a amount that has to be paid to the successful auctioneer for the sale of the land whereas with a expression of interest process um that will be run internally the costs are likely to be lower and there 's no agent to pay any commission to if you like so slightly lower costs but you have to weigh that up against other lower costs against the likelihood you 're indicating around an auction may attract a higher bidder and so they may be offset hopefully that answers your question thank you um can can i just clarify a comment that counselor hayes made madam chair yes look i i think council hayes has raised a valid issue here in so far as the perception out there i think it 's important that we correct that perception i think the community need to realize that when council sells land for unpaid rates the only benefit that flows to the council from the proceeds of that auction is to pay the unpaid rates any revenue above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the land if that person can be found and i might ask the general manager to explain to the community that if the owner of that land is not identified what happens to the proceeds from the sale through the chair councillor chaffee the proceeds of the sale if the landowner can 't be identified or found goes back to the public trustee so it doesn 't come back into council reserve and if the public trustee is able to locate the the person in question then that money is passed on to them and if they 're not i 'm not entirely sure what that process is whether it comes back to council or not i think it 's very important madam chair that the community realized that the council doesn 't benefit from an escalation of price by way of auction or any other it 's all the benefit to the council and the community is the unpaid rates revenue has received thank you man chappie um i have one just one query in it to go out to an expression of interest um does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be for the expression of interest so if it goes out for expression of interest does council actually seek a commercial value of the property or do we just um ask people to make an offer so the officer recommendation uh says there that that within 20 of the market appraisal so we would get a market appraisal on those properties and we would only sell it if it 's in within 20 if it 's outside the 20 um staff may still present that to council for a decision outside of that 20 but it 's delegating if it 's within that 20 for the staff to proceed thank you in the uh in the attachments that we were given before this um there are appraisals there and suggestions of price so we 're aware thank you any further comment or discussion while we 're in committee for slipping students it 's usually through your agent that you work out with your agent which is the most beneficial way they might maximize the best return so thank you councillor just one further question to the ceo is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to auction does that mean it 's just going to take a lot longer through the chair we will have to follow a procurement process that will take a little bit longer and once we do that one public process even if it 's not sold at auction we can then negotiate directly following that point so it will slow us down for the procurement of the auctioneer but apart from that no thank you so i suppose counselors before we move back into council you need to decide do you want to continue with the wording that the ceo has up there or do you want to go with the original recommendations so with that in mind um i 'd like to ask somebody move back into council do you want me to well we 're in committee do you want me to share the screen and put some options up my word thank you yes thank you council 's to be on the screen on the you know there i 'm sorry it 's it 's not that great so um that 's the motion amended as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have what we 've been in discussion uh been working on an alternative motion that captures uh the details number four is a bit counter intuitive in it just we would have to add an extra e regarding so i 'm looking at the bottom one at the moment as i 'm given that there 's a number of different implications there for a different method when we have to meet the provisions of the local government the staff have quickly in the background uh prepared an alternative motion because there is issues around the details there 's a very big difference in what resolution we need for a expression of interest first versus an auction council wouldn 't this be useful if we defer this to the end of the making excuse me i think the difficulty arises is that even if we leave it at the end of the meeting we the ceo will still have to to work through it without the rest of the meeting to work through yes and we do want to experience well i 'm not sure about the heading now you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just find underlining did this really distract him when you 're trying to read it so seriously i think we should say that council proceed to sell lots sell the land lots 1 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 dp by public auction at public auction right rather than implement sell sale proceedings seems to say sell the landlords 11 12 13 14 15 16 at public ocean at a time and place to be determined yep that sounds good to me are you happy with the other four or the other three uh yeah fair enough no yeah i see what you 're getting at but anyway look i just think that it 's uh it 's important that uh if we go down the private uh the auction process there could well be land that doesn 't sell so someone could make an offer so i think items uh section three of that motion covers that i think that 's correct thank you councillors does anybody else want to make any comment are you happy with the wording just really just checking in with the mover and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsellor i both happy with the new wording yes okay so we are actually still in committee so we had um asked that we move out of committee of which council i have and i think council livermore had already indicated we 'd move out when we stopped so it has been moved that we or it has been put that we move out of committee all those in favor against harry so council as we have before is the the recommendations that have been moved and seconded council of hand did you want to speak to the motions thank you for your time thank you okay i 'll just read out what what we 're about to vote on councillors the council proceed to sell land lots 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 of dp220570 at public auction out of place and time for a time and place to be determined number two is that council delegates authority to the chief executive officer and the mayor to take the following actions pertaining to the property specific in the report to set reserve price for the sale of properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private treaty and accept offers for sale of any property that fails to sell at auction and then point for is that we authorise the application of council seal on the sale of land i 'll put those those motions be passed all those in favour against it 's been carried unanimously thank you councillors councillors to page 56 i 'll call report 11.2 which is the sale of the water race within lot 1 dp 791035 at tumbarumba there are four recommendations someone like to move and second those recommendations thank you councillor ham do i have a second urb for those recommendations did you want to speak to the recommendations at all notion um not really i think sounds um very reasonable after talking to the directors about it thank you any discussion or debate yes um but i 'd like to uh understand why we 'd be selling this um not for not for what it 's worth rather than should we get shouldn 't we sell it for more than a dollar like if if i if i buy land for example um a disused road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department and i pay costs as well so and and that 's reasonable um what why are we discounting land council has if you 'd like to put an amendment well uh only that 'll be at market value that 's that 's what i 'm i 'm just asking the question why why are we why are we giving land away can we have clarification on the uh from the writer of the report as to how they determined a dollar yes i 'll ask the ceo to speak on the report um through the chair um mayor chaffee in regards to the report on the second page you can see their previous resolution in regards to selling water races for one dollar i believe that there is other precedents where the sale of the water race has been in relation to market value so there 's precedence for both if you would like to move your amendment and change three the sale price will be within 20 of market rate if you take the 20 that we used in the previous resolution but it 's fully up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's obviously cost associated with going to get a market price etcetera and i am unsure of what the market value of that particular parcel or portion of land would be so at the moment we have the motions on the book so councillor hayes if you wanted to change it we would need an amendment i just asked the mayor and seconder whether they would uh be willing to change it to market value councillor councillor here um the report is written by the director of infrastructure i was just wondering if he could speak on about how much land are we um talking about and like doesn 't guesstimate the value of what what are we talking about we 're talking yeah i 've got no idea what we 're doing in terms of what costings wouldn 't be councillors we 've moved beyond the point of actually debating the motions at all so if somebody wants to continue discussion we need to actually sorry go into committee as we move beyond the um [Music] thank you councillor hand it 's been moved that we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by councillor hughes i 'll put that motion all those in favor against it 's been carried unanimously thank you so that was councillor ham and councillor hughes for that just for the thank you okay so councillor ham if do we have the director yes mr corsh if you could respond to the question please thank you for the question through you madam chair i suppose yeah the um the termination of a dollar was um due to uh precedence in that that 's the amount that was charged previously with with in similar matters um i suppose and it 's and it 's not my role to debate so i 'm only providing um information but i suppose from my perspective that the parcel of land is very small it it it separates two allotments that were previously won one allotment so this land was was resumed for the purpose of the water race so for me it makes sense it gets returned to that allotment and there 's significant cost in recons reconciling or reconsidering the subdivision and getting it all included into one allotment and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that cost is significant probably more than the value of the land when you 're taking or count the size of it anyone else have queries or questions counselor so counselors any any further comment or discussion just the comments i 'm sure you know um this little president 's a good one for the uh for the gilmore farmers i 'm sure that they 'll uh they 'll latch onto this straight away councillor hughes um we 're assuming it 's going to be um sold directly we 've not got great audio visual communications here you 're gonna have to project your voice so it goes through the live stream um the proposal here is that the sale go direct to the land holder of the property so it would be unreasonable to sell a water race uh to an alternative person who might set up their tent in the backyard of someone 's property so i think direct the land holder is appropriate and allowed for under the under the legislation so councillors if there 's no further discussion in relation to what sorry madam chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i think it needs a bit of clarification if your pardon me uh the the point is that it 's a precedent being set uh i 'm led to believe that the water race is invested in the snowy valley 's council whereas i think the gilmore situation may well be different i don 't think it 's the land is vested in the snowy valleys council i just think that for clarification we may need to take that into consideration uh look as i said i think a precedent 's been set there are a number of blocks of number of water races that have been sold particularly in the batlow area and there 's a a number of that uh water races in the tumbarama area and i 'm not sure whether they 've come to council 's attention or not but i think there is a slight difference between the uh the gilmore valley situation and and the water race situation and i don 't know if you how you feel about that councillor hayes i was um just stretching it a little bit there councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe but but remembering of course that you know in some cases the the land in the gilmore valley was resumed from the from the very families that uh own it now so um so so that was that and that i might also say that i wasn 't suggesting in any way that it be sold to anyone else other than that the landowner whose property at intersex thank you councillors um just a a point before we move back into council in order to vote on the motions before us councillor hayes if you were wanting to change it to market value it would have to be an amendment because it goes well beyond the scope of what is currently there so it 's not something that could just be decided so if you wanted to move an amendment once we go back in to council then that 's what would that 's what would be required um yeah look i 'm not sure if if the if the movement second head don 't have the appetite well i 'm not sure whether it 'll get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it let it swing but i might say that we shouldn 't be just because we made mistakes in in administration and there were numerous ones made we shouldn 't be replicating them at any top of the head just because of precedence thank you okay so you 're moving that we go back in okay it 's been moved by councillor pam and do i have a second year to move back into council council ival thank you so councillors ham and i will for the minute taker that we go back into council all those in favor any against so council orlando that was for moving back in not against no i 'm full moving in thank you then it 's been carried unanimously hannah okay call report 11.3 which is the request for purchase of council you haven 't voted we haven 't gone we do have the emotions before us i 'll put i 'll put all those in favor against so councillor hayes you 're against it yep and councillor chaffee are you for it or against it i 'm i 'm fired thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried but councillor hayes is voting against it and right now i think councilman if i go forward yeah it was migrating that and i sent us a delay um page 59 councillors please report 11.3 something different request for the purchase of council road reserve at long road shumit we had three recommendations not going to give this one away someone like to move and second national councillor hayes oh no no i don 't think so i think it 's pretty obvious that this is only useful to um joining the blood that owns the land next door unless of course you wanted to put in an alternative access through to the uh go cup road which would suit very nicely through there that 's not what mr tool wants did anyone want to speak against the motions if there 's no further discussion or debate i 'll put i 'll put the motions all those in favor against it 's been carried thank you councillors to page 63 for report 11.4 request for the partial road closure and sale of 17 york street tumbarumba there are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival did you want to speak to the the motions counselor hand no as my understanding this makes a lot of sense and i would like to support all three recommendations thank you any speakers against there 's no speakers against i 'll put the three motions all those in favor against been carried counsellors page 66 a core report 11.5 which is the plan of management for council managed community crown reserves we do have full four recommendations on the page so we have the four recommendations so we do have four recommendations just before we moved um there were issues with some of the uh identified parcels of land so um [Music] and here you would want to uh address that um so did you want to point put an additional point in any of those and then move them right maybe we could use the precedence from the earlier one where we just move one and wait for the others to come through later i think you know the so i 'm discussion to i 'll just take some advice from the ceo in relation to best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a slight variation to two to allow the ceo to make corrective and administrative amendments to those ground land management documents or you could go down the process councillor hayes has suggested where you move and seconded one only have a discussion about the whole report and then during that discussion decide what you want to do and either move two to four as they are or modify two to four or do something entirely different so councils i 'll be guided at this point nobody has moved or seconded anything uh well look i 'd suggest that um i 'll move one so [Music] um and that way the thing can be dealt with and get out there on public exhibition so it 's been moved by councillor livermore with the addition in point two to authorize the ceo um for any corrective and administrative changes councillor hayes did you want to second that no i don 't think so no can i have a second counsellor hand thank you did you want to speak to the motions counsellor livermore um only from the point of view i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the identification of some of so i think you know for credibility before we put it out on public exhibition because i imagine a lot of people out there will pick up the same things that i 've noticed i think it 'd be well worthwhile just making those changes it 's really changes to some of the mapping before it goes out then we know that the document 's pretty accurate and goes out on exhibition thank you any speakers against if there 's no further discussion or debate then i 'll put the motions all those in favor against and we had haze and latter against counselors to page 73 which we 've already dealt with that was um report 11.60 in principle support for the establishment of a new preschool in tumbarumba so seeing as we 've built with that i 'll ask councillors to go to page 76 and i 'll pour report 11.7 and that is that snowy valley 's council moved to the southeastern tablelands planning area i 'll move the recommendations it 's moved by councillor hayes do i have a seconder councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hayes yes look um i i can 't say that it this changes a lot of a lot of things uh but you know it it does align us with some similar councils but it also removes us from um from an area where we we we do have a uh you know a long history but um things change and uh you know i 'm happy to happy to move with the with the with the future and with the change and uh yeah i look forward to working with the uh with the new planning area okay do i have any speakers against um council liverpool yeah through you madam chair um i guess one of the main issues i would have with this from a planning perspective um it 's an area over there which goes over the coast now when you 're developing things like a new lep which council 's embarking on now one of the primary issues you 've got to take note in the development of your lep are your regional planning instruments that cover the region that you 're in now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really in this region we 're actually in another one on the other side of the mountains and i think we we need to give that careful consideration that what are the sort of uh regional plans talking about over on the coastal councils um and we know the resorts and so on um there 's probably going to be a lot of things in those regional plans that in no way relate to our neck of the woods here uh and that 's just from a straight planning point of view um so i think we need to be very very careful about you know ignoring the fact that we live where we live um and it 's hard to sort of pinpoint what the uh you know the exact issues are going to be because this is all future stuff we 're talking about um so it 's very hard to you know necessarily pinpoint that today but i 'm just wary of that knowing that uh things like leps you 've got to be very cognizant of what your regional planning systems are talking about um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lep through the department of planning if we have inconsistencies with regional plans thank you do i have any speaker for chair um i believe this is uh the planning um where our planning area is involved has a bearing on our associations and thinking with jose you know that 's pretty important um i think there is actually a lot a lot of consistency in places like tabletop um and young and even canberra and those that are similar to what our either our where and also what our aspirations are so i think it 's maximum thank you any speaker against councillor ham you had your hand up earlier no um councillor hughes councillor hughes articulated my argument thank you councillor hayes did you want a close debate there 's no further comment yes yes i did look i think the report puts it fairly clearly we do have a lot of um a lot of synergy with the snowy monero particularly now through um snowy hydro uh and and i think we need to to take take full advantage of that uh and uh also with with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common border with canberra um at the act so it does make sense that we um we 're part of that donut that surrounds surrounds canberra there 's a lot of advantages um for us and i don 't think there 's too many disadvantages as well we still we still have that attachment with the with the riverina area river in a murray area so um you know i can 't see it being too much of a problem but i can see it as being useful for us going into the future this is [Music] okay um can i just ask the mover and the secondary if you would be happy to include a fourth point which would be investigate snow valley 's council becoming an associate member of redrock are the movers the second are happy with that given that i 've closed the bait that 's a pretty difficult one sorry i said given that i 've closed debate thank you counselor no it 's okay i 'll just put it up next time okay i 'll put the motion all those in favor against so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay 80 councillors for report 11.8 destination network boundary changes counselor hand do i have a seconder no no it 's up to them it 's not me do i have a seconder yes councillor hayes thank you counselor okay could i um i would like to add an amendment a point two to this madam chair yes um i 've never felt so i i would say that this was just plain insulting as a as a councillor that has been very involved with um destination river and has just been so appreciative of their work where we came for four years um snowy valleys council you can you can see our tourism growing you can see all our merch that we 've got down to the local tourist information you can see people coming to town writing bikes accommodation coming up i i have great gratitude destination river arena i felt that they 've always been very good in their discussion with council and with stakeholders and i was just goldsmith when out of the blue said by the way you in july are going with destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a very polite strong letter of disappointment to minister ayers local members justin clancy and dr joe mcgurk and destination chair christine mclaughlin and i um note christine prides herself on establishing strong stakeholder relationships and is recognised in her achievement of bringing people together to address issues so i welcome her to address this issue because um this happened with no consultation certainly with us as a counselor and there are i 've heard one stakeholder that vaguely heard about it and i would ask for a review of this decision before july any speaker against i assume that in addition an an addition to the emotion that 's there is it or a new motion let 's see counselor in a minute sorry counselor uh mayor chaffee what was that comment just wondering it says here receive and note the report i assume that 's item two is it that 's one and the second item is to write a letter of disappointment so that 's the second one so yeah do you have a second after that addition no i just need the well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's happy with that otherwise we can put it as an amendment and we 'll go that way councillor hayes are you happy with the second point sure i think it depends on the strength of the letter and i haven 't seen the letter well it just says that we 're writing the letter we 're in this point we 're approving the writing of a letter it 's a letter of disappointment [Music] put it in i just i 'd like to see the letter before it goes though so councillors we do have those two motions before us did anyone want to speak for or against yeah look i just want i just want to add i think we need a whole review of where the where the uh council 's money is going in relation to this stuff i mean i i think the public has sick to death of propping up these tourism businesses that offer nothing back in return you know a lot of them are basing their businesses around medical apartheid and not allowing uh you know certain groups of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any tariffs at all to the uh to the local government to uh to allow us to uh do anything and you 've got all these fat cats sitting around on these big salaries and what are they actually doing nothing absolutely nothing all we 're doing is paying these people to do what you know it 's the whole thing 's a joke can i just ask councillor is there a point to the comment in relation to speaking against the motion the point is that we we need to review where our money 's going you know we shouldn 't be propping up tourism it 's not our it 's not our problem you know i 'm all for tourism but you know we 've got to start spending our local money on on on local products you know lata i 'll just say that i don 't think that that actually relates to the motions we have before us here right now well you might not think so but i do okay thank you for the comment counsellors we actually have two motions before us and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have two against council of councillor host council of page 83 please i 'll call report 12.1 the minutes of the local traffic committee from the 24th of november there are actually i think four recommendations um [Music] in this first sorry community i did councillor and secondary councillor mata do you want to speak to the motions at all councillor hayes uh no no but i 'm happy to uh to be a new member of the local traffic committee even though our first meeting has been postponed i look forward to um thank you thank you so there 's no further discussion or debate in relation to the motions i 'll put those all those in favor against discourage unanimously thank you councillors that brings us to the end of the open section of the

    "text": "this video has been produced to support community engagement about the rate options study for snowy valleys council it 's part of a series of videos as shown on your screen and i 'd encourage you to start with the introduction video as this provides the background and context for what i 'll go through specifically in relation to rural residential land in this video as a starting point i 'll look at the current rating structure that 's in place for rural residential land in each of the former councils it 's important to note that under the local government councils must have distinct rating categories for farmland business and residential land but rural residential is an optional subcategory within the residential category councils don 't have to define it separately and as i 'll discuss later the former turmeric shire didn 't use it until 2005 when it was introducing a special rate variation and so when when considering the current rating structure of rural residential land it 's worth comparing this to the rating of ordinary residential land too so starting in turmeric the 540 minimum rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the threshold about 72 000 there 's an ad valorem rate or rate in the dollar that applies so rates are increasing with the value of the land and if we overlay the residential rating structure we can see that the rates paid uh are quite a bit higher on the same value property and in the form of tumber umbershower there 's a 40 base rate that everyone pays and then an ad valorem rate that goes up with the value of land over and above this and if we overlay the residential rating structure we can see that particularly at the higher end of property values the rates are considerably higher on residential properties than on the same value rural residential property and if we now compare all of these different rating structures we can see that it 's the residential rate payers in the form of tumor shire that are paying by far the highest rates and the rural residential ratepayers in the former tumba umber show out that are paying by far the lowest rates it 's important to understand the history behind the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils because it is quite different so starting in tumbarumba the rural residential subcategory was used as subcategories are used in most councils to even out the rates paid on the lower value residential land and the higher valued rural residential land so even though the typical rural residential property 's worth two and a half times that of the typical residential property the rates paid on the rural residential is only one and a half times as much this was possible though because there was a reasonably clear distinction between the lower value residential and the higher value rural residential in the form of tumachshire there 's a significant overlap between the two as can be seen in this chart and when both of these charts are combined it 's clear that there is a significant overlap for snowy valleys between the value of residential and rural residential land so if we draw a line at say 86 000 which is the value of the typical rural residential block in tumbarumba there 's actually almost a thousand residential properties valued over that amount in snowy valleys but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 86 000. so the question then is is it fair for these um higher value rural residential properties to be paying around 20 less in rates uh on land of the same value the trouble is addressing this does result in some considerable increases for the rural residential ratepayers the history of the rural residential subcategory in the form of tumor shire is quite different up until a special rate variation was introduced in 2005 there was no rural residential subcategory there was everyone was in residential the then council introduced a special rate variation on the basis that no one would pay more and offset the increases associated with the srv with lower water and sewer charges so the rural residential subcategory was simply those residential properties not connected to water and sewer and so not benefiting from the reduction in water and sewer charges while this approach was in some respects understandable it was a red herring the ordinary rates are not related to the water and sewer charges councils need to run these two operations as distinct businesses and generate the revenues from these areas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential rate pays in the form of two mature have paid 36 lower rates for the last 15 years when the special rate variation was introduced the only ones that paid more were the residential properties and the business properties another complication of this history is that almost half of the properties that are currently classified as rural residential are non-compliant with the requirements of the act which is that they can only be classified as rural residential if they are larger than two hectares so when this special rate variation expires they need to return to the residential land use category anyway and because rates on residential land are higher this will result in an increase in rates for these former rural residential ratepayers and a slight decrease for the rest of the residential ratepayers so considering the history behind the rural residential subcategory and each of the former councils and the difficulties in applying a fair rating structure across snowy valleys as a whole the option of eliminating the subcategory is something that needs to be considered as part of this process but the key issue with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural residential ratepayers the impacts have associated with the two options included in the community survey are explained following but before we consider this it 's important to address what is no doubt a reasonable concern in relation to the fairness of any proposal to trade residential and rural residential land the same for rating purposes the issue relates to the fact that rural residential ratepayers will possibly feel that they receive lower service levels than those in ordinary residential areas there is no curb and gutter or footpaths for example and other facilities like pools parks and sporting grounds are further away and so harder to access in the rate options study i 've analyzed the net cost of all these council services and allocated these to each of the main land use categories on a proportional basis i 'd encourage you to have a look at the study if you want to know more but i 'm afraid there is too much detail to go through the analysis here all i can do is provide the outcomes of the analysis and what i found based on the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a dollar forty in services back for each dollar of rates they put in which is more than any of the other rating categories although close to residential and when we consider this alongside the tax rate on the land shown in purple bars here which i 've calculated by dividing the rates paid by the land values we can see that the rural residential rate payers are actually taxed at a considerably lower rate than ordinary residential ratepayers which is what we saw before with the current rating structure and bearing this in mind there is an argument to reduce that gap so now we need to look at the options council has included in the survey regarding the new rating structure for snowy valleys council basically there 's two options that either involve eliminating the rural residential subcategory and trading all residential land the same or retaining the rural residential subcategory with a 50 base rate to explain the impact of the options on different rate payers we 'll be using this chart so at the top we 've got the rating structure that 's in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates going up based on the value of the land and at the bottom shows the number of rating assessments for each of those property values so you can see there 's a pretty consistent distribution um in terms of the number of properties of different values in each of the former councils with chairman in blue and tumbarumba in red the purple line that i 've added at the top shows the rates that would be payable under option a which is eliminating the subcategory and you can see that that purple line is above both the blue and the red lines indicating that the rates would go up for most ratepayers and different property values the blue line that i 've added at the bottom there shows the increases in percentage terms for properties of different values in tumor and what it 's showing is that with the reduction in rates at the lower end of property values in tumor with the elimination of the minimum rate rates are decreasing in percentage terms for those landowners in the middle range of property values in turmeric around the 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent but it 's important to remember that 's about the premium that the residential rate payers and chairman have been paying for the last 15 years compared to rural residential then at the higher end of property values in chairman said that the increases are coming down to virtually nothing around the 150 000 mark and above and that 's related to the introduction of the base rate which flattens out the rating structure reducing the difference between low and higher value properties the red line that i 've added shows the impacts in percentage terms on ratepayers in tumbarumba and you can see because the line 's flat that the increases are fairly consistent on all property values in percentage terms but it is a significant increase across all property values of around 30 it 's important to recognize though that the increases in dollar times are quite different at the lower end the increase is around 100 but at the higher end the increases are approaching three times this amount and it 's important to note too that the increases at the lower end would still put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chambered on properties of similar value now the second option that 's considered in the survey is retaining the existing rural residential subcategory and including a 40 base rate that 's in place in tumbarumba at the moment and as can be seen the blue line um showing the impact of ratepayers in turmeric that the increases are far less than under option a the biggest increases are around the 70 60 to 70 000 mark and they 're about 20 rather than 36 for option a and also in tumbarumba the increases in percentage terms are now under 20 for most ratepayers this video is focused on the impacts of the two options on rural residential rate payers but it 's also important before we finish up to clarify the impacts of these options on ordinary residential rate pairs this chart shows the rates payable on residential land of different values both in the case where the rural residential subcategory is retained and where it 's eliminated and the lines are very close together which shows that there 's very little difference in the rates paid but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars the uh elimination of rural residential saves about ten dollars a year or about one point five percent of rates and at the lower end it drops off um to very little and at the top end at most the saving is around three percent per year for the residential rate pass so in summary here 's the two options side by side option a involves eliminating the rural residential subcategory and results in significant increases for ratepayers in tumbarumba and for many in turmeric too option b retains the subcategory and so the increases are far less but this does mean that rural residential rate payers end up paying 15 to 25 percent less in rates than ordinary residential rate payers do on land of the same value despite the fact that the cost of services that council provides and the ability to pay is about the same one thing that 's important to note in relation to these increases is that the rate options study has recommended that council explore opportunities to limit increases in rates to no more than 10 per annum so thanks for taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rural residential land in snowy valley 's council again i 'd encourage you to complete the survey and to check out the other information that 's available at the link shown on your screen"

    "text": "no today thank you councillor thompson today the mayor was unwell and the council handed the chair across to you for the council meeting would you like to tell us a little bit about the meeting look i 'd just like to initially thank everyone for their support and also for the way in which they engaged within the meeting today look part of what was so good was to have community come along and do a public forum at the beginning but also to look at some of the most important things that we have coming up and the exhibition of some of the policies that we really do encourage everyone to go onto the website or to the customer service area and to make their comments this is your opportunity to have a voice and this is your opportunity to engage with us we can listen we can meet with you we can talk with you but we also need you to engage and actually make the effort to go in and look for those documents as well you said today we talked about the local government new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up as of next week and a number of motions that we need to be looking at but apart from the conference itself local government new south wales has some fantastic training courses and and we have some some of the counsellors who have already put their hand up to do a number of those courses which is a part of the professional development that is now required when you undertake the role of a counsellor and also we put a number of documents out on public exhibition today we have procurement policies and and things in relation to our donations and gifts so these are the policies that are so important that when you say that you want to be engaged and you want to have a voice this is when we 're asking you please when they 're at an exhibition for 28 days take the time have a look at them go in read them but then make some submissions and and make sure that you make your voice heard and counselors report on the six months of the operational plan actions that was quite significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the document and i think that as a as a brand new council and for councillors who are only just at the moment starting to get their head around all of the financials as we head into even the budgeting process it was so good to actually see documented and to have all of our answers or all of the questions that maybe we wanted to ask is to have the cfo here with us today who really went above and beyond and may clear a lot of that information so we also know that we have access to the cfo if we need to ask questions going forward and and i think that 's one of the important things that we are all learning is that you don 't have to wait for a meeting and you don 't have to wait until there 's an issue if you have a concern go through the correct channels ask the right people and we can get the answers and then we can inform the community and budget control was a significant item for the candidates for election and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether we were on schedule there and the cfo provided some information there would you like to comment on any of those it 's um it 's been an interesting challenge in the short term because there has been so much focus on finance so much in focus on the budget so much focus on special rate variations that even now i don 't think that anybody could say that they really have their head around everything that we need to but what i will say is that we now have an understanding of where we can go to and the questions that we can ask and the the responses that we 're getting so it 's it 's still an enormous learning curve and a cliff for some of us we have six out of the nine councillors who are brand new to this council and we are still getting our head around it but i think today having the opportunity to go through a quarterly review budget and or the quarterly review and to actually have the cfo to to respond to some of our queries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of relearning to a lot of the the line detail and understanding that money doesn 't always have to be real money sometimes it is um it 's put against other items so it 's it 's an interesting time it 's a challenging time but it 's one that every single person who 's at the table is committed to making work and to work with the staff to make it work our community deserves nothing less and we had the public forum and we had a presentation on the preschool proposal in tumbarumba um it was so good to see a resolution around that how excellent was that you know thank you so much to jenny and and michael who came along and people tend to think of child care as only being around young children and don 't see that it actually connects to them and what was made very clear today is that particularly in a community such as tumbarumba without adequate childcare and preschool facilities then there 's not the opportunity for the staff to be able to get the adequate care so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills whether it be in council whether it actually be at our schools it 's about providing providing families with affordable childcare but not only that it 's the appropriate childcare that enables our our preschoolers to learn how to read to to have that interaction it 's not child care it 's called preschool for a reason and it 's what they get to learn before they 're off to school so i think council was unanimous in its support for in principle the development and the application that they 're going for with to to put that preschool in tumbramba i i personally hope it is successful certainly and i think the most discussed item on the agenda was about uh destination riverina murray i know it 's you know it is so frustrating when as a local government um elected representative you want to make a difference and and we want our voices heard as well and it was extremely disappointing to have imposed upon our local government area by other levels of of government um a change from being a part of the riverina murray to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of interest and we 'd already had really good partnerships built with others and to be given it 's almost like an either all it 's to some level it 's a little bit disrespectful of the quality of council as we have around the table and what we can actually have and the input that we can make so i think the decision to actually write to the appropriate people express our disappointment and ask for it to be reviewed as the right one today excellent and we had three tenders today and the copabella creek and the swing bridge uh suspension bridge over copper bella creek is a significant investment on crown lands and something exciting for the future i think it is and what 's really important for people to understand is that this is not council money that 's being spent this is a this is a commercial venture the council has the opportunity to deliver the project without having to pay for it that 's always a bonus um but also the significance of that bridge and that creek for you know we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the various plans to include all of that and and i think that once you start looking at areas like the copper bella creek bridge that can be included in our plans as well thanks councillor thompson it 's uh great to catch up and give a little bit of a quick review of the meeting today thank you and look um i 'd like to actually thank mayor chaffee for the opportunity to take this on and and but to also thank him i know he wasn 't 100 will but he really made the effort to contribute and um he 's he 's very much valued and as i said thank you so much to the staff for the support it was a an interesting opportunity thrust sourced upon but i think we got there okay and i think we 've made all the right decisions today certainly uh short notice and a very well run meeting and lots of discussion which was good to see so thank you thank you"

thank you please retain it resume your seats the 2022 australia day ambassador for the snowy valleys is mrs michelle leonard oam the founder and artistic director of the not-for-profit murambilla voices michelle has sadly contracted covert along with the family and is not able to be here today instead we will present a ted talk ted a ted talk that michelle delivered in 2018 that 'll be portrayed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see growing up in north west new south wales michelle leonard learned to play piano and clarinet but noticed there weren 't many opportunities for regional students to pursue music as founder and artistic director of the not-for-profit miramila voices michelle works to create opportunities for underprivileged children in rural areas to access music education she has taught many indigenous children and her work has a strong community focus murrenville voices has opened countless doors for many of its students some of whom have walked out with a scholarship for knox grammar school or an invitation to study at the sydney conservatorium of music michelle has sent her apologies and a message to pass on her gratitude to the mayor deputy mayor councillors elders and australian day working group for still including her in the celebrations michelle has made a note to the elders in the community that the following video acknowledges having a perspective presented to them and their communities that is not their own but is done in the spirit of respect and reconciliation from those who have loved and looked after michelle and supported her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is is going to run the video now and we 'll sit back and listen and watch that things [Music] [Music] relentless positivity that 's pretty much been my mantra actually and um it 's one that i 've lived my life with and particularly one in the arts so i had a bit of a mission 13 14 years ago the children that i knew and loved from regional australia were starting to see music as a passive activity you just watch someone else do it on telly or you watch someone else do it on youtube so if you combine that with a mindset that music literacy is just too hard it 's a skill set that is not even needed anymore it 's for the elite few then you have a mindset that is just completely one of scarcity so my privilege as the artistic director of marine villa voices has been to move a region and their whole mindset from one of scarcity to abundance and the way i 've done that is through the choice of marimba voices i have three choirs i have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing primary trebles and well over a hundred primary girls and then a high school group called maxed out now i 've always believed that life was absolutely full of possibilities that 's the way i was brought up and i must have missed the uh the kpis that said you grew up in rural australia and you couldn 't be a female conductor so here i am that 's what i do um but what has been the most incredible thing for me is that music literacy and making music has unleashed my creative capacity and in turn it 's given me the skills and the opportunity to share that and that 's been one of life 's great joys for me and i hope for all the hundreds and thousands of children that have been involved and the professional choreographers and dancers and composers and artists that have worked with us so i thought what i should do is put this down and invite you to do what i ask the children to do every year when they 're on tour with me i go to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we learn how to read music so i have three minutes and eight seconds no seven and we 're going to learn how to read music so you 're ready to get to primary school find your happy place good rub your hands and don 't pinch the person beside you good oh you 're so cute in fact you 're excellent you show me your excellent face show me your thumbs oh you are so cute smile you know that really cheesy one from you too without your teeth great now i want you to get your second finger and i want you to do the groovy dance groovy [Music] i am so groovy yes where yeah so show me excellent smile groovy now music was written originally written on one red line so in honor of that blood going down say after me blood going down and now very scarily blood going up excellent that 'd be groovy thanks darling show me your fourth finger darling and now whilst hitting the person beside you you 're fabulous show me darling darling you 're fabulous oh and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the power of technology is you 've probably seen that sign that squiggly thing the reason there 's five lines is because you have five fingers and in fact if i go to this next one excellent groovy blood darling you 're fabulous and if i show you with this hand if you can take it like this put your thumb down f say it f a a c c e f a c e in this space you find your face and there it is now this didn 't take a long time music literacy is not a burden it is not that it is too hard we it 's just a skill that we 've forgotten but the opportunities that being able to read something like this unleashes for my candidates and in fact for all of us is absolutely extraordinary and this is why i bother and why we bother using art music so if we had a little longer i 'd find a c and we 'd sing that and the wonderful thing about this is all of those notes fit in your hand because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly and it 's yours so as you give yourself a round of applause for your music literacy i 'd like to introduce you to the choirs of murambila voices in fact there 's 60 children that are about to come on stage now from regional new south wales as my beautiful children come on stage item oh they are just so gorgeous they represent the most remote and regional third of new south wales they met together yesterday for our first rehearsal um what i 'd like to do is take this opportunity to acknowledge the incredible support that i have been given from all of the communities i work in the incredible volunteers the um the extraordinary annie brenda who has mentored me through all of the cultural nuances over the last 14 years melissa kirby from berwarana who has with human kindness shared a language that was shared to her so that we can share this with you we 're going to sing about the oldest man-made structure in the world yes you did hear that correctly that 's the warren of fish traps and the brewarana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live your life not take more than you need to sing to dance to live a life of possibility and abundance the music that we 're going to sing has been commissioned by mourinho voices by a wonderful australian female composer called josephine gibson we will be accompanied by extraordinary musicians the artwork that you 're going to see of photos from our region by noni carol and the movement that the children will do has been created by jacob williams thank you very much for having us [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] the river rushing fast [Music] [Laughter] generations [Applause] [Music] is oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] m [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] well that was an ambassador address with a difference remotely and uh thank you to michelle for that uh mayor and jaffee has to get away to tumbarumba shortly and i 'd like to invite him back to the microphone to say a few words thank you very much ron uh look i 've taken the liberty of penning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i said earlier it 's good to see so many people here today australia day the 26th of january what does it represent what are we recognising to different people it means different things some good some bad or is it just an excuse for a holiday or does it have real significance i would hope that it 's not just about commemorating the colonisation of the great south land but about recognizing where we have all come from acknowledging the journey that has brought us to this time the good and the bad all of us australians from whatever background need to reflect on our good fortune to live in this great country we are all blessed to call this land home it is good to be aware of the past and take heed of history but what has gone before cannot be changed we need to remember the past so that as not to repeat it [Applause] how we define the future sorry how we handle the future will define us previous generations and leaders both men and women have left us a great legacy we are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people caring for others less fortunate than ourselves or just caring about ourselves at the expense of others i hope not the older i get the more i wonder about the changing of values in our society things like ethics integrity and accountability don 't seem as important as in the past the present is a time of rapid change today what is today 's fact is tomorrow 's fiction how we uh how are we coping with that change covert has exposed some interesting traits in our ethos as australian a country of 26 million and yet when faced with adversity retreat we retreat to our colonial past not prepared to act as one people and i might add a fascination with toilet paper we see overseas corporations and countries buying up our mining operations our minerals oil gas our agricultural land and output keep it up and we 'll be tenants in our own land why is this happening they must see a future in australia if so why can 't we australians see that future do we rush headlong into selling everything we are told we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are told we are a smart country better our inventions like wi-fi the black box and aircraft instrument landing systems are developed overseas we have our own retirement super funds invested overseas why not in our own country the government could be paying us interest instead of paying it to overseas organizations what does the future hold for us all i believe we need to take greater control of our own future be more vocal be more proactive in our own communities providing for our needs in growing our communities and if we need to provide our own funds and effort so be it the new south wales government wants local government to deliver services that they can 't to be more efficient in providing services that the community wants but they don 't provide the funds what they haven 't been able to provide is a mechanism to ensure good governance which i believe is an essential part of any worthwhile reform if we want to have a say in what we need and how we develop we need strong drivers people who can adapt to change who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not driven by the social media who are not afraid to risk who provide hope for the future and carry the community with them if we want to grow and maintain our unique lifestyle and environment we must retain control of our future we need younger people with community spirit to come forward and take us into the mid 21st century it 's very easy to sit back and let others do it for us but they pardon me but it may not be to in our best interest or to our liking we must be vigilant in protecting our way of life and the land that we take so much for granted it 's great to see so many people from different backgrounds stepping forward to become australian citizens today and we wish you all well in your new life in australia over the years we have recognized those in our community have shown us what a wonderful contribution can be willingly and selflessly made to the benefits of us all those who have shown us what a wonderful talent we have in our people this recognition is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful land we live in and remain ever vigilant in not having our freedoms and hopes sacrificed for the sake of a dollar let 's all do our bit to continue to make this a great community that we are proud to live in i 've probably posed more questions than i have answered it may not be entertaining but i hope it is relevant to today thank you for the opportunity of speaking to you thank you mr chaffee it 's now time

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone it 's darren here and this is tony we 're here at the beautiful tumbaruma creekscape and we 're going to show you how to make a wicking garden first thing you need is you need some sort of container and it can be a custom construction like this or it can be an ibc an old apple bin or anything you get your hands on providing it hasn 't been used to store harmful chemicals or anything like that so the first thing you need to do is you need to line your container with plastic to hold water in the bottom now we 've finished putting the plastic into the wicking bed ensuring that we 've pushed it down in all the corners we now have to put this drain coil in the bottom to help with the dispersion of the water so we 're going to have a bit of pvc as a filler pipe so that 's going to connect down in the bottom to this drain coil and it 's going to loop around in the bottom and help that water get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coil in the bottom and the filler hose attached we 've got to fill it up with the gravel and sand mix [Music] okay we 've just filled the container up with the aggregate mix now we need to put this geotextile fabric down to allow the water to move through but it won 't let the soil to mix down with the sand and aggregate mix so i 'm also going to just cut some holes now in the plastic so the water can come up to this point but it can 't flood the soil zone all right so now we have to fill the wicking bed with the soil a bed of this size is going to take about two cubic meters of soil [Music] all right so the bed 's nearly full now we 're just going to cut this excess plastic off to tidy that up all right so now it 's full of the soil it 's time to plant it out we 've got a selection of different herbs and leafy greens that hopefully the community can enjoy [Music] so we finished planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help protect the top of the soil and just hold a bit of the moisture while the plants are young so we 've finished planting out and mulching the garden now it 's time to give it a good water so for the first couple of weeks while these plants are getting their roots down we 're going to have to water from up here but from that point you 'll be able to fill up your reservoir from the filler pipe here in order to give the plants the water they need we 're also going to put a cap on the filler pipe so that mozzies can 't breathe down in there all right so we 're all done here thanks for watching hopefully this has inspired you to go and make your own wicking bed at home if you want to get involved you can check out the snowy valley 's website for more details and this is a great initiative by snow valley 's council and murrumbidgee local health you"

councillor ham second and by councillor hughes put the motion all those in favor moments declarations of security interest has anyone got any pecuniary interest which they wish to declare if not we 'll move to public forum there 's no public forum confirmation of the minutes ordinary meeting 18th of november 2021 mr remover the thompson all those in favor shouldn 't should it not be somebody who was actually at the meeting i think it probably should be um i 'd like to speak to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to last time uh councillor hayes i was going to deal with manager rising so would you like to speak to it now before we move yes please if that would be okay okay look i i wanted to speak on i 'm just trying to find it here the um the motion for um the motion from the extraordinary meeting can we speak about that or not 11.2 the rural landscape okay and um just there 's been i think an overall amount of interest in the community about that and probably a bit of a fear that this is going to be the lep of the future um if i could through you mr chaffee if we could ask the ceo if he could explain what we 're going to do to make our consultation better thank you through the mayor councillor ham we are going to or we have already extended the submission period so that people have longer to respond to that we have organized for the consultant who 's done the report to brief counsellors and we 'll also be organizing a online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to a presentation from the author of the report and ask some questions part of that will be our staff also giving an explanation about how the rural land study contributes to our local environment plan very grateful any further questions through you mr man um just in relation to report 11.1 the bombole creek road land acquisition i 'd just like to have it confirmed that all of the affected landowners have actually finalized their contracts with council thank you through the mayor council thompson i 'll hand that to the executive director infrastructure hines through you through you mr mayor thank you for the question council thompson um the actual finalization of the land matters um is still progressing as far as the paperwork goes but yes we do have agreement from what i understand formal agreement with all the land owners impacted and for the transfer adjustment of the land is required to facilitate the works any further questions i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carrie uh extraordinary meeting 11th of january council hayes you indicated you wish to make a comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by councillor ham is there a second council livermore councillor hayes thank you look um i i want to speak on the the uh the proposal to not not to have an election for the if say some what someone drops out i think i think what i wanted to say at the time was that this probably strikes at the heart of democracy in a way in that it doesn 't give people a choice it takes that choice away from from the voters now they made they made a choice at a point in time and they elected us now from here on things changed in that you know a week 's a very long time in politics and certainly um 18 months is an enormous amount of time so sentiment can change quite drastically between now and then and i can see the only reason for doing this is is purely financial and i understand understand the financial situation that the council is in and we 've got to find every way to to make sure that we uh you know don 't spend money um recklessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so so you know what it was what i was going to propose on the on the day was do we have or did we have an opportunity to uh reduce that time um you know at the time so maybe six months or 12 months or whatever so um that that 's what i wanted to say on the day uh and uh you know it 's a bit late now but uh i 've had my opportunity and i thank you for that thank you very much councillor hayes we 've all heard councillor hayes sentiment i think i 'll now put the motion all those in favor against gary and decision there aren 't any i do have a very small mayoral minute and i 'll just read that out to you it is important that the incoming council acknowledge the contributions made by the previous council to the svc over the what has not been an easy time the merger of turmeric and cumberland shires should never have happened but the government of the day by eating made that decision and a lot fell to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hand up and took the challenge and for that we thank them local government is not an easy place this new council now has the task of taking ssbc forward into the future there are many challenges not least the financial position i 'm sure this council will put the future rest sbc first and foremost in all its considerations while keeping the community informed way once again to those councils of the previous council thank you nation um mr mayor i 'd like to actually move that we bring report 11.1 sorry that we move um to bring report 11.1 to the front so that we can deal with the climate change and adaptation advisory committee prior to making a determination of committee delegates in the next workplace thank you councillor thompson i 'll just deal with urgent business without notice and there is none we 're now in governance and financial reports you 've moved that motion is there a second second of my counselor um i 'll put the motion all those in favor the guy 's carried climate change adaptation advisory committee council thompson [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just in relation to any of these uh climate change um decisions that it 's come to my attention through speaking to people uh especially in wagga that a lot of this stuff is uh there 's a lot more to a lot of this stuff than meets the eye like a lot of these solar farms they 're all chinese-owned uh they 're all chinese imported materials there 's a lot of waste goes on with this product stuff that isn 't seen on the surface so i think if we get any uh future reports or advice from these committees then we need to have that level of detail in there about uh you know what 's behind it who you know what companies we 're supporting and uh you know it needs to be a whole of um encompassing uh all that information for for us to make a decision i think you 're right there and i think that 's the role that the committee could draw those issues to our attention basically the issue is the motion 's been moved if i read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to establish the climate change adaptation committee is that what you 're removing council i was going to put an amendment to that second one to take out not and to see what the feeling of the um because the councils have moved not to establish you can 't it 's the opposite to establish yeah so i think you 're better off proceeding with this one and if someone else wanted to move an amendment which was to establish i think that would follow our process is the recommendation drastically so i don 't think that would be allowed so i think you need an amendment or another recommendation okay well the motion 's been moved as written here is there an amendment why can 't you just okay oh um [Music] this is the effect of re-establishing a climate change is that correct i don 't think it 's ever established so to ask to establish to establish is there a second of that nation councillor livermore is there any debate on the motion has it now sorry the amendment has administered if i could speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite a topical issue and i now have five people who have said they want to be honest the election seems to be worth a lot better than that in the well look i i i 'm not speaking against it as such but look all i 'd ask if that is established that uh we get uh you know a whole of um all the information you know it can 't be just proactive on climate change for the sake of it because it 's politically correct uh you know it has to be about whether it you know the where the origins of this stuff is in relation to the purchase of uh you know things like the solar panels and the like um where the where the money 's going to if they 're chinese owned companies uh you know whether this stuff has an environmental uh problem like a lot of these wind turbines when they get disregarded they end up causing more more mess and havoc than uh you know what what they 're intended to uh placate so look i 'm i i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing that information it has to be balanced i agree with you uh any further debate yeah our council hitters thank you um um i think the uh the climate change community needs to be quite a lot more broader in whatever what 's sort of the fields that it covers um climate change is a it 's going to be affecting every part of our lives in the next 15-20 years and we need to um it may not be it may not be the best structure for our climate change ambitions for mitigation and preparedness so i 'm having to have the climate change committee informed um but they have to have to keep their eye open as to is this going to be the best mythology the best method to for the council to approach this to have a committee or is it more of an overarching thing but the stuff that we 've talked about in the last 10 days of being a counsellor almost every one of us has got a climate change perspective in interest importance but that 's not this one so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emerging and the wider implications yeah it should it would be quite a large it could it could stand by a lot it really is up to who turns up to the committee and what so now it looks like we 're moving into general discussion that someone might admit they put a motion for going into committing or are we going to go off the debate i don 't think there 's one comment that i would in relation to i think what at least by including the climate change and adaptation committee it gives us an opportunity to develop the terms of reference it gives the new people who are coming on board that opportunity but i think each of us received an email leading into the elections asking what did we see and how did we see that we could actually support climate change within our within our region and as sam has spoken is that virtually everything we do is is related to climate change and going forward into the future so for that purpose i think that at least having a committee that gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad demographic of people to actually be on that committee and to look at the terms of reference because it 's a new starting point for us if there hasn 't been a previous committee so it 's a starting point thank you yeah if there 's no for and against i 'll put the motion sorry i would like to speak i 'm having problems seeing you at a distance there that 's okay i 'm still here um look i i don 't think we can support climate change per se but i think we 've got to be aware of it as the climate 's always been changing anyone that died out in the old last ice age will tell you that but it 's it 's it 's an it 's an evolving thing we 've got to be aware of it people are concerned about it um but once again it shouldn 't be that it shouldn 't be a deterrent to stopping things happening i think the main thing that we 've got to be doing is we 've got to be have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occur as a result of the changing climate so we 've got to have uh we 've got to lobby the government that um instead of spending 97 of all disaster funding after the fact they 're going to spend more before the fact and and we 've got to be prepared for that so i think you know the terms of reference of this um of this group could be fairly broad and and i think in a lot of cases it should be up to the to the group to um you know we 'll set it set out abroad a broad um term reference but they can add there according to their expertise that 's all thank you i couldn 't agree with you more i think this the spending of money after the event anyway that 's another issue so if there 's no further debate oh sorry for the reasons for not maybe doing it because it 's been so difficult to get interested even though that 's changing our actions through an operational plan only won 't be enough this is an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way so we really need to be in there with the community to be able to have an impact and have opinions i think i think you 're right there and i think the role of this committee to engage with the community and get a no further debate i 'll put the motion sorry the amendment i 've got to get the procedure right here i 'll put the amendment all those in favor carried the amendment now becomes the motion i 'll put the motion always in favor against carry unanimous right i would have dealt with 11 1 which we brought forward we 'll now get now going to the governance and financial report item 10 1. now you 'll have to bear with me i 'm i 'm getting this right for the first one trying to get it right for the first time so bear with me can we get a quote on the digital page uh where uh page page number 20 on the electronic process 10-1 schedule of ordinary council meeting dates and times is there a mover is there a second day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this this you 're moving what 's in front of us right now it 's been moved and seconded do you wish who wishes to speak for it and thompson no i 'm not [Music] is there a second that for what is there council ladder the the issue is now open to debate is there does the either the mover or second who wants to speak to it if not council thompson i 'd like to move an amendment please um just to in point number three to remove to be held at truman council chambers i think that 's very specific with what 's happened over the last sorry very specific with what 's happened over the last 12 months so i acknowledge setting the day and the time but to allow that not to be included as being specific to tumeric council chamber is there a second uh the amendment being proposed seems pretty relevant as we 're sitting sitting in nottingham council liverpool is there any debate on the removal of being held in the chairman council chambers well council i mean i i i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what 's what 's happening and where it 's to be expected or i mean unless there 's some extraordinary reason why you wouldn 't be holding it humid given that 's where all your your digital setup is i mean surely if there 's a an issue at the time it would just be it would just be changed but uh it seems at odds to me to be going out to the public uh and not having that you know that certainty for them as to as to where where things that are going to be likely held i mean things will will obviously change if there 's you know a pipe burst or something like we 've obviously had uh but you know from my understanding that the tumor chambers have been set up specifically uh to deal with the uh digital requirements under the act and you know it would seem ridiculous to me not to say that we 're holding it thank you council hayes yeah look uh i 'd be happy with it just with a full stop after 2 p.m um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure uh the better infrastructures sitting in in turmeric um and just by way of you know towards the end of the old truman council we we did take a traveling road show out and we took it to talbingo and we took the road along that low and we we have our council meetings there that 's not necessary anymore because we 're all live streamed and people can tune in and they can see it live and they can see it post meeting as well so it 's all recorded so it doesn 't matter really where it is as long as the the infrastructure and the uh the facilities are up the standard and the and the production uh is good as well so you know i 'm sitting here at my house at you know in adelong so um i don 't even have to be there um you know it 's probably better if i am but but i 'm not at the moment so it doesn 't really matter i i 'd be happy with just um getting getting it uh you know just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 pm and assuming that it will be mostly in tumor that 's the assumption so i 'm happy with that thank you councillor hayes any further debate i 'll just make one point sorry if i can mr man i think councillor hayes just summoned it up he 's currently sitting in adelong and uh he 's tuned into a meeting here in dunder under um now i know it was it most people know that but um i would imagine a lot of the i.t sort of equipment we use for these live streamings is probably fairly affordable um i may be wrong there but i can be corrected on that but the other big issue with this [Music] it 's the perception it sends to the community okay now you know this is it 's not the tuna chai council that and i 'd probably encourage people to go back and have a look at the proclamation of the merger um there 's nothing whatsoever in that proclamation that indicates or intimates in any way that truman will be the center of snowy valley 's council there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that 's been made in the past but i think we 've got to be very mindful about what we do in terms of the eyes of the general public and they 're not all just in china um anyway i 'll leave it at that thank you councillor um just one day i 'd like to comment on councillor hayes comment i think what you 've highlighted there councillor hayes is the technology is moving all the time you have authorization from the department of local government to hold these meetings up until the end of june i think 2022 i think that will give them adequate time to realize that this style of meeting is quite successful i i may be wrong but maybe they might extend that period of time to operate under the present conditions but i do think the face-to-face option should be taken whenever possible however i agree with your sentence councillor thompson oh you did indicate that you wished to speak with him i speak like close debate you want to close yeah so i 'll miss anyone else um thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well i think we should get some indication from the senior staff as to what the uh what the what the setup is with the with the digital uh filming i mean because look we 've also got an obligation to ensure that whatever we 're doing um and recording of the meetings is done in in a sense that this quality and able to be you know reproduced uh freely so the public can view it i mean uh you know it 's not ideal at the moment because you know i can 't see you particularly well at the end of the uh the chair there and you know that 's what 's going to be replicated on youtube so my understanding is that that that uh digital setup that has been put in the the turmeric room is is absolutely cutting-edge stuff that will um you know make the production and and the the broadcast of this meeting professional um you know and i think we should just get that advice as to whether that that is the case would you like to comment on that uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have invested heavily in the boardroom at the northern end we made the choice due to the cost of that investment to only do it in one location unfortunately at the moment due to issues outside of our control that building has various closures throughout the aim of the boardroom there is a lot better live streaming there is issues with live streaming here it is possible but on the basis of making sure that we are very transparent in our process um that it is would be more transparent with the facilities we 've got at that facility and they are fixed facilities so we can 't actually move them around we can duplicate that investment in other locations and council needs to consider what part of your engagement strategy the council meeting component is as opposed to the other engagement strategies um across um the your whole community thank you mr moon thank you mr general uh council college do you wish to thank us today um through you mr may i think that putting it specifically where it 's going to be healed was an unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last year 's reported identified that it would alternate between the tumor and the tumor umber and then that didn 't happen and and there were all sorts of reasons so at the end of the day putting the actual location in there is is in my opinion not particularly necessary but i also share the sentiment of council livermore and that is that you know we don 't want the community of tamaramba to feel and here it comes they 've walked in and now they 've moved us out i think that we still need to be really respectful that there are people in the community who are quite sensitive towards the the merger that occurred and that sometimes just to not poke them in the chest by by printing that can sometimes be just the what is needed so in respect of that i truly don 't believe that adding the actual location is necessary and i think sometimes we need to be aware of how power can be received thank you uh having closed the debate on the amendment uh i 'll put the amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor item three um councillor uh thompson uh seconded by council of livermore is to end item three at two pm and then continue with the dates that 's my understanding of the amendment is that correct yes that 's the case i 'll put the amendment all those in favor against carrie the amendment now becomes the motion sorry council lara has [Music] amendment sorry i 'll put the amendment which has now become the motion all those in favor against carried councillor lada is indicated hayes 10.2 meeting calendar which is on page 23. is there any debate if not i 'll put the motion sorry i 'll put the motion all those in favour against chaos item 10-3 which is item as page 25 committee and nominations of delegates for 2022-24 you 're all right clarification please mr mc send me clarification since we 've already um dealt with the matter of the climate change adaptation committee um does it does that require a specific amendment to remove that from the recommendation through councillor thompson through the chair i believe that uh on item four if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table it will be included as an appendix um to the minutes of the meeting so don 't think you need to just you need to specifically address it when you 're going through which delegate for each committee and we 'll include that in the listing thank you i 'll move the recommendation move the recommendation is there a second council liable uh debate do we want to go through and i think i think perhaps either either go through individually or or go into committee to go through individually i needed to move into the committee by councillor hands second all right we 're open for a general discussion you want to deal with them one by one yes is it possible to have them on the screen yeah well based on that assumption we 'll deal with that along the showground committee sorry um through the chair do you want to share them on the zoom screen so that the community is pleased yes okay let me work i 'm happy to put my hand up there on showground committee um while we 're waiting for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ january due to a technical issue i can 't i can 't get back [Music] [Music] i 'm sure you 'll hear us two nominees or two positions that have nominees uh the tumor recreation reserve who would like to uh excuse me if we could have heritage reserve committee well i used to be on that oblong showdown uh if we need one i can just bring someone up if you like to wreck reserve oh um how about we deal with the list of committees in that delegate on their uh 355 committees if there 's no further interest or nomination than someone new but we 're in [Music] committees and their delegates uh page what page are we on there page two of the page two of the attachment number page two of ten and we 're dealing with the aboriginal liaison committee we need one counsellor i 'm happy to go on that uh we have councillor hughes and council orlando council he 's risk and improvement committee we 're looking for two councillors councillor ham cessna council livermore are there any other expressions of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like that 's positions filled really can i speak to that one you can counsel um thank you very much councillors for allowing me to be on the committee this year and thank you to the australian committee however i would really like this meeting to be reviewed would you like to um speak to that castle hand through the mayor the terms of reference is something that goes across to the committee so if we have a delegate that we nominate here the committee can be asked to review the terms of reference and put them back into the council for an amendment so the terms of reference will talk about how the committee works and make a recommendation about how we run australia today back to council so all that structure can happen this is just about who 's the representative on the committee so my problem with that is i 'd rather the committee not be involved with the review i 'd like to conduct the councillors to review how the australian database starts so if i may continue mr may um you can do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place and have a delegate on that committee and council can go about any general review thank you thank you just clarificate why is it necessary that the mayor is actually the delegate i can understand why you 're asking the mayor to turn up on australia but to actually have to attend all of the pre-meetings and things i don 't in my opinion i don 't believe that needs to necessarily be the man who 's never been in there the castle can choose if i may through the mayor the council can choose to have a alternative person there the terms of reference must currently reflect that the maid is the representative on there so if you choose someone else we will amend the terms of reference so but the mayor can also be on there and delegate to someone else to do that so is there someone who wishes to be involved i uh i think we need to make that decision now because i think we 've got to have our presence in the community and it doesn 't always have to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now last time either no it 's never been raised i don 't know where it 's come from so is that anybody else got an interest in that area council i have sorry yeah chief executive officers review committee we need one councillor for this position who wishes to be involved in a councillor is there anyone else who wishes to be involved there 's no further interest there well not that there 's no further interest it 's just that kenza ham has a particular interest climate change adaption committee we 've dealt with already is that we don 't need to appoint someone today is that correct mister so yeah [Music] our suggestion is that we appoint someone councillor armor are you expressing an interest and i 'll give you a step step disability inclusion access reference group one counselor i 'm happy to do that counselor thompson new verb interest if not we 'll move to page three number of rsl memorial committee one councillor required council liverpool anybody else german aerodrome committee one councillor required council arrival councillor no no he 's on mute john @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what i was going to suggest is that i i personally think that with the uh likely 20 million dollars worth of um infrastructure happening out there at the airport and the the multifaceted sort of response that it 's going to require i think it would be a good opportunity to expand that out to two councillors and i think council arrival and myself would uh bring um you know us a different expertise and skills to that which would uh you know fit in nicely on that committee and would be a a great benefit to the director of engineering yeah i agree i know so based on that proposition uh we can change the terms of reference to include two councillors is there any problem if not we 'll deal with the tumbarama regional youth council uh one councillor replied there counselor accused would you consider the region unless somebody else had an interest in the chairman regional youth council anybody else got an interest counselor hughes has indicated an interest in both of those the young one thanks that 's right yes i 'll just change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018 uh it says here mayor and councillors uh who would like to councillor hayes i think you had an affair thank you mr mayor uh look perhaps yourself and myself and that 'll that 'll give me a chance to hand on my knowledge of the previous meetings to you as well so i 'm happy to have you to help you there so we 've got four is that correct at this point in time it was stressed and interest councillor thompson 's expressed an interest so we 've got four people uh or four councillors based on your experience would that be a problem um fine sorry it depends what they say in the meeting well that 's right i agree with that uh look how about we try that and see how it functions all right snowy rose community grant assessment panel uh i think that 's seems to be nominated at this point of time unless somebody else has an interest uh and there the community grants it 's just basically where account the cover of a showdown user doesn 't need a council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't need a councillor either adelon progress all right i can attend those council hayes the brenda benelli economic group one councillor required [Music] yes look i used to attend these uh and um i 'd be interested in continuing if you wanted to uh either share it with me or appoint me um i i 'd like to continue to do that if possible look how about we ascertain what the situation is there as far as the options that are available to us or alternatively as i said an alternatively an alternate example do they not specify that it 's the media that 's why i 'm asking for clarification that was my understanding with the setting up of the jos councillor thompson um through the me uh the legislation actually says the mayor or the mayor 's delegate so just just by um you know previously i would think to other councillors when i 've been unavailable so um councillor pritchard has gone and and council ham came along as well so yes possible i think that 'd be a good idea james and deputy chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently so uh you know i think it would be a shame to lose that knowledge um even if the the two of you attended it you know and uh if the mayor was uh happy to delegate it well you know we 're in good hands yeah look i think we can address that issue we 'll certainly seek clarification i know the ceo general manager has provided some clarification at present i 'm sure we can negotiate that exercise the other issues on that page five don 't require a nomination page six goes on jr infrastructure working group so eastern river arena no council required forest industries hum link uh i believe there 's a consultant group there and i think we have an involvement is that correct counselor hand so i 'm happy to continue counselor infrastructure delivery working group no counsellor required navigated page seven uh interagency one councillor required indication sorry council thompson southern regional planning panel i think the uh council everywhere you might like to comment there i think well only um from the point of view of uh where there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um if the representatives on that are a councillor and or you know staff member councils get to nominate two representatives um the other three members of the panel are government appointees so the government appointed is carrying the day anyway but it 's good to have a voice [Music] so one option is to uh put out for expressions of interest from people that hold various qualifications in engineering planning uh land surveying there 's a there 's a list of qualifications of the department sort of specified to try and get onto those panels so that is an option to do that and you can probably do that by [Music] if you know something 's coming up you could nearly uh recruit um appropriately qualified people from neighbouring councils not too far away so based on those comments do you feel it appropriate that we nominate a counselor um well you could as long as as i 'll say that there 's still an interest even if it 's uh say an independent development that 's not a council development um if you have a counsellor there there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to simply support whatever council 's position is on that development well it is a good idea but i 've i 've um i 've been the planning officer on some of these and i can tell you you do get hammered by councillors who want an outcome that 's not necessarily the the best outcome from the development perspective um so it 's just a matter of you 've got to be able to manage those um conflicts so based on my understanding of greater hume is they 've appointed someone as their representative who 's not a counselor or as a counselor in another council is that right um well i 'm representative what a legal question um now another of the representatives there though was a you 're not falling into that perception of conflict are you mr german manager ceo uh would you like one of your staff members to comment on this issue yes could i just ask that um mr holton uh comment on the the discussion that we 've had today uh through you uh mayor uh the um castle is delegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ da 's uh you know to under delegation um in the municipality uh participation in the southern rural panel just continues that um that uh stake you know that key involvement in in decisions uh but look council is up to if if council wishes to appoint an independent person to represent their views that 's um that 's uh entirely uh okay but um given that the the the process eliminates us from all the council from decisions that around council 's uh own projects uh council does have an interest in in other projects that occur and given that they 're one voice on the panel notwithstanding the officer 's participation as well as that most of those applications that go to the panel will have an assessment report from the an internal council staff member a da assessment officer so there are some checks and balances there in place to avoid conflicts of interest but um but counselor involvement uh is not necessarily a bad thing given that councillors have a a key interest in development within the municipality i 'd just like to suggest that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about this and i 'd really like to see it at the table absolutely i 'm happy you know to be a council of representatives um but i i just made those comments about you you do need to be mindful there 's um if not conflict certainly potential for seed confidence so i 'm sure can i see a little bit more you could manage that situation situation fair enough council a little more we 'll i 'm finding it very difficult to see who 's raising james sorry councillor hayes um given given that we may given that we may have a counsellor representing two organizations uh i i just that doesn 't fit well with me um assuming that one of them are they both voluntary or i i 'd prefer that if we 've got a counsellor who 's sitting sitting on another council um as their delegate that you know there could be a perceived conflict of interest if uh if a project came up in our area and they may have to leave the room um i don 't i i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 'd be i 'd be more confident with um someone else [Music] [Music] i think what 's up i look around around the table and i don 't know that anyone apart from councillor livermore has the expertise to be actually a significant contributor to the um to the regional planning and i think that whoever 's going to be representing needs to know there needs to know what they 're doing it 's not just turning up and voting in favour of things that we 've read a bit of a report on they need to fully understand the documents and the processes that are required so if it 's not going to be counselling livermore it needs to be in my opinion and an independent person who 's going to have the skills and capabilities to actually represent the council and to understand fully so unless there 's a counsellor at the table other than council of livermore who genuinely believes they have the skills and abilities to do it i don 't think it 's a matter of just appointing someone for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit hole here you 're going down a rabbit hole and i think we need to be very very careful here i 'd be happy to see you in the interim i 'm happy to see councillor ham represent us really it comes back to how the council feel about this situation now we 've got a situation that we need to resolve i think uh mr holton highlighted the fact that if it involves snowy valley 's council you 're precluded is that correct no no the if not sure if the point council has trying to rise i i don 't he thought there was some conflict if let 's say i was nominal representative from another council if that 's the case if they did call on me to sit on the panel um because they 've got a you know a state significant or reasonable significant development um that will be in that other council area so me sitting on that would have absolutely nothing to do with anything within the state of alice um so i 'm not quite sure what the what the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point that there can be a perception of conflict uh and just to clarify um mr holton raised the issue about you know councils involved in the process count that 's right council planning officer does the planning report the same as they would do for any other development but they 're doing that report not for council they 're doing it for the panel right so that that report becomes the count the panels repair now even though it 's a planning panel matter the council is still the consent authority right but they are not the determining authority the panel is the determining authority and as i say at the end of the day the three state elected members of the panel they have the majority paid so if you were there as a councillor really arguing that we 'd really like this aluminium smelter to go in down the road here um won 't matter what your argument is the the panel who is made up of extremely professional planning platform and so on they they say no it doesn 't go ahead so or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor livermore hit it right on the head there 's a there 's a perception problem um and yeah that 's that 's the first thing that raised with me you wish to sum up there mr general maybe you see yeah i 'll let i 'm through the man i 'll just attempt to sum the discussion so i think what 's coming out of the discussion is you got a choice if you could have a counsellor or council can delegate another person to be honest just talking about snowy valleys council 's position on there we have got a staff member that sits on there as well and you can see in the chart there that that 's the executive director of community and corporate council has to make a choice essentially mr holsen has indicated that if it 's a council project in the snowy valleys area that that councillor would be excluded from the panel because of a conflict of interest where mr council livermore is indicating that if it was a delegate that delegate may still be able to be on there but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i may add to that and say that if council delegates that to a member of the community you have no control over that delegate 's decision on behalf of the community and it 's a delegate who hasn 't been elected by the community so and you can do that and there 's nothing wrong with doing that but the community has elected you to represent it and the panel has asked for a council of representation so both possible and hopefully i haven 't confused the matter now but i 've summed it up for you that 's counselor larry here can i just um add look i know it seems a bit confusing but um it would seem a little bit odd to me that um counselor livermore has sort of indicated that you know it could possibly be a conflict um and and i would have thought that if we 're putting someone on a panel that you know it would be essentially someone that really and truly isn 't going to uh to the best of our knowledge have a conflict i mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbouring uh the neighbouring shire uh if that 's the case i mean i don 't fully understand it but if that 's the case um you know there 's sort of an obligation to them um you know but we 're we 're committing ourselves to having someone that 's free and available to assist uh in this process but you know if that 's sort of canceling itself out then i think we we 've got a duty to essentially appoint someone that you know is going to be available uh you know for essentially everything i mean because we know that you know on planning matters you know it 's probably the most significant uh point of of people 's interest especially from from a governance point of view i mean because you know we are all required in uh in matters of uh planning to uh you know uh vote uh and have it recorded so uh you know i just think that you know if there is a perception uh there that you know i i think going with the with the option that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it for the for hume shire as well is going to be the best option look we could debate this issue on and or discuss this issue on and on uh i think that we probably need to hold that particular position over [Music] local emergency management committee my council i 'm not sure there was always a counsellor on that i 'm not sure why we 've removed it but i do think um in some respects that is a uh although the general manager or the the manager of um engineering is usually in the room um at that committee meeting there are things that come up from time to time that are of a political nature that you know i think would have some uh benefit in having a the the political input i mean because it was historically a position that was held there that was a non-voting delegate to that committee but um there 's a lot of significant uh players in that room um you know our communications people snout sounds of the mountains there 's uh a snowy hydro there 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh people in that in that room um and i i do think that it would be um you know i think it would give those members of the committee some confidence and you know i think it may assist them in uh you know perhaps uh um you know getting uh getting things that are needed for for the region uh from an emergency services perspective sort of advance through uh the mayor and uh and the like terms of reference [Music] the committee is a legislative committee council has an operational role on that committee i wouldn 't think that it 's appropriate for a councillor to be on that committee but it is appropriate for us to keep the council informed about what 's happening on that committee so if i could request that we just follow what 's listed here that there 's not a counsellor on that committee and we will review that and if there is an opportunity for a councillor to be on that committee because it 's not our legislation we will bring that back in front of council and ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah move on yeah oh look i i just think uh you know there always was a a a councillor on that committee as a non-voting delegate uh so i don 't know where that 's changed uh but yeah i can live with that local traffic committee i 'll be happy to sit on that yesterday is counselor bible spanish correctional doesn 't know the one council required in the river in the library service anybody got expressing an interest your hustler hand [Music] working group two councillors required mr mayor i think given the importance of this industry it probably should be you this one just i have had a long time a long-term uh involvement software 's working group for the moment [Music] you 're happy to do that john how about you guys [Music] [Music] community consultant in the committee yeah i 'll happily stay on that i 'm happy i 'm happy to be an alternate to james if he can 't get there okay based on those deliberations i will say we go back into we 've made it move that we go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee all those in favour uh yeah is that unanimous yes oh sorry counselor [Music] and now does someone want to move the wait a minute what 's it say in the recommendations [Music] yes yes do you want that item for do you want the the general manager ceo to read out what was decided or you 're happy with well we 're very happy with what 's decided very good well in that case uh is there you 're going to leave her in a second so you 've got hayes seconded i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carrying the next one it is the delegation for council item 104 and that 's page 29. delegations from council to the general management mayor and council committee is there any sorry is there a mover sorry um yeah just in relation to the uh there 's a delegate from there for the acceptance of tenders um which at the moment is 500 000. um and that 's 500 000 delegations without any report to council um i think we should reduce that to the 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the introduction of the gender regulation um so effectively you know anything that anything that triggers the gender regulation the value of works i think would be a very good idea if they did come to council unless the general manager 's got a completely different uh view to what i 'm about to say i i disagree with that i mean things have been functioning uh you know um uh quite well and i mean at the end of the day look we 've employed uh the executive to do a job and i think a delegation of five hundred thousand dollars in an organization this size is uh you know is probably uh pretty sound uh we know that the uh the general manager and the executive team um uh send back things that are uh uh are obviously going to be a public interest but you know i think in matters of uh you know acting on uh matters for road safety and all those sort of tenders that can get tied up for months and months having to go out to processes and all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape that we don 't need and we have to be allow them to operationally do their business uh and if they we have to back them you know we have to support them and and you know just have the confidence that we 're employing them to do a job and and they can get on and do it and i think you know reducing that just demonstrates a lack of confidence in what they 're doing in my opinion and i think it 'll have some operational impact on what they can achieve and i think you know we 're just going to be tied up unnecessarily with more more more reports any further comment councillor ham i i 'd like to support councillor in the um argument of sustainable financial sustainability that you know every report that comes to town so it costs time and we 're just looking at cutting stuff not you know being a lot more sustainable so i got cutting stuff but i think it comes at a cost yes sir thank you mr mayor um just in relation to just one moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um counselor comps through you mr mayor just in relation to the report that we 've received on this it does actually have um and because i 'm working from on my copy page 29 it gives us the option to review the limit on acceptance of the tenders and to reduce the limit from 500 dollars to a set amount 500 000 if not a lottery then um so the option is actually there at the back of the report for us to look at and consider and you know each one of us comes to have been elected on to council in relation to the the different varying skills and and demographics of the the backgrounds that we have and i i believe that if councillor livermore this is was his bread and butter area that he understands and that 's where i 'd like to be guided by somebody who has that level of experience and expertise in the area which is why i 'd support just changing it from the 500 000 to the 250 000 attended processes any further discussion anyone wish to race counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livermore was elected to councillor like the rest of us you know for you know the community purpose that we 've got a team of professional people who run our business and we have to entrust them 100 percent to run that business we 're there you know for the purpose of governance and part of that is financial uh responsibility and and and and and that has not been irresponsible but we have to be able to run our business without any any uh any hiccups uh and it has to be fluid and has to be timely and we have to be able to make decisions uh you know in relation to these matters and all we 're going to do is just tie the back of house up with all more red tape more reports more cost and you know this is not something that 's out of control that they have demonstrated that they they are very responsible um and we need to demonstrate that level of confidence in this decision any further discussion oh just to say that um you know i don 't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone on a fair while to start with uh and if we if we 're going to tie them up with this sort of thing it 's going to you know it 's going to increase the the meeting time and uh and the amount of reports that have to be generated and the amount of reports that have to be read and there 's no reason there 's no reason to reduce it there 's not like that there 's been any um any problems with any of our any of our tenders that we 've gone to in the recent past it 's not like there 's any been any malfeasance or anything like that there 's no there 's no history uh to back up this but um anyhow that 's that 's what i think there 's no further discussion i think someone to move that we go back into the ordinary meeting sir remover councillor hand council atlanta put the motion all those in favor against carried uh right oh so we had the motion moved and seconded does anyone wish to move an amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor okay what 's the actual motion as as president against against we 'll have a show of hands so that 's arma thompson and livermore against i 'm mindful of councillor hayes comment about times i 'll move the recommendations any debate it goes out for a public exhibition if anyone wants to comment they can from a council point of view they 're entitled to comment i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carrie 10 6 confirmation of attendees and voting delegates and motions for the new south wales or the local government new south wales conference on the 28th of february the 2nd of march 2022 and that 's on page 36. there 's our mover the other secondary submitted main move by councillor hayes seconded by councillor ham that 's just the reward any debate council 's counsellor hand um i just wonder when this was passed i didn 't pick this up and i will bring it up again today for a three um the impediment of maintaining rural century employment numbers for merged councils and achieving long-term efficiencies and savings i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this whole emotional steps [Music] numeral three saying that the failure to provide appropriate indexation feats and charges the impediment of maintaining um it says we have to review and confirm the following motions and i actually did vote for this and then afterwards whatever voted for item four and rolling through yeah all right so how did we handle this one three brandon browning newman three roman numerals promised by cinema tonight moment of numeral three impediment of maintaining rural centre employment numbers for merged councils is achieving long-term internet achieving long-term efficiencies and savings so anyone who wishes to speak on the issue and council of ham has already done so well i i would if i know mr mayor um the whilst i understand of the these provisions are in the act in relation to post-merger requirements um i certainly wouldn 't support that piece being in this because to me that 's effectively the same whilst we don 't like those uh impediments to be there we fully support mergers and it would beg a belief to me that this council could turn around at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you remove some of those impediments um the problem here isn 't the impediment of that particular provision in the act to the problem is mergers so you know i think the uh the motion to lg nsw to take up with the governments um they need to really consider not going ahead with mergers because there haven 't been any that have been successful i think the the writings on the wall for that night openness means in this round of merges if you go back to 1906 and look at the subsequent mergers in global government um they 've all been disastrous my understanding is that the secondary emotion could move that they 'd be excluded and then asked to move no no not at all i i 'm happy to leave it in there i i think um it 's an anachronism to to have something set in stone from the 12th of may 2016. i think it 's inequitable across the whole shower and i i i don 't it 's nonsensical to have that sort of thing how can you make you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it was a crazy thing to do in the first place i can 't believe some people in the room supported it but um it is what it is and we 've got to make the best of it and the best of it would be if we didn 't have to abide by some of these ridiculous um things that the state government put on us and this is this is one of them it 's just it 's just stupid really how can you possibly make any savings if you 've if you if you 're hamstrung like this and this is what it is this is this is them hamstringing us so we we need to be able to manage our own show not be dictated to by what you know what we 've got to do and what staff we 've got to maintain i 'm happy to vote for um one two three no we 've got a motion you 've got a foreign i 'll be corrected here but i can 't see why the amendment can 't be the motion that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that particular item i 've been corrected so let 's say can i move you out of there yes we 're intermediate can i need to go out and clean yesterday yes please look most people in this room got elected to to try and make savings for this council this is one option to make savings for this council and uh you know you you 'd be you 'd be negligent if you uh if you if you threw you know this option out it doesn 't mean that it has to be you know sort of has to be um you know bloodshed or anything like that and i 'm not not saying that not you know certainly like to see as many staff employed as possible we 've certainly got a lot um but i don 't i don 't think changing this will will help you know i think we 've been elected to to make decisions uh and this this is this is one of the rules that 's making those decisions hard to take okay and and as i said it 's inequitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general manager through the chair if i may make a comment this is something we have had discussions with the minister on in the past and if i can take it from a staff point of view i think the unions would have an issue if we proceed with a reduction in staff and that full reduction in staff has to be taken from one uh particular location so that excludes us reducing staff if we do big cuts so i 'm not sure what council 's decision is going to be around the srv but if i reduce srv means reduced service levels or no slv and if that relates to staffing uh directly to provide those that reduction in costs then we cannot take any staff from uh ken cobin tumbarumba adelong and batlow all the staff have to go from the tumor location so that 'd be the tumor tempo and the rhb building and i don 't think the union would be very supportive of that the intent of this resolution is about us proceeding forward if we have to do adjustments to staff numbers doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed not having protection measures on anyone and that 's the legislation that states that at the moment so this this provision is about recommending to have a change to legislation which has its own consolidative process that it will go through so this this is a record this is a resolution sorry recommendations or motions that go to new south wales local government new south wales conference right so everybody 's aware of that that 's the procedure so it 's got to go to the conference you have to be adopted go to the government the government will have to consider it now that 's a long convoluted process and there 's no assurance of the outcome however this these are resolutions that go from snowy valley 's council to the local government conference based on that councillor ham i noticed you wished her okay i was going to answer that [Music] fair enough is there any further discussion in committee if not well i think someone would move out of committee this does send a message to the government that um not happy with the merger not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in the past so it sends that message for the same to the same government that had us merged thank you councillor hayes has been moved by councillor here 's the council hand and we we now have a mover and a second after this motion is there any further debate the mover i believe was councillor hayes and the second it was councillor hand is that correct correct right so how do you wish to proceed with this if there 's no amendment do you want to authorize all counsellors pretend if they wish to do it so confirm counsel attendees is two so two do you want to change that resolution in two to say all councillors be authorised to attend the lg nsw conference and three is stated there which is confirming that the voting delegates because we get two votes will be the mayor and the deputy mayor yeah i 'd agree with that we 're in a um we 're in a pandemic um and you know it 's it 's an evolving show and we 're also been elected once again uh to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for this first one let 's just send the mayor and the deputy mayor and i can keep each other company and we can stay home um for me the first time i went to that in my first year i just learned so much range people i knew make contacts things like that i think i think we 're living in a pandemic with you know most of us are vaccinated people vaccinated or had covered or whatever i would like to see councils who want to go so what you 're suggesting and look we 've got a number of amendments here which is becoming a suggested amendment you 're suggesting that the item two that confirm all councillors can attend uh at their own discretion is that what you 're essentially saying we probably need someone and amendments to those so this is all five we 're talking against state your position i moved it the motion as it stands be put oh that 's right that 's what we 're thinking that 's right so always in favor sorry you can 't get to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hayes those are opposed councillor ham council liberal tom [Music] councillor ham i put in an amendment you 're the second so i believe you can put in an amendment could i put the recommendation confirm all councillors at their discretion are able to go to the local government new south wales conference may i 'll make a wording suggestion she 'll authorize all councillors to attend the lg nsw conference if they choose to do so and if i could um have four a three women any debate on the amendment we 've already had a significant debate can you just read out what that was the three in a room did you say four a three you spoke against it name transaction numbers so do you want me so counselors you 've got five parts to this recommendation uh and we go to uh part one stands as it is part two will now read um authorize all counselors to attend the lg nsw conference if they wish part three stays exactly the same part four a three that states the impediment of maintaining rural centre employment numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded from that part part 5 to stay the same as what it is and that 's the decision right so it 's been moved and seconded is there any further debate if not i 'll put the amendment all those in favor of the amendment all those against the amendment council of the latter and council made so the amendment now becomes the motion i 'll put the vote and the less there 's further debate i 'll put the motion always in favor against carrie was against saint james councillor hayes and councillor right okay subject principles 10.7 and that 's on page 43. is there a mover and a second is there any debate if not i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carrie 10 8 application of special rate variation is that the report be accepted every second counselor thompson number one sorry i 'm just moving point number one removed the report on the application of special rate of variation that we receive that report and it 's been seconded by councillor hand all right we 'll move into committee sorry sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against carrie all right now i 've moved that we 're going to committee for the first time we can 't go into committee if you haven 't got anything to discuss we don 't have a motion discussion on is there a second we need a second note councillor thompson all they sorry two to nine two to nine yes two to nine do you wish to go into the committee to discuss the issue been moved it 's been seconded by a counsellor being moved by councillor ham and seconded by councillor hughes we 're now in committee you wish to continue the discussion yes [Music] well yeah this this is probably the biggest single item on your business paper and based on the amount of time we 've spent so far you could be here for some quite some some considerable time i think it 's fairly true to say that it is probably one of the biggest items that we 've been discussing going back all the way from my and it 's created a lot of angst and anxiety within the community and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ourselves in is finding that balance of how do we continue to ensure that there is financial viability moving forward while also addressing and respecting the views of the wider community at the same time the special rate variation figure in point in the recommendations six of 35.95 i feel needs some greater discussion but what 's also really important from this point today is for the community to have a really clear understanding that the decision that will be made around the table today is purely about the application to ipad this is not about determining what that long-term special rate variation will be or indeed how much of it will be implemented and over what period of time because while it does actually state that it 's over two years the council can in its wisdom choose to extend that out further we can choose to reduce the amount of money we cannot increase any special rate variation that was asked and in some ways putting it very bluntly the opportunity to apply for a special rate variation gives this council breathing space to further look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to them about the saving efficiencies can i just hand over to the deputy mayor for a few moments i need to attend to initiative hello and we 're in comedian um if i can just um agree with what has said and i something that 's really i found upsetting this week is uh the front page of the children at all times and the sensations and um in big writing saying that we you know staff numbers have been cut and as councillor thompson has said this is just a first part of senior off to a government body to be discussed that then we come back it 's you know and to i just think you know a holiday down at camp hoban i look at the streets around um how hard this staff has worked and we are only as good as the staff of the snowy valleys council and um i just want to strongly say that um [Music] a little more yeah thank you uh um look this is i suppose it 's true to say a very next sort of question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion in workshops and presentations from the consultants and so on i uh i 've spent a bit of time looking through you know our long-term financial plan and so on and to me there 's some some fairly key points that i think we need to observe [Music] and when we you know we 're considering a special rate variation now one of those points at this time will be not i don 't know what the exact figure is but i know there 's been a lot of money spent um leading up to this now that 's the community 's money that 's been spent in developing you know scenarios and options and so on for the special rate variations so i think it 's probably pretty disrespectful i mean if we we do nothing um so it 's really a question then about okay so what do we do um and i know there 's different options there i think we do have a bit of a little bit of time up our sleeve before our cache position becomes catastrophic or basically run out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this this motion um and i 'm not sure of the process here but whether if people are willing i i can put forward this this amendment and then we can have discussion on that or if people want to thrash out the emotion in front of them first um i 'll hear it yeah yeah we 'd like to hear it thank you i 'm glad you said that just happens just keep it brief unfortunately we 'll have to read it out though ryder okay read it read it right so in order to um to read this out you will need to be looking at the original notion and the points in that because some of those um haven 't changed so at this point in time um the amendment um would still incorporate points one two and three there 'd be no change to those uh point four in my amended version would read the introduction of any special rate variation if approved by ipad shall not be implemented until such time as council has given adequate consideration to all other opportunities for productivity improvements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assets without further community consultation 0.5 remains as written in the original motion 0.6 would now read proceed with an application to the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal ipad under section 508 a of the label government act 1993 for increases to the ordinary rate income of 12.5 per cent in 2022-23 including the rate peak limit and 12.5 percent in 2023-24 including the right peg limit representing a cumulative increase of 26.66 over the two-year period to be a permanent increase retained within the rates um part seven um would now simply read adopt the updated long-term financial plan for 2021-32 to incorporate the amendments as resolved by council after consideration of the impacts of the introduction of a special rate variation of 12.5 per cent each year for two years being a cumulative increase of 26.66 percent that 's where the amendment would end i haven 't included points eight and nine um because i believe there are only administrative things that don 't require a resolution to council i mean if we 're going to lodge an application it goes without saying that application will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and criteria and quite simply if it 's not launched on that basis then people won 't get a hearing um yeah so that 's uh that 's how you can get it up on me look so so this this amendment you 're proposing is being discussed in committee is that correct yes yes okay well we 're still in commitment so this is to inform the yeah council at this point in time that you 're proposing this amendment and making them aware of them so is there any further discussion regarding the emotion that we have before us right which was moved by a councillor larter if i 'm not mistaken and second invite hello we 've got a procedural issue here we don 't have recorded the second of the motion we do that i can 't communicate with that person at the moment genie can you just um can you just turn on your mic and tell me who you thought is the mover and the second for that please yes ma 'am i have counselor john larter as the mover and councillor thompson as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nation in front of we 're now in committee and we 're debating the issue sorry not debating it we 're discussing the issue uh is there any further discussion this all goes back and and some people have to take responsibility for it so it goes back to the state government uh and them not listening it goes back to yourself and counselor thompson former mayors who uh who in my opinion didn 't do enough to stop the merger it goes back to so what is the point of lawyer that i 'm being disrespectful yes i don 't see that i 'm stating facts this is my opinion my opinion so if i can carry on i 've got to make a decision here uh i uh i 'll uphold the point of order uh i think you should possibly rephrase that counselor phase or alternatively refrain um i don 't think that the former mayors did enough to prevent the merger is that acceptable is that okay sorry i um i think you need to rephrase the progress the comment to be quite honest i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the um the merger in in the form of tumbarumba or tumit i don 't think i think that the state government has a lot to do a lot to accept responsibility in that they were the the people who appointed the administrator and they were the people that appointed the the iag and i don 't think either of those uh assisted in the process uh going forward during administration and i think we have we have problems there i see this um this special rate variation as a merger tax and uh and and you know that 's that 's the way it 's been termed in various other councils or particularly in kuda motor gundam but that 's what i see it i see it as a merger tax and it 's it 's a responsibility of those those organizations or the the state government as i said and uh and you know i 've stood against it all along i 've done my best to make it work but it 's it 's a merger tax and we have we we now are left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the best of it um you know like i didn 't i didn 't go to i didn 't go to dubbo and drink from the pool of tool i didn 't see any reflections in in that pool i don 't know what happened there but something came back from there that convinced people that it was a good idea i still remain convinced that it was a bad idea um i can see that already today that you know despite talking about you know wanting to save money councillors don 't have an appetite for um to save money so you know we 've got to start with it with the basics and and work our way up so i think we need to go back to the government and say this is your responsibility this is your you know you are the cause of this and i have forwarded on a letter that i wrote to the minister for local government towards the end of this council term making some suggestions of ways that we could increase our income as a council and ways that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come here and move here and to increase the funds available to council and i hope you 've all read that and i and i hope that the government does something about it but i i see it as a government 's responsibility they 've put us in this mess and they need they need to be able to help us out so um you know it shouldn 't be up to the ratepayers to put their hand in their pocket time and time again because of mistakes that have been made by the state government that 's all before we 're against them [Music] can i just quietly read this out what i wrote last night just to get to perspective i accept and understand that we 're here today i accept and understand that the recommendation states that we should proceed with the special rate variation application in number five of this that 's what we 're here to do today there seems to be confusion in the community and by myself for a long time of what that really means and it does not mean what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35.9 95 srv scheduled for thursday that 's not what we 're doing here today that 's the issue that 's going wrong so instead of and this won 't work for you i know that i 'm going to say it and you may just keep reading many people won 't read or hear the word application could it not read we should proceed with an application that will allow us to use an agreed srv if that should become necessary after we have made our deliberations now i don 't know whether that can be worded that way but that 's my naive way of looking at it or something that makes it clear that we are doing this so we have to back up we have the backup if we need it but after we 've had the time to have all the information upon which to make urban position we are buying time to live up to our very first responsibility as councillors and that is to make well and well-informed decisions we are denied this by everyone including ipad and the department of local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussions over the last eight weeks but as new councillors asking for an extension we 've spent five hours i think in total on actually discussing this it 's a week 's fortnight 's discussion to get to the real issues that we might be able to find to make it to make it more palatable and we are the night that by our state government as james said and by our i cannot believe that the rulers of what we have to live by would give us five hours to come up with a decision on something that 150 000 i think is the figure in the paper consultant has only had suggestions on it it doesn 't make any damn sense at all we need time but we 're not going to get it unless we get some sort of thing in place here but i want the community to understand that if i can sum up here is the fact that you know we have to keep our options open and this is just general discussion and you can correct me if i 've got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way we can do that is between now and the 7th of february when we 've got a lodger an application to ipad is to do exactly that the lodging application wire part this gives us the option or the time i should say to consider all the other alternatives about managing the finances it doesn 't lock the council into anything other than having applied ipads process is then to go back to the community and consult from and even if they are to approve an application council does not have to implement it just gives the council the option and at present based on the fact that we actually became a council last tuesday is that correct the 11th i believe uh the amount of time that 's been available to to come to any reasonable conclusion as to the way forward is is not appropriate in my mind and all this resolution does for whichever resolution is adopted is to give the elected council a breathing space to investigate further the extent of a special rate variation to be implemented or not implemented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the door open we subject the community to a whole resumption of the process which again will cost a very similar amount of money and and i don 't believe one that we should expose the community to that cost and i don 't also believe that we can afford not to provide ourselves with that option so if we want to avoid the cost and keep the options open i don 't think that we have any alternative but to apply that in no way implies that we need to accept the outcome of ipad in the exercise but it gives us time to investigate other alternatives in bringing about savings within the organization to address those issues that are fundamental to the financial stability of the snowy valleys council going forward it 's unfortunate the time frame is so limited but i personally see no other alternative then as i 've said to pick the options over so i 've had my say i don 't know whether that 's clarified things for people but counseling yeah thanks uh man chaffey look i have to you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it would be remiss of us as a council not to apply for the uh full extent to ipad to give us that flexibility and and as it 's been stated here it 's not about making that decision at this meeting it 's basically giving us the ability to make the appropriate decision when we 've got all the information i mean there 's so many um elephants in the room with this stuff like when we look at uh you know say hunters hill council you know they 've got a square a kilometer coverage of about 5.72 kilometers you know when you compare that with our uh pop population which is the same as theirs and and the square meter ridge or kilometers that we 're covering in this area and the the land that 's unrightable it 's it 's horrendous we 've got this anti-competitive behaviour from the government in relation to state forests i mean we 've got these private forests that are paying rates and then the state forest which is a government entity pay no rates i mean that is anti-competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity basically not and then it 's yeah i mean it 's absolutely ridiculous and then we 've got this emergency services levy which is you know nearly i think 10 of our rate income that just goes out the door before we can even look at it so you know there there are things that we need to lobby at a very senior level and i know uh the previous mayor uh james hayes did a lot of that and i i hope that you 'll continue to lobby on our behalf in in terms of where that 's going um you know the national parks there are significant uh interest as well as the state forest in this area and yes we have to to to balance the books and we have to um uh you know look at what options and keep our options open and that 's what we 're doing today uh which i think is is just very very sensible um you know i 'm one of those people that uh you know thought that the the merger probably didn 't go far enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix wrong um that you know we were probably a better option to to move with gundagai and and perhaps create a bigger council um but you know these things are all subjective um i hear where you 're coming from uh a counselor hand do i have a say i assume yeah look i think i think councillor chaffee you uh you summed that up very well i think that 's um you you 've hit the nail right on the head um you 've got to be pragmatic in these situations and that 's exactly what you said move that we go out of committee now we 're back to the debate uh we have who is your deliverance sorry councillor hayes believed that we go out debate councillor ham second out i 'm sorry out of committee been carried so now we 're back debating the motion right now there was a suggestion of sorry debating two through two to nine right so there was suggestion during the um so we 're now back in discussing two to nine is that correct right that 's it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an amendment so if there 's no amendment moved in this stage we 'll deal with the motion um well i would propose to move the amendment as that is outlined [Music] do we have it up on the screen here as to what the amendment is you just need to give me a couple of minutes all right we can stop discussion for a while join the meeting for a few moments until such times that the ceo has got the the meeting is adjourned for a few moments to allow the general managing ceo to put up the resolution on the screen behind us okay right if you want and we can restart a new live stream or we can allow the live stream to continue i think you i can 't see any reason why the live stream you can 't continue depending on how long it takes to get this so i can mute yeah [Music] screen [Music] [Music] i 'll reconvene the meeting and let me explain where we are i believe we are present i 'll be guided by what the general manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have in front of us an amendment to be discussed right it 's been moved and seconded and i think that in light of the magnitude of the issue we need to go back into committee to have a more general abroad based discussion so i 'll thank someone to move that we do that removed by councillor umar and seconded by councillor henry no friday so we 'll have a vote all those in favor against carrie right uh does someone wish to start the discussion councillor hannah um we had a similar discussion back in november and why i i can 't speak for the other councillors but there was very much of the thought that the special rate variation should be smaller than what it was presented to ipad the first time however we left it at the i think it 's 38 at that time we left it at that time because just what panty was saying before it just gave us i i can 't say um he gave us an open book to then go back and do some more research some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd love nothing better to support britain and say twenty six point five yep great good because i don 't want a 38 however this way when we 've done more research and as you said five days is not enough to to make a real decision about this so this way we send it off and when it comes back then we 'll be a lot better informed this is something huge can this be now broken down you 've got three amendments i think exactly yes there 's no reason why we can 't add um agree to the first girls i can share the screen so that it 's on the live stream as well and i 'll work through where we 've got to at this point and you 're still in committee so discussion point and then if you want to talk about doing something else i can cut and paste as we go and i can draft what might be a foreshadow emotion in motion if that is helpful to you so just give me a chance to if you have happy mr mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion because we we need to resolve the way forward here and uh you know council use before i mean it 's not a um [Music] um of the community um i just want to acknowledge that um that probably wasn 't the best result the best coverage of the community um into just a statement all right now you know the point is that the i 've been informed and i don 't know i 'm not in a position to make a judgment here i 've just been told the amount of work that 's involved to address this amendment is significant uh and based on the concept that we are keeping the door open uh i 'll now hand it over to the ceo general manager to give a bit of an explanation as to what 's involved in the process and maybe our chief financial officer might make might want to make a contribution as well so the council 's decision is better informed thank you mr mayor i 'm sharing the screen and i 'll just do a bit of a recap because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public to track where so in blue here i 've got council has moved and second and and carried the council received the report on an application for a special rate variation then we had a motion uh which was essentially as per the recommendations from two through to nine as per the report we then had an amendment to the motion moved by councillor livermore and seconded by councillor thompson and that 's what 's been the the source of the current uh discussion in committee so as this amends what the current process is and as has been indicated by various councillors there 's been a significant investment to date and you 'll see by the council report that there is a very specific process that ipad requires to go through and ipad are the next step in our process whether we choose to go to ipad or not and what we choose to go for to set this up a success to get to the next stage and it 's been highlighted by various counsellors that that doesn 't necessarily mean introduction because we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get ipart to go after consultation and they need to tick their boxes these amendments that have been suggested here that 's currently being discussed puts that at risk because there is a different percentage we 're talking about here that hasn 't been consulted with the community and there 's issues around the long-term financial plan that we have consulted being different so i 'm not i can 't determine what ipad would do but i would say the chances of ipad saying that you need to restart your process would be reasonably um would be higher let 's say let 's say to be higher than what your risk of getting what your chances of getting the current process through now to rework this as per the suggestions here i 'll hand over to the cfo about what behind the scenes work has to happen to actually do this if ipad was requested to request us to go back and do that again thank you mr mayor councillors um changing the actual uh percentage figure at this stage and to a percentage figure that has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-term financial plan in jeopardy it will have to be remodeled entirely uh can it certainly can be done we will have to go back to morrison lowell and get that remodeled but i i think we might be at considerable risk from for ipad not accepting that long-term financial plans because it hasn 't been on public exhibition and you won 't unless you convene an extraordinary meeting you will be able to actually approve this long-term financial planning but it will have considerable changes to it i think it 's doable from a from a work perspective it 's a lot of work but it 's still only the time frames the time frames for public exhibition and adoption will not be adhered to so we would have to rely on ipad basically taking this as an exception and accepting that council made a change to the long-term financial plan without seeing that change so i uh you know the publications from um morrison lowe had three options so i had four options do nothing do very little do something and do a lot and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um rate increase um and we could work our way back into those three other options if needed and if we could and that would each one of those options would incur us trying to find savings and cost cutting issues in our organization so so we 're going to sort of try to go from full door open to and figure out how we can make it again in other ways we might end up having a much lower um percentage we 're going to have to put on to the right case but we have to have time to figure that out exactly where we 're at that 's my understanding of the situation council council ham you had a comment you wanted to make so if we were to go with our first motion and put it into ipad we can though as a councillor council okay um yes that is a possibility and it 's it 's actually a budget decision my biggest issue here is you would have all noticed in the report you have outlined what happens with this largest srv there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is purely the modeling we 've undertaken today the emotion the alternative margin that 's on the table is different to any of those three spell training types and and that 's where i 'm coming from in addition the long-term financial plan would have to change regardless so there 's two steps the first step is none of none of the alternatives that we have is is designed as council even more historically on the table and the second step is a long-term financial plan needs to be rewritten so so do you mind if the video was made by a councilman worldwide 26.6 percent well it 's taken from the report it 's often so to say that it hasn 't been consulted it 's sort of saying that morrison low report didn 't go out for consultation unfortunately due to the rate peak changes this is no longer the case what would be option 2 would currently be 13.2 plus 15 so could we change breaks because of the right peg changes now for the second time unfortunately it 's it is an unfortunate situation the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next iteration of 12.5 12.5 and is no longer the same as the current one simply because the rail peak adjustments had to be made twice [Music] so basically what they 're saying we 're locked into those three options and we need to decide which [Music] well my understanding is there are only two options modeled and that was none from the original 38.1 is that correct what was originally normal was for but they 're no longer valid because in january and then after the october decision by council the only model the two options which was the 38 or not none because we had to um concentrate our resources onto a document that could be put out to public exhibitions so if i can summer to this point in time my understanding is that there are two options obviously i don 't think we 're in a position to be able to say no srb and the maximum srv the issue now becomes if we apply for a different level of sap that we have to do the modeling again and the time frame involved in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate right now i really think that it comes back to the fact that if we proceed at the lower level that 's being suggested here we incur a time problem associated with remodeling if we proceed with the model that 's been modeled for one of a better term we don 't have to do that and the same intent remains so if you leave the right peg application at the 30 whatever it turns out to be now with the model the 35.9 percent that that is the option that would be available to council the other options that are listed i think in the resolution and i 'll have to read them again in more detail still still exist in so far as there 's no requirement on council to take the level of rate pegging that if that if and i pass that if i partner to approve needs to be taken right but the whole problem revolves around the time frame and i think councillor hayes this was the fact that you know there 's such a short amount of time between the new council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep our options open and the closing date of applications so it 's to me it 's it 's probably the best way to proceed with the application as it stands and maybe the debate needs to be around the fact that um we highlight the fact that we 're not in any way endorsing any level of srv and that that 's the issue that i think the community needs to understand is that because of the constrained situation we find ourselves we can 't close the options off however this still remains a lot of decision making points or points at which decisions will have to be made in the process in which we can actually control the outcome i don 't know how the rest of you feel about my summation but i 'd be interested to understand counselor although i 100 agree with you uh man chavy i i think uh the the indication to the public has been uh from the from the outset during the consultation that you know there is a wide range of opportunities within that within that uh 35 38 you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforeseen circumstances but the reality is we have we have gone to the community from day dot and said that this is the maximum we can apply for uh and that 's what we need to do through ipad but it doesn 't bind us to in enforcing that once we get the green light from ipad what we can 't do is have you know such significant amendments uh come before us that are pre-written uh that we we haven 't had any prior knowledge of like if you 're going to introduce something that 's so significantly different to what is in the business paper and you 've got notice of it you 've got a duty to inform the staff so we can have some debate about it before we get here i mean you know now we 're going around in circles because somebody 's tried to change the move the goal posts and and move them so ridiculously to the left that you know we 'd have to basically undo what we 've already done and waste a whole lot more of staff time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view yeah i do and i i 'd note that you know originally we were we were to go to um to election in september last year and uh you know that 's that 's one of the reasons why this has been come such a short time frame um but look i 'm not sure whether it 's political obfuscation or or grandstanding or what but regardless of anything this is just wasting time um what we 've seen you know like castle lard is right you 're right um you know we will get the opportunity later on to decide on the level you know the percentage and when it is introduced this this is just holding holding us up uh and i don 't see any reason so i 'd be happy to go out of committee and put it to the vote so just to have it clarified in my mind all of the work that we were trying to do about getting a special load a new special road variation from ipad it 's already been done so we just got to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided it 's going to come so we 're we 're really wasting a lot of time doing something that 's already been put in place and all we 've got to do as a council is make a decision as to where that went correct it has it has to go to ipart first once it goes to ipad it 'll come back i think it 's important we outline the steps first of all we put in an application right ipad look at the application and go to the community to gauge or to engage the community in consultation now as to the level of that consultation i 'm not sure but i 've been led to believe that that 's is the community aware you know i could be corrected there the next thing is they have to make up their mind about the level that they will approve and they don 't have to approve the amount applied for and then that gives the council assuming they approve the the application that gives the council the right to access up to the amount they approve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its decision as to what level if any that needs to be applied now i use the word if any but based on the information that i think we 've gathered from our eight or nine or ten days of involvement in snowy valley 's council i think we would be naive to think that there won 't be some special rate variation and i think the community needs to be aware of that because i don 't think we can build up fourth hope i think that the issue has to be addressed and and i i believe that we 've got to put the cards on it 's as simple as that counselor i just want a clarification on that so um so i agree with what you 're saying so unless we put in a variation of what 's already um in our business playback which has been said in the movement that 's not going to get through because there 's going to be a significant amount of work to get that through we 've already done that work we 've already got the goal posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal posts put in that rate variation we don 't have to go back to we don 't have to go through that whole process of getting remodeled which is silly we just go forward put in that right here reaction and see what that means i hear what you 're saying uh as the procedure would be to trust me having said that i think the discussion it may be a time-consuming exercise as councillor hayes has put out but i think it has engaged the community assuming that there 's someone out there actually watching in the process and and the deliberations that are necessary or that go on within council to china way forward so i think it 's probably served a good purpose but that 's for others to judge councillor thompson um i 'd just like to raise the issue that that while the council laws sitting around the table get the decision as to what percentage we vote to put up for an srv one of the areas of concern that i do have that i would really hope that we would be included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start looking at the savings whether it 's staff whether it 's the selling off of assets that those decisions are announced come to us as well and that it 's not taken that all staffing issues are just related to the under the ceo 's delegations because i think that part of the fear that has been created through the special rate variation discussions and and the finances is about as was printed on the front page some of the alternatives of selling off assets and staff reduction so i think while we can vote on a percentage that we apply to ipad i 'd also like an assurance at some stage that as councillors we will be further included in the reports that outline how you 're going to actually have those efficiencies i could be wrong here but there 's no way that the council the council staff can employ any level of srv or take any action without particularly on this issue without the approval council now i would imagine if they were to come back to council and say that this is the way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council to seek a 25 percent or 15 srv they would have to outline the issues in the process that they 've enabled them to come to the conclusion and that 's where council gets a chance to please impromada stamp whatever you want to call it on the decision so is there any other decision go up our if i can just add to what the mayor um indicated that council 's decision today is applying to ipad council 's job as in councillors and the staff 's job from monday is to rip all that apart and find out what impact that has on the organization and the community so we can 't wait for the ipad to come back to us and give us the answer we have to make a number of assumptions so whatever percentage any counsellor wants to put forward we need to now work that through to our ipad um our integrated planning and reporting process so we need to develop that look at the community strategic plan we need to form up a delivery program operational plan and budget and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff cannot sell off assets and staff have to come and consult with the councillor about uh very significant service level changes so that information will happen through our integrated planning and reporting process so and then council goes out to consultation on that so while i parts after consultation on whatever it is we lodge an application for if we lodge an application once the staff work through what counsellors have workshopped around our budget into the future our long-term financial plan etc we will then go out to consultation to the public on that and they 'll get feedback so if our plans indicate a particular percentage or whatever and you 'll be able to see what the impact of that is then the public get another opportunity to comment and then council makes a decision um about what they what they actually got so there 's still more consultation processes down down the track so look i know this is being live-streamed and the community need to have their say and the fact that i think this forum the council meetings being live stream gives them an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future of snowy valleys council so look we 've gotta we could relate this for some considerable time and i take councillor as long as it 's productive i 'm prepared to let it go but i think we 've reached a point now where we can make a decision on on the amendment so if someone will move that we go out of committee it 's been moved by council minor and seconded by councillor hayes i put the motion all those in favor against carrie uh debate on the motion as put or presented i should say uh sorry the amendment my apologies um i 'll put the amendment uh unless there 's further debate on the amendment do you want to go through it again it should is it up on the shoulder screen down down main advice please yeah close the debate um we 've probably had enough um a couple of points on my regardless of the potential grandstanding and you made a comment about what 's great this is there then and for the public um i think it 's even better that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uh i don 't view that as being a waste of time okay um look the uh we will probably have to accept all right if there 's got to be massive work to go and redo it okay that 's that 's not an option because there 's been too much money spent on this already um the bit i would probably still like to included in that motion is uh before as i had it there because that sends a clear message to the public and that 's not necessarily for us internally the public need to know about the decisions we are making and the processes we 're looking at in order to make those decisions uh look probably for me to suggest how you go about this but you could uh you could vote on the amendment and then there 's no reason why you couldn 't foreshadow an amendment eg number four to be included in the original i mean that motion right yes so from a procedural point of view i think that 's probably the best way to go about it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you don 't i 'll put the amendment now you understand all understood what i was suggesting we 're going to uh i 'll get manager ceo to talk you through this so that you 're all adequately informed before you make a decision so what we 're considering at the moment is the amendment so and that was what councillor livermore proposed and that 's to receive three acknowledge as per the recommendation in the council report four is a variation to say basically that we wouldn 't proceed until we fully consider the other opportunities around productivity improvements reduction in services sale of assets five is as per the staff report proceed with the permanent special rate variation application six is changing the percentage amounts are there to 12.5 and 12.5 seven is adopting a long term plan with 12.5 for each year totaling 26.66 eight is as per the recommendation uh in the staff report to authorize the ceo and ninety that as per the recommendation considering implementation if this gets up this then becomes the motion that you vote on if it doesn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original motion original motion yes sorry which was essentially two to nine of uh the staff report as heard but there is a proposal that there might be a foreshadowed amendment that is this with four included as an additional item on it so everybody is aware of what they 're waiting on i 'll stop the share so that the public can see clear of what people are i think winners are foreign [Music] subsequent amendment to include what was number four in the so it gets very involved but at least it 's well from procedural point of view i think it 's correct righto so based on the the fact that you all should know the facts now i 'll put the amendment always in favor against i 'll declare the amendment lost and now we go back to the original motion which was two three to nine i think because that 's two through to nine not three to nine now there has been foreshadow an amendment to that in so far as i believe it 's an addition to those recommendations is am i correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know i think you 're spot-on if the second is happy i 'm happy to include that if it 's a reasonable uh change if it doesn 't uh it 's up to you second are happy councilman thompson are you happy to have that included without having to yes so space the mover and the secondary happy to have that included if there 's no further debate i 'll put the motion and the motion is i can 't say is it up on the screen but in essence is what was the original recommendation from the executive or staff and with the inclusion of item number 10 which is the introduction of any special rate variation if approved by ipad shall not be implemented until such times as as council has given adequate consideration to all other opportunities for the productivity improvements and council will not endorse reductions in service levels sale of assets or any further community without further community consultation so having read that it 's been moved and seconded if there 's no debate i 'll put the motion always in favor against carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second by council at hand if there 's no further debate i 'll put the nation always in favor against carriage 1010 statement of investments november 21 merver councillor ham council arrival second oh any debate i only just wanted to make the point that it 's good to see investments going up for show if there 's no further comment or debate i 'll put the motion all those in favor against carrie item 1011 is the statement of investments for december 21 the mover council thompson the second act council arrival any debate or discussion if not i 'll put the motion always in favor against carried we 'll now go to twelve one as we 've already dealt with eleven one minutes of commit meetings 12-1 is the meetings of the disability inclusion access reference group meeting of november 21 is there any comments no i want to thank someone to move counselor hand the seconder counselor debate no i 'll put the motion all those in against local traffic committee 25th to august 21 any issues if not i 'll see someone to move [Music] council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not i 'll put the motion always in favor against carrie i believe that concludes the business of the ordinary meeting of the 20th of january 2022 i thank everybody for their attendance and and their involvement in the debate i think it 's it 's been a good opportunity to put certainly some of the newer counselors to get some understanding of the process and look i 'll be the best one to admit maybe i haven 't got it right i 'm quite happy to have a critique of my handling of the meeting subsequent to our closure so thank you all very much i don 't think uh through you mr manager ceo that we need any other issues so at this point i 'll close the meeting somewhere sometimes"

years in particular since the bushfires and they 're not when they replace the poles have not replaced the lighting and now we we are we able to bring that to their attention in batliner there are at least five streetlights that haven 't been replaced since the bushfire thank you councillors and i 'll hand over to the director of infrastructure yeah through you through you mr chair cancel easelmen um yeah thank you very much for raising that i wasn 't i wasn 't aware of that that they hadn 't been replaced um any information we can get on locations would be great and uh yeah i 'll certainly raise that with essential energy because yeah my expectation is that if fire impacted infrastructure they should they should be replacing that particularly given that uh yeah we 're the owner of that infrastructure and we pay for it thank you very much mr mayor um because some of the polls no longer have the um the tag number on the poll so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tag number as such through you mr mr mayor i 'll i 'll arrange for one of our surveillance officers to uh do a check through batlow and we 'll see what we can uh identify and maybe yeah if anyone lets you know that there 's there 's a lot they know of a light that 's missing yet past pass that on to us and we 'll we 'll and i 'll let you know the five i know and pass the word around thank you fantastic thank you thank you uh castor pichai just thank you mr uh the trains getting back to the transcript polls i 've noticed that they are looking at the map that they 're going right beside busy mill adlong can you tell me this is there any significance in that it 's got has he got any plan to join up or manufacture electricity on site um katherine pritchard i chair the busy community consulting committee we met last week i asked that very question what the what why was it necessary to have the transgrid line going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wasn 't necessary to have them as far as he was concerned the transcript going to the mill and there was no um although they do produce energy on on site it only equates to about half of what they use but there 's no they said there were no immediate plans to have any further energy production um on on site that they would be looking to export via that um via that hume link given that they already have two uh high voltage lines coming into the into the site it just seems an amazing coincidence it does it does and that 's why i asked the question the manager was particularly frank uh on the night thank you anything further counsellors mrs put the nation all in favor that brings us to the minutes of the the um meeting held by video link on thursday the 30th of july 2020. do i have a mover for those minutes cancel the right cancel of ham anything arising from those nothing i 'll put the notion that we accept those minutes all in favor that 's carried [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the to the mayoral minute local government seat on the national cabinet um so uh i need to uh first of all um we need to have a move for those or do we i 'd rather before we do that we make an amendment to that uh and just by way of explanation this is a uh this is something that 's been sent to all councils by local government new south wales and probably uh in other states as well uh and uh we we did admit um our local member for aubry and we also would like to i 'd like to make sure that he 's added to that uh dustin clancy but also um before we we move it but also have our local um mlcs uh uh uh added to that and that would be wes fang nick leach and brony taylor uh and as well as that uh following his interest in the uh in the bushfires and um his presence here for much of that much of the time during the fires um michael mccormack the deputy prime minister if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also add uh matthew mason cox as well because he 's the liberal uh mlc for this area okay certainly thank you uh were you moving that way councilmember with those editions thank you do i have a second bethlehem uh comments i think it 's a great idea but uh this covered virus has exposed a lot of thoughts in our national constitution to my mind uh i 'm putting up a notice at the next meeting regarding the fact regarding this and uh looking towards using the opportunity of the covered crisis to look at our national constitution to look at a lot of the anomalies that occur with our present form of governance i 'll say that more at the moment but just for sharing that motion thank you kev for precharging certainly code and uh and that is going to be the catalyst for for lots more change i believe as well so with those um with those additions uh councillors um i 've spoken to uh um mr clancy and uh he 's happy with that uh i 'll put the notion all in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new south wales annual conference november 2020 assuming it goes ahead councillor smith that 's my right simply to say that this is an important event for local councils to be able to network with each other as well as a lot of information about what 's going on in the national site or the state scene and um and to also have the opportunity to have input into the business of the meeting uh through our mayor and deputy mayor in this case and so i think it 's an important thing for us to obtain thank you uh any further comment oh thanks mr yeah i think it could well be that it 's a non-meeting because of the covered virus i 'd like to be involved in it if it 's some way of doing it online i can 't go to the meeting unfortunately but uh maybe that we can be involved if they change their way of presenting it or running the meeting councillor pitcher i 'd say there 's every op there 'll be every chance that there is some uh opportunity for for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if it does go to uh learning so um i i guess we just say uh nature intention and um and stay tuned thank you and i would like to um follow that through in the same vein please thank you councillors um so the motion we 've got is for um for those uh those counsellors to to attend this the the budget is unexpected to date which is not unusual given given the circumstances so i 'll put the motion all in favor that 's carried thank you um 20 2019 2020 operational plan fourth quarter update 10.2 two recommendations uh calculate cross cancel hand i think castle picture is just falling i 'm sorry i 'm just squirreling there 's my other hand um castle cross i i think this has been an extraordinary result where we got out of the the operational plan out of the capital works we 've got 71 of those have been completed uh and out of the major projects we 've got 60 percent of them in train with 40 complete i think given the year we 've had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got 104 actions done out of the 111 so it really is a magnificent achievement on behalf of the staff and i 'd like to congratulate them thank you council cross anything further councillors castle ham um i i agree with you kate i think um how you guys have got through the operational plan as well as you have it 's um just tremendous i um something that 's been brought to my attention a lot and councillor wilson and councillor schmidt probably closer to this is 2.6 point two um and that is to complete a uh program business case for that low cannery site that um tests investments options and identifies a preferred mix of development steps to be delivered over the next five to ten year period now it was impacted by bushfires i just don 't understand why now there 's not i mean there 's still that space there why there isn 't going to be a business case and if that that is the case that 's fine but where 's the money going mr mayor um councillor ham the um that item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to the bushfires there was money set aside council made a decision to do the demolition of the site which cost a lot more money and that took up uh the money for the business case as well however we have been able to put aside some money for future master planning around that site as part of our funding program and i might ask mr holton to just give us some more details on that uh through you mr mr mayor um there has we have approximately 90 000 um uh allocated to uh the um process whereby we will undertake an environmental assessment of the site as well as a spatial assessment of the site and then go back to the community and engage with them around what future use there may be for that site going forward [Music] with the knowledge and understanding of what the um environmental limitations are and how the site may work spatially uh in relation to the rest of the town thank you and i mean that sounds fantastic and sounds like the priorities excellent there however there 's some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um why uh why why is it being leased already before that sort of consultation how has that come about there was a uh public uh expressions of interest process undertaken in relation to the um the the future of that cannery site um and uh there were a number of submissions um and the two well there were a number of submissions and uh only one was uh left viable following the bushfire and that is the purpose to which it is currently being leased for so council has currently leased out the site to a um to a a nurseryman for the propagation of um uh pine seedlings um which will assist in the um assisting the uh i guess re rebuilding the future of the plantation pine timber industry um and uh i know that in confidential there is a there is a a report considering um another purpose of that style thank you so so there can 't be any probity issues with this at all it went to expressions of interest it 's we 're followed due process that 's correct counselor him thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i may please um i 'd just like to compliment the um work that 's been going going on in relation to the cannery and in particular the initial the um the opportunity to gain employment for people within the town because um the um [Music] the planning for the cannery site can 't be blue sky thinking it has to be reality backed by finance and that 's what we need for the township of batlow is financial investments in the town that are real finances and not just somebody dreaming up a great idea with no backing so i 'm i 'm personally very pleased to hear that um this particular initial opportunity has come come to fruition if that 's the case thank you thank you council wrestleman um counselors anything further on the uh operational plan put the motion all in favor that 's carried unanimously think counselors that brings us to um governance and finance reports 10.3 disbanding of council committees there 's a few committees there that um we we feel we can do without um seven uh eight recommendations there do i have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr mayor against this we go into committee yes do i have a second of that all in favor unanimous in committee council pritchard thank you mr mayor a number of committees have fallen by the wayside over recent years and partly because their functions were fulfilled for example the railway precinct committee but one that worried me is that the wetlands committee has disappeared and this largely was well established but on the other hand i don 't like to leave a vacuum there i 'd like to see a river walk committee set up to give advice and make plans for future expansion of the tumor river walk now that 's just one example but i wonder whether we shouldn 't be calling for public comment on this before we pass it all and ask for i mean we shouldn 't just have a i believe a uh a motion to disband committees i think it 's a reasonable emotion to look at the committee 's committees all together whether we should have new committees as well but i i think that uh they played a very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these community bodies and i think we should be looking at it and i 'd certainly be proposing that we have a timid river walk committee established at some stage but should we put it down for public comment we we can do that um but the the motion we 've got here is to to disband some of these this doesn 't um so uh that would be a separate motion i think or something we could discuss at a workshop and then and then move on from there the idea of a complete trails committee um might be an opportunity it 's just the trails there are all sorts of trails being put up in the air and many of them are fanciful i think but i think the riverwalk in turmeric is one of the icons of the area and these i think a lot of people use it a lot of people have input and that 's one thing that i 'd like to see establish whether we do it now or at the next meeting i don 't know yes and i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us too yes yes absolutely i may um council does consider annually in september its list of committees and the future and the representation on those committees so that will be on the agenda for the next council meeting thank you picture even yeah i 'm happy but i 'd like to hear what the other councils have to say council cross was next i think i think it gives us an ideal opportunity to look at the committees that we are dissolving because there 's a great opportunity for them to be linked into a bigger picture snowy valley 's council committee for example the tumbarumba airfield that can go you know there are other airfields within snowy valleys council that they can all come together and now that we 've got zoom this is an ideal opportunity for people who may not want to actually physically come to meetings but they can still participate in those meetings so i think it gives us an ideal opportunity for that september meeting to look at how we can revamp them i think uh thank you mr mayor i 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're proposing to disband snowy valley 's tourism committee i was in fact as you may recall partly involved in getting that committee set up at the beginning of their council term um but i 'd would just like uh perhaps for our chief executive officer to uh perhaps explain how the production of that committee is now in fact being undertaken by other committees and other departments within council through you mr mayor i think that 's more of a question for the director of the community in corporates tourism and economic developments in his portfolio thank you so the uh as written i think as articulated in the report sorry through you mr mayor has articulated in the report the um we are establishing uh focus groups a focus group on economic development which will include a tourism focus as well thank you and i think we should mention destination riverina as well um and the big part they play with tourism in our area well yes we do we we do uh have officers who work um specifically around promoting uh the region as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractorists and another officer who promotes the things that people can do within the region for the tourists and we do a lot of liaising with destination uh riverina murray um to uh to actually come up with projects to um bring more people into the region so we 're very active in the tourism space and uh through these focus groups we we would be seeking broader input from the people involved in the tourism business and the tourism industry to get their thoughts and ideas around what we can do into the future thank you uh counselor uh castellata um only to say that it 's not always my experience but sometimes i think these uh committees become cartels you know they end up with collective interest groups on them um they don 't deal with a lot of substance and you end up getting uh political agendas driven by some members who you know want particular outcomes um and i agree with council across i think it should be more of a holistic approach across the whole spectrum of the of the committee 's uh more balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you deal with all the airports in one committee i mean it just just makes sense and i mean the last thing we want is the staff being overrun with reports and running committees and um councillors who can 't get to these things because you know there 's a meeting on every half hour i mean it 's not what we want or it 's not what i want thank you councillor um just to reiterate what has been said previously but this um review of council committees is a wonderful opportunity to go forward and support one snowy valley 's council instead of having town centric council committees and i think that 's a very important direction thank you councillor pritchard yes yes the final thing of course is i 'm just using tourism tourism as an example most of or any committee really most of the people on the involved are people whose professional employments regarding safer tourism but that doesn 't necessarily represent the broad committee who we represent and i think it 's our councilor 's responsibility to be involved in some of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these serious commit committees to stop them being made hobby horses for his particular issues thank you castle pitcher anything further castle cross i think we 've got a perfect opportunity to start looking at all of our committees really because we 've got um some governance issues around our three five five committees that we 're looking at and you know this and it 's obvious that if no these committees are not being um they 're no longer active or they 've never been established then it 's it really is an ideal opportunity to to do an audit of all the committees and what are which ones are going to be how how they 're going you know what 's the best fit for all of them thank you uh council lada oh i 'll just pick up on what uh councillor cross said there i i 've that 's been a um a subject that 's come up at the uh the governance um committee meetings audit committee meetings about three five five committees because essentially i think there needs to be a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is going on in inside some of these committees um you know as you 're aware some of these uh committees uh uh you know could be uh potentially leaving us liable um with regards to their conduct um and you know and we 're not fully aware of what 's going on and they 're not reporting um exactly what 's going on and you know information is very scarce so you know it definitely needs a um a thorough investigation and look thank you um this was actually one of the recommendations that the eric which is totally independent of council one of their recommendations that we look at three five five committees they saw that as a risk for both those committees and for council so it really is a very timely opportunity councillors uh would someone like to move that we go out of committee councillor wright councillor lata all in favor carrie unanimously thank you councillors we still have those act recommendations there do we have a mover councillor smith councillor hamm e for the discussion put them put them open all in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four recommendations council hand that 's the latter tesla just to encourage public to look at this um policy and for us to have a good close look at it as well um before it 's passed thank you anything further put the motion all in favor [Music] that 's unanimous thank you quarterly ncifscf grants report kessler hamm chancellor i i just love looking at this for this report what we 've achieved or what everyone on council has achieved is remarkable so congratulations i just wouldn 't mind um asking the director for infrastructure um there 's 90 000 left on the rail trail i 'm just hoping that gets a couple of toilets along the way is that a possible thing director executive of course the mayor councillor ham yeah very very much intending to utilize that funding to further enhance things the the rail trial we 're in negotiations with the department now discussions around how we vary the scope to include additional toilets i think that 's the probably the priority thing on our on our list of um of enhancements um yeah and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the leftover funding to do those additional works and i 'll keep it i 'll keep cancellers posted on how we go with that well congratulations it is just such a pleasure going there and seeing a amount of people in tumblr it 's brilliant thank you anything further i 'll put the motion all in favor council smith yep gotcha thank you unanimous um 10.6 statement of investments as of july castle ham council orlando um yep well these are looking very good congratulations to cfo and um i would like to just probably back to the director of infrastructure again um we 've got 2.2 million dollars coming in our ms payments is that normal for this time of year or have we got extra is that because of extra contracts and i noticed that we 've spent 617 000 on the alpine way so we 've spent that but how is the alpine way going and um is there any progress there at all and are we doing it who are you mr mayor uh canceled ham great question thank you very much thank you you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to to promote i think roughly speaking we 've completed in the order of five million dollars of work for transport for new south wales on the state roads and some slope stabilization works on alpine way been a very successful year and yeah all that work has has been completed and that 's what you can see there as far as the financial um translations go right and then the other way any magical update or is its status quo still the same uh sorry are you referring to ali or eliot way or well i 'm i am return sorry yes i am yes yes i am that 's a bit of a stretch sorry mr mayor i believe the general manager to advise on the status of elliott way thanks uh mr mayor to councillor ham we have had um more discussions with parks and wildlife service regarding assisting them they are working through their process at the moment and one of the holdups is actually doing some of the testing while the ground is frozen is not able to be completed so they have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done they are preparing to get out to tender as soon as possible and uh council has uh also notified them of our capability with our third party works program and the certifications in which we have to be able to assist them as another government agency rather than taking a longer procurement process and going out to to the to the whole community for that and our processors obviously do use our local contractors as well so that would have significant benefit we are at every forum that we get um taking the opportunity to push along and getting the alley away open as soon as practically possible thank you and and and sorry about my mix up there but back to the alpine way did have we got anywhere with that 60 um the 22 kilometers of 60k zone and i know that 's has that anything come back on that and how is it impacting things have you any feedback in that area um i yeah uh through you mr mayor cancer ham i haven 't received any feedback directly but we do have a traffic committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question there and see if we can get gets get some feedback and then i could refer that back to cancel that 'll be excellent thank you anything further all in favor unanimous thank you 10.7 financial report casper pritchard you 're moving that no i 'm just moving up sorry [Music] i 'll get you on the book do i have a mover whistleman thank you very much and a second this is like pulling teeth counselor benjamin thank you anything any comment i had i had a question yeah yes sorry mr mayor i was going to ask to see if she wouldn 't mind talking to this report cfo thank you through you mr mayor council ham this um it it is a self-explanatory report really the basically we 're doing a first months of financial reporting which is usually a bit difficult because the budget spread is over 12 months we 're doing well for the first months but we also are still finalizing financial statements for last year so we are actually not in a position to give you a full financial report with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emotional and i 'll cast this fit sorry yeah in terms of the um expenditure there 's a note on this budget that employee costs are above budget by a considerable amount 32.51 and i just wanted to make the notes that this is made up of time staff engaged in disaster recovery and that the bushfires and of course again the covert situation now has impacted greatly on council 's expenditure so that 's reflected in in the budget thank you councillor yes and traditionally um people would be away or on toil or whatever this time of year this council of right would know um cfo did you have something to add to that yes thank you mr mayor for you um most of these projects are actually funded so it 's an in and out there will be a relative revenue against these extra expenses as well thank you thank you council smith anything further councillors promotional favor unanimous thank you uh 10.8 re review and approval of carryovers russell hamm councillor cross bethlehem um thank you this is um quite interesting the one point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like rumbling around in the background is the ross corner medical center lease and um there 's a carryover 58 000 there just wouldn 't mind talking to um the executive um paul holton about why that is and you know if if this is a leased building why why isn 't that 58 000 why wasn 't that spent you know why we 've got all these locums so we want to keep attracting them and it probably would be great time if you give us an update on how things are going with ross corner medical center that 's just that 's your second longbow uh today counselor hand but uh mr holton um we we currently have um uh locums uh regularly swinging through the um the uh ross corner medical center so we continue to provide a a good service there to the community um we have uh we did have a a doctor that was interested in leasing the uh the building and and establishing or continuing the practice there um some time back but unfortunately uh when he was located in western australia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has remained in that location so therefore any negotiations that we had with that doctor uh stalled and and have not been able to be picked up since then so we continue to uh swing locums through um and at this stage um the you know the the cost of of doing that is probably uh greater uh greater but but at the same time we do uh generate income which uh in general covers the cost of operating the practice okay and there 's still um i noticed in the tumblr times there were articles saying that we 're pushing to sell the building and at this stage as far as i know that is not the case at all at this stage we 're just looking for a doctor at this stage i can say um that there have been some inquiries from doctors who wish to uh who would who would be interested in taking over the practice um but unfortunately they would want to purchase the building as part of taking over that practice and uh as uh we have had um a position where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable outcome uh with the community the selling of that building uh to date we haven 't progressed any of those um those discussions i think that 's appreciated by the tomb raider community council wrestling apologies my apologies um thank you mr may um on number two commence projects the very first one recognizes um the lot in section number that refers to hides park as the location for the sound system and i 'm not sure that hides park is actually officially gazetted as the name of a location in butler but as it has emerged as a colloquial term for that space and i 'm just drawing attention to the fact that we maybe need to pay attention to the naming of things in some of these details because as i know it hides park is just you know the the local terminology for that particular area so we need to move on that one i think we decided through council to ratify this park some time ago but that would be somewhere in the minutes that 's something we can we could look up uh through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have an official signpost at the front that says hides park but we will ascertain whether that is confirmed in resolution castle cross i 'm a bit confused if you look at the approved budget and then you look at the amount of money expended the carryover amount doesn 't balance with the approved budget so i 'm a bit confused as to uh what what some of those figures actually mean for example if you look at the fitzroy park bollards the approved budget was sixteen thousand seven hundred and seventy what 's been expended is seven thousand nine hundred and something and the carry-over amount is seven thousand it it um it doesn 't actually my calculations it should actually be 7 000 something oh sorry not that one another one but but some of them they don 't balance out if you see what i mean so i was just a bit confused thank you council cross that 's uh uh that 's probably a question for the cfo thank you mr mayor um councillor cross the carryover amount reflects what our best estimate is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to budget as budget estimates can um sometimes be a bit off when when you finally have the final amount yep yep that makes sense thank you i just thought it just doesn 't quite add up and i was confused thank you to the cfo uh anything further counselors casa lata um just back to the ross corner um uh medical center i was just i don 't know whether it 's clear or not but if if there has been an expression of interest from anyone to purchase that building and um and to uh put forward a plan for an ongoing medical practice into the long term into that facility i i 'd hope that that would come to council to be considered as part of any normal rather than not not not been seen is that the case um it was my understanding that council was um had uh ruled out the sale of the building however if there is um if council would would like to discuss uh you know an offer from a from a medical practitioner who also wishes to purchase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh to a counsellor discussion for you know consideration as to how to progress with with such a an offer if there were concerns around the uh ongoing provision of medical services through the building um uh you know a covenant-like uh instrument could be put on title that uh ensured that the building could be only used for such a purpose therefore ensuring the ongoing provision of medical services in that area through that through that facility so there are there are legal ways to to get an outcome that would be consistent with i guess the desires of the community to have that building um continue to fulfill the function of a medical practice but you know at this stage we haven 't progressed those discussions uh based on the um any any discussions involving the sale of the building based on previous um previous resolution of council councillor lada was made very very clear to me after the rally up there and the all the phone calls and emails and everything i got as well as a petition that the community did not want it sold they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were happy not to sell it to a doctor even if it was the case that that was the only way they could fill it with a doctor um they did not want it sold and they made that very very clear um despite the fact that there was a doctor wanting to buy it and set up a practice so i think that 's the way that 's that 's what was presented to me and to us so i guess you know um it 's a community driven um you know it 's community driven and that 's what they want uh they also are adamant uh that you cannot put a covenant on it uh i i 've i my my uh opinion was that i thought you could but i 've been told unequivocally by the experts of the september umber people in the ross corner advocates that you can 't put a covenant on it counselor right i think we could talk to the community a bit more about this because like i 'm i i attend that doctor surgery and and a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of us are sort of thinking it 'd be damn nice to have the one doctor you go and visit each time because you 've got a bit of a problem you 're going to visit the doctor and they 're all been pretty good i can 't say they 've been bad but i 've been a bit crook lately and i 've gone to three doctors now so and they 've got three different opinions and it would be nice if we had a doctor there who belonged to us and was interested in following through i mean they look at your notes and stuff but you know i think time we looked at it again maybe a little bit more open mind and maybe a little bit more relaxed atmosphere about it and i and maybe our consultations a bit better and certainly to go through the chamber of commerce and maybe through um lions and rotary and just make our consultation better yeah i agree you wanted doctors obviously anchored into the community his family and get involved in the community affairs he might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice to have somebody who wants to live [Music] the paradox is of course that that 's exactly what we had we had a doctor who wanted to buy the building and settle here and he you know i agree that was a pretty emotional emotionally charged time and i think with a bit of fight discussion now we might get a different outcome and people have you know we 've got time to think about these things so i think we should just think about again i i personally believe that we should if somebody 's committed to wanting to buy here and live here and we should support that that 's only my personal opinion but i would i would like to have the opportunity to talk other people in town about that thank you all right i think it 's probably enough on that one we might just move on councillor smith quickly i was going to ask about going into committee on this one i think we probably had enough on this it 's not it 's we 're stretching stretching some things a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old drive calming um project it 's under construction and i 've noticed that there are bars across the road at the um at the racecourse and at the broughton street end but there isn 't any uh anything to slow the traffic down at the fitzroy street or the the main road uh entrance is that still going to happen uh i might hand over to mr couch are you mr mayor councillor smith yes um that 's yeah there 's some more of those treatments to go in i think another four in total okay thank you subjective budget thank you anything further on that put the motion all in favor carried unanimously castle right yep okay moving on to svc committee strengthening grants so as i mentioned this is the one that i 've got uh um number i and that 's the this woman has um [Music] oh is that correct that 's correct mr mayor can i make a suggestion that uh we deal with all of those recommendations into except for ino and that we deal with ino separately and the relevant counsellors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you so will someone move that uh except for 2i and 200. counselor wright counselor han discussion counselor right hi um i would like to discuss this um congratulations to the to the 16 people who got it and there were 35 applications so no no doubt it was quite a tough um thing to work out who got what and 269 000 was asked for but there was only 97 000 to be given so um tough call i would like to discuss the governance of how this was done though um previously there were two buckets um southern and northern they 've been put together um i i 'm not sure it certainly didn 't come to council who were who was to be on the committee to decide who got what funds the people who on there thank you you 've done a great job but i would like that to be reviewed so that there was equity with north and south having councillors from either end on that committee mr mayor if i may um councillor ham uh as uh indicated earlier on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every september and last september we 've made a decision around who would be the member of the committee that goes and reviews the grants yes we have had a process in the meantime where we 've combined the grants program together to a one svc model and that wasn 't the membership of that committee wasn 't reviewed at that time however next month council will have the opportunity to consider who are the councillors on those committees and as we 're going through the section 355 committee review establishing proper terms of reference and assistance to those committees that we establish thank you thank you anything for the counsellors councils will put one and two excluding i and o all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you i 'm leaving the room and i i just want to do them one at a time so um mr mayor if you would like to leave into the breakout room first yes mr mayor has gone uh deputy mayor chairperson councillors we 've got um i to deal with which is uh the allocation of money six thousand one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a member and a secondary councillor ham and councillor schmidt any comment uh there was a question here about the amount no that 's fine i thought it didn 't tell you is it when let 's look at the listing uh the building that they occupy to um to i think it 's like a crafty sort of place where people drop into that along and um that 's uh it 's uh and it 's occupied by rustic creations any further comments not i 'll put that all those in favor what about number three hudson management committee is that is it that in the group we 've already dealt with that jeff that was the previous one so i was just dying at the moment yeah any comments in relation to i i 'll put the motion all those in favor again let 's carry unanimously councillor esselman would you go into the breakout room would you mind asking the mayor to return i can do that for you sir thank you very much let 's wait for the mayor to return to the meeting he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor just advising you that uh council unanimously uh the allocation of those funds to avalon community enterprises and uh we haven 't dealt with zero uh oh yeah handing over thank you council lada and thank you councillors um moving back uh so do we have a mover for oh castle cross and councillor ham any discussion on it 's a it sounds a great project because i know the lands army was quite um quite active uh in in butler at that time and to record that would be a great achievement i think so yeah fully supported yeah i think so and i think it can go further than that i think if we if there was some sort of permanent display to the land army there you may well um um have the the sons and daughters and grandchildren and ultimately great grandchildren of the women who were there coming up to visit batlow to see what it was like and to have their pictures taken in front of the land army um mural so i i think it 's a really exciting thing i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential to generate tourism castle smith um there is currently a mural of about the land army on one of the shops adjacent to hides park i understand that this is a second mural i 'm not quite sure where this is planned to be executed the current one is partly obliterated by a sign that has just recently been erected which has a map on it uh of battle and unfortunately that that map is actually quite inaccurate there has been some discussion with the director about having that relay list can i just stop the discussion for a minute just ask um councillor esselman if you can uh we haven 't finished yet so if you could go back into the thank you sorry about that technology getting used to it sorry just don 't know how to return you 'll tell me let me know i will [Music] set that up again okay councilorsmen can you see the junior interest breakout room now so that council this one has gone back to the naughty room um castle smith please carry on um yes look um that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mural uh partly obliterated by the signing front and uh mr holton has agreed has arranged to have that move but as part of that move could i please um refer to the fact that a lot of people in battle have made it known that that map on that sign is quite inaccurate uh in many respects so could that be looked at when it 's being relocated to actually reflect the true nature of the way batlow is currently laid out and the other question was where is the second mural going to be executed is it on the same wall or elsewhere i i can 't answer that question um it 's in that line if we could take that matter on notice we can let you know the answer to that question thank you okay nothing further councils i 'll put that motion all in favor uh castle cross i can 't see i 've got a breakout room thing in front of me gotcha okay carried unanimously thank you um ceo could you invite i 'll just um excuse me for a minute i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay i was just going to say mr mayor be an opportunity to thank luke from snowy hydro and snowy hydro for their participation in that in that group that selected the the applications that would be wonderful perhaps we could we could perhaps move that way uh snowy hydro of course put 20 000 into that second uh councillor smith anything further on that so are we clear on that minute taker that we 've got a motion to thank snowy hydro for their um involvement and financial support for these grants yes is there no money from home to my knowledge put demotion all in favor [Music] gary mr mayor that uh i think uh just on the on the background of that last debate about the murals that they are a very good idea um in in sort of portraying our history perhaps given the fact that i think council probably owns the water tower at the tumor hospital site whether if any grant funding becomes available that that be uh proposed as a future opportunity to maybe highlight the history of the uh medical services on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea thank you council orlando uh councillors moving on um management city 's power partner partnership program it 's hard to say cities power partnership program a little bit of alliteration there council across councillor ham interestingly uh councillors i did get an email uh the other day asking why we weren 't part of this and i was happy to be able to respond that we were looking at it at first on thursday so council costs i think it 's a it fits beautifully in with our climate change forum that we had it actually exposes us to a much broader um platform we 've got access to experts in the field both here and overseas is my understanding and i think it 's just a a logical extension of what we want to achieve i think it 's great thank you councillor cross anything further councillors councillor hannah i just support that ask people to read the partnership action pledge on page uh well it says 14 on the screen but 94 which actually um points out you know using renewable energy and making sure that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you uh minutes of the committee meeting 12.1 audit risk and improvement committee cast la crosse and council lata council across think it 's really important that we have this independent body it 's working extremely well the chairperson is very vigilant about going through all of the things that that come before to discuss and as we highlighted prior with councillor lata the 355 committee review that came out of that so you know it 's really good to have that external looking at what we 're doing and make it to make sure that what we 're doing is is as it should be thank you council costs anything further all in favor [Music] thank you those minutes are accepted minutes of the battle development july 1. [Music] castle smith castle ham there 's four recommendations there any anything um number three that council or there 's a recommendation from the batlow development league that council seek urgent access to the battle canary site for contamination using current resources and so forth can we has there been any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary or have we completely cleaned up that site i think that was alluded to earlier by mr holton i might ask him mr holton thank you through you mr may yes has allocated funds as per um recommendation for for an environmental assessment in relation to the site as well as a spatial assessment for the site and then further community engagement uh in respect of how the the site may be used and how it will fit into the future of that load thank you mr holton anything further councillors councillor ham [Music] um just in in terms of 4b relating to the old pack house look i 've heard from some people it 's fine some people it 's not some people it 's been burned inside across the board there is a lot of people use the word condemned now but is that through um council of jurisdiction can we condemn buildings uh once again ask mr halton through you mr mayor um where buildings are dangerous my understanding is that we can order you know the the buildings be uh made undangerous in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have the the power to um insist that um that the entire structure be demolished and certainly it 's not a matter for council to be involved in um council has brought the matter to the attention of the epa as well as met with the public works authority to to discuss the the overall state of the building and what it could do uh in relation to its demolition and that was the um the position that public works uh arrived at that they would they would in fact demolish the fire affected parts of the building and and and no more thank you holden just in relation to um councils responsibility and due diligence with um when we 're aware or when we 've been advised that there may be chemical contaminations what what what have we done in relation to that mr holden for you mr mayor yes uh the matter has been reported to the epa and they have referred it specifically to their um bushfire team who who have investigated the matter i can 't tell you off the top of my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they likely to report on that publicly i mean because obviously a lot of people in battle would would be concerned i mean it would have similar ramifications to the the wagga air force base and the the use of the chemicals there for instance for you mr mayor if i may take that one on notice and report back to councillors as to what the status of the investigation is thank you mr holton councillor thank you mr mayor mr holden if i may given the amount of safety precautions that were taken on every site in relation to the asbestos situations on fire um damaged areas that lang o 'rourke were clearing and given that the back of the cannery office building at the end of pioneer street opposite the school in the hospital has got a derelict building site at the back of it that is definitely asbestos located have we heightened the the risks that are there to the community in relation to the asbestos from that building mr hull where are you mr mayor uh councillor i 'm afraid that 's a very technical question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and i i think you 're referring to the uh is this the pack house or the pack house office the office building the office building opposite the school next to the hospital and next to the library yes um yeah i look i 'm that hasn 't been the subject of um uh that wasn 't the subject of any of the discussions that we had had with um lang o 'rourke or the epa so uh i i respectfully

    "text": "foreign foreign again and i 'll explain how we 'll do that when we get closer to that time uh as i said uh stan walker here what he was going to speak to was how he fits in the role of the work on and how the local global emergency management committee works i 'll just ask everyone to hear me all right yeah okay so that 's good um the local emergency management committee fits within the framework of the broader emergency management new south wales arrangements legislatively bound and directed by the state of england rescue management act or the cernak which governs and sets out certain responsibilities it does a lot of things it sets our responsibilities uh it allocates certain powers for people to do certain things and but most importantly uh what it governs is um things called combat agencies and combat agencies are various agencies or government entities that are legislatively bound to deal with certain types of emergencies and in a rural fire situation obviously it 's a rural fire service in health pandemics that 's just been experienced in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can change uh obviously for an urban fighter new south wales and and so on and so on uh for a state for something like equine influenza it 's dpi so the sternback sets those things out anything that isn 't legislatively set out in that act is actually the responsibility of police as are other things such as search and rescue uh in setting out those responsibilities certain powers are established and our broad sweeping powers allocating combat agencies and in a significant coordinated response such as we saw in the fires here about 15 months ago the combat agency which was the world fire service is supported by the emergency management committee the emergency management committee is comprised of the lurkon which is a student police officer an email as i said which is a civilian employee of the local council uh other emergency service organisations that assist so you know your urban fires your rainbows vra marine which the list goes on and on the luc is also supported by functional areas which are critical to the management of any emergency they include health looking after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at risk they importantly function as a functional area of welfare which is generally under the auspice of family and community students and their responsibilities look after people who are evacuated and people 's welfare more generally psychological counselling and so on and again this goes on deeply by an lls to look after livestock when you 're in crisis council and i appreciate it look after companion animals and pets and the arrangements are broad and vast and they 're too too expensive to set out here in any detail we 're suffice to say that the backing of the combat agency in this case was the rfs guess it 's comprehensive it is expansive uh it involves a lot of staff from a lot of different agencies and the lead climb and on the leecon for the water area has the responsibility of coordinating all of those agencies to support the combat agency the leopon themselves has no actual power to direct or come in they operate purely through influence which is to say to get all those different people from different agencies with different personalities pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only operate it can only occur is that lemc operates in a cohesive fashion and collaborative fashion which i 'm sure of all where those things can only be achieved if the people in those committees and in that community a worry of respect and trust and um as we know those things can 't be built or manufactured overnight and which is why having local people in no one know the area on those helium suits is vital and you 're very well served in this district in this council area by having lot of people with that bill so those are the broad strokes of how emergency management operates and operate that way in regard to any emergency that requires a significant coordinated response and indeed the response to code of 19 in the last 12 months has been managed in much the same way although methodologies have had to be adapted because of the nature of that issue um the opportunity to go through some of those any questions you might have about those arrangements later um let 's say they can be quite detailed and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for you so there 's an opportunity now to go to uh superintendent john gregory and peter jones from the rfs we 've got some information to present to us i believe they have a powerpoint loaded up so is it okay to hang over youtube 's fellows now john thank you bob yeah black summer what can i say um this is not going to be post-mortem or anything about what happened there but just a few fast facts of what occurred and um i know tomorrow was one of many communities that were significantly impacted by black summer and the dance road and the green valley fire during the 1920 fire season it created some significant challenges to all of us that were involved in emergency management even significant challenges to people on the ground it exceeded in most cases our our imagination on what the type of fire we faced a few quick quick um statistics there was 340 000 square kilometers in our coast it was about almost a thousand kilometers around the fire um and people give us some more facts and figures on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about two and a half thousand kilometers of containment lines and fire trails which are quite significant so um it 's the biggest fire that we 've seen i 've been in the rfs for 35 years never seen anything like it so what 's happened um there was a state inquiry that was initiated by the new south wales government and it was conducted independently by an independent um former deputy commissioner of the new south wales police there was also a federal royal commission that was conducted by the federal government and out of both of those inquiries there 's been a number of recommendations there was the recommendations out of the state inquiry the new south wales government has um given an undertaking that they 'll implement all the recommendations of those and during the with the federal royal commission the um the federal government has also made an undertaking that they 'll introduce the recommendations of those so what are we doing so i 'm going to give you a bit of a strategic overview of what we 're doing um on a district level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to peter jones the district coordinator for riverina highlands and he 'll talk about how we can better prepare our properties one of the big messages that came out of it and one of the things that we 've been very much pushing for uh for quite some time is everyone needs a plan it doesn 't matter whether you 're the rfs the bfmc the bushfire management committee a resident in a town or actually a resident in the rural um and that was highlighted significantly during the 1930 bushfire season so what are we what are we actually doing so some of the things that we we 're doing at the moment with um improving the snowy valleys bushfire management committee with consultation so that committee is made up of not only the rfs it 's made up of snowy valleys council the forestry corporation um the national parks and wildlife service and a number of other stakeholders like hume forest and snowy hydro and so forth so we meet quarterly and we 're in the process of developing a new um risk plan which i 'll talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy with our group offices and captains so we have um significant um meetings with the captains and the group officers to convey all of the information that 's come out of the various inquiries and they 're helping us to implement that on the ground we 've been involved in two across border actually three so two cross-border committees one with victoria and the main reason behind that is to try and get that that messaging out there to get some commonality and try and reduce that confusion that um that did occur during the 1925 's so we 're working with um the upper murray and also a state across border committee as well with that and we 're working also with the ict government on a similar arrangement we 're doing a lot of hazard reduction planning um so at the moment um we 've got a hazard reduction plan that we we implement and um that 's being rolled out right as we speak so we 've got a number of hazard reduction burns planned which will cover off a little bit it has reduction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also involves community protection plans community engagement just like what we 're doing here tonight also um the hazard mitigation processes we have a fire trial maintenance program we call it fact so there 's about six million dollars that 's been allocated across new south wales um for fire trial upgrades and um we 're working at the moment with land holders so we actually need a land holder agreement with each of the land holders that these fire trials go through before we can actually touch the ground and upgrade those fire trials so we 're working on getting those commissions in place at the moment and the agreements and we 're going to get a nice slice of that six million dollars so we 're hoping that we 'll get around about two million dollars for the snowy valleys area for that so that 's a good news story for us so what have we been doing um all our tankers have been maintained so that all of them have been through and maintained being upgraded um and any problems that have been identified with those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half million dollars that came out of the the inquiry and the extra funding to upgrade tankers in the snowy valleys area again so that sounds a lot of money but um when a tent is worth four hundred thousand dollars each it doesn 't go very fast so but we are getting something that 's the best um upgrade of tankers that i 've seen in a long time we 've been um lucky enough as well to be given a full-time mitigation crew for [Music] so that there was a hundred extra positions identified across the state in the rfs um national parks and forestry were also given some funding for theirs but we across the state and we 've been able to secure four extra positions here and those guys you may have seen them they 're out and about they 've been working up in this area quite a bit recently they go out and prepare our hr burns they clear fire trails um they engage with land holders they do uh a thing called ada which peter will talk a little bit more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their property protection that 's many other things we 've got um 22 000 at 22 tonnes i should say a fire retardant located here in the snowy valleys that 's the most we 've ever had before so that 's a case here and many of you have probably heard that there 's a um some upgrading happening at the turmeric airport rfs bus it 's a very strategic facility for fighting fires and we 've been able to enhance that further enhancements we 're doing at the moment um we 're relocating one of our brigade stations to the airport and some other ceiling and works out there to make it a little bit more pleasant to work from that area and i 'd just like to acknowledge that the work that was done out there at the air base during the fires it was incredible so some many records of the amount of aircraft rotations and the amount of water that was sent out of there were broken during this fire and we were lucky enough to have those aviation assets here we 've been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadside slashing and we 've been trying to carry that out across the whole the lga and this year with the la nina weather that 's been a real challenge because we 've slashed and then we 've had to go back and slash again because the amount of fuel that 's there yeah so it 's uh it 's been a real challenge um there 's probably ongoing media and social media campaigns and you 've probably seen a fair bit of that um we have a rigorous facebook page the rfs has a facebook page as well we have a weekly radio um segment that sounds in the mountains which we talk about what 's happening with fire preparedness and preparations many other aspects of the rural fire service a real good news story for us we 've actually trained 150 new members across the fire district which is right across the snowy valley 's council area so that goes from ken coburn right out to um to tomorrow so down in in the tamarama area there 's probably 60 or 70 new firefighters and that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job attached to that because each of those people are people who have to be prepared with ppe they have to be trained that their memberships have to be processed and then transitioned into the brigade so that was a real win for us so i 'll just put a picture up there on the powerpoint it 's probably hard to see from the back but that 's the wearable tricks comments tower so it 's one of the main strategic communications towers in in snowy valleys um and you can see that we 've done quite a lot of preparation work with the mitigation crew and pushed out the um what we call the ops the asset protections are around that so that 's that 's one of the real successes that we 've been able to achieve in in just the recent times and this is a similar one from mount like so we 've done significant works out of now as well so the two critical towers um we 're also doing work we 're negotiating with the land holders for the comms towers the telstra towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clear that vegetation we have to get agreement from the land holders up there and that 's in the final stages at the moment of that happening so you 'll see some fairly significant works being done up there thank you so what what else have we been doing in terms of the independent bushfire enquiry the fire 's nearly app i acknowledge it didn 't work as well as it could have been um during the last five season um for a number of reasons one of the things that was identified it was confusing so we 've adopted the standard icons on there now so the standard um little icons that mean the main various things that are exactly the same right across the whole of the nation now across australia so that 's one of the things we 've done um our cross border um warning messaging is now in a standard format so again so what we talk about in victoria is the same messaging that we 'll be given in new south wales we 're also providing support to the local council including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our roadside vegetation management strategies and just engaging a lot more with the local emergency management committee we 're doing um bushfire planning protection for roadside infrastructure again we 've also got to get that landholder permission before we can actually do too much coc availability has been um one of the things that was identified in the independent inquiry evacuation arrangements involved with people 's support and i mentioned a little bit about the ada program and people talk more about that but if there 's anyone in your community you 've identified that needs a bit of help tell us tonight tracy down the back in the yellow she 's got some information on that we can certainly help foreground communications we 've just completely changed all our radio terminals in all our trucks we 've got some terminals in there as well so that we get we 're entering the 21st century if you like so there 's um push buttons to say when the trucks are responding the next stage in the near future will be some tablets in the truck so we 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre we can send out the maps to the trucks and they 've got it on this screen in front of them and then of course preparation and programs like building resilience in the community and in our tourism industry so what i 'll do now i 'll hand over to peter and he 'll talk a little bit more about the nuts and bolts of how you get prepared for a bushfire thanks sean um so my role here is to talk about bushfire scents in terms of if we 're in fire season we are still in fire seasons at the end of the month and you can pretty much see with this weather a lot of people are thinking about how what am i going to do about preparing my property for for fires perfect opportunity now and over the winter months to get ready for the next fire season in october so when that starts you need to get on top of that now so i 'll just sort of start with a few concepts uh my powerpoint presentation is a little bit fast so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can actually survive with fire if you 've got your property there 's a good chance you will survive it 's also a shared responsibility so as a firefighter we actually will go to a house and if the house is not prepared there are times when our firefighter will say we can 't defend this property we 'll move to the next one particularly in these large scale incidents so the landowner must do their part by preparing their problem this is just an example of a well-prepared property obviously you can see uh they 've got a nice asset protection zone around the home being a grassland issue but uh certainly it 's quite a nice picture to see that fires can houses can survive cloud fires so in terms of your decision in terms of making a bushfire survival plan there 's a couple of things you need to do and tracy 's got copies of the bushfire survival plan down the back there but you need to have a bit of a conversation with yourself and your family so your first decision you need to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are you going to leave and relocate to a safer location and that 's just the decision you have to decide on can i stay and defend my home or where am i going to leave so in order to get to the right answer you need to have to have some reasons to come to that decision so think about your family your children your partner and your pets can they withstand a bushfire are they physically fit and capable and able to defend your home if the answer is no decision is quite simple relocate to a safer location and do it well before the fire front arrives it 's got a couple of other photo slides here most of these were taken during daylight hours so you can see how bad the actual images so if you can actually see the flames members or spot fires starting around you then you have no choice the the decision is actually being made for you you need to defend your family your property and seek refuge in the safety of your home as the firefront is passing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just about the three stages of bushfire impact i understand you won 't be able to see but generally homes are affected by bushfire by ember attack radiant heat or more or direct flame impact some facts the riverina highlands rural fire service so this is just our snowy valley 's local government area we have 28 brigades from go cut in the north to ken cavern in the south we have 75 tankers within our area covering the whole ldlj obviously we can draw upon uh other resources from outer areas but if you think about uh time for them to get to the location that 's a it 's a can be a bit of a delay so think about it how many how many houses do we actually have in that snowy valley shower and if you think about it don 't expect to get a big red truck at your house because it 's uh we just don 't have enough trucks to go around to every single person 's home we do what we can but you 're asking a lot of all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home there are times when we just physically can 't get to those homes you 're on fire where is it safe the safest place to be in the event of a fire is nowhere near it don 't leave it too late it will be scary it will be dark when the fire arrives it will be noisy it will be hot if you 've made the decision to stay then don 't lose your nerve and leave when the fire is upon you take refuge we 've actually had a number of people that have tried to leave when the fire fronts hit and that 's the worst time to to leave you actually need to say i 'm going to have to stay here and defend my property will take refuge in my home until the main firefighters pass if you actually have a look this photo this was taking taken at midday and you can see there that it 's uh it 's quite horrific uh i don 't bring back too many memories but certainly you can understand that trying to leave in a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your second decision you need to make in developing your wish by survival land is your home defendable so this is what i mean it 's about a shared responsibility those at home have a clear area removed i 'll find fuels around it was it what is it made of and how close is it to the bush if you 've got a very good asset protection zone you can generally uh most houses will survive a wish fire there 's just a bit of a slide shot of things you can do obviously you can 't see that there are copies in the in the survival plans just an example obviously of people doing some work around their home and in terms of the aid program john spoke about so the aid program is to assist in firm with the sale on the early residents as a well-free service which is done by our mitigation crew they 'll go around to people 's property once they 're registered assess it and if it doesn 't need to be cleaned up they can do that one-off cleanup form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that point on so you can see this photo here is uh there 's a house in telbigo that was actually after the last fire season and and it survived obviously with all that grass in here but in the garden but certainly need to be something to be done about it so that 's just a bit more information uh tracy has a flyer out there back there if you 're aware if someone needs help there 's the contact entitlement with regards to the ada program this is the bushfire survival plan just a bit of a look see what it is so things that you can do now prepare your home by removing fuels for these you catch your light from an amber attacker that 's the most reason you 'll actually your house will catch fire as a result of an ember attack start work on that now through the winter months as we get into october and into summer you need to have this already done have a survival plan have a survival pack for you and your family and if you 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stay you need to make those decisions based on the weather forecast for the day if there 's a fine invite pay attention to your local radio and tv stations monitor our website and social media pages on those hot dry windy days and you would have heard those days when we when we went into a taylor fire event or the severe catastrophic fire weather days the other days you need to put your ears in the air and start thinking about some of those things that you need to do am i going to leave if i am going to leave i 'm going to leave for the main heat of the day that might be the option so uh the rfs also has a version of this on the rfs website that 's the web address you can actually do your plan and have your conversation with your family online and out of it you can get a result as to what you decide you 're going to do and print it up and make sure that the family 's aware of what you 're intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in terms of a bushfire just put it up on the fridge once you 've printed it out and certainly we 'll give you that information um as a redirect you 've had that conversation in a calm quiet environment as opposed to when things are going wrong and there 's a fire nearby you you really need to have that in a calm manner just an example of a survival pack and this relates to all types of immersions not just bushfire flooding as we 're heading up in the north at the moment make sure you 've got a survival pack and probably the key piece of information in there is actually having a portable radio i want to say affordable radio is to listen to radio traffic through abc stands at the mountains radio upper hurry any of those radio stations you 'll get that information that 's the best way we can get information out quickly we can do lots of other things sometimes systems fail and the quickest and easiest way is to listen to the radio if you have to get into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where you 'll get some of that information and fires are going example of this uh just to remember if a fire can can threaten quite suddenly the first things to fail are generally the phones and the power so if you haven 't got phone or power um there 's all your communication started to disappear so your only option is to really seek that information by by internet if you still got it if you 've got satellite internet you might be okay until the power battery or your batteries run out but certainly make sure you 've got those those other systems and another source of getting that information from somewhere else not just relying on those one or two things it 's just one of the flyers we have out the back there 's just a bit of an information about the emergency warning processes and a few other things but i 've got something next slide so um so just when you see this on our 5v app or when we 're giving messaging about that so you can see the three new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uh the emergency warning that 's standardized across australia now for any type of emergency uh the fire obviously has a fire in the icon but a flood will have a different uh different symbol but it 's basically the same colour so advice a fire is burning and not currently posing any threat to any property a watch can act a fire is burning and the situation is changing enact your survival plan and gain situational awareness in other words that 's the time if you if you see a fire that 's going to watch an act and it 's near your property you need to think about what am i going to do i need to enact my bushfire survival plan and then the highest one we have which is the emergency warning a fire is burning out of control in actual survival when lives in property are under threat don 't expect that you 'll get all of these warnings in order sometimes the fires move fast and you may not get in the first advice you might get might be an emergency warning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasn 't moved too fast for us to process that information and get that award that you 're wanting out this is uh a revised version of the 5v it got updated about two months ago there 's a new version of the 5v with the new icons there are more improvements going to it you can actually set your watch zones and your phone will actually give you notifications of when there 's a fire popped up in your area i 'm assuming a few of you have already got this already but just an example where it is if it works on any smart device um just make sure that you download it set your watch change and turn your notifications on uh just uh this is the federal um processes the example goes to us alerting people via buying their mobile phones and their home phones it 's just something to start at the rural fires service head office is just basically the website where it comes from so you can actually get that warning as a recorded message through your through your home phone uh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that can also be so in terms of the fire danger ratings these are things you need to watch out on a daily basis particularly during the fire season obviously so so our fire weather area is actually the southern slopes fire weather area and uh on a severe extreme or catastrophic fire day that will automatically be a total finance so weather forecast and curing and stuff when it goes to the to the vegetation time as to what type of weather we can expect for the next day so that comes out about four o 'clock every afternoon for the for the next day uh commissioner makes a decision based on the weather forecast for the era and then you implement either a total fighting for the next day or for a weekend or the next week if needed so we get normally get those the day before that 's the clock and you might hear this in victoria we call it catastrophic which is the highest part of the scale the victorians call it catastrophic code red so just in regards to catastrophic i 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did experience catastrophic fire weather in the 2019-2025 but potentially lives and homes will be lost so if a fire starts anywhere near you during these locate those conditions you 'll need to immediately relocate to a safer location now the easiest way to do that is if we get forecaster catastrophic fire with the day and your decision is going that you 're going to leave the best thing you can do is say i 'm going to leave our area maybe go to water for the day until the heat of the day that 's what i 'm saying it 's a catastrophic fire weather day and you were going to leave so pack it up and move for the day come back when that when the heat of the day has changed and things have gotten better so firefighters will only be able to assist with property protection and generally on those conditions will not be able to extinguish the fire until those weather conditions which generally happens later in the evening we also have the standard emergency warning signal which is used by tv and radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be authorised to be used so the instant control of the fire can say we need to use that um we need to use the sue 's message but you 've probably all heard it before but uh i know today certainly plays the bushfire siren when there 's a uh when there 's a message about a follow-up around so what can you do now prepare and maintain your home develop a survival plan consider helping the brigade where you 're joining or providing some support just remember it 's your property it 's your fuel that 's on the ground and it 's your responsibility to do something about it this is just uh our facebook page i regularly update this and uh certainly not just me but anytime there 's a fire my first point of call is generally to the radios uh abc on significance so be either right for the abc or uh senior member of murray and then put a page straight up on the facebook page that 's just where you get a bit more other information obviously the rfs website 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems so what 's on the website is generally up to date with the most up-to-date information if you need more information tracy you 've got plenty of information down about the survival plans a couple of flies and brochures and a little ready reckoner survival and checklist it 'll give you some help thank you uh thanks peter and the opportunity to ask questions of peter and john again shortly now we do have chris and marisa how are we going to do this christian how 's this going to work seamlessly okay we 're not thinking well she was like a teeny week so we 'll just hang for a second [Music] uh so stop so my scrub um um [Music] um you have uh um coverage um sorry okay good job so subject um um [Music] it 's foreign uh jesus is is is um yes [Music] it just gives you now is um um sorry come back sorry it 's screw that right thank you guys foreign um is [Music] all right [Music] question oh is is uh it 's experienced behind me it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is yes um is again that 's separate to the video the biggest [Music] sorry is all is is foreign foreign is [Music] um is uh yes [Music] um um what 's up the greatest [Music] is is [Music] until it um [Music] yes um along the bottom but you have to have tv you have that power to see that the am675 lauren is it is is the aim it still works it 's not very good quality up here in the mountain but you can use it and most cars could still pick up am radio so i know that was probably a bit of an oversight by many people at the time and we probably didn 't push that as hard as we could um to get that message out and one of the things that we 're here tonight laurence here from abc river rain and she 's happy to discuss that as well with anyone that wants to talk about that [Music] mainly there were five emergency lines of that that 's that 's the crux of your question yeah obviously i 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have um glenn here so what do i take on a notice plane is it it 's a secondary center and the secondary centers set up to be able to handle it but there has been changes since yep there 's been changes since kim uh i think we 'll just allow matthew to get that information and get it back uh a reasonable time what was your next question um management officer and are those personally delegated and have they yes so the question was for those online uh did we have an alternative leno you 're appropriately trained and ready to step into that role uh the answer to mr hyde was in the affirmative uh they 're going into details about that which i don 't think we will but um certainly will serve with the personnel that were there at the time but how did you find that useful second part of that question was did he break down on the lack of um a great question um uhfcb so what we have we have three networks that we use so we have a pmr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young what we call the vibram network which is a tactical network and then we have a tertiary network which we use the uhf so in up in the tumblr area we use 12 12 and 12 they 're all channel 12s on the fly ground the division commanders on the fire ground can also make a decision that they might need to relocate to another channel on the uhf or indeed the young firebrand or if they get too congested but it uhf is is a um an integral part of our operation all our heading plan operators um use uhf as that platform the 12 is a simplex not not a repeated channel that you 've been talking about you 're talking about the channel three repeaters um we 're aware that that 's gone down and we 've been having some discussion with council about the possibility of renewing that getting it back up and running and whether some of the brigades want to take that on in custodianship um we don 't get directly funded but if the brigades want to look at that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't be used as a tactical or a strategic network during firefighting because it 's simply one on ike 's it 'll be going down into victoria as you know the channel 3 goes everywhere and we would still use uhf just as a simplex we 're working on a formalized um farm firefighting strategy to bring the farmers into the fold um but luckily in our area up here most of the farmers are involved in the uh rfs anyway so it 's not a big big deal i hope that helps you instagram um i 'm a little bit disappointed in this evening there 's not a great deal i have learned apart from most of the questions they have been fantastic now you mentioned the word local in your community your the question was and it 's a great one uh it 's about i think it 's really asking people for a comment but um about how we 're involving locals how can we involve and small okay all right thank you yeah lorraine are you talking about the local emergency management committee or the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's based on local government districts i 've there 's a couple of gentlemen in this room in terms of we have a senior management team in the rfs so we have four representatives who are group officers from tamarama and we have four representatives that are group officers we 've got peter lonigan down the back here tonight he 's one of the group officers that represents the tamarama area and we also have the brigade captain we meet regularly two to three times a year with all the captains um formally and then informally on much much more frequent basis to that alan french is in the room again tonight and alex uh the captain of tomorrow we have about 15 brigades in the tumbarama area um there is from down an awning right there uh to we 're going um they 're all engaged and included in in the decision making and whatever occurs with our systems in terms of if you want the local brigade to come and see if you can access bring their truck drive down your driveway see if you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it during the flight season um we encourage that we encourage the brigades to take their vehicles out to their local areas go in the gateways see if they can maneuver around find out where the static water supplies are talk to the land holders about setting up systems so that we can get water quickly so if you 've got tanks we can even provide the fittings to put on the tanks so that they 're compatible with our trucks that um talk to your local brigades yet now we are running out of time so there is time for a couple more questions but i 'm sure that most of us are including people in the front row you have to hang around afterwards but i 'm going to go to the lady closest to me first yes think of me um local radio stations okay and we 're checking something wrong with it can we get your address afterwards [Music] um now i think i was speaking to uh nick myers who you know in may of last year he 's the manager of the plantation authorisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five members of his team that has awarded all the uh plantation forest communications in in the state and and basically his plan is to try and um order beach forest plantation once every three years however he 's failing that he says it 's more likely five years plus before we can order them so uh are you the real part of this going to assist in the five trial maintenance of the fire trusting in [Music] [Music] foreign fire file didn 't exist is suddenly being upgraded or illustrated to try and allow access that 's my first question my second question is or it 's more a statement and asking for assistance from the rural fire service the new south wales farmers are trying to pressure the state government to have a 50 metre buffer zone around plantations uh to join natives or like engraving grazing or just or just uh uh we as new south wales farmers would like the rural fire service to press the state government to change their legislation because it 's in legislation now that forest grantation violence can be planted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight control weed control at all so um basically i would think it would be wonderful for forestry if the rural prices would support the new south wales farmers to get the legislation changed so that 50 million in the minimum barrier thanks roger i will allow my friends to answer those questions but the two questions were firstly in relation to fire trial maintenance limb forests and also natural natural forests governing forest plantations and i think if you guys have heard that question so well then the responder of the second part was about cleaning up within 50 metres of boundaries and whether that should be an exclusive or i understood so i 'll just talk specifically about the fire trial and fire access which is the fact what we call the fat plan about two years ago the service actually got some legislation changed and as a result the fire trailer fire access plan was developed by the bushfire each pushed by an android committee across the state so snowy valley council has the bushfire management committee which all agencies sit on we 've been going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and basically the committee actually decides which trails they want those sooner are fire trucks there 's a strategic fire trail or a tactical fire truck it was tenure blind so they were drawn across a number of a number of areas so every trail that you see in a forest is not necessarily by definition of fire trail it may be an access road to the plantation but not necessarily a designated fire truck so what john was talking about with the fire trial funding that specifically targets those trails that we 've identified to be a strategic fire trial or a tactical trial with more waiting on the the actual strategic trust we had had some funding in the past and we 've got some more funding bids here at this stage that will the money becoming available to actually upgrade those jobs so we 're actually starting from a very low point um and then starting to get these trails up to a standard which is a standard four metre wide widths and and clearing so so our changes can get up again so that relates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plantation roads as i said some of those are physically physically uh not a fire trial under under the act if that makes sense and there 's under the plantations and forestry accidents there 's probably a few more foresters in the room that might be able to might be but basically when a plantation gets harvested and that when they replant again they 're required to to provide a fire road depending on the size of the replanting but basically any fire road in existing plantation was established prior to i think the plantation act of 2001 i think or off the top of my head but basically that road um if it didn 't exist prior they could they actually have to put a sign up to say no fire right they may get a road in there or an accident it may not necessarily be a fire truck by the definition so yes we we do work with the um the forest corporation um here forest snowy mountains known as forest in regards to helping them with their fire trials where they can obviously they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the any of them that have been identified as strategic or tactical uh they have access to the funding we can get to get that control upgrade to meet their standards because so from my perspective john is actually our executive officer he 's our representative on the bushfire management committee on the technical support committee uh but i 'll let john answer that that 's called from his point so absolutely so um a lot of those old forests that have been established were done pre the current legislation and they were planted up against the under fences um there has been a recommendation out of the state inquiry to make sure that there is a buffer zone there we 're working with the softwood industry at the moment to make sure that there is a reasonable buffer zone there on our bushfire management committee we have two new south wales farmer 's representatives and one happens to be in the room tonight he 's got his hand raised there james thank you and james is advocating on on your behalf to make sure that that happens and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing their replanning and they 're certainly not planning up to the boundary fence now there 's a buffer zone and in many places they 're putting a trail and an asset protection zone and then we 've been out and inspected a number of the sites that they 've already started to do that but in terms of the 50 metre it hasn 't been legislated yet but there is certainly um an increased buffer zone over what we 've had previously so you 've is okay thank you um that will conclude the question we 'll hang around for a year for anyone who wants to but um before i just did finish up it 's pretty obvious and look to be nowhere in the room whether it 's us up here or the people in the front row or the people official rolls around the room the darning knowledge it was a horrendous time i think uh with what 's coming in the meantime with the cover 19 and most recently floods whilst those things are bad a secondary bad effect on that is to be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state regrettably to the back of the public consciousness it 's not the back of your consciousness right up front and we acknowledge that and there 's still a lot of work to be done and we need to continue to work to be prepared and whilst this meeting was never going to be all things to all people um i appreciate everyone coming on and participating and i will hang around afterwards so if anyone wants to get me by the heat please do so because that 's fine i don 't mind doing that at all i 'll handle the council julia here just to close tonight thank you very much thank you bob and we 've um we 're very very grateful that you 've come and helped today it 's been very much appreciated and i just um following on from what bob was saying is thank you to you all being here today um it 's still very close to all of us and um here we are today in this fall we 've got rick jones up the back it doesn 't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's like a side and um here we are a year later a year and a bit later and um we 've been very fortunate with this last season there hasn 't been a fire risk but we will never take it for granted again so um thank you to john and peter with your fire preparedness um notices we um we 'll take that on board thank you to tracy down that back he 's got a lot of pamphlets for us and i think jennifer you 've got some up there as well and that 's i encourage people to take on those we need a plan we 've got it we 'll get a plan uh to chris thank you for being there online and we could hear you well um for all for many of us who are all in black spots um we 're still there 's a bit of frustration there and next time you 're in town if you want to come and talk to group us we 'd really like to have a further conversation about how we can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people who 've made this work it 's pretty incredible that we can do this um remotely the way it happens but um and i certainly want to thank rob who who really um kicked some of us in the butt to make this happen tonight robin and for working with me over the last few weeks to make it happen so thank you very much"

under temporary provisions expiring on the 31st of december 2021 at the local government general regulation 2005 which gives council discretion to allow councillors to attend remotely under exceptional circumstances and we 're all attending remotely at the moment thank you very much councillors um we have apologies and leave of absence from councillor benjamin and castle alata do i have a mover for those councillor wright and councillor island all in favor it 's unanimous thank you because there 's any declarations of pecuniary interest no there 's no late reports moving on to governance and financial reports we have a notice of motion here 5.1 it 's moved by uh councillor ham and it 's seconded by councillor smith yep council again uh thank you mr man um this this motion is really about snowy valley 's council and making our position clear because uh with the management of covert throughout new south wales it looks like it 's going to be open on the 1st of december which is just brilliant news bringing news today that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 percent double dose vaccination so this um motion is just to um say that we 're living with the virus now that 's our only long-term solution to move forward and this motion is to say that as a council as a counselor you know um following the health recommendations but to also be wary and grateful to the many people who are working in health in our area and in our whole murray bridge health district and being very mindful that there are only so many icu beds and that we can do as much as we possibly can to prevent people filling up the icu so if any of us get sick there 's space for us and um lastly to all the businesses who have been impacted by covert we see you it 's been very tough and i want to show a committed a commitment from the council that we will be supporting small businesses to return um to economic growth as soon as possible because there 's any speakers against obviously you can 't speak against something like this but this should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get involved in the covered issues repeatedly over the last 18 months and have been proved stonewalled by council all the time and the other thing is that this motion is not an urgent notion it shouldn 't be on this agenda this is an extraordinary meeting and this is not an extraordinary motion but the overriding thing is why bring it up at this moment when one of our fellow colleagues fellow councillors is has been suspended from his job very seriously and is in the middle of a court case and i think it 's i can 't support it because of i don 't agree with what our how the council 's position is and but i feel that i 've got loyalty to a federal council who 's in real trouble at the moment in my opinion yes thank you mr mayor look i 'd like to congratulate you uh on your advocacy for getting a pop-up clinic happening here a very proactive role we know that the commonwealth government is actually responsible for the rollout of vaccines but through our advocacy we 've been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that i and i believe yesterday that happened we had 90 people vaccinated which i think is a fantastic thing it shows how how good pop-up clinics can be because not everyone has their own doctor or wants to go to a doctor to be vaccinated so i think it 's a really great outcome and i believe that you too mayor actually played a part in facilitating someone who didn 't have their driver 's license to come to germa to get their vaccine so thank you on behalf of everyone else thank you council cross castle yes mr mayor i think that this motion really is not about um personal issues of any sort but just to show leadership to the community that we as a council totally support the government 's encouragement to get doubly vaccinated in order to protect all of their community and here in the snowy valleys we have been most fortunate that we haven 't had any real cases of covert 19 here but because of the opening up situation there is of course a likelihood that that will happen and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get as much protection for the against the virus in the community and we just want to make sure that our community does know that their council is totally supportive of that thank you any other speakers counselors i 'll put the motion uh of course raising hands all in favor so we 've got five six and against okay we 've got one one against and one abstention thank you councillors so that 's carried thank you moving on uh governance and financial reports 5.2 mover councillor wrestleman councillor ham councillor wrestleman unmute councillor islam thank you mr mayor nothing to add to this thank you any other speakers kessler ham um mr now i think that um i 'd actually like to go into committee about this thank you all in favor excuse me mr mayor we 're not doing the financial statement we 're doing the um sign off of the this is this is the delegation of the statement by council on its opinion of the accounts for the financial year so 5.2 delegate the mayor so but this is the time we discuss the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we have to go into commercial discussion yes yeah hang on i just need the hands okay yep that 's unanimous thank you ryder we 're now in we 're now on committee castle ham oh okay um you moved it um i moved it well first of all i want to say thank you very much to the chief financial officer and team for getting these papers together and thank you very much i 've spent quite a bit of time asking questions and trying to get my head around this um it 's been quite entertaining um just my um first question is um how are we looking in terms of viability is is how are these financial ones we 're going out for an srv how are we looking in terms of viability enable and you know from these financial statements we should be able to see a strong argument why we should be going up for necessarily so that 's directed at the cfl or the ceo i 'll put it to the ceo first thanks mr mayor uh councillor ham uh yes in regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants indicates our inability to sell fund capital renewals and councils reliance on external funding for these that 's not an unusual situation for local governments to be in and hence a variety of reasons we 're going off on a financial sustainability journey and engaging with the community about what direction we would like or the community would like us to considering going forwards i 'll hand over to the cfo to provide a little bit more detail response to that cfr thank you mr mayor um through you mr mayor the um overall snowy valleys council result for last financial year is a deficit when you remove the capital revenue and that is obviously not sustainable in the long term however it as the ceo already outlined this is not unusual for councils for a situation to be in and we are addressing the sustainability matters through the sustainability plan that council has adopted also through engagement with the community last year was a very special year um not only did we have kowitt um nearly all throughout it we delivered a large amount of projects that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bushfires our staff had to pivot to new ways of delivering the work and that shows in our financial statements not necessarily the pivoting but the extra work that we had to do we were um lucky enough to receive a lot of funding from the state and the commonwealth 's during the year our budget basically was in constant flux from from july to june um due to all the funding that was available for economic reasons that was available for disaster management and we had floods we had storms and we had a pandemic um it shows that our revenue that we received is a lot higher than what we originally budgeted it is it is even higher than our qbis um our quarterly budget review is forecast on the other side of the of the ledger our expenses are obviously also very much higher um the result is slightly better than we originally forecast which is great but as i said in the long run making an operational loss is not sustainable we have plenty of cash in the bank at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is largely restricted to our waters or on waste funds and it is also money that we received from other um other organizations like the commonwealth or the state to deliver certain projects however 38 million dollars in the bank is a good result and we are expecting another five million dollars at the very least that was actually you at the end of the year we will be quite capable to keep going like this during this financial year but we are addressing it through the sustainability plan i note in there that there was some quite a lot of capital grants and we were able to capitalize some of those grants but not to the same extent as last year is is this an ongoing issue that will have concerns about not getting these capital grants but not being able to capitalise um salaries against them thank you mr mayor you um it it is to a degree an ongoing issue because we had so many projects it is unbelievable how much our staff actually delivered uh every every one of our employees has a story to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects we delivered therefore we had to take some of our staff away from the capital projects and move them to some of the operational projects that we needed to deliver and just could not um capitalize their wages so yes if we keep going the way we are with a lot of projects that um are in addition to what we actually forecast and to our works forecast we will have the same issue again or we can pivot the um operational part of things to an external contractor and utilize our staff in in the capital projects it is possibly an operational matter of how we address this but the more projects we deliver the less capacity we have to deliver it within our own workforce mr may i also add that some of our grants have conditions that we aren 't allowed to use day labor staff for those so we do utilize contractors uh when the grant provisions uh indicate that and hence uh not using our staff hence not being able to capitalize them is that a is that a new [Music] or no no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding mr mayor so um some of the other grant opportunities allow us to use day labour staff but uh certainly the um day labour staff used for disaster cleanup is not not a claimable expense and therefore the ratepayer would be paying for all of that hence the reason why we use quite a lot of contractors and you 'll see the the jump in materials and services there indicating that we 've used contractors quite significantly for the disaster cleaner uh castle ham you had another question i 'll oh i 'll reserve my questions too later okay councillors uh castle cross yes look i wanted to make a comment that we had as an extraordinary eric meeting where the financial statement was discussed and there were no red flags raised at that meeting so it 's very reassuring to know that we 've got that oversight that independent oversight but they did raise a couple of issues which we 've touched on and one was about the rural fire service assets being transferred to councils and they agreed with our council as other councils are also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books until legislation has been changed which i think is my understanding they also raised concerns what we 've just talked about with the unrestricted cash that it was negative and that we 're still waiting for disaster funding to from the state government to fund to cover that i believe is about five and a half million dollars and i wondered uh if that was the case and where we 're up to with that please thank you councillor cross um that is correct the um disaster recovery um works that we undertook we expended the cash during the year but the assessments by the state weren 't done at 30th of june so we had what we call a receivable as in we are owed the money but we haven 't received it yet at the end of the year and that is what happened in our unrestricted cash so the unrestricted cash is secured against a receivable and today unfortunately i have to report that we still have not received that cash mr mam may i also add that um yourself and myself have visited various ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given us a great support um uh justin clancy and joe mcgurk about that and we 've also raised that with the staff in those various departments to try and expedite those payments and we were successful with one payment uh being expedited and we 're in the process of expediting that other payment thank you smith yes given the long-term uh fact that we are in deficit and likely to continue to deficit for some time are we actually eating into our reserves as a result of that safer thank you and through you mr mayor we to a degree will be eating into our reserves in the sense of that all the grant funded projects are sitting in an external reserve and we continue to utilize that if you restore if you um refer to the internal reserves now we have not had a need to um eat into any of our internal reserves at all um we are utilizing things like the project development reserve to actually get projects shovel ready so when a funding opportunity comes along that we are able to submit a funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all our reserves are still there we have only utilized those that were authorized by council thank you thank you you 've already answered the second part of the question which was to do with the outstanding uh funds owed to us thank you okay uh other councillors counselor right you 're on mute mate still on mute i think you already answered this one um susan but uh you know with the amount of you know we 're going for an srv um how how would we arbor manage you know if we 're short of money how are we going to manage for the next 12 months we we 're safe with that we 're not going to give a new council a big headache are we on mr mayor um we are completely able to keep going for the next 12 months for the next 24 months for the next three years without any problems the problem is a long-term sustainability problem as long as the state keeps funding us for maintenance and renewal of our of some of our assets we will be posting operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding but the legislation says we have to provide a result that is at least break even without capital funding because that is a long-term sustainability issue so we are not going to run out of cash to to keep running this council but in the long run posting um operational deficits and then maybe the funding um seizing or the is the state not being able to fund us to the degree they are now we will run into problems but it 's not in the short term thank you any other councillors councillor cross again yes look i actually following on from that i actually went back to my australian company of institut institute of company directors course and matched what what financial statements against their healthy checklist and it was really reassuring to find out that yes we are okay and and whilst we have issues we 're still looking very healthy but one of the questions i wanted to ask was that at the end of the financial year on the 30th of june 2021 in the financial statements the bottom line looked a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was such a big difference there please cfo who are you mr mayor thank you councillor cross we um i assume you 're referring to the financial statement if the financial report that we presented in august to council um we when we prepared that report we made it quite clear in the report that none of the end-of-year adjustments had yet been affected for example we had not finalized the approvals on both sides expenditure and revenue and in particular we had not yet assessed where our grant funding was at the requirement for grant funding to be taken out of revenue then it hasn 't it hasn 't been that the project hasn 't been delivered is one that is quite complicated and takes quite a bit of time at year end obviously that um was one of the first time it was only the second time that we had to do this my team um worked quite hard on this the accounting standard only came in the year before and we are improving these months by months but we did flag that it was definitely going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um rather than that interim report where all the adjustments had not yet been affected thank you thank you uh councillor thank you mr may through you i 'm talking a lot about projects and project funding um how many projects are actually over budget and if they are over budget where does that money go and how many projects are under budget and what happens to that and when do we know when projects are under budget i might refer that to the executive director thank you through you mr mr mayor as already sort of described by the cfo we we had to do a lot of reshuffling of our projects this year to yeah in response to the bushfire recovery works um and also the flood the flood recovery works and um trying to meet the um the timelines in the in the grant funded projects as well as deliver on our own internal projects so that 's why you 've seen a fair bit of change in the budget as as suzanne has already alluded to from a project delivery perspective outside of that we didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with through our qbr process so if there is a under expenditure on one project narrative expansion another we 'll sort of shuffle that through the quarterly budget review process but there was no significant changes over this year outside of all those adjustments to accommodate the floods and the bushfire bushfire works we 've also implemented a program management office or program management group we 've been doing that over the last couple of years and we monitor our project expenditure scope and timelines on a monthly basis so if there is an issue with a project being delivered in regard to time or budget we identify that very early so we can make adjustments resolve the issue and make sure we bring we bring the budget in so we don 't get into that situation where you get to the end of the financial year and you 've got you know you don 't you 've got expenditure at the end of the year we don 't we don 't allow that to that to occur we monitor it monthly and if there are issues we identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep our projects within within the allocated budget does that sort of answer that question thank you mr uh councillor i 'm just segueing on before you disappear again executive director of infrastructure um can you follow on with that is what is our backlog i i noticed that in a few surrounding council areas that they have very large backlogs um how are we standing in snowy valley 's council yep um yeah i suppose um we take a long-term approach to the way we manage our our assets particularly our road infrastructure which is which is pro which is our biggest asset base and our most expensive to to look after and we try and avoid roads falling into that condition where they do become a backlog so for example you know we 'll spend five dollars a square meter on resealing a road if that road is allowed to fail it could cost in the order of a hundred dollars per square meter to reconstruct so so we spend the money on the maintenance keep that to a higher level so we avoid um which which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it becomes very expensive to um to recover sort of falls over that that condition cliff and then obviously it 's very difficult and very expensive to bring that back so we work we work very hard to make sure that that that doesn 't happen and by doing that we keep our our backlog very very low i think our backlogs largely made up of at the moment of the old tumult bridge um which is an asset that was handed to cancel when the new bridge was built so it was originally a state asset handed to cancel um it is well beyond its useful life and hence now it has become a backlog and we 're not funded to do any significant works on that bridge so that 's something that we 're we 're very aware of and working on together with with the cfo and others to try and sort out how we 're going to how we 're going to address that backlog in the future thank you can i just say how proud i am of the roads and thank you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through floods through now we 've got rain and rain and rain and i you know i go into other areas and i just think we do so well so thank you very much you see yeah mr mayer sorry processed matter can i just highlight to councillors if you can 't be seen um in a live stream meeting then you 'll be recorded as absent from the meeting so can all councils make sure they 've got nothing in front of their cameras then they 're staying close enough to their cameras that they can be seen thank you sorry okay thank you thank you councillor ham thank you mr corsh anything further can we move back out of committee councillor ham councillor smith all in favor that 's unanimous thank you uh so we 've got a mover for this mover is yes you have uh councillor esselman and councillor okay thank you okay nothing further i 'll put the motion all in favor let 's carry unanimously thank you because that takes us on to [Music] um 6.1 a management report proposed caravan park 30 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time to introduce nick wilton the manager of growth and activation um welcome to sunny valley 's council nick and uh some of the counselors may have questions for you but um do we have a mover for this one councillor smith and councillor lata council smith oh thank you mr mayor i really welcome this motion we did see that at our september meeting and because there was a scarcity of information about the development it was put over to this meeting and now we have received all of the information that we need and all the diagrams and things and happy to say that it really does stack up and i think that it 's good for any kind of development that will encourage tourism into our area is good in particular what might be called a more of a boutique type of development where it 's a small development with only 15 sites it 's not going to impact greatly on the traffic in the area but it is going to add a dimension to our tourism accommodation that is available which i welcome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i could speak against it thank you mr mayor just um first of all on page 11 if i can pick up the no page eight um a typo that it 's got um the zoning context should be tumba rubber local environmental plan which i 'm sure was just a typo um just a question so when you look at it it 's quite interesting for 15 caravan parks there 's a really enormous administration visitors centers there um and just a small amenities block it does could i ask the manager of growth and activation does this seem a bit unusual mr wilton through the chair um these types of applications are generally regulated under the local government regulation act um essentially at the end of the day um there are certain requirements that have been placed on these types of developments for certain size buildings and amenities the actual amenities building that 's been provided here is not inconsistent with the type of development so if it was um say to suddenly flip into a convention center or function center or tourist complex or something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment plan or would they have to resubmit well obviously the application relates to a caravan park and a camping ground that is defined under the lep now if it was to change to a convention center or some other form of use or activity that activity would be subject to either a modification application or a subject to a new development um consent which would obviously have to come back to full council for consideration okay and all right mr mayor just one last um question going along tumor road it 's a busy road anyhow but the entrance to paddy 's river fall is very narrow it hardly fits two cars and then you quickly turn to the right into this um entrance and if we 're looking at you know caravans moving in and you know the big um amenities block that you we might have a lot of people coming what what um what 's been put in place to help with the the safety of that entrance well so through the chair um the original application wasn 't supported by a traffic impact study um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as as part of this application that study was provided it was referred through to our engineers it was assessed in accordance with the osro guidelines those engineers have agreed with the outcomes of that traffic impact study and advised that that it 's okay to proceed thank you council of course yes so this is a really really sensitive area so um i wanted to ask whether the septic tank system whether the waste removal system whether water whether any of that could impact seriously on the environment surrounding it through the chair um obviously these types of developments are not only regulated by a developed application but they also have a section 68 under the local government application for any sewer disposal on the site that application is supported by a wastewater management report and it ensures that there 's no impact on the local environment and what about waste actual rubbish removal and that that kind of stuff they 've got things in place for that through the chair yes that is correct there 's uh waste removal is via a contractor essentially there 's also we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this application which will be considered prior to any occupations to be being issued um to ensure that appropriate waste receptacles are on site and that it 's obviously managed correctly and just one last question if i may uh i noted in there to the traffic report that there could be a need for a reduction of speed limit there so how who negotiates that to have to have that happen if it 's needed through the chair there 's a request to council to reduce that speed limit along that road now that 's a matter for the traffic committee uh to to deliberate on um at the end of the day traffic committee um can then make recommendations to council to lower that speed limit thank you guys there 's anything further nope i 'll put the motion all in favor against customs voting against so that 's run against thank you so councillors that concludes the the meeting i 'd like to thank you all for your attendance and uh we 'll meet again next month the ordinary"

of the minutes of the previous meeting remover council ham council across thanks business arising from those minutes both of you have business arising councillor ham um i 'd like to bring up 11.2 the local roads and community infrastructure program and um why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there to me one of the local roads that is really really concerning is the elliott way and it is really causing a lot of stress throughout the southern region and also it was interesting on the tumblr umbra trek just to find out how many people with snowy hydro and trans good we 're just really feeling the pain of not being able to use you know um the way going through cabramura and i i don 't know if anyone was privy to information on the tumbler trick about what is happening in that arena thank you council ham um i 'll direct that to the ceo and he can redirect it if she wishes um also noting is the elliott way a local road ceo ah thanks mr mayor yes um the road is a combination of a national parks road and a council road the council road was open immediately after the fires and we 've received some funding to do some works on that recently and we 've applied for more funding to do works on that the section in national parks is owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant land slips and have had to do some geotechnical investigations before doing the specifications to go out to tender for those works we understand that those works will be notified about who was a successful tenderer soon and those works will commence they were delayed apparently due to the geotechnical studies having some difficulties about not being able to be done during the cold weather climate and they had an additional wet weather event councillors raised the issue advocacy the mayor myself all of you councillors at every opportunity we 've had i also sit on the state and the original coordination group for snowy 2.0 and at every one of those meetings i have questioned national parks and wildlife service about that road and the opening we did have mick pettit um there at the tumble trek on the weekend at the dinner and on the walk and i know a number of councillors and staff caught up with mick and certainly i 've had a number of conversations uh with mick and they they have been trying to move on that project as quickly as possible some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may wish to add to that counselor right yeah i spoke to nikki blink about it and i must admit he was very good i gave him a bit of a pacing about lack of communication to the community about where they 're at and what they 're doing and he did admit that they probably didn 't either all that well um and he did say that he believes it will still be finished before the end of may um the plan is to um once it 's um contracts are let they 'll be into it straight away and he 's got um confirmation from the contractors that they can get onto it pretty quickly so i thought it was pretty good news and he was very open and good to talk about it he was i found it quite good um you know especially scenes they didn 't really do i think the communication to our community was the biggest thing they missed out on where they could have been better just let us know what 's going on thank you councillor wright any other councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mayor whether uh whether we 've received any advice about being successful for that tender given the fact that we obviously control the uh the other half i 'm through councillor we haven 't received any notification yet we have um on our private works um actually tented for those four tenders uh for uh the national park section of the um of that road we haven 't received notification yet but i hear that that from national parks that that 's imminent for that release and i have also heard that there may be some um additional tenders for extra sections on that road as well would see mod that uh he 's telling councillor right that the contractors can start straight away if they haven 't uh they 've obviously decided it doesn 't sound like it 's us i i don 't think um he he just said part of their discussions and i guess with all the contractors was um you know how soon that he 'd get started how soon did he finish he didn 't actually say that he 'd let any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross you had a question yes i want i just wondered if there was any response at all from blakely miller um through the chair mr mayor uh councillor cross we have had some discussions about setting up a meeting unfortunately at this point we haven 't been able to get a time that works for both the foundation and for council but we 're continuing to work on that they um appear to be uh willing to meet with us which is a great sign well done thank you anything further from those minutes councillor benjamin thank you mr mayor i just wanted to get an update on um item number 10 11.5 the assessment for da 2020 slash 0247 mr mayor i may hand that one across to um the executive director corporate and community uh thank you for your inquiry through you mr mayor um the uh assessment uh we have requested the further information from the applicant uh to date the application or that um further information has not been forthcoming uh we we are awaiting it um in cons a conversation with the applicant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in that further information was underway so we expect to receive that further information in the in the coming weeks and uh once received um we will um uh prepare the assessment for discussion with council thank you mr holton thank you anything further okay put the motion that we accept those minutes all in favor that 's everyone thank you councillors that takes us to 10.1 governance and financial reports ratification of meetings attended by councillors january 2021 three recommendations there to have a mover council larder secondary councillor benjamin councillor all right no i just recommend a three thank you any other speakers put the motion all in favor oh counselor ham you wanted to say something i i might refer it to the next the next one thank you let 's put the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you 10.2 relates back to that one draft payment of expenses and provision of facilities for mayor and councillors policy for adoption councillor ham 's moving it second to council lada kessler hand um thank you mr mayor um thank you very much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking um consideration of points that i 've put in i believe the policy is much improved but something i suggested i want to unsuggest if possible and the reason that is is that previous policy uh that previous motion which was to pay for my transport to go to the arbor festival and i am going to have a slight diversion there i 'm sorry mr mayor but i do want to publicly say how brilliant the other festival was and i think everyone would agree that it 's just been the most amazing thing for the district and anyone who was fortunate enough to be at the woodlands festival to be at the sugar pie memorial and to be at fannie lamston 's concert like would be just blown away with the professionalism the enthusiasm just i mean this all happened on our patch and it 's just i presume we 're writing a letter of gratitude to the organizers but it was really outstanding given given that i agree with you i 'll allow that [Laughter] thank you however um my my attending the uh the sugarpine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the council reports and and this could be stopped in the policy by just making sure that um when a counselor attends events sponsored by council that this can be ratified by the ceo and the mayor rather than having to be passed right through all the all the council because at the end of the year there 's an there 's an annual review anyhow that publicly shows where you know what reimbursements were for and what so it does seem duplicating and really does seem a lot of work on council for something that 's happening anyhow so councillor councillor ham would you be happy if the in that under that submission summary page two section uh adjacent to ecm id three zero eight four nine one zero uh after mayor and ceo it says to be ratified at the next council meeting put a line through to be ratified at the next council meeting yep i 'd like that right and and and also in official business that official business um also includes events sponsored by council so that means if i want to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every year i 'm on no committee nothing for it i 'd like me to go because i 'm a councillor um i 'd like to know that i can go um as a counsellor to that event okay mr mayor if i may given discussions the staff have had with uh councillor ham we have uh drafted an alternative resolution i can share that on the screen if you wish to you see that okay so we 've added uh four five and six there um highlighted in red castle ham does that capture um your request yeah thank you very much for understanding yes thank you are the counselors happy with that okay councillor smith yes mr mayor i also attended that event in fact i took part in that event at the at the request which i took to be part of my council responsibilities and therefore didn 't run it past you or the ceo um and i wasn 't aware that there was any controversy about that or that counselor hammered run into trouble about during difficulty about that um and i understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now there 's no there 's no trouble at all it 's just um it 's just ticking boxes and i did hear that you were the headline act and and did a wonderful job so congratulations on your part there um no this is this is just paperwork basically so with those changes counselors are there any other comments with those changes i 'll put that most those new motions counseling need to seek clarify clarification from the mover and the seconder that they accept those changes happy okay yeah right up put the notion all in favor that 's unanimous again thank you adoption of council committees policy and council committee 's operation manual riveting staff do we have a mover councillor smith council of latter thank you yes considering that we have worked on that quite consistently and exhaustively i think it 's a good result and i recommend this policy thank you councillor smith nothing further all in favor unanimous again thank you um half year the operational plan action and project update council ham chris lalata castle ham we be able to go into committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'd like to move that way you 're moving that way do i have a secondary because a lot of thank you do i have everybody in agreeance that 's unanimous thank you thank you mr mayor thing and thank you to the staff that put this document together it 's just great to see what is happening um i i i 'd like to comment on a few things and i 'm sorry i 've got a paper copy but i 'm referring to page 89 um paper copy which is point number in the advocacy plan progress number 11 and the rail tran trail master plan establishing a walking and cycle master plan for the svc region for the development of existing and new south wales um there 's a tick as funding secured and i think that is in the wrong place because it 's successful grant application for tel bingo trail rail mail master plan business case that that should be somewhat it worked the next one down because we have certainly not got the master plan for um trails and i know there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and all of us waiting to do the big master plan so um if that could be just unticked because that 's certainly not the case um mr verify may so um councillors that 's on page 8 of 52 electronically of that attachment um and councillor ham yes i agree we have got the money for the tel bingo component but not for the regional component so we will make that that amendment fantastic and then so if it 's okay with you mr man i 've got about four or five points okay keep going um on page 96 about snow view um just a half yearly it 's in progress it said that it 's 75 um completed but when i was looking the other day i really couldn 't see any action there at all and my understanding that it has to be completed by july just if we could have an update on is that going to be completed in time and what should we be expecting to see in the next month or two yeah mr holton yeah through you mr mayor um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application has been lodged with council i 've had meetings with our project manager and we are in the throes of developing a project scope for a design and construct project um we will our intention is to as soon as that scope has been finalized we will go to market looking for a um to procure a uh a contractor to undertake that design and construct project anticipating that we would award a contract by the end of this financial year with a view to the design work the detailed design work pre-construction design work to be undertaken uh during the winter months and uh a uh i guess um the first sod turned uh in the spring that 's uh that 's about as fast as we can get this project okay so two points there it really isn 't 75 because i like how soft i 'm just looking at colors but it really is nowhere near 75 completed and and to so if that 's the case so we 're looking at spring getting it done are people able to buy off the plan now or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'd be reluctant to put any any um blocks on the market in advance of the da being approved but at the same time the i don 't see there being any constraint in terms of running a procurement at the same time as the da assessment for a detailed design and construct so we do have very fairly clear plans on that were developed for stage three um through you know they were developed in the past uh they 're not detailed design plans to the uh to the extent where um you know engineering details and things like that are worked out but they there are site plans that are quite clear i don 't believe we can uh at this stage it would be advisable to actually put them on the market until we have um the da um finalized that could be in the next month or so well it 's it 's with us and uh and we are progressing our contractor uh is assessing that da at the moment mr mayor if i just point of clarification the 75 percent indicates that 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress stage not that those items are 75 percent progressed thank you partner okay thank you thank you okay um page 101.1.4.2 um facilitate and deliver a program of council-led cultural development just um no at 0.1 so just i um the activation team is doing an amazing job in with eastern riverina arts and everything however um there 's a reference here to hello scenario valleys i really don 't know what that 's about and also after the consultation meetings with winter bites there seems to be some confusion about what it actually means and how it is going to help our communities through you mr mayor i can take that question hello snowy uh hello snowy valleys is uh it 's a fantastic um arts and cultural initiative that will occur uh around the same time as the winter bites festival it involves the residency of national profile internationally profiled playwright hani rayson and and radio nationals arts broadcaster michael cathcart they 'll be in residence in snowy valleys for 10 weeks from june through to august and they 'll be i guess eliciting stories from local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories into a a theater piece to be presented in batlow in august and council has funded that project through some of the bushfire funding that came through as well as through the place activation team so it 's very much um uh in line with the operational plan action in terms of developing partnerships encouraging arts and cultural activities and this this is a really great example of local arts and culture and it will utilize the literary institute to its fullest degree and all of the the lighting and sound infrastructure that 's been um put in there i 'm sorry nice to meet you could we have some clarification exactly what winter bites is and how that is so winter bites um is a festival uh that has been developed and it 's been funded through um austrade um as a as an economic recovery initiative in response to the bush fires it involves the towns of adelong batlow and tumbarumba and seeks to showcase the produce and and the commodities that we produce in those three different areas and i guess the aim is to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a summer autumn and spring destination and at this stage the the actual events are under under planning and we have employed a uh a festival um director or coordinator to to to put together the program and uh that person has been undertaking um various uh consultations with the business community in particular in a in each of those locations um in an effort to put together an exciting pro program it is anticipated and one of the things that um got us over the line with the funding and it was significant funding was we would like to see this event continue uh throughout you know ongoing and not necessarily limited to those three locations but you know seeing it expand or move around as uh in different years so this is the first first try we have been fortunate enough to get significant funding to give it a really a red hot go and and it 's still a work in progress and and there will be more and more come out about this uh as time goes on thank you thank you mr holt there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been applying um for other projects other than a winter bites festival but was that um funding available for other projects so the story around the funding was quite interesting we initially submitted for a large scale event in one location with a concert and so forth we were that we were told that the amount of money we were looking for um wasn 't uh they weren 't going to fund it uh funded to that extent and would we uh re uh rejig our application uh so the the place activation team did a complete review of what they had proposed and came up with the concept of winter bites and locating it in those three areas the austrade was so they were so enamored with what was proposed they actually uh provided more funding than was originally applied for in the first instance so we got a very strong endorsement from austrade around the proposal that was put forward and on that basis um i guess um you know we 've um proceeded on uh to to attempt or proceeded with the process of delivering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i just want to ask if you know about the bushfire preparedness for next year if you like um you know you know one of the big things we keep talking about is communication and lack of communication some of our more outlying i wonder if this is an opportunity for us to ask about that see where we 're going with that it 's out on a bit of a limb but i i guess we can it 's it can be it could be linked in with major projects and advocacy projects hand over to the ceo thanks mr may uh yes we have um uploaded the portal on our website where there 's a whole lot of disaster information available to the community there we in the case of fires we aren 't the lead agency the rfs is the lead agency and they control the communications we are doing what we need to do for council responsibility and we are looking at lands where um council is responsible uh for managing those lands some of those lands we do need to receive crown lands permission and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and can 't do on lands that are actually owned by the crown we make a approach for that but they make the decision about what we can do um and where you know we 've got our information uh available as we get through but really the the um the lead agency is rfs and we don 't want to create any confusion with council issuing any particular instructions because that 's not our expertise that is rfs 's expertise and they 're very good at their job and they 're very good at communicating so most of that communication comes out through them we do have the local emergency management committee which does meet and does discuss various issues and progress matters between government departments and that is still operating and there is a subgroup to that that operates around the snowy two as well i might point out also that as a council we continue to lobby for black spot programs for um upgrade of telecommunications so we 're continuing to do to do that as well and i 'll talk and talk about having some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our community and keep them informed of what what 's going on and maybe talk about you know it 's really rfs 's um department which should be stepping on their toes but um is it is there any more news on that at all you think of thanks counselor right we we can only just hear you so you might you might just need to speak closer to your microphone when you 're talking but um rfs um has uh have offered to run some events in the local community um that um advise the community about what their processes are and what 's happening i don 't have an update on where that 's at but i will follow that up okay thanks councillor pritchard just a bit of communications mr mayor yeah a lot of the agencies are doing a lot of work but the big hole in the in communications as far as i 'm concerned is the urgent see when there 's a major event on not everyone has the internet not everyone has a mobile telephone and we need to have some immediate alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that there is a major event bushfires or floods or whatever i mean during the second world war they used sirens well i can 't see why we can 't have a siren system set up or even run on by low-flying aircraft around the whole area so people don 't have normal communication access they 're alerted then it 's up to them to go and find out what 's going on but there are people who get no communication no no communication whatsoever thank you councillor pritchard um i do note that uh sounds of the mountains have been funded i think also radio upper murray some of the funds have gone there for our local radio to uh to be enhanced uh during times of well enhanced at all times but uh so so that they can get the the word out during um during times of crisis and emergency i also note that um for example in in adelong um the siren goes off when there 's a fire or there 's something something going on so it 's not uh it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uh or watch tv on your tv and uh there are a lot of people that don 't have any communications whatsoever and they need to get out with the fires and you buy up the bubaganda for example um they do it during wartime i can 't see any reason why an aircraft can 't just fly around the area with a fire on so that people can be warned they can go right to the neighbor and find out what 's happening but some people really don 't get immediate um we can uh we can give that as an option to the emergency team some of those comments the document that we 're talking about on electronic page five we 've actually got the progress that we made on our uh advocacy pro uh projects there and we were successful in securing uh just over 19 million dollars for six of the 14 advocacy projects and in q1 and q2 of this financial year we 've lodged for a further 42 million dollars worth of projects a significant amount of work progressing in there but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects around uh bushfire recovery and those are well in progress as we 've seen in respect to the roadside cleanup you know that is a a multi-million dollar project and the community lobbied hard for that we advocated to make sure that that was a funded project from the state and the state have done that and we 've made great progress in our area so lots of good things um happening around protecting our communities thank you but just to reinforce it there are people who don 't get any warning whatsoever if they 're in an isolated place and anyway they can be addressed as great such aircraft or police or whatever going around the signs in all the area um anyway that 's all i 've got to say thank you councilman pritchard any other councillor costs i can see your hand up there i 'd just like to go back to the operational plan and inquire get an update on what 's happening with fogo one question on what 's happening with fogo the other question around the waist app do we have any any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so far thank you councillor cross uh for listeners food organics garden organics is the acronym um see ya i 'll hand this one on to executive director of infrastructure hines thank you through you mr mr mayor the um yeah apps that 's going well from what i hear over a thousand uh people have participated in the app and they have been um the vouchers have been used at the uh landfills which is which is great uh in regard to fogo yes still it 's fogo 's gonna be a a multi-year project obviously very very deep into the planning phase at the moment detailed designs sorting out contracts and all that sort of stuff yeah looking at rolling out the bins this financial year and then the processing facility will will follow thank you anything further just like because of just like to compliment the staff on the way they put together the operational plan it 's really clear i really like the color coding it makes it so easy to read i think they 've done a fantastic job thank you ceo can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors do i have do we have a mover to go out of is that what you 're moving kessler ham that we go out of i 'm afraid you 're afraid not is anything happening with the country university center haven 't it hasn 't raised its head for a while and there haven 't been any anyone who 's been terribly um well i 'm i 'm very enthusiastic about it but um it just hasn 't yeah yep okay happy to move out secondary council across all in favor that 's unanimous thank you which takes us to 10.4 we 've got to move in a second of that didn 't we yes we did cancel a handicap further on that put the motion all in favor it 's unanimous thank you [Music] new council implementation fund ncif and stronger communities scf as a there are a few of these stronger communities fund and stronger country communities fund but these are these are ncif and scf movers council lada custer benjamin councillota mute castle lada nothing to say okay something else put the motion all in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass on congratulations to uh the council crews and and also the contractors who are working on all these um all these projects it 's certainly been uh great to see see them all and um yeah and i 'm just so impressed with some of them they 're fantastic 10.6 governance and finance reports council ham because lacrosse um thank you to the cfo for presenting this so well um i 've got two questions one is i i am actually going to look at the statement investments for january and december together in um in the it management support software just because it 's looking like up to about i think it 's around 360 000 is being spent in the it software management area and i know that we 've all gone over to outlook which i personally appreciate it 's great however that just seems like an awful lot of money is it 's not very expensive it 's just a one-off how was it funded um if the cfo could explain that great thank you council ham cfa councillor hampshire are you mr mayor um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corresponding savings in the wages and materials budget so it 's not going over budget it 's just a different type of procuring it i can add that we also had some ncif projects in these payments we had finalized the network connectivity the installation of the hardware cabling phone systems and the installation of the always-on vpn software and then also the transfer to office 365 over the christmas period some security remediation work is also being undertaken by the same contractor it 's a large expense isn 't it and so this is too much in a row that 's been quite large what would you what 's it now that it 's all set up how much would we be expecting in this area and yeah yeah through you mr mayor i am uh going to take this one on notice there is a commercial confidence contract obviously in place okay and while i 've got your cfo just you 've made a statement up here cash investments rates continue to fall due to uncertain economic environment and long-term outlook so i 'd just like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area and um so the yeah the investment rates are continuing to fall do you have a forecast of how you 're seeing this going forward thank you councillors for you mr mayor um we have a number of impacts uh albeit not very large ones and we have some reduction in fee income because we couldn 't hire out halls parks etc for a while on the other hand we have received increased funding due to colbit there is a number of funding streams that are now available that weren 't available before and it 's mainly to do with kickstarting the economy but it definitely had a negative in fact impact on the general economy and once the general economy gets impacted and investment rates are going down so at the moment we 're starting to attract decent interest rates on our investments but we also had a very good rate on a loan that we took out so it all balances out in the end it will impact our income by the end of the year but we did budget very very conservatively because we did expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to just to highlight the fact that we spend 139 000 dollars on waste disposal to full hill it that would be a really good point to bring out when we start doing some educational work around fogo and how the community can get on board with reducing that um but my question is does all does all of snowy valleys council waste go that 's not recyclable does all of that go to bald hill thank you cross i 'll direct that to the executive director of infrastructure mr course on mute mr course short answer short answer to that yes so we don 't have any landfills any active landfills in our region so everything that needs to go to landfill goes to bald hill which is unrecyclable material and what is the life expectancy of bald hill uh yeah a bit difficult it is a it is a privately run landfill um but as a cancer we 're a partner in that in that we have air space that 's made available to us from what i understand um there 's no threat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to long term but as as you 've stated earlier we 'd very much prefer to maximize recycling and very much minimize what goes to board hill and part of rolling out the fogo will hopefully assist with that and when we do roll out fogo is there the capacity to be able to to uh capture how much waste is reduced by the introduction of fogo so that we 've got a we 've got a ballpark figure baseline figure now can we work out how much is saved to landfill through through that fogo program yes most most definitely everything that goes to bald hill goes through a weighbridge uh and is invoiced so yes we 'll very clearly see the difference thank you thank you councillor cross thank you mr cause uh anything further just put the motion all in favor that 's unanimous thank you statement of investments december 2020 castle ladder council lacrosse castle and i 'm just happy to move them thank you counselor cost you 've got a question yes statement the energy costs i 'm just curious whether it 's too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to be able to look at how led lights in the in our towns is impacting on our cost is is that able to be measured yet of course uh not quite yet but very soon in that the installation of the leds is is well underway uh once that 's completed we will we should see um immediate reductions in our energy bills and you will be able to track that for us yes yes so we we get billed by the energy so so we should see that and you 're happy to happy to share that information with councillors of course so so we 're judging this basically just on on a monetary figure um what about do we have any um any measure any metrics on uh consumption of energy units uh for street lighting or do you mean it like across the world just on a hole you know like if if we 're if we 're looking at trying to reduce some of our consumption and be you know a little bit greener and and produce um solar pv and all that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing um have we got any any sort of handle on that i suppose yeah any any new works or anything we do any new buildings we 're obviously always looking at at introducing solar and reducing energy consumption as part of the design processes i don 't suppose we probably don 't measure that directly but we do make sure that we do incorporate energy efficient devices and strategies in everything we do and at the end yeah and at the end of the day that 's that should reduce the cost yeah yeah yeah definitely definitely but it 's it 's something you know if we 're talking new builds we don 't have a comparison to what it would have been you know if it hadn 't been included if that makes sense it certainly does obviously i mean the stuff we 've done with the pools maximizing solar and all that all our swimming pools where we can sure thank you anything further on that i 'll put the motion all in favor it 's unanimous again thank you financial report december 2020 council ham council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all um just point out a fairly major typo in the graph there in the actual where 's in the operating results where it is showing negative it should show positive and vice versa which actually brings good news rather than bad news in the fact that um our operating result is 4.8 million dollars up and 154 percent variance which um i 'd like to congratulate the of throwing and would like her to continue in that way if that 's possible um unfortunately i don 't think it is so if that could just be miniature that that is that operating result line is incorrect um then i 'd like to discuss income above budget including the tumba rumba caravan park up 138 000 rough corners this is up above budget um ross corner up 35 000 and commercial works up 360 000 um 560. yeah i presume commercial works is because of bushfire recovery um caravan park probably the same and yeah maybe to see if they might um tell us why and why did we um budget so conservatively that certainly makes us feel good now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you counselor i am through your mr mayor um we didn 't have baseline figures for the caravan park and we also didn 't expect it to be such a good year for the caring park we have basically the entire caroline park booked out for for the entire year um with ross corner there was um uncertainty on how we would be running ross corner but if we would continue to run it ourselves with local doctors or whether somebody would take over and and also it 's very hard to predict how much income comes through it we are still currently running it ourselves and please be aware that just because the income is up doesn 't mean we 're making a higher profit the expenditures are also up thank you and then commercial works being up that high that is bushfire our vision yeah through you mr mayor i believe it is mainly bushfire related but we also have had some other additional funding streams coming and i 'll hand that over to director of infrastructure yeah um exactly as the cfo alluded to good part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been fortunate additional commercial works and it is a it is a bit of a um yeah it 's difficult to forecast depending on what happens um but we we are progressing very well with commercial works at this point in time thank you anything further put the motion all in favor on favor thank you carrot unanimous quarterly budget review castellana castle ham castellata nothing anyone else kessler hand um maybe if i could just ask the ceo or the cfo is this is is this good result just to bush fire bubble thank you councillor uh ceo thank you counselor through your mr chair um it is to a degree a little bit of a bushfire bubble it 's also a culvert bubble but we are also making great inroads in savings and efficiencies across the organization which has an effect as well i draw your attention to the fact that our capital works budget is getting postponed on a number of fronts mainly due to additional projects but also due to the weather conditions that we had recently and um continuing disaster recovery works thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit i mean it looks great and it 's you know good to see that financially we 're going okay at this stage it just worries me a bit that we are looking at a long-term financial budget and have we budgetatively too conservative conservatively because you know is this at the pan i 'm going to say year after year but then we 're also budgeting on you know we 're still not looking until we have a uh you know feel comfortably financially till 10 years down the track so it just makes me ask are we just too conservative in our budgeting through your messages um look budgeting is is always a little bit conservative because especially on the expenditure side you you have um variances that you need to explain upfront but um we are still making we are we are still pro um think that we will make a loss at the end of this year so it 's not like we 're doing we 're doing better but we 're not doing that fantastically if we 're still making losses and if we eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah okay and i understand your um concern and yes we will take that into account for the future budget ground thank you thank you cfo but at the same time we we can 't budget for natural disasters and and pandemics as well councillor pritchard yeah i was just going to raise that point myself people think that the this covered virus is over i don 't think it started yet it certainly won 't er it could have impacts on us for for the for longer than the and more significant impacts that we can see ahead of us look at the rest of the world they 're in shambles and uh we 're hanging in there at the moment but the vaccine advice is confusing i think we need to er on the conservative side for everything for the time being yeah and unfortunately most um most of our organizations around and businesses have have been lucky with the federal government 's job keeper and of course we weren 't eligible for that as a council handing on any further counsellors okay let 's put this 10.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional ordinary meeting for the review of the draft operational plan and budget new meeting and a new time council ham are you moving that thank you i can barely see your grin from here counselor hand would you like to speak to this oh i will mr mayor i 'm just delighted that we 're showing that we can be flexible in the in our meeting time so i 'm aware that it 's an election year i 'm aware that there 's some people who may be listening today who are just dying to become on council or at least stand for election and just so that you know that we do have some flexibility i also think it 's a good trial um for us as a council to do to see how much uh this will cost and the impact it does make on staffing and on cost so thank you very much thank you council hammond i 'm delighted that you 're delighted and i 'm also aware that it 's an election year any other councillors no okay let 's put the motion all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that sorry that 's the castle across council cross thank you all in favor unanimous thank you road naming golf links estate subdivision councillor benjamin councillor lata any conversation on this one christmas it 's great to see um this subdivision actually opened um in the snowy valleys and yeah keen to see what happens in the long run thank you thank you councillor benjamin put the motion all in favor that 's carried thank you thanks to everyone involved in that that 's good uh drinking water management system annual reports for 2018 and 19. three recommendations councillor smith councillor cross councillor smith which looks yes look it 's good to see the reports very very good but it might be worth mentioning for people in tumbarumba who are noting um an odor and a taste in the water it might be a little bit excuse me concerned about the quality of the water that the water has been very very thoroughly tested and that it is a 100 percent fit to drink and that there are possibly other reasons for the odor and for the taste perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be helpful thank you councillor smith executive director of infrastructure mute still on mute sorry apologies um through you mr mayor thank you councillor smith here we have had issues with um algae in the uh supply dam that feeds into the treatment plant at tumbarumba very much as you 've as you 've highlighted not an issue as far as water quality goes uh is creating some odour which then um affects the taste um we 're working through that the best we can it 's a natural occurring thing um something we haven 't experienced before in that in that system um but please be advised there 's no issue with the um quality of the water from a drinking perspective thank you anything else counsellors follow the counselor costs i 'd like to say how our community expects to have control good quality water and how good it is to have external bodies overseeing it and actually auditing the quality of our water it 's really great to see that oversight from an external body and i 'd like to complement the fact that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely thank you that means a lot from coming from you thank you councillors um if you can excuse me for uh a moment i have to uh get a cord because my battery is low you can just we can just cancel i might hand over to actually i 'll put the motion all in favor it 's carried and while i grab that i might ask the deputy mayor to do the next report please thank you sorry it 's it 's right your topic mr deputy man yes but you have to get off mute [Music] councillor ham does anyone wish to speak counsellor right

one over councillor we 're back on um item 11.3 crown road reserve chimney aerodrome 11 4 sorry yeah you 're you 're ahead of us so if i could speak to it and just ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i could

uh aspiring to and you know i think it 's it 's it 's a great idea cancel a picture would you mind telling us where we stand with the extension of the airport and the runway and upgrading of the airport if i may um councillor pritchard that um we 're just putting our project plan together for that one at the moment and uh just working through that so we can come back to councillors and advise them a little more on that project as we advance um there is some commercial issues uh um that we need to be conscious of in discussing that in the public forum just just that the uh wish fire season will be upon us shortly so it 's two separate projects um if i may there 's one project that 's uh um that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then there 's the the larger project if you want um uh uh mr corsh could give us an update on the ceiling of the taxiways uh project which was the first project yeah through you mr deputy mayor um we we 've been liaising very closely with the rfs they 've asked us to just hold back on the actual physical work on site um they 'd prefer that we wait till the end of the fire season so we 've programmed the works once they once they 're comfortable that they 're clear of the fire season we 'll get in and do that work and it 's intended it 'll be ready for the next fire season just didn 't want to didn 't want to start that work now and impede their response if they 're if there is an incident thank you [Music] anything further the map that we 've got the overview of that we 've got is really very unclear as to where that what is actually being proposed so it 's very hard to make a decision about it and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr deputy mayor the the road is shown in that purpley color going across the runway that 's that 's the section that we 're referring to in the report so that 's currently dedicated as a as a what we what we refer to as a paper road for the crown and we need to get that transferred over into cancel ownership um in that it is very much part of the part of the aerodrome so heinz the the um scale there has freehold landers in brown but in actual fact it should be white because it 's sbc land isn 't it correct yes apologies for that yeah thank you that 's that 's that 's where we 're getting lost okay yeah and the purple strip is that is the road going through the aerodrome well we better yeah we better move the motion then if that 's the case you happy to put to a vote all those in favor against that 's carried unanimously fully charged now well done okay i 'll do the tomorrow cemetery naming of the internal walkway we 've

to agree with councillor wrote that um anyone who knew ivan lyons and and the impact he 's had on tumbarama district it 's it 's very worthy thank you thank you very much all in favor carrie thank you uh the sentiment of policies infrastructure one and two and two goes a to h councillor ham council across i think they should be rescinded as recommended thank you all in favor synonymous thank you companion animals management policy for adoption three recommendations council ham councillor [Music] previously yeah and uh we all agree that there needs to be proper control of companion animals and this is okay to deliver that so we commend thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously minister local traffic committee meeting moving that councillor right thank you council lada anything arising any comments yeah council across i just wanted to highlight uh 4.3 about parking lines uh and perhaps item 4.3 uh plugin lines along elm drive could we take back to the committee that it should also include elm drive down by the riverside cafe where the island is because there 's a lot of confusion about where you can park and how you can park down in that area i 'm sure councillor councillor wright can take that to the next meeting and bring probably bring it up in business arising from these minutes thank you councillor pritchard uh mr mayor inquire if there 's any progress regarding the crossing from near the skateboard park in turmerit in fitzgerald street that 's been a disaster along there for some years and it 's very dangerous with the increase in traffic through the town and the increased activity of the skateboard park okay thank you um i do note that it 's that it 's dropped by 10 kilometers an hour but uh director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic calming through that area or a warning well it 's a pedestrian crossing that we 're like a pedestrian footpath any um application for a crossing would have to be through transport for new south wales and and i think my understanding is we were looking at the pedestrian traffic and pathways and all that as part of it as part of that overall strategy um being our pathway strategy so i think it should be picked up through that otherwise we could again as as you 've alluded to previously we could raise it through the traffic committee as general as general business it 's been on the agenda for years and it 's needed attention in my opinion thank you certainly an area that 's utilized a lot by the young people along there uh anything further from those minutes the motion all in favor that 's unanimous as well battle development league 4th of november 320 councillor smith council lada council smith yes i 'd like to comment on the fact that there has been a lot of uh increase in community interest uh in batlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendees at the bdl meetings which is very gratifying to see a lot of people have become involved in um furthering the interests of batlow particularly post uh bushfire and i think it has increased a lot of activity and there are a number of different projects and things that were brought to the attention of the bdl uh that are happening around the place and um i think that batlow is on the up and up um after a very disastrous bushfire period and the losses that were suffered there certainly there have been a lot of government support and interest from various politicians and so forth in the area um and that is well worth noting that there is a real increase in community activity and community interest in the battle development league and its work there thank you council smith any further councillor ham can i just ask councillor smith and maybe the um paul holton as well who lives in um butler i know that the rms will not approve the crossing on batlay road i presume that 's outside the um the iga there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely coffee but um i have to agree with it it 's it 's just so congested as it is and if you had a crossing there you 'd have no room left to park at all at the supermarket it 's i just like some opinion on that it just seems like the wrong place to have the crossing um if i may through you just um comment on that the um the the actual discussion that was held at the the batlow development league uh was more of the lines that that the crossing would not be approved in time to uh be funded through the uh prior to the closure of or prior to the the date that was was required to be finished in respect of the grants program that was uh that it was to be funded under i i think efforts are still being put in to identify an appropriate uh uh site for a a crossing to address the issues that would have that were um raised during community consultation but this is outside of that um that funding program so it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project in which case the next priority was the toilets there in um yeah and they definitely need to be written thank you your that i do believe that a crossing is needed uh very much in the future when we can get to that um point with rfs to to get a crossing done there because of the elderly people that crossed the road and because of the heavy traffic and heavy um logged trucks and so forth had come down there i think it is important at some stage a crossing is installed there thank you council smith okay uh put the motion this is for the development league 12.3 all in favor it 's carried unanimous takes us to the next not 12.2 that was now 12.3 councillor smith we 'll just accept that one councillor ham seconder any any comment put the motion all in favor unanimous again takes us to glenroy heritage reserve committee councillor ham councillor lata just like to thank councillor um schmidt for attending this for me um they 're a great group of people to live with um not to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some concerns that uh has been spoken to with councillor wright i was just wondering if you wouldn 't mind bringing those up councillor wright about the concerns that uh leroy [Music] committee that 's a museum committee um so but i think it 's all in hand at the present moment that um shelley said that working on it and um and to help facilitate that in any way we can and help those people um just discuss it and make sure that they 're all comfortable that 's all thank you thank you okay put the motion all in favor that 's

for the special activation precinct but there will be a flow on into the scenario valley 's council and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted to say that our council is putting in a submission for this however um it certainly does affect um for people it would be good if the aboriginal people can put in something as well because these are their lands that are going to be affected thank you councillor pritchard still on mute counselor pritchard i 'm trying to mute you you know this is an enormous uh proposal it 's get the the reasoning behind it is they want to turn the ski field area into an all year round playground they want to put a four thousand beds in the bay field in the area they want to put their three helipads ski mountain bike trails uh it 's going to change things just gigantically and i you may remember that the snowfields people did a deal with the vale in colorado about this joining joining up they they 've got some partnership or they did have and people could buy a ticket for one country and we should do them right for the whole year across either colorado or parachute i don 't know that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel that will get it through this area in the uh uh off that skiing season will be enormous there will be a throw on whether we like it or not it won 't affect us in tune very much i don 't think except that the people who want to go there from the riverina they 'll all be passing through here um but the narrow great people are the the original owners of the land and it 's certainly important that they 'd be respected and there may be job opportunities for them there but i 'd advise anyone to read this proposal john balaro is the guy behind it all and uh i won 't carry on anymore but it 's gonna have an enormous impact thank you council pitch on any other counselors put the motion all in further that 's carried unanimously thank you uh council that brings us to the confidential mayoral minute we 'll move into confidential for that to have a mover to move that way correct yep councillor ham councillor across all in favor unanimous we 'll move into confidential just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button yeah do you want me to put you back in the breakout room okay thank you well affirmation uh sorry just having trouble getting you out to that that 's all right i just i thought i hit the right but i didn 't say leave the meeting i just said leave the breakout room was that you uh i 'm not sure so it is being live streamed though so everything you say at the moment is love streaming yeah i 'm sorry kate i can 't get you back into that hey so we 've got one two three four we 've lost jeff i 've got him all president accounted for thank you thank you councillors i just moved further on so report that that uh that mayoral minute was was passed unanimously by those in the room councillors that takes us to the 10.1 australian local government association do i have a mover for that council across councillor smith you got your hand up yes he has um any comment on that council across mute council cross i was at that conference and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of issues i think a couple of things that came out of it that were of interest to me was the fact that city dwellers are interested in moving to the country and that the jobs in the country are now perceived as not just being a rural kinds of jobs so i thought that and that um there has been a toolkit developed for councils to be able to use to help launch their region i think the other thing that was of interest to us in particular is that the barriers for doctors coming to our region that they don 't want to set up as businesses they actually want to be part of a hospital so the other things of interest were the exhibitions that we saw and all the different things that that um that we can tap into so all in all i don 't know if councillor smith you 've got anything else to add but i found it a really valuable experience thank you council cross council smith yes certainly uh i would like to add the the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of salient points one of them was that we were addressed by a number of the current politicians and i found it quite a significant moment when the current deputy prime minister spoke to us on his way to a parliamentary meeting where he uh knew that he was going to be voted out of his position and yet he had the courage and strength to come and talk to us from the heart and encourage us in our position as local government i found it very touching and moving and courageous in fact and a number of other politicians addressed us um and i find those sort of events or those parts of the event very uh helpful and useful um one of the other things that i noted was i went out to the breakout session uh about waste towards zero waste and it was very heartening to note that with our fogo program that we 're well of ahead of the pack and that it 's going to become um law by uh 2031 i think it is um that all councils need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that snowy valley 's council is ahead of the game in this respect uh and that in in many respects we can hold our heads up high and members of this council well into the future can hold their heads up high of being part of a very progressive and positive council um and that there are not many other councils where the um camaraderie if you like but the positive um culture of this council are replicated so for me it was a very positive experience thank you councillor smitten certainly we 're very lucky to be able to get the conference uh up and over before the uh the coven came back again to bite us so yeah very good thank you very much councillors do it uh anyone any further i 'll put the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously uh and uh just for the for the minute taker i believe it was councillor ham and councillor wright that moved to move out of uh confidential yes thank you okay moving on councillors to 10.2 section 218 cc local government act proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor ham seconder councillor across here we are okay uh kessler ham i i 'd just like to um acknowledge that the report was delivered as someone who lives in the southern area of the council it 's been really quite distressing to see the sadness in the community um i think i think everyone was prepared for a yes or no but to get a uh the report is flawed um is really not good enough and a lot of people including everyone here on the screen and myself putting a lot of work for the boundaries commission and presented a really you know what we thought out and really thought about our arguments as did so many other people in the community and it just really leaves a bad taste in your mouth when it 's just like uh sorry it was flawed and you know the work that all the people in the southern region and in the northern region put in i want to acknowledge that and just say i i do empathize with um what you 've been through with that when you be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very grateful that this report 's come come together and um i am also acknowledging what 's happening gunning guy truman um you know just to jump in and say right we 're going with um 218 cc section section 218 section of the local government act proposal and ask immediately for uh d amalgamation now that 's been tried and just got a letter saying yeah not happy um i quite i 'm i 'm pleased that we 're trying to work out as we do in our council we might be a bit risk adverse but if we do it we do it well and we do it once to find out exactly what the term of reference are what the guidelines are to make sure that there is um a boundaries commission in place um there was one word i wouldn 't mind on adding in 3c the final on that on the finalization of the terms of reference the minister immediately import appoint independent commissioners that have the expertise to fill the role expected under the terms of reference and the reason i 'd like independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reason why it was flawed in the beginning because it was deemed that some of those uh some commissioners were um flawed so um yes once again thank you for letting this motion go forward thank you uh councillor ham uh councillor wright had his hand up for initially and then we 'll come to councillor wrestleman still on mute counselor right um yeah sorry uh thanks uh mr mayor um yeah i 'm with council ham you know i 'm so disappointedly disappointed that the government didn 't make a decision either for against them as we all know we didn 't stand we stood for council as a as a combined council um we didn 't necessarily agree with it to start off with but we stood as a combined council so we 've all we 've done has tried to do our best for all our communities but um you know you know the people who were one of the amalgamate has done a great job work really hard you 've gotta gotta really applaud them in lots of ways um shame they attacked some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah it 's really disappointing the government didn 't have the balls to make a decision they just left it hanging thank you councillor wright for your very forthright uh views uh councillor wrestling um if i may please mr mayor i i would like to have um the actual recommendation put on the screen because counselor um wright is unable to see that and i i wish to make some changes to the recommendation i think that the minister was fairly straightforward in her as her deliberation this is what i want this is where we go and i 'll have some boundary commission boundary um commission evaluations and guidelines set so i disagree with you for once bruce but still if i could just get recommendations on the screen if that 's a possibility counselor wrestleman would you would you like to move into uh in the committee for this and then i moved to committee please serve and council lacrosse is seconding that and do we have all an agreement yes we do okay so ceo can you put that on the screen and we might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary happening with that we 'll move on and mr man for the record mr mayor i 'd like to comment that i have a note on my screen that my internet like we 've lost councillor smith he 's back he 's back in there but i think his internet is unstable so we 'll just watch that as we go we might need to put another shilling in the meter um counselors i 've put up there there 's the change that um counselor uh ham suggested there with that independent word and the changes that um uh counselor isselman has discussed previously um if i may please mr b yes councillor simon yes i 've asked for the um um needs to be renumbered as i look at it as well it needs to be four and five i 've asked four and five to be merged into a very very simple and straightforward request the officer of local government finalize the guidelines i don 't think we need any more than that it 's important that as councillors right across new south wales we understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter thank you councillor and i think that says much the same as what has been underlined that 's correct so mr mayor the um after you 've finished your discussion you could ask the mover and seconder of the report which was hammond cross um whether they 're happy with those changes and if not we could move to it to an amendment motion okay um counselor yeah no i 'm happy with that castle cross yeah i 'm happy with that okay all right okay we might um move it but i can hear you right uh if i may uh please just ask for some more clarification on point c uh that on finalization of the terms of reference the minister immediately appoint independent commissioners um i understand that that might [Music] mean or that the intention of that might mean that it should not be people from local government background if that is the case i believe that should be pointed out specifically okay is that what we want councillors so can i ask the question please mr may what did um council ham mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and i i i maybe flippantly said it 'd be good if it was someone from england someone completely away from the local government system here because um it would be very hard not to have a bias but [Music] whether or not that 's possible i don 't know whether or not it 's um possible to have someone from another state um someone from uh a big council within the they did have someone from a big council in the city um there there has been discussions that one of the commissioners actually works for the minister of local government and if that was the case i i feel that 's almost a conflict of interest so i feel uncomfortable about that i feel uncomfortable about having a commissioner that is in a similar size and space as we are because to me they 're probably always going to support um what they 're used to so i i just want it to be balanced um i 'm not sure who 's to say that if you want an independent one that it shouldn 't be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your point there um i wouldn 't count any of the current members of the boundaries commission as independent as the mayor stated they 're counsellors um they 're experts in the office of local government however you could say that the chair is independent because he doesn 't have a local government background he does have an audit officer background if um i would think you would want to consider that word independent and and what that truly might mean it may mean that you get a group a panel that has actually no local government experience whatsoever if you were to use that word independent given given that the administrator was independent um i think we probably i would be happier to leave that word out and and go with the rest of what we 've got councilor pritchard you 're on mute still [Music] yes i think the more we debate it the more we keep it alive i just ignore the whole bloody thing like and just press on following that and do our job so so council ham i think we can get this over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay that 's what debate is all about sorry would you like me to reshare the screen again and so that you can see clearly what you 've got there uh i 'm i 'm pretty clear on it but yes i 'm happy for you to do that and and do we do we want to move out of you want to move out or not or do you want to look at it first let 's get on with it okay let 's put it to the vote let 's see who wants to move out so we 've got a mover counsellor this time and counsellor right all in favor that 's unanimous okay we 're out let 's put up when you share that now yes let 's let 's have one last look at it counselors you 're happy with that comfortable yeah put them put the motion all in favor all right i 'll just take that share off so that you can count the vote mr mayor i 'm just waiting on councillor pitcher i 'm not going to face with it okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got uh we 've got uh six four and uh castor pitcher is an abstention which is enough okay moving on counselors that brings me to brings us to 10.3 10.3 that 's correct mr man it 's on page 28 electronically page 25 on the paper copy ten point three yep okay operational plan for the fourth quarter report clever castle cross yeah mr mayor i 'd like to congratulate the team on putting this together 114 out of 119 actions and initiatives have been delivered which i think is against what we 've been through is a marvelous job but one thing i wanted to point out was that the project team sent through a breakdown of those projects and and by towns and by how much money was spent in each town as well as the costs per pop per head of population which gives us a really good picture of how much money went into different communities now my reason for bringing this up is because the save tumbarumba shire is always complaining about the fact that no money gets spent in in tumbarumba the projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune so i think it would be really good for us to be able to publish those breakdowns of costs for the communities so they could actually see what was spent in their areas so that they can see that this safety barumba shire really are using emotional tactics to prove a point i thank you council across i think worse than that is they 're using data that 's not correct yes making up data so if we give them the correct data um maybe they can get get their um comments correct in the paper and that would make me a lot happier yes and it would also inform the community exactly and and i did have some questions about the operational plan if nobody else has anything else to say sorry counselor hannah whether we should go into committee about the operational plan yep so you 're moving that way council ahab secondary council wrestleman all in favor you 've already guessed that too counselor pritchard are you voting for going into the committee not voting on it i think it 's just keeping things alive we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay so we 've got got six four and one abstention uh we 're into committee now so uh who 's speaking first kessler ham oh oh thank you sorry okay um i there 's just two things i want to talk about is 1.9.2 the development of new draft lep um now we 've got the reason the department of planning and environment advised not to proceed until rural land loose new study is complete i know there are people just hanging out to have this lep completed um so can would it be possible to have someone tell me exactly when this rural land use study is complete and why the necessity to wait for it and if we are waiting for it like is this going to be done this year this financial year or next year just a timeline on it i 'll ask mr halton uh through you mr mayor um i 'm trying to i can 't actually start my i can 't start my uh oh here we go oh thank you it seemed very dark in batlow there yeah through you mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a first draft is complete uh this document um looks at the the rural uh the available rural land uh and uh makes recommendations around what what zoning should be applied to those those areas and lot size and basically making recommendations um to bring um i guess the two municipalities in alignment in terms of the various uh rural zones and what you can and can 't do there um so this is an important document that will feed into the development of the lep and so to get the best lep we we could have gone down the track of just harmonizing the leps that we had but the um the planning department felt that it would be a great opportunity to do a thorough job on developing our laps our lep and actually addressing a range of issues including you know rural land use residential housing availability uh and a range of other concerns so the um we 're just we were just waiting on some finalized mapping to come through and we should have the rural land use study in our hands in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commence the lep uh the i guess a thorough robust um review and then development of a new lap so that rural land use study will that be current oh sorry mr if this is all right mr meant for you um would that be current given this covert move from the city to the bush and things like that it will be very up-to-date it 'll be absolutely contemporary with the um with what demand there is uh and and what the various uses could be so yes you 're right in that there is uh i guess a growing demand for larger uh residential lots in rural areas so large lot residential zones and they are considered within the context of the rural land use study but it also acknowledges that the mix of agricultural activity has changed within the municipality and there are a far more diverse range of agricultural and horticultural enterprises out there and they all have different needs for uh for land it 's not all about growing cattle sheep or things like that so the leps that we were working with were reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contemporary land use was in the rural area and the the new lep will also address some issues around the um the residential zones residential and industrial zones that we see and through you mr mayor if i could just also ask i hope they um really highlight um the bushfire risk within our area and you know and particularly with the planning of pines and having buffer zones and things like that i would really like to see that in there for you mr mayor that 's a thorough approach to the lep will pick up on any contemporary issues and any things that are being being sent down the line from the state government who are doing a lot a great deal of work from the planning department on uh bushfire and a bushfire prone areas so early people pick up on all of that so mr holton would it be possible to have a rush draft in front of us for the next workshop in september september workshop um i 'll take that one notice on notice and um i 'll uh yeah [Music] i could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete at that point in time but um we can bring what we have there 's there 's some interesting facts have emerged through the through the process okay thank you we 'll look forward to that thank you uh mr holton thank you council ham uh okay we 're still in committee council lacrosse yes a few little questions i wanted to ask about the operational plan um 1.9.3 we 're talking about the online portal that the state government has now put through for development applications and i just wondered how that was working if i could ask the director if it was making it easier for staff for clients to use or if it hasn 't even been used yet well mr halton thank you thank you through you mr mayor the the the portal the planning portal is currently in use it was mandated to um be used from the first of um first of july and um so it 's currently in use in this council we had been uh using the portal for quite some time but [Music] all da 's must be lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used extensively we have been granted some money from the state government to facilitate the use we we 've used we 've used that funding to get other software that will will enable us to do uh da assessment electronically we also used it to set up little kiosks uh in the council offices to assist people who need to access the portal when they they come in to lodge their da most professional planning consultants are familiar with how to use the portal but it 's a little bit different when people are determined to lodge the da on on behalf of themselves at currently because we haven 't quite got the ability to uh do the assessments online because of some technical issues that have arisen between our enterprise systems and the um and then and the portal itself um we it does create some administrative um uh burden in that um that all the da 's must be printed out assessed um in hard copy then scan back in onto the portal and uh that does create busy work that when we are able to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say that our planning team are still managing to keep the median days that it takes to get a da assessed at around 21 to 22 days which is a is is very very good the next one a question i wanted to ask was um 3.1.3 to get an idea of whether we are making any savings having replaced all the street lights with leds if i could ask the director to respond please mr mayor executive director of course through you mr mayor thank you very much for the question cancel across um yes the led changeout program has been completed and um we are realizing savings from that immediately um in in respect to that the energy costs are significantly less those savings are helping to fund the um the loan that we took out for the capital cost to change out the leds and we expect that that 'll run for about seven years to fully recoup that cross that cost and then we will be in the black in respect to the savings that 's wonderful news thank you and if i made two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i just talk about fogo and say everybody i see says it 's absolutely wonderful they just love it it 's just fantastic but is it having an impact a negative impact on operations for staff it 's taking i suppose through the implementation phase staff are making yeah a massive effort and very much stepping out of business as usual to make sure that it is successful and really appreciate your feedback on that it will settle down into into business as usual over over time from an operational perspective the pickup of the additional bin we purchased another truck as part of the part of the project and also employed another another driver for the vehicle so from that perspective we 're covered and uh yeah as as the rollout is finalized and things settle down a bit staff will be able to get back to back to normal back to business as usual fantastic effort by all staff involved cross-organisational approach you know with our customer service team our rates team our comms team and our waste team all working very well together to make sure this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green waste that you you pick up yeah so at the at the moment obviously the the green waste is separated through the uh through the fogo bin it goes to the transfer station gets sorted quickly to make sure there 's no issues with contamination and and that 's been a fantastic result as well we found contamination to be less than one percent which is amazing and really need to thank the community for that it then gets loaded into a bulky waste truck and gets transported to a licensed processing facility recognizing that we 're still in the process in the planning phase of getting our own facility set up here in snowy valleys in in the interim it 's going to another facility being processed as as as compost which which is fantastic in that that material is already now being kept out of landfill do we know what proportion is it is going it 's been kept out of landfill yet or is it early days it 's look it 's it 's still still early days and that we 're still doing you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest numbers i 've got about about 60 tonnes from what i understand has been diverted away from landfill already when fully implemented we 're hoping to capture as much as 30 to 40 of the waste drought that 's brilliant thank you councillors okay thanks council lacrosse councillor smith you heard a question uh not a question but a a comment i 'd like to comment that uh i think a very um important part of the success of the fogo or the rollout of the fogo program at this point in time is due to the presentation to all the schools in the area i 've had comments from members of the public that it was probably the highlight of the school year for some of the children who took part in that presentation and certainly having been present at those presentations in some of the schools myself to see the enthusiasm and the excitement of the kids in uh seeing that presentation uh was very worthwhile and they 've clearly gone home and told their parents all about fogo and what to do and what not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a strong part of the success of the role out of that program thank you council smith cast the prince chad you had something just uh if i could address it to paul horton please just about the lap could you tell us if there 's enough land available for building at the moment are we sure the build is short of land or went to hoffman so through you mr mayor uh look the current um land that is zoned for housing there is there is many many years supply of land that 's um currently zoned for housing um both uh like right across the municipality in um truman batlow adelong and uh and tumbarumba the issue is is that the owners of large portions of that land at this stage aren 't prepared to go to the expense or go through the process of developing it as such this may well be partly addressed through the development of a new lep because currently in tumut for example most of the land that 's some zoned residential is zoned r3 which is medium density residential now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density housing development and uh and in reality the market isn 't really uh isn 't there for medium density the market is probably more about general residential larger lots with with standalone [Music] three and four bedroom houses on it now you don 't have to develop median density on on medium density zoning but the message that our led is sending is that that 's what we 're looking for and um and we that 's one of the issues that we hope to address through the development of a new lep send the right messages to the development community and to the market that um the kind of latin residential land that people are looking for is the kind that we are going to zone thank you councillor right you 're on yet yeah i just want to add to what paul just said then about community land you know people who 've got to own the land and don 't want to develop it but of course um most of that land 's pretty good agricultural and with the prices of um of cattle and sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it for what it is only a comment thank you anything further counsellors can we move uh castle smith yes can i please comment on 4.4 customer service in general there are a number of points there um it 's one of the issues that was discussed in this council from the very beginning uh because there had been a you know a measure of dissatisfaction in the community with the responses that council staff had been giving and so on so there has been quite a strong um interest from council and i 'm also very pleased to say that there has been a strong response from council staff in the the way that they 've been responding um so i i wanted to just draw attention uh to the fact that the uh the uh community satisfaction survey was uh somewhat critical of this aspect but i wanted to also make a the point that in our operational plan this has been well and truly covered and that we are developing systems and that they are well underway to actually produce a much more uh efficient system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment from the director of that department to uh to give us some more specifics about that i 'll go straight to the ceo for this one thanks uh thanks very much uh mr mayor and uh councillor smith yes we 've had an improvement program going over a number of years we haven 't had a customer relation management system and that has applied across the whole local government area at the start but we now do have that system is aligned with our existing system and we have managed to employ a qualified staff member to assist in developing that system we are reporting through that system now and the results are quite good uh demonstrating that we 're meeting with within the service standard for the majority of our requests we are now as you lodge a quest you automatically get a number uh allocated that you can make contact with the customer service section and ask about your particular request and that system has further development to go at this point we did have quite a lot of work up front to clear up the nas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially complete now so significant progress and good reporting and getting good results for that now but still got a little while to go thank you ceo thank you councillor smith kessler ham um i 'd just like to make a comment on 5.5.2 and 5.5.1 being the um making note of the rail trail and um just the quarterly maintenance program completed i just have to compliment um well the rail trail group around tumbaruma that do so much work honor but having made a comment to council about some of the drainage near the bridges near the culverts just how quickly that was moved on in my thanks for that and i 'm delighted to see that we 've got the regional trails master plan is about to commence and that will give an overview of all rail trails i have a particularly passion to have the rail trail get down to humula going through hume shire and wagga city so i 'm just hoping that that gets added into the plan being that it 's a part of it most of it is outside of our council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain bike group are planning with mount tumbarum behind tumbarumba so i just told you that those two things get included in that last plan certainly thank you and given that it 's a regional master plan i 'm sure that that will be included in it ceo you had something to say yep uh mr mayor just to counsel a ham the regional trials master plan has been uh funded now uh we 're hoping to appoint a consultant later this year with that funding package we got from the state and that work will commence with the community early next year it is about regional trails so it is inside and outside our local government area and it 's about those linkages and it 's about all the different sorts of trails be they mountain biking road biking horse riding all those different components and we watched the community to become involved in that process and provide that information in there because that will actually set the agenda going forward and the state government departments have already indicated to us that they will look to that document to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future brilliant thank you thank you thank you council have can we move out of committee now councillor wright kessler ham all in favor okay that 's unanimous thank you so we 've got the any further comments on those recommendations i 'll put the recommendations all in favor it 's carried unanimously uh interim financial performance has on 30 june 2021 this is very early because yep castle ham councillor esselman castle ham um three mr mary if i 'd be able to talk to the cfo about a couple of things that i need some explanation about um the first one um you know in that second paragraph saying that the result is a 11 million dollar surplus or 907 k loss after capital um items i i get that and understand that but it 's only estimated and um we 're not to take that figure um as gospel at this stage i presume and then i 'll maybe talk to that first and then i 'll ask my second question okey-dokey thanks uh thank you council hamstring mr mayor um yes this is an interim report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still finalizing um our asset register and we have a number of grants yet to reconcile and also a number of operational expenditure to reconcile so yes it is definitely a very interim report okay so this is probably through you mr mayor um this is probably an interim question as well i i just look at what the year to date is compared to our original budget and i know it 's going through qbr since but like we 're right off like 70 million to 42 and it just concerns me that we are not for people that are going out and talking about suvs and things like that we we need to should we not be a lot closer with our budget so we we actually do know what monies we 've got or has this been distorted because of grants coming in post bushfire through you mr thank you council ham yes it has been distorted not just by bushfire funding and by a large amount of projects that were funded during the financial year we have adjusted each qbr a little further but in overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we anticipated the budget is a plan plans change during the year and that 's why we have qbi 's it 's still early days especially as we haven 't finalized the disaster recovery funding stream yet which was a large expenditure and obviously also a large income but there is many projects the entire program had to be rejected during the year because of all the funding we received so and through you mr mayor if i could just ask one i mean it works for us but to have other incomes being 14 million dollars but budgeted at 900. um and it 's not part of the grants what would that 14 million dollars be thank you so you mr mayor that is disaster recovery funding which is not considered to be a grant but um a refund for expenditure incurred thank you thank you castle cross you unmute counselor costs just a question for the cfo as well if if we look at the expenses in the pie chart the employee costs are still really really high and i was just wondering what the explanation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course is one of the items that were not reconciled at report writing date but partially due to the extreme amount of funding that we received and the many programs we had to deliver in addition to what was originally budgeted thank you makes sense thank you mr mayor if i may also add by comparison to other councils we run up quite a lot of day labour works so compared to say the city council we run a lot of services ourselves like our waste collection trucks we run a lot of services on behalf of the state or federal government like the multi-service outlet community transport and they all take employees so our employee numbers are quite high but that 's not unusual for a rural regional council because we tend to do that work ourselves which means that that money stays in our community so if we were to employ a contractor to do our waste collection for instance that money will go to wherever that that contractor is based so it is good to see that that money does return and recycle in our community that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you uh anything further councillors kessler ham sorry just a very quick update from the um director of infrastructure about the telbingo boat ramp pontoon and house house that developing along mr coy yes sir through you mr mayor thank you cancer councillor ham um yeah so they 're on site working as we speak preparing for the first round of concrete pours hopefully tomorrow if the weather is kind to us which will be fantastic the pontoons that will form part of the boat ramp delineating the boat area from the swimming area they 've been largely manufactured so they 're ready to go as well they 've been built in a factory and they 'll get installed on site once we can get the right water levels which is in the hands of snowy hydro yeah so um going well um given the um the impediments that we 've had had to deal with being wet weather high and high water levels thank you but in time for summer it 's great thank you anything further i think your counselors have put emotional in favor that 's unanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham thank you councillor smith counselor thanks mr mayor i 've had a look at these i 'm quite happy with what i see put the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you uh 10.6 review approval of 2020 2021 revotes council smith council lacrosse council smith anything comment uh mr mayor could we ask the chief financial officer to comment on the distinguishing features between carryovers and re-votes just so that yeah we can have that understanding thank you councillor smith thank you for you mr mayor a revolt is a project that has not been started and that we 're asking council to add to the current budget as in taking increasing the budget whereas a carry forward is a project that has started and we are contractually obligated to deliver while it gets added to the budget it doesn 't need to be approved by council because we have a contractual obligation thank you thank you any any further put the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you thank you cfo tumba rumba i 'm happy for councillor wright to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to i think it 's a great project i think i 'm so took for it and great to see the men 's shed really um you know expanding at such a great facility and so many people going along to it and being involved i think i really commend everybody to support this um and it 's a good area where it 's going it 's a nice area it 's plenty of room plenty of parking out of the road of everybody and and um you know it 's near the bench of the rail trail where they 've been doing a heck of a lot of work on the rail trail too so just a great great idea great great initiative by the men 's shed and i think it 's great that we can support it perfect thank you councillor cross just three instruments a question about how easy will it be for us or for the land to be moved over to the men 's shed for where they 're proposing their new shed because it 's crown lands and and i i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how quick it will be i 'm sorry i just lost uh i just lost contact then for a moment but i think that 's a a question for executive director through you mr mayor thanks for the question council across um great question i i don 't have an answer for it at this stage in that we 're finding that dealing with the crown can take some time and can be rather complex in saying that i i don 't see if the tubber men 's shed were successful in securing funding for their new facility there 'd be no reason why they couldn 't start work on that facility and get going and you know at the same time week we work through the the land arrangements with the with the crown so although that could take some time and and it requires some tuning and throwing i don 't see that as being a delay to the men 's shed getting on with it if they get their funding that 's really good news and what will happen to the old shed if not when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as as described there in recommendation six of the report we 'll be looking at um making that shed available to other community groups that might be able to benefit from it um and we 've already had one approach for that and would do that through an expressions of interest process and uh yeah assess that on benefit i suppose if there was no ongoing need for the shed we 'll then look at its its disposal but would much prefer to make it available to the community first if we can do that excellent thank you thank you thank you council cross anything further a councillor right still on mute storm i 'd just like to add that i think the men 's shed building existing one belongs to the tamborama community i think the community built it themselves it wasn 't a council i said it 's only on crown land that became council asset really um so really be great to see somebody in there for me to use it thank you okay put the emotional in favor that 's unanimous thank you draft snowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for public exhibition mover councillor ham council across comment i um i think this is something that you know it 's about children in all aspects of snowy valleys council the only thing that worries me is in the recommendation point four adopt the draft snorri valleys council safe organization policy um if no one 's commented i i i can see why that 's there but i 'm just wondering it 's just not something that i think is really good practice to get into because sometimes you get the policy back again and you re-read it it 's just unusual it 's not the normal way that a policy is presented normally it does come back to council for final tick off so yeah um mr mayor um councillor ham this is the way that we tend to do things it just creates a smoother administrative process as you know all of our policies can be reviewed at any time if it 's just an administrative minor changes then they can just happen automatically if they 're larger changes then there 's a bigger process around that but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any comments we take them on board if they 're just administrative it goes through and we 're adopted otherwise if there 's any changes suggested we come back to council but as councillors you can ask for that report to come back at any time and as staff if we believe that there 's been a change in the industry that we need to change some of the information in the report then we 'll bring back a suggestion for a change so it is a standard process but it 's aimed to decrease the administration and the more time that staff can spend um doing the work on the ground rather than just doing a reporting process thank you for that anything else council cross yes i really i appreciate this whole stuff followed this is mandated by the state government but i 'm just worried that it 's going to put a huge impulse on the staff and what kind of training they will need to undertake uh can can we have some reassurance about what the implications of this are forced for our child care centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these things it does come at a cost and um the uh these things are mandated and whilst the cost on each one of these things so we have the disability inclusion and access legislation we also have the need to develop and put in place a reconciliation reconciliation action plan and this one and they are all they are all really important things uh for um all organizations not just councils to um to to adopt and put forward it does create um extra administrative burden and it does create the need to provide training and working with children 's checks and and things like that and uh cumulatively the cost of compliance with state legislation and federal legislation uh does uh is quite is quite significant and that a fair amount of local government 's resources uh are generally uh put to that purpose the whole uh castle right i just i 'm just gonna make a comment on that it 's another case of the government 's cost shifting to local government isn 't it take that as a comment anything further counselor ham however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety we can put in to keep our children safe the better and a lot of these costs most of what 's in that policy has been in practice and has been part of the um what parents pay when they pay for child care throughout the whole of the country to in order to keep children safe and that 's what we should do mr mayor may also know that this isn 't just about the children 's services this is about the whole organization so there 's a responsibility in these documents for every employee and every councillor and every volunteer in absolutely every activity we do to make sure that we are protecting the safety of children in our our community thank you okay let 's put the motion oh let 's council across before we do so last word having said that matt um does that mean then that we have to undertake some kind of training as well um through the mayor that 's correct council across so the staff in mr holton 's area are currently evaluating how we run those programs but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy is adopted and the frameworks adopted about how we implement all those changes and make sure that all of our staff are aware and aware of what they can do and how they do referrals and any issues of concern that they might have what their duty of care is around that does that then mean that we all have to have a working with children check and a police check not necessarily no mr holton would you sorry mr may if mr holton would like to add to that you 're okay um yes some councils have have elected some councils in australia have elected to uh ensure that every every person uh involved with the council from the councillors through to all frontline staff uh undertake working with children checks and uh this is the case um uh in a couple of councils that i 've worked in in other locations and is that at a cost of 80 dollars per person it is through you uh mayor or in response to your question um in some cases that uh that cost is met by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i were to uh to start working in another council and i was and i would be required to have a working with children 's check i would have to have that before i started work so i would bear the cost of that but in general uh where you know the the legislation or the policy has changed uh to require working with children check it would be borne by the individuals who are already working there thank you so that would be that 'd be close to twenty thousand dollars for our organization if that was the case okay moving on did let 's put the motion all in favor that 's unanimous thank you councillors this brings us to 11.3 and as i mentioned earlier i have uh with 2b i have a pecuniary interest so can we address everything in that recommendation and leave to be out or not to be maybe yes so so we 'll put the so i 'm asking for somebody to move the recommendation excluding 2b so i 've got councillor cross and councillor pritchard that 's lacrosse gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in their applications it 's great that we can still offer these community grants because i know that not all councils do uh my one of my questions is around the unsuccessful applicants and whether they 'll be sent an individual letter outlining why they were unsuccessful and suggestions as to how or who they could approach to get their grants over the line because some of the grants that we weren 't able to uh to um fund were really really good and it would be great to see them be successful in another way in another forum okay miss jones um thank you through you mr mayor thank you council across just in response to the first part of your question all applicants whether they 're successful or unsuccessful will be contacted individually and the offer will be made to discuss um the content of unsuccessful applications as to the reasons why they were deemed ineligible or didn 't make the grade in relation to support generally for grant applications that 's available all the time through a variety of teams inside of svc first point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program manager who deals with these grants specifically would also be able to provide that level of support but as always the best uh the best direction is to the info at or the 1300 number sorry counselors that was a technical glitch it 's all right when 's your next review now where are we just so yeah yeah that 's all right as long as that 's why you 're not the president of the united states now moving on where are we up to i was hearing about the grants oh thank you yes miss josh where did we get cut off council across um you were talking about that there was always support available for uh foreign for the viewers at home they would have got this already um it 's generally through the place activation team as a first point of call for community groups and support is provided through the program manager in the office of the ceo as well but for councillors please direct all of your enquiries that you get around this straight to the 1300 number or info at svc and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you thank you council cross thank you shelley okay so any other comments on that will i put the motion pawn favor get carried okay i will move to the breakout room and hand over to councillor ham i will start the breakout room now rather than trying to be efficient just send me i 'm going to attempt to do that uh [Music] we like you here jane i 'm still here sorry this is hence why i was trying to get ahead of this before pretty slow buddy couldn 't he just leave his room he 's gone he 's gone um thank you councillors for allowing me to chair this part um so it 's recommendation 2c that we endorse avalon enterprise for ten thousand dollars to to be or not to be what did i say anyway um so do i have everyone 's support for that i need a mover and a second or first so who would like to move that counselor right and counsel across all in favor all in favour unanimously yes thank you i will close that room now bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably gone for a break back uh mr mayor um councillor ham has uh carried out uh the vote on that matter um and uh that matter has been accepted uh at along enterprises for ten thousand dollars thank you councillor han thank you councillor ham okay moving on the uh minutes of the aboriginal liaison committee meeting over charleston pritchard secondary council lacrosse any comment council richard just to endorse the recommendation from that committee meeting which is uh on the 16th of june there was another meeting yesterday which is relevant but obviously we don 't have the minutes for it but just comment on it that meeting in june was um face-to-face and yesterday was by zoom the zoom meeting which is highly successful it was quite extraordinary because everyone could speak to each other have a look on disagreements and so forth it was the previous one was a sweet interface some of the people they weren 't used to meetings and didn 't speak out but the other thing is that one of the apart from the distances involved to get people together one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for her to come across the media it wouldn 't have been six hours or something like that so they 're very enthusiastic and would like to move zoom meetings in in the future as far as there 's just one other small point and that is that they 're complaining that uh yesterday they 're complaining they don 't have a place in tumbaruma which they can call home and i was wondering whether that old man 's shed would be suitable for them or were there something else and maybe somebody could talk to the aboriginal liaison committee or i think from a meeting point of view a place they could fall down but the old man should be big enough bruce cass castle i reckon to be plenty big enough to be quite old but um yeah probably a good location the other one is the um is that place up near the wildest cottages it 's a building up there that 's never been used as far as i know i think i think the opportunity is there for them to put forward an expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can somebody that timber ever talks to talk to them yep please yeah yeah yes we 'll do thank you for the czech renova runner expression of interest process for that building and i think we have a resolution on the books um about the walters cottage area for um the tumbarumba aboriginal people there so i could dig that up and circulate that to councillors thank you okay thank you uh councillor cross yes look this is not directly related to the community [Music] we know that 60 to 69 of the of the indigenous population out of brungal have been vaccinated now i would really like to know who was responsible for vaccinating them whether it was roof med or another organization i know i hope that we can find out please can we take that on notice and get get an answer back to you as soon as we can yes that 'd be great thank you thank you thank you councillor christian good question lucky you 're all out today thank you yeah pleasure i apologize for my dog sparking interrupting hey i thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor that 's carried unanimously thank you let 's move on to the minutes of the audit risk and improvement committee that 'll take the smile off your face um castle across moving that way do i have a seconder thank you councillor ham councillor cross yes it was a really interesting meeting this one the the committee looked at all of the operations of council and were very happy with everything that 's happening for me what was really important was the telstra cyber security report that was brought to council and we got a really good report card for that with 96 compliance ratings so uh the audit committee was very very happy with all of that thank you council costs anything further i 'll put the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously moving on to disability inclusion access reference group mover council across secondary essentially thank you anything from there yes just to let you know that the diag is is developing a survey to assess the community 's experiences regarding access to venues and whether the disabilities and additional needs people additional needs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activation officer the events activation officer come and attend and he discussed a platform called humanities which is a ticketing platform for people with disabilities who can connect with the event prior to it happening to make sure or just to find out what kind of facilities are going to be available at that event thank you thank you council cross anything further all in favor of that motion we 've carried unanimously 2.3 moving on to 12.4 glenroy heritage reserve committee mover councillor smith seconder council bright council smith yes i attended this meeting on behalf of councillor ham who 's the regular counselor um representative on that committee um two things that i just want to mention on the recommendations at 0.3 endorse the nominations of the following committee members i note that the treasurer is not mentioned on that report and i 'm just wondering why that is um the the two the president and the secretary are noted there as interim president and interim secretary the reason for that is that there just are not enough people on that committee to take up these positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working very hard for for many years on that committee and they do an incredibly important job for that facility which is a a great credit to the tambaramba community and a great attraction to the tambaramba community and it is really important as far as our snowy valleys council tourism uh program is concerned so i just want to highlight the fact that those people need extra support they need new members for their committee to be able to take up these positions and to help steer that facility forward into the future um and i 'm just recommending that if it is possible for council to in some way have a recruitment drive um to to gain new members for that committee that would be a very important thing for us to do thank you councillor said i will i will note that the um treasurer is mentioned in the body of the minutes and we 're asked to receive the report minutes so in in that way we 're accepting that uh anything further any other counselors i 'll put the motion all in favor carrie thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 25th of july castle again yep and kessler ham anything further to add no that was on the side just my my thanks to councillor smith for filling in for me on that day and and i um support all your comments um it is a tremendous tremendous asset to snowy valley 's council so let 's hope we can get some more people in it okay all in favor unanimous thank you uh term the recreation reserve committee luther councillor hamm councillor esselman castle ham anything to add um i was unable to be there on that day but i am part of the email loop of just how pleased they were to be getting the funding um for the two majin khana and uh just wondering whether the director of infrastructure knows anything about the options for commencement of the project for the outdoor area i presume that 's the veranda going along the front and the secure storage um whether um he is able to tell us what 's going to be happening with that mr caution through you mr mayor thank you councillor hand very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that we 've had a look at the drawings and working working through glenn with the with the committee in how we can help out um with the application of funding and trying to progress that so i 'll be yeah we 'll we 'll work with the with the group and see how how we can help because it 's a it 's it 's it 's a um they 've got to go through council because they 've got quite a lot of bushfire money there now that um but they 've got to go through council if they 're going to do these modifications yeah would we 'd like them to come through council yes correct yep yeah so even though that they might be funded and we want to undertake the delivery of the works we 'd still like to be involved in that in that process thank you okay anything further all in favor unanimous thank you uh let 's turn the recreation reserve river in a regional library advisory committee meeting council lacrosse councillor wrestleman council lacrosse yes uh the uh at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the biggest issue facing the river in a regional library uh organization is the fact that waga city council which is the executive council for the committee has indicated that they wish to leave the committee so that leaves quite a bit of a financial gap for us to for other councils there are currently 10 member councils but at the meeting they all uh endorsed remaining within the the river in a regional library organization because there are so many benefits to it but it would just need to be looked at how how it 's managed if with wagga city council does withdraw because there will need to be a new executive council appointed uh it 's not probably something that snowy valleys can do even though we 've got the most libraries within the region uh given the fact that we are we have other commitments as well so that will go out be called on for expressions of interest uh we um but and one of the ways to look at how we can grow committee is to look at other councils within the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well thank you councillor cross anything further councillors thank you for that summation council across uh put the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously councillors that that concludes the uh ordinary section of the uh council meeting can i have a move in a second and move into confidential and can also before we do that can i also ask that councillors are able to confirm if they 're in a location where no one else can hear or see or view the session you 're in so everybody do that yep thank you that 's good okay move in a second move into confidential that 's councillor smith and councillor cross all in favor unanimous thank you thank you councils will now move into confidential my dog is joining us i hope you don 't mind like the cat 's left me the cat is left my cat 's just um [Music] you"

    "text": "this video has been produced to support community engagement about the rate options study for snowy valleys council it 's part of a series as shown on your screen and i 'd encourage you to start with the introduction video as this provides the background and context for what i 'll go through specifically in relation to farmland for this video as a starting point i look at the current rating structure that 's in place for farmland in each of the former councils in turmerit like each of the categories there 's a 540 minimum rate that applies and the rates above that threshold of about a hundred thousand dollars are determined on the ad valorem which is the rate in the dollar which goes up with the value of your property in the form of tumblr ambershire there 's again a base rate in place but unlike residential where uh 50 of the overall rate revenues come from the base rate here only five percent of the revenues come from the base and 95 percent from the ad valorem rate so in other words most of the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes sense with farmland where there 's a big gap between high and low value land so comparing the current rating structure side by side you can see that rates in turmeric are higher across all of the property values the chart that i 've added at the bottom shows the distribution of property values in turmeric and you can see that the majority about 75 percent of them are valued under 400 000 but it 's worth noting that there are about 10 of properties that are actually off the end of this scale over 750 thousand dollars and if we then overlay the property values in the form of humber umber show you can see that there 's a fairly even distribution which was different from residential where the average property values in turnaround were lower than those in tune it 's important to note that this is looking at the value of particular farming properties but it 's it 's also worth noting that on a dollars per hectare basis there 's not a considerable difference between the two former councils so looking at option a for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it starts off from the same point as the red line the current rating system in tumblr because tumblr 's rates currently are a five percent base rate and uh about 95 bucks and when you 're looking at the higher end of property values the green line is landing somewhere in the middle of the two rating structures at the moment when they come together so the blue line that i 've added below shows the impacts of this option on ratepayers in the form of tumor shire down the lower end of property values with the elimination of the minimum rate there 's some considerable savings for uh rate payers and turmeric there 's a group around a hundred thousand dollars that would see a slight increase of about five percent under this option and at the higher end of property values there 'd be a saving approaching around 10 when we now look at the red line which shows the impacts on farmland ratepayers in the form of tumblrshire and see it 's fairly flat which means the the impacts are fairly consistent in percentage terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase for all those properties moving on to option b which is shown as the purple line the higher base rate is pushing up the bottom end slightly this also has the effect of reducing rates at the higher end of the property values slightly and when we look at the impacts of this option on ratepayers in the form of two machinery we can see that the savings for those currently on the minimum are slightly reduced there 's a larger group in the middle around 100 dollar mark who are paying uh a bit more and and that is getting up to around 20 for some people while at the higher end of the property values uh there is some larger savings moving on to the impact of this option on ratepayers in the form of tumbleshower you can see that the higher base rate is pushing up the increases for the lower property values in tumbaramba vary significantly in percentage terms around 50 for some properties but in dollar terms the increase is about a hundred dollars a year and even with this increase the the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the rate payers in turmeric that are currently on the minimum which is five hundred and forty dollars what this option also does is just pushes down the rate slightly at the higher end of the scale so as with residential this is the key question when we 're trying to determine what is the fairest rating structure because having a slightly higher base rate does mean that everyone pays a bit more of a contribution towards the cost of the services that they enjoy it 's worth noting that a 10 base rate is not high compared to other councils there are a few that are around the seven percent mark but there 's plenty that are higher as well moving on to option c for farmland a 15 base rate again this is not out of step with other councils there 's still a number of that that are higher and a number that are lower it 's sort of still middle range we can see that it 's uh just magnifying slightly the the impacts that we saw under option b it 's important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant in percentage times particularly in tumbarumba but also for a group in tumor around the 100 000 mark but in dollar times it 's around the uh the current 540 dollar minimum that 's in place in turmeric now this option also pushes down the rates slightly more at the higher end of the scale which means everyone 's making a bit more of a contribution towards the cost of the services they enjoy so comparing the three options side by side option a is a five percent base rate and that 's what 's in place in tumbarumba now which is why there 's a fairly consistent increase of about nine percent across the board for all tumbarumba farmland ratepayers and under this option those currently on the minimum rate in turmeric pay significantly less and those at the higher end see savings of 5 to 10 option b increases the base rate to 10 or about 190 a year and that has the effect of flattening out the rates a bit increasing them at the lower end of values and decreasing them at the higher end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms for lower value properties in tumbarumba the increase in dollar times is less they 'd be paying an extra hundred dollars a year but that 's still 60 odd dollars a year less than the 540 minimum paid by ratepayers with the same value properties in turmeric at the moment and finally option c increases the base rate up to 15 or about 285 dollars a year and this results in larger increases in rates for farms at the lower end of property values in tumbarumba bringing them up to somewhere around the 540 minimum that 's paid in on similar valued properties in turmeric at the moment and it also results in increases of around 30 percent for farms in turmeric around the 100 000 mark so thanks for taking the time to watch this video and hear a bit more about the raid options for farmland and snowy valleys council and i 'd encourage you again to complete the survey and check out the other information available the link shown on your screen"

uh it 's being recorded anyway uh a big welcome and my name is stephen bunting i work for a company called morrison low and it 's a bit unfortunate we 're actually meeting by online means tonight but unfortunately covert has done that to us and we would like to be talking to you face to face uh but that 's not possible um anyway just before we start i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of land and pay their respects to elders past in prison um and uh anyway i 'm sure you 're all wondering who morris and lower we are local government focused management consultancy with expertise in helping councils address uh various sustainability challenges we 've been around new south wales for about 20 odd years and helped councils from some of the large metros to some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems as much as we can before any need for an srv official recreation or then helping them once they 've needed to apply for one we 're helping uh the snowy valleys council by independently reviewing their financial position and then modeling some options that might close the financial gap for them to become more sustainable um purpose of um so we 're actually facilitating these meetings and then they 're really a first step and quite a leaky multi-step process um that council is going through to look at various options to close the gap and i 'll go through that process at the end of the end of the session the session 's about 40 minutes long so it does take a little while um and it 's really a chance to reinform you the community members around what some of these key issues are that councils is facing and hopefully enable you to be more informed about um what those are and why they have occurred and what solutions are so that you can express your views on what what you would like to see happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off muted with video off so attendance is largely anonymous um it 's really just for to manage the background noise as much as possible um so yeah if you want to um adjust the size of your presentation if you haven 't found it by now there is a view option or speaker view um and you can adjust the size there if you can wait until the presentation is completed for asking any questions i know that 's sometimes difficult um but it just may be that some of the questions might be answered through long presentation um so if you do want to capture a question um straight away then you can use the check chat function uh on your screen to be able to write them uh right in the chat box and then you can do it at any stage um or you can raise a virtual hand uh that 's also an option there and that will flag that you would like to ask a question later on or you can text your question to the number on the screen oh four one eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that down if you want to use that number that 's oh four one eight one two four four three seven it 'll come back up at the end anyway um now just to let you know that um our knowledge or my knowledge in particular of the snowy valley 's community is is rather limited our work has really been around and analyzing the financial information uh of council um so you may have questions that are more related to operational issues with council planning issues or um or something that might have been bothering you we 'll endeavor to capture those um but i won 't potentially be able to answer them so we 'll capture them and we 'll make sure that they 're either unresponsive either posted on council 's website or uh if anyone 's left their email address and we 'll um message them directly there is an option which would be likely to do it near the end of the presentation and that 's to participate in a series of polls on some of the kind of key issues that council is facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these polls are non-binding and obviously they 'll be forwarded through the council to help them with their decision-making process um the the meeting will cover our summary this is mauricion lowe 's assessment council 's financial sustainability challenges the current situation some of the backgrounds are the problems um options that council has uh the srv proceeds itself and what the next steps are will be um there is a lot more information available on council 's websites and background papers and and more information on the process just want to make sure that we all know this is needed uh meetings not about a few things it 's not about the merger or the merger i know it 's quite a significant topic for the community down there but that process is a separate one it 's currently for the minister it 's not about that community strategic planning process which councils are currently going through they 're seeking your feedback on the strategic direction of the community so it 's not about that um and it 's not about setting the work program for next year we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring back ideas for council it 's uh really around just being informing you and the last thing is it 's not about making a decision it 's really to give council as much information as it can about what the community is feeling um so that it can make an important decision and then at some point during the year um come back out to you with some of the more famous solutions then um are here tonight um i guess the real issue uh um that 's facing councilwoman and that 's what all this information is all about is this whole balancing expenditure and service levels so i mean the the amount the quant the quantity the quality and the frequency of services delivered to the community really dictates the level of expenditure councils um required to set aside and that in turn dictates or influences the rates that you pay and the charges levy for different services so the whole purpose about this process is really try and get a really a good understanding about that balance between expenditure and service levels just to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be financially sustainable the local government act requires councils to apply uh financial meds and financial management principles so that 's included a fully funded operating position uh sufficient cash reserves appropriately funded capital program maintenance asset base and adequate resources to meet ongoing compliance obligations that 's not negotiable councils who fail to do that uh will uh will cause um new zealand new south wales office of local government intervention and they can demand in a few different ways but there 's usually a stage process that goes through to try and get councils uh to solve their funding problems uh the other thing i just like to sort of discuss it 's often a bit of a misnomer that um when we 've done these sort of workshops before and the community there is a perception that um rates are a fee for service so that you pay rates based on getting a level of service they 're actually more akin to a tax based on land value where land value is used as a proxy for wealth much like income tax or income as income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community costs based on that land value or proportional land value to fund some of those community services that everyone needs or to make the place that makes very valuable is a desirable place to live so it 's not meant to be a you know services but it 's more of a a tax or a more equitable distribution of costs based on land value as a proxy and that doesn 't mean that everyone has different uh different views on how services should be charged because they have different access to services but that 's a really selling point for any council to um to balance that um with those challenges so one about council 's current position i 'm sure you 've um all heard about this um you may have read about it in our long-term financial plan firstly this this process we 're talking about tonight is only dealing with general fund rates uh there 's two types of funds the consolidated fund and the general fund consolidated fund funds not only the general fund which is general operations but also fund some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 're really only just dealing with the general fund which over the last two years as opposed to the net operating deficit of about 7.7 million uh two years ago and last year 2.9 million one of the challenges for snowy valleys is that uh its general rates only contribute about 18 of the total general fund rate which is much lower than comparable councils and again this is that 's on the website if you need to have a look at that also um we noted that um there 's other independent analysis by deloitte 's confirming the situation that council is in and that 's the council doesn 't need a combination of grants so the increased fees and charges and expenses because to be sustainable uh and our analysis marginal loans analysis is that over the next 10 years that funding gap is an order of 45 million or about 4.5 million a year um if we were to have uh a one-off funding injection tomorrow it would need to be equate to around about 37 uh increase to um remove that gap altogether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where it currently is um on an ongoing basis out to that 45 million and year 2030 31. why is this occurred uh it 's occurred for a number of reasons actually more than six years there but um the main one really well not the main one but one of the ones is rate capping and rate capping does tend to cause a problem over time because traditionally rates are kept at less than the annual cost increases the council faces and i 'll show you some information a little bit later about what those numbers look like and why that problem is uh causing so much concern where it causes so much concern the other thing is really around some cost shifting and increased compliance and one example is the emergency services levy which in uh 2020 21 that levy used to be in your um insurances by the way but it 's been shifted into your rates uh it was 748 000 on uh the smelly valley communities and that was about eight cent rates councils also lost two um two srvs uh that ceased last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's identified that since about 2016 it 's actually added new services or increased service levels or increased services that have cost an additional 1.6 million dollars over and above what it was in about 2016. the other interesting thing uh and it 's a bit of a two-week sword is the new assets council 's um uh been building uh those new assets that 19.2 million dollars worth has come by way of grant funding so that the capital cost itself hasn 't cost the council endlessly but the ongoing depreciation maintenance and renewal costs of those assets does amount add additional costs and because um the council 's added 19.2 million dollars more than normal it means it 's added another 460 thousand dollars to its operating costs above normal obviously with um with the current climate it 's lost income from investments and the other thing we 've noted when we were reviewing councils um services is that snowy those communities quite fortunate in that such it has such a broad breed of services that are offered everything from you know aged care to community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't find in a lot of regional communities the problem without the problem the challenge with having those services while they 're great is that they do increase the back of house costs that councils have to provide to support those services and then exposes council to a bigger risk of service cost changes um council from air analysis hasn 't been just sitting there doing nothing over the last few years it has committed to making efficiency gains it 's a thousand dollars um over the next three years it has moved from a cyclic maintenance program to a condition based maintenance program so rather than just doing it on a cycle basis it does it now when it 's needed it 's um reviewed and adopted sustainability plan that it 's implementing to use its resources more efficiently and you will have noted from the last long-term financial plan that it 's recognized that this alone or these loans things aren 't enough or that 's sufficient and it 's starting this engagement process around so what can we do about it uh there is an srv option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're talking about tonight um just to explain the special rate variation process because obviously that 's one of the cornerstones of the solutions the special rate variations are a government 's preferred solution when councils need a rate increase above the rate um and they 're not necessarily bad i think there 's a misconception about special rate variations out there in the community they 're just something that councils are required to do apply for from time to time they 're a good thing from a point of view of community because what it does is it encourages the councils to minimize costs and stick within that um that rate peg amount but over time as the rate pay exceeds uh or it is the cost that see the rate there get stretches and stretches further until i put that reaches a point where it can no longer um sustain the sense of hairs without the risks associated with them uh you can see down below that graph down below shows you the principal problem is the rate gap there 's a red line there if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the local government cost index is the the basket of goods much like the cpi the council uses so it uses more bitumen and fuel than free veg you 've got the local government award movement there which is again higher and the emergency service is levy as a percentage of rates so you can see that um generally as a rule the costs uh the council incur um sit above that red line with the exception of last year 's and one of the first times it hasn 't um but we 've noted there that i love a lot of that was because the rate cap was increased to allow for some of the emergency services living but anyway there are two types of srvs council comply for was the temporary one which is what humid had and then it allows you to fund temporary problems like uh upgrading the facilities fixing infrastructure back blogs or things like that and they generally expire after their problem solved um the problem that um snowy valleys has is as much more long-term measures with a 45 million hole over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains in the rating base to fund that uh operation um you can see here what um the cumulative effect of those costs do um so and that 's what i was meaning before when you look at the rate pigs sitting along the bottom there you look at what those operational cost increases i had on the previous slide were and then you take that 460 odd thousand new assets costs are increasing so they 're all all new costs for councils facing and then year on year you actually you start to build the cumulative gap for what those what 's happening there and the cumulative gap um is getting larger and larger and larger and that 's essentially why um councils find themselves in the problem after a while it 's not just physically are unable to make savings needed to um to address that um council 's current srv um has a uh has a scenario in it that is proposing to fund the financial gap through an srv um that that was without the community for feedback the community preferred an srv option to uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate and infrastructure that scenario talks about the pathway balanced budget of increasing rates um of a compounded amount of 25.44 over two years and doing some minor or some smaller expenditure gains and cost savings but after we 've reviewed the ltfp and allowing for the impact of the new grants that council has been successful in getting the 14 million dollars for the pools that ken coburn tumit and batalo and the new emergency evacuation center that 's really added a whole lot more cost into the um into the council 's cost structure or will when they 're completed so that 's really now it means that the council needs to look at an srv of about 32.25 percent over two years to actually get back to that break even uh brief break-even number so we 've morrison most looked at a few options um in conjunction with council we have come up with uh a range of things with there 's a few things we 've looked at that don 't really make a lot of sense to possibly do nothing we 've talked about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and that 's always not the greatest thing when it comes to cost cutting you can sell more assets uh and invest the money but unfortunately the business aren 't really going to return anything or you can rely on potential council to rely on increased operating grants um their account the state government is pretty stressed at the moment with a lot of things with bushfires covered and has redirected a lot of its funding into those um those programs uh and i know there 's lot about lot of councils out there would love to get more operational grant funding but it 's really pretty much a long shot um so i wouldn 't recommended relying on that so anyway we 've proposed um three options uh and they are options of the next srv or special recreation amount and then a series of things what we call we 're called closing the gap savings and these are things such as asset rationalization which is the sales transfer or disposal of assets reducing service levels transferring or seizing services that 's always an option increasing fees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some lend themselves to making more savings than others um so it really probably needs to be a balance and we 're going to go through another process here we 're going to try and i 'm trying to take you through what some of those might mean um here 's what uh we 've we 've suggested was just these three options one is um not proposing any closure in the gap savings but assuming that council or uh banking that uh six hundred thousand dollars product so if you 're saving that council 's planning over three years um that would leave you with that 32.25 percent compounded srv which is approximately 15 percent one year and 15 the next year um that remains in the rating structure option b is that six hundred thousand dollars worth of um productivity savings then another seven hundred thousand dollars worth of those closing the gap savings a combination of those savings over over three years and that would leave um council will leave the community with having to uh or an srb of 12.5 percent in the first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c um still has those six hundred thousand dollars worth of productivity savings but but a lot more of those in the gap savings it needs to find about 1.7 million dollars over three years to reduce the srv round down to around 7.5 percent next year and seven and then 7.5 percent the year after so they 're they 're the real challenges based on customers so um those options could look something like this um you can see here when we 've used a different portion of those different clues from the gap measures you can see option a b and c all have productivity savings um b and c then have varying amounts of asset rationalization changes in service levels uh reduce services and increase fees and charges um so i 'll take you through each of them and individually and then um i would really like if you uh can when you reach the end of this one each one to just tell me um i 'll give you some feedback through a brief poll about you know how you feel about these options um so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 9.7 million dollars of building assets that are either underutilized non-core or redundant that doesn 't mean they 're not being utilized used but they 're not as important as they uh could be or not as important for council ownership they 're things like um the can coven store roth corner medical centre which could be sold and still be delivered by someone privately there are other things that could be um either closed or handed back to government or handed to volunteer groups and there 's a range of things that council identified in that 9.7 million dollars from the rumba um basketball stadium to the tuna boys club to the museum to the neighborhood centers and things like that so there 's a range of different options in there none of these have been decided uh and what we 're trying to do is just say well is is sale or rationalization in some ways it 's a good option um as i mentioned council spends around 4.5 of building values on depreciation and maintenance it 's a bit higher for buildings than this but roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could save around 437 thousand dollars effort if it disposed of or rationalized all that 9.7 million dollars for the assets but under option there we 've suggested or included that council would sell half those assets so that 's around 220 million a 220 000 saving and under option c uh they would sell three quarters of its assets um uh under utilize the redundant assets and save around 330 000 um so uh that what that looks like when we take it back to um those options b and c that shot asset rationalization component of option b that 700 000 would be that 220 000 it 's just half the assets on that list and uh 330 000 um in the 1.7 million dollars so i 'm just going to ask you a little poll a little question here um my co-host michelle will bring that up on the screen um as you can see there it 's it 's asking on a scale of one to five how important is to you for council to maintain the current range of assets it provides one not important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't mind i 'd appreciate if you would like larger poles there where you think it sits in your um in your views and we 'll share those results later on or after we 're finished there um a couple of people voted is there anyone else wants for a few more i 'll give you another five or ten seconds if anyone else wants to participate okay we 've got a small number in there so we 'll we 'll end the polling and michelle will show you the results um so uh so on a scale how important does the council maintain them and there 's a view from at least two other people here that um it 's not very important at all while um uh you know someone else had a much stronger view that 's important to maintain at least most of them i would suggest um okay so we 'll move on to the next one uh and that is um uh the you can pop back in here that 's that 's changing service levels um so currently um there 's a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd like to talk about tonight is particularly the one around changing hours of operation currently council 's customer contact centres really are customers customer centers community services libraries vic are open a combined 380 hours per week and there are a number of other regular seasonal season services such as swimming pools that potentially could be reduced it costs around a hundred dollars an hour to keep these depending on what service but to keep these services open and accessible to the community um but there are other things council could you know choose to do to reduce service levels someone will be unpopular but or or have a significant impact but you could do things like reduce the frequency of mowing reduce immunity cleaning or even rosemary and activities such as grading go to a different frequency or a different cycle of those kind of activities a long cycle between them so um we 're going to use that example of changing current service levels by reducing hours as a as a sample for to get your impression on under option b um if we reduce uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um thirty thousand dollars per annum and under option c uh if we reduced it by twelve hours a week we would say uh six sixty thousand dollars per annum so you can see in terms of the contribution there to um uh option b and option c into in terms of closing the gap savings they don 't make a significant amount so six hours on option b and um and 12 hours in option uh c so um not a significant amount but you would have to close it by quite a large amount to actually get a larger number there so can i ask um i 'll get the show to put up the same um poll and ask you to have your thoughts on how important is it for for you for council to maintain current levels of service is it not important at all that 's a one or is it very important to survive or is it somewhere in between anyone else want to participate here okay okay we 're only a small number so we will um we 'll share the results and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not as important to maintain those current levels of service although it 's it 's uh there 's one person who thinks again it 's really important to do that that 's great thank you very much they uh the next one obviously or next one obviously but the next one is um ceasing or transferring services this is a bit of a tricky one because under this one this is really um the one where that the most opportunity lies and it 's and it 's a chance for council uh if it closes or stopped services either to pass the services on to back the government pass the services back to the community in terms of volunteers or um perfect private operators so if it was going to return the swimming pools to a private operator or lease them out or or lease out some of its facilities or some of its activities and hand them back to the community or stop more together so essentially but it basically means the council would no longer fund those services that 's the bottom line doesn 't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered the exit of those non-core services that council 's not obliged to provide i know they 're quite highly valued in the community and there will be certainly individuals with the community that would be severely affected if they were they were changed drastically but a lot of those are community service activities um things like um and things like community grants and donations council currently um gives out about uh about a quarter million dollars in grants and donations spends about 520 000 on community development spends another 600 thousand dollars on economic affairs and events and promotions etc so there 's quite a large amount of money there and other things like collingwood where operates five swimming pools which costs the community around one one million dollars a year so currently council spends around about 2.5 million dollars a year of general rate money that 's net of any income it receives delivering these discretionary services that potentially could be transferred or closed so obviously ceasing 20 of those would close the gap by about 500 000 and and this option we 've talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars worth of services to transfer or close or um or hand back the government and under option fee um a much larger amount about 1.3 million with the services to reach that 1.7 uh million dollar target so again you know if you if you had if you went down the path with this option you would need something like seven hundred thousand dollars where the savings option be of which you could make up 400 000 with a reduced services um and an option c um 1.2 of that 1.7 million but you still need those rate increases as well to close that financial gap so can i ask you what your thoughts are again on importance um around those particular um particular closing the gap options for reducing services so i 'll get the shelf to put up the poll and here it is yep so on a scale of again one to five how important is it to the council to provide the current range of services one not important at all and five very important okay so we 've only got a few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it share the results and um yeah the majority of people um are reasonably open to or you know see that there is potential to close we 'll change some of those services so that 's good obviously there 's a bit of a balance there and council will need to come back to just planning to come back to the community once it 's made a decision on what the best solution is the feedback uh okay so the next and last one is uh user fees and charges um this one only impacts the users of facilities and services um obviously offsets the general rate um there is a bit of a catch so the higher the service uh fees you charge the less likely people are to use them so there is a bit of a drop off sometimes in usage how the charges go currently council currently reads about 640 000 from general fees and charges for services like cemeteries supporting facilities community transport etc and these season charges don 't cover the full cost of those services so they 're generally subsidized by rates so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's possibly 64 000 um that will reduce the need for an srv buy so under option b we suggested um eight percent there which is about fifty thousand dollars and option c um suggested 18 which is uh reducing the srv by around about 110 000 so again you can see um you know those numbers uh in that um option b there that proportion 700 600 000 saving and uh 50 000 of increased fees and charges and and that 700 000 um closing the gap options and plus the use of these and the same with um option c so i 'll get michelle again to ask you to tell us whether you think council should maintain fees and charges at the current levels how important is it they do that not important at all or very important so one not important for five very important got a couple of votes in anyone else like to have australia okay yeah that 's i guess everyone so um it 's in the polling and theater results um yeah so you can see there that um again it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be neutral on or it 's not important to keep those fees in charges around about the same so it 's again thank you for that because that 's a good feedback for council and as we go through these series of meetings we should be able to i guess get a a good good feedback for council about what they what their options are um so what does all this do to the impact on average rates um and you can see there what option uh a is um the change in average rate is around uh 351 dollars that 's for the 15 plus 15 rate increase over two years for the um twelve and a half plus twelve and a half it increases the average rate by about 283 dollars a year and for the 7.5 percent plus 7.5 percent increases the average rate um by 170 a year if you um if you do want to kind of work out where where the impact is on you um you can take this as here 's a sample rate for is coming out shortly for the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can 't really read it very well but it 's 500 uh the ordinary general residential rate which is the general rate is 554. um so that 's the only area where this uh srv would impact um it would add to the gst of course but um it would impact that rate only um in this case a uh option a solution would increase it by 83. 554. in the first year and about 111 in the second year because you have the right cap chipping in and an option c option would increase by 42. and get 60 in the second year um so and we 're just winding up now so i 'd just like to um ask you if you participate again just in looking at um just a couple of your most preferred options that you would think council would like to use or you would like the council to consider to close that financial gap um michelle bring up another poll here and this time just pick your two preferred options out of asset rationalisation changing service levels reducing services or increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people in there yeah okay let 's uh we can close that one off now thanks michelle we 'll show you the results so yeah so um everyone 's happy to um dispose off some of those surplus or underutilized facilities um that 's great uh and then potentially reducing services and increasing decent charges so again thank you for that um that input um uh yeah so i just got i won 't go over this again but just recapping the options if you can bear this in mind please because uh very shortly i 'll just ask you to pick um one of those options or another option to get your feedback on which which of these you would prefer but before i do that there is an option of not to have an srv obviously if council doesn 't proceed with sov it will actually need to cut four and a half million dollars out of its budget as i mentioned earlier so what would that mean in terms of the initials we 're talking about tonight um so to find four and a half million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council would need to make those product of their gains that 's a hundred thousand dollars would need to sell all that 9.7 million dollars of assets that 's got on that if it 's identified as a potentially underutilized um surplus it would need to cut the hours open for service by about half i would need to transfer or cease all those non-core services that 's pretty much everything in that area and it would also need to increase user charges by 25 and that would bring in around 400 4.5 million dollars a year so um i guess i 'm going to ask you now um which well i 'm not going to i 'm not guessing i am going to ask you now of that those options a b and c and this this option d here which is no sov which one would you think is the most palatable from your perspective what would you prefer so again if you just if you can choose between a b and c i promise is the last time i 'll ask you to participate in the bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple there so that 's option a 15 plus 15 and six hundred thousand option b twelve and a half plus twelve and a half plus six hundred thousand saving and seven hundred thousand dollars of service reductions etc yeah see the uh seven plus two point five plus seven point five plus six hundred thousand plus one point seven million dollars in reductions and the last one is um you know knowledge survey and make make it all through savings so well let 's uh i think that 's it see everyone in there um and yeah so actually everyone voted or everyone polled suggested option b was their preference so that 's great thank you appreciate your feedback there [Music] okay so um where can you get more information we 'll try to give you a lot of information i know it 's a reasonably complex problem but there there is more information on council 's website um some background papers and things there if you want to know more about srv around how um ipad um the independent pricing and regulatory i 'll go about i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils have had srvs and what for and that 's all on ipad 's website you can get more information by speaking to your local councillor or my calling council on their 1 300 number this is uh not the end of the process am i done here i have website shortly um if it 's not there already and you can make a submission through directly to the council 's website there 's a form on the page there um what happens next is submissions will close in august council will consider those submissions it will determine what its preferred solution or solutions are uh it has undertaken that if that does involve some sort of rationalization of services or assets or service cuts then we 'll come back to the communities and consult on those in november it needs to um identify its preferred solution and notify ipad if it 's an intent to apply for an srv and it needs to state the amount that once wants to apply for at that time then between december and uh january the council will need to seek the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and then after weighing up what that community feedback is it will need to decide whether it wants to proceed either it 's in february either in a uh as proposed or as an amended form and then between march and april ipad will then invite the community to make submissions um while it evaluates the application so that will be an independent submission process where you can make your submission to ipa um and then in may ipart makes its determination which is binding on everyone and that srv if there is one would apply from uh one um one july onwards 2022. um ipart doesn 't always approve these ivs sometimes it grants them in different ways and what 's what 's applied for so that will um you know that 's really up to my path to decide at that point so i 'm going to um really just open it up for questions if anyone 's got any michelle my co-host is um is managing the chat box here uh if you want to raise your hand and ask a question verbally on it yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen i 'll never answer your questions as best i can so i think i 've got any questions uh we haven 't got anything in the chat coming through okay okay well as i say if no one 's got any questions now there are i mean lots of ways to ask questions going forward there 's more of these sessions as you may have noticed on the website um over the next wee while if you want to go and think about it and you can then participate another question on the council website is my email address i 'm more than happy to receive questions from the community about this presentation and even numbers or things in it there and certainly um you 're more than um there 's plenty of information there and you know ask your counselor or um you know ask ask a staff member they 'll be more than happy to help you with your um questions there 's nothing else here no we haven 't got anything okay well um and then thanks everyone thanks for your participation tonight um i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 'll be um really helpful for council and um yeah and hopefully you 're more informed to participate in the process going forward thanks everyone okay"

audit risk and improvement committee annual report i have two recommendations there do you have a mover councillor cross and councillor ham secondly cancel across it was really it was a very productive meeting that we had at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the that the chair complemented snowy valley 's council on the growing maturity of the reports and and how it was identifying and managing risk so i think that gives us great comfort to know that we have this forensic analysis of the processes that are important and i think thank you very much to glennis for her forensic analysis of our our policies and procedures and risks and financial management there 's no further discussion i 'll put mr mayor we 've just got um the chair of the water risk and improvement committee um in on the meeting if you wanted to ask her if she 'd like to make any is that for the next one as well uh more for them glenn if you 're just on uh mute there i 'm right now should be right now thank you okay so do you want me to talk to the report at all um okay um i think it 's all fairly self-explanatory there um if anybody 's got any questions um i 'm happy to take any questions a comment and maybe you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk committee for two years and then stood down as you were coming in on care um i am very aware that a lot of the processes have been tightened up from where it was when we were the brand new snowy valleys council and um maybe you know better than me just to do a a little bit of a timeline of where we were because it wasn 't a great place to where we are now yes um i suppose my experience with the audit committee starts with the administration period really um and taken us right through to here so i have certainly seen a huge leap in our um i suppose discipline our governance our risk management in terms of the council etc so there 's been enormous work in in policies there 's been enormous work in getting our governance and risk management framework together i think probably the the and also too i suppose the discipline in running our meetings um and the expectation of what we want in terms of reports and information from people who are presenting the the various reports etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be in terms of our internal audit function i think that we need a bit more maturity in relation to that maturity in terms of um our attitude to audit internal order our attitude to well i suppose the culture within the organization and i suppose um not seeing it as a impost or whether it be financial or whether it be resource whatever it 's part and parcel like risk management it 's part and parcel of our everyday work and i think that 's a challenge for any organisation any organization i 've been in and involved in the same sort of area and i think it 's going to be a particular challenge for councils in the future particularly probably regional councils as they 've come on board with the new framework that the government is trying to put in place from about march next year and there 'll be regulations supporting that as well so i think that 's probably um the biggest challenge for us in the future in terms of varick but i think our arik is way way down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the requirements that the state government is looking towards in terms of our risk governance risk and internal order framework so i think we 're in a very very good place at this point in time as to where we are now um but yes where would you like to go oops sorry my watch is talking to me um take it off actually um yes so um i think that um i think also too one of the other challenges for eric has been is to be flexible and adapt to the environment in which we have faced in the last 12 months um well probably 18 months i suppose too with all the different things that are impacting on the council and which has obviously an impact on um eric as well and its role as well so i think we 've come out of that quite well at this stage um and i think that there 's a good future for eric um and i must say i think that the the thing that i 've seen um most important uh i i think in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from like where i came from coming in as in the administration period in the audit committee to now has been a superb change and improvement from what i have seen well having seen you in a meeting glennis and how you question and how and your knowledge i want to personally thank you for your input okay thanks julia thanks all right um i noticed uh in the uh in the following recommendation uh glennis that uh that we we will probably formally acknowledge you but uh whilst you 're on the phone i think it would be prudent uh to um say you know that on behalf of council that we 're we 're very grateful for the stewardship and the uh and and the direction that you 've been able to take us in in relation to making this um essential part of our governance um a really important and um and worthwhile process um that that the councillors and the staff of uh and the community will benefit from so um you 've been an integral part of that as the chairperson and uh although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things come to an end and you know we we wish you every success in in the future endeavors and uh look forward to seeing you around town and can i just say to john um none of the improvements could happen if you didn 't have a council that supported you and also the ceo and the staff as well so um those improvements do not happen without all those people supporting um the aric and the direction that we 're headed in certainly thanks thanks okay all right we 've got two uh recommendations there so if there 's nothing further i 'll put that to council so all those in favor that 's unanimous thanks glennis okay thank you uh in relation to 10.4 audit risk and improvement committee membership for 2021 we 've got five recommendations there do we have a mover councillor cross and councillor benjamin councillor cross yes i do endorse that it 's been absolutely wonderful to have glennis on board to to guide us with our eric um i 'd also like to note that we did at the we did interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can eat we can not ask her to to join our committee she certainly comes highly recommended and she actually has local connections so i think that will be a real asset to our to our eric cancel here can i i i must admit it but but we didn 't advertise for this position i presume caroline yes yes we did we interviewed and we had a formal application a formal um interview process at the same time as we put melissa melissa melanie on uh so yes it it was fully done well did you get many other applicants i think we had sorry we 'll have to refer to shelley for that one um through you mr deputy mayor i can cancel him there was a competitive field of which three applicants were interviewed um and there was a recommendation made at the end of um last year that carol and rosetta welsh be placed on the eligibility list which has prompted of course circumvented another onerous uh recruitment process yeah ah excellent thank you all right there 's nothing further i 'll put that to cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stephen walker is the chair he 's obviously played a very essential part about eric over the last um 12 months and he 's obviously going to um play a great role in in our in our governance from now on in and has certainly got big feels big shoes to fill in in glenise 's absence but uh i 'm sure stephen will um will perform that task with a great deal of passion all right uh 10. uh 5 the future direction of council committees there 's six recommendations there do we counselor smith just on mu you can suggest that do we have a seconder for that councillor pritchard all those in favor of going into committee think that 's unanimous it 's uh yeah sorry no that 's all right it 's the the screens are freaking up well say that 's unanimous cancel a ham you 've got the thought oh i think it 's over to council smith sorry i bumped him you go called thank you yes look uh the the whole issue of committees has been a little bit controversial uh councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of council committees has been somewhat uh aired if you like through the boundaries commission inquiry and there have been a lot of negative comments about the process that we have undertaken about that or from that inquiry but i would just like to to say that this is a very very positive process that we have undertaken and that as a result of this process there is going to be a lot more sense and streamlining of committees although a number of committees are to be dissolved that is appropriate because they are not functioning as council committees at this point in time and we 're just really recognizing what uh the the actual fact is uh one of one of the uh issues is of course governance is and that has we 've just been talking about that with the eric um one of the statements that i had heard during this inquiry was that the former uh councils had given a little a lot less attention to governance and that we have in our time in office have given too much attention and cost to the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that governance is probably one of the most important issues that we have to deal with and in so doing the disbanding of some of the committees is in the interests of good governance and the the main issue for the committees themselves is that they will continue to be supported by council they 're not going to be just dissolved and left in the lurch council under the arrangements that we 're having place is going to be continuing to support those committees and look after them in the most appropriate way possible so from that perspective i totally endure endorse all of the points one to six that are in our recommendations today council again um i thank you core you covered that pretty well but you know just um people like the tumbarumba historical society which you know have some insecurities about their venue their um their equipment and all the artifacts that they have and the wonderful museum they have i am hearing positives back on how well the council are working and i suggest for everyone on the committees that are to dissolve by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um to help with the negotiation and not be afraid to um put your hand up for assistance in kind and financial should that need be to keep your committee going yeah ask a question um can we enter this list of committees through through the chair if i may mr deputy mayor the resolution has been moved and seconded so if you have a proposal you 're in committee now suggest you have a discussion and if you would like some amendments to that then it 's up to the mover or second to either agree or disagree to that and if it 's a disagree then you may move a an amendment to the motion well i 'd like to move that we established a tumor river walk committee was a wetlands committee has expired there 's a big area and i think that the community wants to have more input into what 's happening down in that part of the world and what the future plans are there and i think we need to commute a community committee to oversee it because there 's been some developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community may not be in favor of and i think i think there 's a it 's a jewel in the crown of truman i think we should have a community community committee uh if i may through the chair um councillor pritchard do you believe that that might fit into one of the other committees we 've got our committee listing um that we 're going to evaluate delegates on etc i believe that that purpose may actually fit into one of those existing groups that provide some advice to council such as uh we 'll go through that list in a few minutes when we get to that item but there are various committees around uh gardens um and providing volunteer input et cetera too and i think this is more important quite frankly as you will know that uh council has been approached recently to do some major redevelopment of the pioneer park and we 've had a that uh labyrinth put in i don 't think realise i don 't think the community really the committee community doesn 't realize uh what it was all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing doesn 't happen again but also looking at the future development of it all i think it 's important enough for us to have a separate committee mr chair can i ask the question of counselor pritchard are you suggesting a committee of council or are you suggesting a an independent group well a council committee with representation of councillors and members of the community selected because of their interest how it 's administered i 'm not sure about but uh i think we need to have a closer handle on it i mean there 's a lot of exercise equipment put in along which i wasn 't sure about i think we need to have a closer hand counselor richard it would be perhaps um an opportunity to to maybe have a report on on that at the at the next meeting and having all that sort of substance uh or or or possibly even workshop on it about uh whether what 's involved because i mean i it would be hard to uh to sort of get everything into into that into what you 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the like exercise equipment and all that sort of stuff because i 'm i 'm not very familiar with it myself so that 's the very reason why we all need to have a committee local people i don 't think we can i think we have to do something like this cancer recently thank you deputy mayor um i first of all would like to say that this particular report um is quite important to our all our communities and it 's really important for us as councillors to thank all the committee members and the volunteers who are on these committees who are now choosing to go to be independent committees and stand alone and i think that 's a remarkable effort and thank you to our staff on council as well for bringing this through that process and it still should continue to the end of june um but i think what council pritchard 's bringing up is is perhaps an eye a reason to think about some of the work that we do as councillors and how we actually communicate with the community about issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development within those towns and doesn 't always need to have a committee but it does mean that as mr pritchard 's council of each other is pointing out once development looks to be happening we need to be very diligent on making sure that it is recommended it 's taking the recommendations from the community and don 't necessarily think that that needs to have always to be done through a committee chairperson we can certainly bring that matter back to a council workshop and looking at our governance process for committees and our other engagement activities with the community and provide some information to the councillors to inform whether you would like our future report on that particular matter council of pritchard has raised would you be happy with that council picture so that we can get all that information and and do it correctly rather than sort of on the hop they just don 't mute their cancer picture i feel very strongly about it because i set the whole thing up originally and it 's been a long hard struggle to get to where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't think it should be considered separately i just want to make sure that we have the focus on that river walk as is present and where it should go in the future i don 't want to be diluted down too much yeah i think everyone 's uh in agreeance of what you 're saying but i i i think probably just needs time to to get it to a point where we where we 've got something to work with rather than doing something ad hoc now well i 'd like it 's not to do any development down there until this is sorted out that 's what i 'm very anxious about we certainly won 't be doing any development until uh we get this in order mr c yeah correct okay thank you counselor right i just i 'd just like to um you know be everybody be aware that you know with the tumbarama historical society is really concerned about their um facility they use at the you know the museum and the visitor information center and uh and the memorandum of understanding we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really covers all aspects and supports them how how we really want it you know because you know they 've put so much work into such a huge facility and such a great role card for tumbarumba i think rightly important that we support them in every way we possibly can one thing that really concerns me the only thing that really concerns me is which i don 't think is a bad thing but um we must have our memorandum of understanding they 're really strong and supportive council across uh i really i think we need to really appreciate the work that the staff has put into this i know it 's been 18 months in the making and it 's been as a result of the 2016 legislation but a legislative requirement but it 's also been very challenging for communities i know the talbingo progress association has really really struggled with uh getting to the point where that they know which way they want to go it seems that insurance is the sticking point and i think we need to reassure the communities that they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a transition process and that we will be supporting them to uh have uh to go through this that they will not lose their representation their council of representation um but i i also think that um uh oh sorry i 've lost my train of thought oh um sorry i lost my train of thought for the moment but i do think it needs to be emphasized that uh that three five five committees are about looking after a council facility and i 'm not quite sure that that was actually made clear to a lot of those committees and certainly that 's been a sticking point for the tabingo progress association is it possible to um cancel someone you 're on mute i was going to move that we go out of committee but that 's fine we 've got something else to say i was just going to um maybe ask one more point i think castle hand might also do do you want to go first counseling i was just going to actually compliment the um the stuff the doc first document we saw was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i i get why it was that way and now it 's it 's down to 28 pages it 's concise it 's been well formatted and it 's looking so much better and i just want to publicly thank the staff for their work on that and acknowledge that it is still a draft and people can still comment on it councillor smith um yes look i 've put forward or nominated this particular uh item because i think it 's an important one and the restructure of all their committees is important the the one that counselor pritchard has mentioned i would fully support another separate um discussion about a committee to look after the wetlands and the riverwalk and so on because i also think that that 's a very important part of our infrastructure in the tumut region in particular however it doesn 't fit into this particular item because this is to do with restructuring existing committees so if kessler pritchard wants to to do something about the wetlands i i would fully support him to do that and he wants to put forward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right matt i 'm happy to put a notion that we set up a tumor river walk committee how it 's done or i 'm not fussed about it as long as we have a step in committee with uh general improvement councils and general community people on it but we need to have the decisions regarding the wetlands floated through their representative community committee before they 're implemented mr mary dr if i may um through yourself uh i would prefer that we looked at our governance documents around this and provided some information back to councillors but given that there 's a motion already moved maybe the movers and seconders might want to include an additional recommendation um to provide further information to councillors on that and consider a future report on the matter can i can i just ask um because the thing that worries me with this and obviously there 's a lot of work gone into it and i like probably many other councillors have had a number of telephone calls about it um and you know it sounds like different councillors have obviously been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and councillor wright had been phoned about the historical society um myself and others have been contacted about camp hudson for instance so i think the the possibility of of there being a bit of hysteria about what 's happening here um is is is highly likely and i think it would be a reasonable thing mr ceo if perhaps one of the staff could perhaps give an example of of say the camp hudson situation and you know what the reality is around that you know the lease is about to expire um they 're going to be encouraged to to take out a um with the assistance of council be encouraged to take out an independent um management option um with the assistance of council so it 's it 's you know the reality is the national parks in relation to that uh particular committee hold the lease we we we 're not the we 're not the we 're not the owner uh and the likelihood is that we would have to go to public tender um from what i 'm told as as a council to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our favor and and and even then you know it 's it 's up to the um determination of national parks not us um so you know i think that would be a reasonable thing to explain rather than mr deputy mayor i could ask mrs jones to provide an update to councillors on the camp hudson situation because as you have indicated there is a it is crown lands and there is a lease arrangement there etc which complicates that matter a little bit further yeah so through you mr deputy mayor and and thank you you 've actually pretty much explained it beautifully yourself so um there 's a good understanding of what 's happening in this space i i think picking up on the sentiment of counsellors at this juncture it 's really important to to re-emphasize the work that we 're doing will take us over the next six months and it 's about setting these committees up for success in how what they do and the services that they provide to the community in terms of camp hudson um the deputy mayor is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will expire on the in november next year we 've been received preliminary advice through many conversations with national parks between council and national parks and the committee of national parks and the committee and council that the there is all likelihood that when the lease expires parks under their new operating model would need to go to market for the leasing so it 's not an automatic renewal process and that there 's every chance that you know would counsel if we were if we had the appetite that we would not potentially not not get that so in terms of being able to move that committee into an independent incorporated body and give them the capacity and help them skill to the to the ability that when that lease comes becomes available should they want to you know put an expression of interest for it themselves then then they 're in a good position to be able to do that there there seems to be a bit of legacy around camp hudson totally understand the community sentiment um it 's just we 've got to the point as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us we potentially the lease will expire well the release will expire in november and you know council would need to in this current situation around sustainability see whether or not we would want to become a leaseholder of an asset that is not ours yeah does that help do mr deputy men yeah i think it does i think it 's just very uh transparent to sort of let the public know that um these are the reasons why these decisions are being made absolutely and and uh you know furthermore there 's some more there 's also some um some of these committees have got different sums of money in their accounts and so you know i think without speaking on behalf of council i think the intention would be to ensure that you know that process of um the money that 's in those accounts um you know that that that would have to be fairly adjudicated on um you know to to assist these um committees so that they can become independent through you mr deputy mayor um completely agree so part of this report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at undertaking in terms of being able to transfer fixed assets sorry not fixed assets non-fixed assets so that 's your incidentals and then financial assets back back to community groups when as they transition to incorporated model and obviously that will trigger future reports to council if we 're talking about transfers out of reserve absolutely transparent process yes this is not directly related to what this is all about but it 's about the insurances for these groups i 'm a member of the potus group not on the executive at all but we raise about a thousand bucks a year on road stall and so forth to pay for our public liability insurance that 's all it does and uh you know this year there are no stress tools so i guess we 're not particularly fussed about it but uh i 'm sure there are a lot of community groups around the our shower that around our council area who are stressed by it they can 't raise the money no rattles being held held and there 's no people outside the coals to ambush you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the covered virus get government relief for the public reliability insurance save about thousand bucks per each year until the covered virus for that purpose until the virus is resolved i couldn 't agree more councillor pritchett i think we 've raised previously that you know when you look at sporting groups for instance the impost on families uh in relation to you know say for instance basketball or netball or cricket or whatever the case may be um or even you know your local cwa holding a store you know there 's these costs whether uh whether we could advocate for some legislation which allows council to uh provide some some insurance through a broker or something that covers all these events rather than playing multiple times for the same thing you know it would make sense i mean the only people who seem to be making any money the insurance companies mr deputy mayor i have a draft addition to the uh recommendation that 's moved and seconded if you 'd like me to share that on the screen for council 's consideration that 's fine counselors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for me so just in blue at the bottom is the addition there so the council workshopped the matter about the addition of a tumor wetland slash riverwalk committee providing detail around the possible governance arrangements that are available to council and consistent with our current governance framework and assess whether a further report be provided to council well i 'm happy with that me too councillor pritchard you 're on mute i 'm heavy all right have we got a uh mover and the seconder to go to committee councillor right councillor wrestleman all those in favor unanimous we now have a uh seven recommendations i 'll put those all those in favor again that 's unanimous excuse me mr deputy mayor can we have another look at that because there was a delay in hands up and i 'm not sure if we didn 't have some people voting against i 'm sorry about that but i just we just need to be clarity have clarity um mr deputy mayor if everyone would like to show their hands again very clearly on the screen um you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for or against oh so that 's 741 against is that correct and we have to declare the one against um counselor this one uh sorry uh councillor benjamin genie did you uh note that we 've got that down thank you uh 10.6 uh dissolve the tumbatric committee one three recommendations there do we have a mover and a second now counselor wrestleman yes and counselor right sorry the screen 's stopping and starting any discussion um just sufficient if i may as a mover of this one to say that on i think this is a remarkable um council committee um for advocacy and there 's potential in the future to look at it from one svc and not necessarily tumba um as a as a project for for the council but um i really support this group for council to be working anything further cancer run are you on mute there councillor ron yeah i 've just i 've been on the committee for a lot of long time and i just feel sorry that it 's going but i um yeah it really is a comedian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i guess as long as we make sure that we have plenty of um independent people rather than just councillors and council employees on the committee so that we can on the ongoing committee for so that people feel like they 're involved some people in our community been involved in it for a real lot of years and then we should make sure we keep including them and recognize how much they have put into it over the years counselor here i i agree with councillor wright but and i would actually like that um our recommendation for to reflect that to reflect um because you know i mean that sounds quite harsh dissolving the direct community it 's been just so fabulous and um achieved such a lot and particularly in terms of advocacy which is why it was um initiated and when um councilors does talk about you know making it 's an svc thing certainly when we 've been walking the last three years we 've been discussing everyone within the whole of the snowy valleys council area so i i would like a recommendation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultation when tubber trek is being developed or described through the chair um councillor ham given the discussion in the workshop regarding this matter i have drafted an additional item if the councillors would like to consider that that would be excellent thank you mr deputy mayor are you happy for me to share the screen on that now the mover and second are happy with the edition yes that 's fine cancel ham that fits you yeah i um yeah not not entirely continue to engage with the community to it just sounds like i i want people like lorraine hilston and tony beckett still to be actually on that consultative um discussion um continue to engage with the community it sounds to me like you 'll put an article in the paper could it be just a little bit more succinct actively i i think we have to be careful and recognize that when we 're passing these resolutions that they 're not for um just now but they 're for the future so when we 're talking about things in the future it doesn 't depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely but within that um i just want to make sure that there is directly with people within the community that you speak like to in actively engaged is just so broad um like at the moment we have um councillor um wright you know he knows the area so well and he can talk very well about where the walk can be you know when if councillor wright is no longer a councillor we want we still want that sort of yes direct consultation with the community through the chair cancel him is there some other words that you would like out of there i 've just added in actively and directly to say that it 's you know it 's not going to be just a broad engagement of a notice up on their website and a letter in the newsletter we we can certainly um hear your intent there and agree with your intent that the community members do need to be involved and and we can take that forward and i believe that the resolution is broad enough for us to um implement your intent thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um the counsellor schmidt might have a question there i think i 'll just stop sharing the screen so it 's a bit easier for you to see yes i did want to ask the question if that 's okay mr chair that um what was the reason that this committee ceased to exist where uh he are going to vote on whether to remove it or to dissolve it officially but it says here that the committee is no longer active why is that committee no longer active uh if i may through the chair so the most recent event was essentially organized in the way that council ham has spoken now where a number of people were engaged and it was run as a community as a sorry as a councillors event as opposed to a community event and in council 's normal process around running an event for the community and the councillors we have engaged with specific people who have the specific knowledge and we the intention is to continue on that process would it be appropriate in that case to suggest a working group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on the governance framework around that um could i mr deputy mayor ask mr jones to comment on that through you mr deputy mayor councillor smith a working group would be the most appropriate structure if we were to convene some sort of a forum so it would have a specific start and end point and come together for a specific purpose to assist council staff i guess to develop and deliver the event that sounds sounds good to me which is really in effect what we 've done in the past yeah that 's right except we 've called it a section 355 committee in the past which which was not correct yeah i 'm happy with that yeah if the deputy mayor maybe we could change the wording if i could share the screen again maybe we could change the wording to include the direct words working group in that resolution just um greatly appreciated sorry for the backwards and forwards in here continue to actively engage with the community all right through a council could type councillors see that okay so i 'll read that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council working group to ensure the event continues as an opportunity for both councillors and the community to advocate for the community needs in the snowy valleys in an open and less formal conversation all good terrific okay you 've got a mover and a second uh [Music] there i believe council is women and councillor right if they agree to those changes mr deputy member all right i 'll put that uh motion all those in favor against all those in failure it just counts as if we can just really clearly center the screen hold their hands up it makes it a bit easier for the counts thank you that 's unanimous mr deputy mayor my apologies um just a clarification on the uh future matter uh sorry the previous matter 10.5 future direction of council committees just to save us in the future the resolution i think there may have been a statement about the seven items but there are actually eight items so could we just uh clarify that the votes that the councillors had in regards to that matter were regarding all eight items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up on the screen if that provides some clarity and i 'll put that back up on the screen i 'm not entirely sure so i felt it better that we provide that clarity now than have an error in the minute so that 's all eight items counsellors are clear that when we adopted that item we were adopting all eight items there um can you just show your hands whether that was your intent counselor yes okay i 've got everyone there indicating that was the intent so we 'll clarify that in a minute thank you sorry for having to clarify that matter okay 10.8 sorry mr deputy man uh ten point eight or seven point seven sorry um [Music] okay dissolve the chairman uh truman community gardens committee i have four recommendations there do we have a move councillor schmidt and seconded by council larissa any discussion um not from me i think it 's just quite clear that it 's changing to a working group which is what we 're after and we thank the members of the committee in the past for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's gone along quite steadily ever since it 's very small but it 's quite active the only question i have do they need public liability insurance but it 's being on council land or what do we do about that mr um mr deputy mayor i might ask mrs jones to comment on that please um through you mr deputy mayor councillor pritchard we 're just basically changing the operating model though still come because they 're still working on a council asset they are still covered by council 's insurance as volunteers rather than as a committee yeah does that clarify the question yeah excellent if there 's nothing further i 'll put those four recommendations all those in favor i think that 's the analysis i just can 't see kate yes uh kate 's got a hand up just like all counsellors with the hand up oh sorry that 's it ten point eight dissolve the tumbrum men shed to me there 's seven recommendations there counselor right and counselor cross on mute counselor right yeah i think this is a really good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 355 and do their own thing and they 're all covered by their own insurance for the men 's shed association and everything i think it 's a great outcome for us um i believe the emerald and of understanding they 've got they 're all happy with that too um i really should support they 've really done a great job there and they 're um i believe um willing to assist other people along the way so i think it 's all good a great outcome for us so is it um just just looking at recommendation number four council have actually paid the men 's shed 25 000 for their assets uh through you mr deputy mayor council ahem we 're donating their assets back to them so the asset the asset list was um their tools their equipment um the bids and pieces that they needed yeah so that 's not that that 's not the cash that 's the actual physical asset cash is there is in recommendation number three yeah terrific got it thank you that 's mr matt evan um yeah just very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big compliment to mrs jones and all her team this is a great template and a great model for other men 's sheds to use in particular about menshed which is just setting up and can use this as a very clear and very precise template for handover when the rotary club has got that established and i do thank her for her work that she 's done in this area all right there 's nothing further there i 'll put those seven recommendations for those in favor against that 's unanimous uh 10.9 dissolution of svc children 's services committee do we have a mover counselor ham counselor right counselor um i was part of this committee when it started in 2002 it was just after car cooler children 's centre had opened and it was a great committee it had the principles from the school attend the maternal health nurse the play group um head and it was very active but um as time went on and yeah the reading day was one of the things that came out of it but as time went on um there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went by the wayside uh councillor cross and i are very involved in the snorri valleys children 's services committee which is separate from council completely so i have no trouble with this being dissolved any further comments council smith just to be clear what council i am saying is that there is in fact a replacement or those needs are being met by another organization we 're not just dumping them is that correct yes it 's it 's a committee of like-minded people and colleagues getting together it 's it 's under no incorporated body or whatever it 's just saying on the third year tuesday of a term at 10 a.m we get together and we meet and we discuss what 's happening in children 's services and should we need a um to do funding one of the preschools or bodies are always happy to put their hands up to a whisper stuff if i could just add to that to counselor schmidt it 's actually a much broader base it involves all of the child care services within snowy valleys council and it provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training needs and i know that counselor ham did organize a very special event last september when we had a a conference for for the early childhood educators which was extremely successful so i think this committee is a much more powerful voice and a necessary one thank you for that i just wanted to make sure that we didn 't leave an impression or a perception that we were just dissolving a committee and getting rid of it thanks cool we wouldn 't let that happen i 'm sure you wouldn 't or if there 's nothing further i 'll put those two recommendations all those in favor against that 's carried unanimously uh ten point ten committees and nomination of delegates and a seconder for that the deputy mayor um i can share the item here and go through the detail of that given what council has workshopped on the matter but you will need a mover and a second at first to just clarify that uh attachment doesn 't have it all filled in councillor wright and councillor smith share the screen would you like me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit can do how 's that is that better cancer yep i can read it

hayes i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you um do you advise the other committees that we added in there sorry i can 't get one sorry i was having a bit of trouble getting off the mute um it was the tumbafest committee and that was under me just open up the right version please just give me one moment done the first was canceller hand and write delegate in altoona and the staff delegate is the tourism officer the additional committee is the forest industry council and the delegate is cancelled right and the alternatives cancel ahem [Music] and the third committee was the snowy valley 's children 's services committee and the delegate is counsellor ham and the alternatives council across and the staff delegate is the manager of community services and that was all of the additional ones councils any suggested changes to any of those any clarifying matters council across my understanding is that the interagency meeting that 's listed there is no longer a meeting of council or an advisory it no longer meets in council i think they wanted to they opted to go privately trying to locate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow bit there it is so what that one 's moving is it to i don 't think they meet at all or if they do it 's a a committee an outside committee much like the children 's services committee you were just speaking of kate they get together at their own at their own calling with their own needs we 're moving that one out of working groups and into [Music] it yes my administration skills aren 't great there my apologies and and just possibly we need to add external committees with council representation the elhec committees for tumor and tumbarumba great idea kane accepting to be invited i don 't know if they want to yeah carly is on that committee health is that okay they determine who 's the member of those committee reading yes okay delegated delegate yeah well done okay that covers that um matt we probably should just use the title rather than the name coordinator place activation okay any ones you want to go back over at all we 'll tidy up the the formatting of this table okay i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone other than cancelers in there uh we do usually list in the table the staff delegate so we 've moved the coordinator place activation into the staff delegate column the the decision on the staff delegate is a decision of of mine um unless it has to be a nomination through an agency like the mlhd of which i would choose which staff member would be nominated for that does that provide a bit of clarity on that matter mr deputy me okay counseling um just in clarification so if you 're uh you 're a delegate and your alternate comes along as well and it 's called for a vote um through you mr deputy mayor uh the delegate has the vote if both are in attendance however if if the alternate is representing because the primary delegate can 't attend then then the alternate has the vote yeah yes so there 's only one vote one vote and so one vote so for the australia day committee when there 's three there 's three council people on there there 's a primary and two delegates one vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um we could make it two primary and one delegate but yeah now 's your opportunity whatever works you think works the best just a bit of clarity there the way that i 've got it for the australia day committee is councillor benjamin and councillor right as the voting as primary yep and councillor cross is the alternate so there 's two votes there for the australia day committee but councillor cross is allowed to go to the meeting and be part of the discussion yeah absolutely you could you could list an another alternate in the case that you have uh councillor benjamin and councillor right away um that way council lacrosse can be assisted by someone else if those two members are away if you wanna okay okay we 're adding council ham in there is the secondary alternate i 'll just share that screen again so that we 're just making very sure we 've got this right so i 've listed it as counsellor cross then counselor hand just to make it close yep is that all right that 's perfect very good counselors need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matt should we try and communicate with the council officer directly or through the uh through the chair um councillor pritchard yes the council of staff interaction policy allows the councillor to talk direct with the councillor staff delegate on those committees if it 's about matters that fall under the terms of reference of those committees so you you 're welcome to go direct to the staff delegate and that 's why we list the staff delegate here to provide clarity so if we 're talking about the australia days committee and your council benjamin or councillor right then you have the ability to go and talk directly to the event activation officer about matters that are being considered by the australia day committee sure what i 'm getting at is that how do i know should we put it through the council of support person all our correspondents or whatever i mean i wouldn 't know who the activation officer was you know and i 'd give up in in despair about trying to contact them and i 'm not allowed to certainly counsel pritchard yes the councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer um make contact with you that way we keep that also the record of contact um as part of their records as well [Applause] just in regard to um the tumbarumba l hack was there any particular reason i 'm not not criticizing but is there any particular reason that um [Music] it was requested to have a staff member instead of a counsellor representative that i 'm aware of mr deputy mayor um something that we can look into uh if you wish well the only thing that i think is uh a flaw in it is that you know the public uh may not have the same access to that person as as the counselor i mean the information about who that person is or isn 't isn 't readily available to you know that 's i mean because the public may perceive that the counsellor you know is their voice on that committee as well you know whereas they might not see it that way with the uh with the staff member what we could do is nominate a counsellor there and write to elhack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given that mlhd is the decision maker they would respond to that yeah i mean it 's obviously up to them it just means odd that we we 've done it differently that 's all yeah it doesn 't like i think it 's a really good point thank you very much for considering that debit event i think that should be council hand with the alternate being councillor right so i 've just listed that we 'll seek clarification on that matter and if the mlhd is okay with a councillor being the um member of theirs then we will suggest that councillor ham be the delegate and councillor right they 're the alternate the council is happy with that okay all right thank you counselors i 'll stop that sharing now so you have a mover and a second uh mr deputy mayor um counselor writing councillor smith around that and we 've updated the table so the resolution will reflect that table and we 'll provide that as part of the minutes if it 's resolved as such all right there 's nothing further off with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more request mr chair that we be advised from uh councillor uh uh representative there uh of all of those nominations and and those count committees that we 're to attend and that they be reflected in the councillor 's calendar quite clearly mr deputy mayor if i might take that one we will provide a copy of the table in the minutes and we will be writing to all these committee members will ensure that the councillors are cc 'd that are representatives on that and where those where those if the information invitations to those meetings comes through the council of support officer will place that in the calendar whether that 's direct through yourself or whether that is from yourself then to the council or support officer it depends on the the contact method there i can 't guarantee that if it doesn 't come into council 's system that we 'll have it in the calendar so it does rely on the delegates providing that information for us to update the council or calendar thank you all right all those in favor that 's carrick unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three recommendations there councillor benjamin councillor pritchard yeah look i 'm sorry can i just as far as the last table was concerned could we get a copy of that laminated sent to us all so we can put it up on that wall and contact the chairperson or the representative whereas i forget who 's on the mitch committee we can give you a copy of that uh counselor pritchard no no dramas at all thank you sorry john that 's all right are you still seconding that or was i mistaking it for the uh yeah i 'll second them i 'll say that anything for a price [Laughter] what page are we on page 74 of 143 of the electronic version thank you all right have the three recommendations there does anyone wish to speak well i 'll put that recommend those through recommendations all those in favor against carried unanimously the quarterly budget review is that 30th september two recommendations have a mover and seconder don 't we do 10.11 so we just did that yes we did just do 10.11 which was the bushfire local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay i 'm sorry i missed it what 's your question oh it was just i when on page 74 the um talking about the bush by impacted roads and the last point is various roads in and around bat load damage being assessed with cost to be confirmed i i would like that in and around or on the fire scar because you know the roads down in yavin creek were badly affected the roads down westbrook road were badly affected right around tumblr i just think we need to just um i mean we we wonder if any roads affected or roads down in orni were affected so um various roads in and around or on the fire scale to me would be a better wording mr deputy mayor um if i may respond to that that 's um in the content of the report it doesn 't include in the resolution as such so we 'll note the councillor 's intent and agree with that and will ensure that it 's any roads that are uh far impacted in the whole local government area that we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of yes thank you yeah thank you all right 10.12 the quarterly budget review yeah remember in a second after that councilorism cancel a hand discussion i 'll put that all those in favor you had a question the answer is all those in favor that 's carried unanimously 10.13 the statement of investments one recommendation there to ever move her look at the electric cattle product councilor wrestleman cass benjamin any discussion counselor thank you council across did you wish to speak [Music] if i could speak deputy me yeah ansel ham go ahead thank you um i 've just just in terms of the statements of the investments um they reflect very closely with what 's um well i seem to be in quite a good place and thank you to the cfo for your reports which seem to be getting even more comprehensive so i appreciate that i just want to make a comment about the tub rubber pool facilities thank the director of infrastructure for um showing councillor schmidt wright and i around those the other day and it 's a great job great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local and what a huge difference it 's going to make to tumbarumba so thank you very much all right any further comment or i 'll put that to a vote all those in favor carried unanimously the financial report on 10.14 [Music] one recommendation there do we have a mover councillor ham councillor smith any discussion i need to say these have been very much affected by monies coming in and out by grants and really for the first quarter this reflects very much was which was in the quarterly report um yeah it 's just we 're just really fortunate that so much money is coming in um through bushfire recovery and um to have a what is it a 530 increase in our um other income is just quite extraordinary and and by other income i presume um maybe to the cfo that is pushed by grant money politics thank you council ham through you mr deputy mayor other income includes recovery money in particular this is for um we have a very large position in there that is for the battle of canary demolition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened last financial year so this is a huge question you probably don 't know the answer but uh um how are we traveling financially after the bushfires do you think we with the help from resilience new south wales and whatever do you think we are they are really actually covering the cost are we going to be bearing the cost of the bushfire for decades so you mr deputy mayor thank you councillor ham um we have received a very large percentage of the expenditure that we incurred but we have not received everything and there will be costs that will not get covered by external funding but it 's nowhere near at the point where we were let 's say in april or may um in last financial year going forward the big issues that we are having is mostly related to resourcing internally like when we have to claim for um disaster funding we do need resources from the governance team from the finance team and those costs are definitely not covered of course so in writing grants and lobbying and advocacy and yeah okay well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well thank you my comment to that a lot of this is about the advocacy the councillors have uh with the various state members and ministers that come through our alignment with regional new south wales strategic documents and looking at the dfra guidelines and ensuring we 're making a very careful risk assessment as we move through this about what is funded and what 's not um and ensuring we we know what the answers to those are before we conduct those works and i think the staff have done a fantastic job there but very well supported by the the councillors and a very good understanding from the politicians at the state and federal level as well all right if there 's no further debate i 'll put that uh recommendation all those in favor that 's carried unanimously all right the quarterly ncif grants report 10.15 every mover cancel wrestleman and then cancel a ham comments no i can 't make thank you please with the report i 'll put that uh recommendation all those in favor before you do cancel across that i have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entry signs to towns and um not always positive it 's caused a lot of conversation i would like to just point out the tabingo progress association is looking to get a sum of money to so that they can have on the back of the signs thank you for visiting taobingo so i think that 's a really positive move to um that and i have been telling everyone that the signs were done right way back with the administrator so trying to get that message out i just i just go to comment that i just read through this and and i know we 've just gone through um the boundaries commission but it 's just such a report to see how much amalgamation has actually cost whether you 're forward or against it it 's quite an interesting document just to see the expense of it all all right i 'll put that all those in favor against it 's encouraging honestly uh 11.1 the city 's power partnership pledge two recommendations with the number of sub sections cancel across river secondary canceling here cancel across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy i think this is an absolutely no-brainer to be part of we will have access to world exports experts about how we can um how we can mitigate against climate change it 's just a great great outcome counsellorism thank you thank you deputy mayor um just the um point where it says efficiency rollout of um energy efficient lighting across the municipality do we use that term municipality or do we call ourselves council through the chair if i may deputy mayor i think the terms are interchangeable at this stage so i think the intent is covering across the whole local government area and my second part of the question is has or where what time frame are we looking at for the um roll out of the energy efficient lighting across the municipality if i may refer this one to mr couch um i believe that the program has actually recently been brought forward yeah i 'm correct uh through your deputy mayor councillor island we 're hoping the latest advice we 've got from essential energies that they 'll kick off prior to christmas um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll let councillors know when when we get it so definitely delivered this financial year it 's just a matter of you know we 're going to start before christmas or straight after that we 're yet to confirm all right there 's nothing further on that those recommendations all those in favor that 's carried unanimously 11.2 the roadside bin harmonization councillor smith and councillor pritchard councillor smith uh i didn 't actually put my hand up there but uh oh okay well it must have been from the previous uh yeah anyway i 'm happy to put that forward um it 's obviously time to to do this as one svc to get it all tidied up um and the bins are 13 years old i understand that the bins will be recycled so that they 're not being dumped somewhere in landfill but they 're going to be reused in recycled form i was just wondering what tune they 're going to be playing step right in the cross and council ham have a question i believe um yet a question for uh heinz heinz um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bins will be detected how how is that going to happen please um yeah there 's probably a a couple of aspects to that uh canceller cancel across the um bin new bins are normally barcoded and attached to a to an address so if they do go missing or yeah and finish up at the other end of town or something like that when the truck picks picks them up it will it will be able to identify that that bin doesn 't belong at that location and also by rolling out um newly branded bins enables us to identify bins that are being put out in the street but aren 't being paid for by the rate payer so yeah so it 'll it 'll help us better manage those two issues that 's great i really really like that and there 'll be no cost to the community with this rollout correct no cost to the community the fundings it 'll be funded through money that 's available to us in the waste reserve so no no additional cost so we 're looking at option number three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we we did a cost analysis of three different options um and established that yeah replacing the bins that have come to the end of the end of the useful license one bulk uh arrangement uh yeah is is long term whole of life cost uh the most effective way of doing it and when sorry i was just going to say so we have 1.081 million dollars in our reserves the sorry through you did deputy mayor the one point [Music] million is the total whole of life 's cost the actual cost to undertake this replacement 188 000 yeah so and we do have that in the resource we do have that in the reserve um and yeah but just to understand the whole of life costs we like we run the cost across the life of the of the bin but yeah so that the upfront capital purchase is higher than the other two options you 'll see that you 'll you 'll see that in there the other two options are far cheaper when you take into account the whole of life cost it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full replacement well that 's really well presented happy a very very damaged bin when can i expect my new bin thing very good question cancel across we 're still finalizing the um the timelines we 're we 're talking um trying to um link it in together with the delivery of the fogo um project as well which yeah sort of um mid mid next year um but very much you know if if if residents have a bin that 's damaged now and need to replace now we do have arrangements in place to to do that as well so you don 't need to wait for the roll out we will still be replacing bins ad hoc as needed i just think it 's a great community service and it 's a great way of spending the reserve funds that have that are there to provide this great service for our community thank you mr carlson i know you 're gonna i know that ceo i 'll say this is a very long bow but i 'm running the show today so you the man sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh a council that was using its uh uh garbage trucks to map out potholes is that something that we we can look at there 's something built into the trucks that apparently maps out where the uh where the potholes are and tells the officers where to basically go so that all that intensive labour 's worked out and as the garbage trucks are doing the run it it maps it yeah i 'm aware of that that tech technology i 've seen it used in regard to tree maintenance as well so you know where you 've got you know because the trucks are running very close to the curb to pick up the bins and where they 're hooking up in in trees they can automatically log a maintenance request through it through a tablet in the truck and i can yeah very much see how you could also do that for potholes at the moment our truck drivers will just give our maintenance guys a call and let and let them know that some work 's needed so if they identify a tree that needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know potholes or other defects they will they will call they will call those in and that seems to work for us at the moment the other issue too is storm water drains would is there any way that they can be also tagged into that system because they get really stuffed up with leaves um yeah through the deputy did deputy mayor cancel across here i sort of um would hope that that would get picked up by our street sweeper as well so we do run the street sweeper around quite regularly um yeah look yeah when you have um uh leaf drops you know seasonal leaf drops it is hard to keep keep up and at times um yeah we do get inquiries from residents advising us of you know excessive leaves over a drain that need to be cleaned up and that sort of thing so we respond that at an ad hoc arrangement there 'd be no reason why our truck drivers couldn 't advise us of that as well it 's all about big brother coming closer and closer that 's the worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles we have in each in the recycling bin i hope councillor pritchard or if there 's nothing further on that i 'll um put those motions all those in favor that 's carried unanimously uh 11.3 proposal for the declaration of new off-leash areas i have three recommendations do we have a mover in a second councillor smith yeah i like this i 'm a dog fan just need a second to first counsellor smith uh councillor here off you go councillor smith yeah i 'm a dog fan and it 's great to uh to have designated areas that are off-leash recognizing that of course you still have to have your animals under control in such an area but it 's important to be able to have that in every town not just in the main areas may just make a comment yesterday if you missed deputy may mr chairman one of the biller parkers were one intimate and a lot of people walk along the riverwalk not knowing never entering a dog leash area we just need a new a few more signs there that tell people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be more aware um we have actually one two one at the entrance and one at maryvale street both of those i actually asked for them to be changed so that they actually would say that they were off leash areas so it 's a lot of long people walking on the river walk yeah we it just we did have one there uh the dog should be on um on leash but i did ask for that to be removed because it was no it is an off-leash area and also because it actually interfered with the with that beautiful landscape so i would be very loath to have more signs there i think just having those at the entrances highlights in fact because people either come through that way either of those ways and i i just make the comment that one day we had 20 dogs down there off leash and it was it was cat wonderful chaos all the dogs were beautifully behaved and had an absolutely fabulous time it 's just wonderful to watch them socializing and interacting with each other and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment from point of view of people with disabilities so um companion dogs and guide dogs can 't go anywhere where there 's an off-leash area if it 's not fenced so that does have an impact on some people who have got a disadvantage in our community because they are not allowed if they go anywhere near an off-leash area that 's not fenced their dog is taken off them what you 're saying um counsellorism but there are plenty of other parks that where people with a guide dog can go so i would be really loathe to see a fence particularly around villa park because it 's such a it 's one of our most beautiful parks oh nothing further put that all those in forever three recommendations those against a counselor is someone i 'm just confirming that you are a full yes okay oh that 's unanimous it 's slow at this end must be awfully slow okay uh eleven point four now councillor is some or not is this the uh yep [Music] 11.4 is a request from butler to establish a men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared a pecuniary interest here and opted to leave the room for debate and the vote which the ceo will arrange recommendations counselor right you 're moving cancel a hand or secondly any discussion i 'd just like to say what a great initiative this is i think um recovery and and just general health of the men 's sheds i think it 's a fantastic thing the whole whole proposal um i really gotta commend them to that low community for fighting for this and working so hard on it um you know i 've seen how good the manchet is in tumba rumba so i think we should fully support this in every way we can if i could just ask where on the back road that 's probably i haven 't seen it that low cannery site is it through the chair might refer that to mr holton um through you mr deputy chair of deputy mayor um it 's located adjacent to the former administration building for the cannery with the red roof on carajong avenue so it 's not that newer building well the proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh adjacent to that and use the um former administrative site as an ancillary facility for other community activities as well as providing toilets and amenities excellent i support it counselor smith in our earlier discussion today i had some confusion around those things that that mr halton has just said and looking into the document more closely i now understand that they will be leasing that whole building not just making use of the toilets in it so they will be leasing that whole building and an area of land adjacent to it where the garage will be built looking at the plans the um appearance of that building is quite different to the actual uh what we call or was generally referred to as the pizza hut building is there a chance that that could be amended to be a little bit more harmonious as far as the surrounding is concerned um through you mr deputy mayor um i suppose the um any building uh shed that is uh to be built there will be subject to uh a um d.a and um cc process so um those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illustration that we have on their plans here today are not necessarily what is going to be built there the illustrations that are with the submission provided by um badlow rotary are indicative um as i said um there was another process to go through uh in terms of gaining approvals for any shed to be built there right it 'd be nice if they were you know somewhat harmonious with that original pizza building because it 's fairly iconic in the town mr deputy mayor can i just ask if there 'll be any cost to council regarding thank you council across and through you mr deputy mayor i guess the cost to council is um loss of opportunity in terms of other commercial activities that could take place on that site um the um the recommendation is quite clear that all maintenance and uh and other costs be met by the the lessee um and that was in fact part of the proposal received from the rotary club of battle and there is no other interest interested parties in in leasing any of that area um not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach made to council to uh to lease that that portion of the former canary site all right there 's no further questions and i 'll put those recommendations to council and all those in favor against so that 's carried unanimously or deputy mayor i 'll just uh bring counsel this woman back council is now back we can continue the meeting thanks councillor island i can advise you that in relation to item 11.4 uh council resolved unanimously to support the recommendations one to five 11.5 update on the status of the rosewood community shed three recommendations have a mover and secondary cancel the right counselor hand i see you yeah okay uh any discussion yeah i 'd just like to say that um i think reading this and and having attended their meeting the other night is just a bit early um and we 'll um work out what 's happening with the rosewood golf club then we can do something different maybe or maybe they will or whatever but um i don 't think we have any other choice on this one and uh and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as getting all these committees together um and going through all this process it has um showing some of the faults that have been in our system with our governance and um you know things that we thought were ground weren 't though somebody else 's or whatever so um i i feel a bit for the committee they 're very hard working and they 're very dedicated to rosewood and it 's a pity they have to this has to drag on a bit for them but um i thank them for their patience yeah and i think it 's really not our fault if you like um and we 'll continue to support them and see how we can help along the way yeah well if there 's no further discussion i 'll put those three recommendations all those in favor against that 's carried unanimously all right 11.6 and just note here that councillor benjamin does have a non-pecuniary interest but he 's staying for the discussion and the in the vote i have two recommendations there there was uh councillors alternate discussion um in the workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me to display both the staff recommendation and the alternate from the discussion before you have a mover yep [Music] share that so the officer recommendation is in black and the alternative from the workshop is in blue would you like me to read that out uh mr deputy man oh not not not unless anyone uh is requiring any clarification on it is so everyone happy is that so what we 're asking for there in number two is for the um council group to come back and tell us why they 've made that decision is that what it is about so through the further assessment i mean what are we asking them for well i 'd be inclined to move them and then we could discuss it so one or the other and then okay so what are we moving the the blue up to councils but that in itself is its own discussion either we make the black recommendation two different recommendations or we go with the blue is that nothing uh stopping councillors from making an amendment to to the initial recommendation if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something you need to move something so you could move just item one of the uh second matter and then um discuss whether you wanted to add item to or reword item two or whatever in that discussion good idea to move first that 's all absolute hammy are you moving point one of the blue i i am indeed do we have a second for uh point one of the blue section i can 't see sir so mr mayor is inappropriate is it inappropriate for me to say i 'd move one and two in the black you 've got a mover of 0.1 so cancel this one you 'd have to wait until we 've got a second to hear before we could make a decision about an amendment or a foreshadowed motion or whatever it be yeah so we need to decide on a or for item one or let the item lap is it inappropriate to go into committee before we do these moves you need a mover and a second and before you can go into commitment yeah so counselor right he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's showing that we 're moving in second in one and two but we 're not we 're only moving number one we 're receiving the report full stop you 're moving that in the black right here okay black all right that 's what i 'll second that all right so we 've now got um a confirmation of one received the report on da2020247 proposed dwelling with the touch garage shed bombali avenue bombali and it 's been moved by councillor ham and seconded by councillor wright so now could i ask if we could go into committee we can do that do we have a segment for that counsellor recently councillor hamp do you wish to start off yes oh um i i feel it was thank you very much to the two who presented on this i can understand your passion and um your concerns about about this very much indeed i am learning about this i 'll be interested to hear what um the other counsellors say and i may um at this stage um go towards deferring until i have more information and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um over to others is it possible just to get the tiles back back up ceo because it just yeah further discussion uh councillor benjamin thank you mr deputy mayor um i 'd just like to just point on this um for the whole community as well that have properties on um on floodplains um it 's just really important with this particular um with this particular report that we 've got that just that we 're mindful and obviously um we want to compromise and we want to we want to help anyone that 's actually um wanting to build on floodplains that you know make the right we want to make the right decision um you know because obviously with this particular um report that 's in um there 's two two other lots um that are going into one 's actually in council um and one 's just about to go into council and they 're side by side so we 've just got to um i think we need to just compromise and make the right decision um moving forward for these for these um residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um yes i support what um councillor benjamin has just said i think it 's really important for us to not be negative and not be the naysayers of these situations um we can look around our whole snow valley 's council and see an enormous number of buildings that have been built in flood plains and are continuing to be built in flood areas let 's just look at tom robins main business district and see how often that floods and the caravan park at tumbrumba we just built it there um and at the same time we 're going to disadvantage an incredibly strong investment person who 's done all the diligence the due diligence of looking at where they are and what they 're involved in and and i just don 't think that we need to consider any more than the the um council da application has been recommended to refuse consent we only need to remove that word refuse and these people can go ahead and i really think that 's what we need to do we are aware of the the prop the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a flood plain but at the same time these are properties that are very sought over after in our community and and from what i heard from the young man who wishes to build this property for his family he 's very conscious of where he 's putting it and very aware of the issues involved and we have it on record of what he has said so we we are not in any high risk situation at this point in time so i think we should just remove the word refuse on 9.2 and move on any further uh comments from here councillor cross got a question there no i i totally agree with what counselor isn 't saying that this man is fully well aware of where he is building it he looks to have made every concession to mitigate against the floods or fires whatever might come his way i also note that bombali avenue is a we the ingress whatever in and out of getting in and out of bombay creek could be an issue however we we have heard from the deputy mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its impacts on other people in that area so we were assured by the applicant that he has considered all of that and how he is going to take care of his very precious stock and family so i really feel that that we should support this application yes i lived in that area for a time at mondongo school and uh coming in and out of town there were no major floods during my stay there but i do have some understanding of the area so as other speakers have said this particular applicant has done a lot of homework um he 's not building a house flat on the ground he 's the plans are quite clear that the uh the lowest of yeah the the building itself the residential building itself will be two point something uh at least 2.2 meters above flood level that 's the the highest flood level um yes it 's going to be difficult if there is a 100 year flood that uh you know if we need to get in and help people but look north wagga is another area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the relief effort at north wagon after the 1974 disastrous floods i know what happens with floods but i also can see that this particular development is designed to avoid those problems and northwater they 've lifted a lot of houses up to a level not anywhere near as high as he intends to build his house so i don 't see any further reason to discuss the matter i think he has made his appeal to us as councillors and on that basis having respect to what the executive director of community has said earlier on um yeah i think we should just simply refuse this particular petition and say take the word refuse out and give permission for that to happen can i um just say that um in relation to this i agree with all the comments uh wholeheartedly as i 've said i actually live out beyond this road so uh the access and egress for me is an issue in a flood as well and there 's been times where i 've had to stay in town to to maintain my work as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's uncommon to people living in that area in fact we i 've obviously allowed previously a number of um habitats uh in closer proximity to the river than this actual development the you know the staff have obviously found that it doesn 't fit in the hole and there 's a few rough edges which is which is fair enough that 's that 's how they have to interpret it but you know i think it 's our it it it 's it 's our responsibility to apply common sense uh and to me this this is uh this guy 's demonstrated um that he has done his due diligence that he has acted responsibly he 's demonstrated that he has a full understanding of what the uh what the scenarios may well be and i i agree that we should uh grant consent um with two conditions um today and those conditions be that he provides an evacuation management plan um in in conjunction with the state emergency service which he 's already uh advised he spoken to them about and the second consent condition in my view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to provide that in in the contract in whatever form to inform the people who are purchasing that property that that is an issue that was was raised and that blood mitigation evacuation plan or whatever you want to determine it is is attached to that property as a unknown risk so that council provides its responsibility in relation to it i was just going to ask before i make my decision i 'd really like to hear from the executive director of community and corporate service and what he had to say about and and why why at this stage was council thinking of refusing through you mr deputy mayor um the council officers have assessed the application and determined that it doesn 't um meet the objectives of the tumor local environment plan uh for on a number of reasons but primarily um the access and egress to the site uh during the one and one hundred year flood with the entry to the um the property being under 1.2 metres under such conditions um the uh so the council assessing officer uh brought it to council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis that they felt it didn 't make the local environment plan so um the alternative recommendation um or the alternative resolution that 's been uh proposed that which suggested coming uh the allowing for further assessment of the application in order to bring it back to council with a with the full range of um uh you know matters um uh maybe addressed in terms of the um the buildings ability uh you know an engineering report uh showing the building 's ability to withstand flood waters given that the flood waters there are it is in the hazardous flood zone it 's closer to the river and a range of technical matters to be dealt with and in the appropriate conditions applied to any um any recommendation around the planning uh the issuing of the d.a thank you so have they already asked sorry mr me deputy mayor through you um having gone to the situation of saying to refuse the application and bringing it to us those those those questions haven 't been raised with the actual owner yet [Music] uh in this case determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that the um that the da did not meet the objectives of the lep determined rather than put the um the applicant to the time and expense addressing those technical issues um um that had come to council to determine what uh where the council would support a notice of refusal or the alternative and the options listed in the uh in the council report is to um submit the you know defer making a decision or a determination on the matter uh to allow the officers a more complete assessment to bring it back to the council uh so that the uh the matter can be appropriately um conditioned up if i might be just if i might just be a little bit so bold then we should have waited another month before we saw this report and then they would have been able to address those issues and we would be making a report on those issues i 'm sorry through you the key issue remains from the council uh in terms of the lep um the the tumor local environment plan is the access and egress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of those there 's no technical way to address the 1.2 metres of water over the road uh preventing access and egress but you know the uh the matters returning to the building 's um uh ability to deal with being in a flood uh that that needs well that can be built into um the uh um the conditions of the uh of the planet of the da uh when issued so um the the the professional opinion of the officers is that the access and egress is the primary um matter in relation to this so mr mayor through you doesn 't matter we 're making a decision today on what that what what is the access neighbors it doesn 't matter what the building is that 's where it stops and we can make a decision right now we 've got the information well i think at the end of the day the the uh we 're not going to allow our house to be built it doesn 't make the building code it wouldn 't pass the inspections so you know i 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't want um it 's not my it 's not my plan from our undertakings here to to set this uh poor guy on some slippery slope of having to get some hundred thousand dollar uh report from some some water theorist in you know back of kickatin along that 's going to set him back another 12 months and drop everyone mad um you know we know the water is an issue you know surely we we can we can approve the thing subject to him um meeting the technical requirements to to build um in that area i mean surely that could be done uh mr mayor i i have no problem with it it 's regarding the access and exit of the property because we 're not going to get sudden floods are going to raise a water level immediately there 's plenty of warning and i don 't see that as a problem the only thing is if whatever we say today will be a precedent for other people to build on the floodplain and whether you should put some limit on the the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockage of the river or the version of the river i 'm not sure that 's how to mow it on but i i don 't see any basic problem with it as long as it 's all sensible and uh if you drive along the chimney plains area you can see where they 've had houses they still have remnants of the dairies you know which were too too destroyed to get them above the original floods which are now mitigated uh by the blowing down to a large extent i do remember as a kid he seen the river flood there with bloated cattle and fences and trees and things all going down a terrible frightening rush but uh to a young kid i suppose it all was frightening but i just think in this day and age there 's a blowing dam and the warnings that we get about floods i don 't see that there 's any threat to human life in any building there and it 's it 's sort of guy that 'll bring lot of work to the town a lot of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn 't this why we have an lep so we have guidelines mr deputy mayor can i make a comment please don 't say yeah councillors are looking to work towards an approval would recommend that we don 't just approve it that we actually asked for a further report back with appropriate conditions if council was too inclined to to approve the site given the discussion that we 've had today rather than to just go for a broad scoping approval as mr holton has indicated it is a newly lodged application so it hasn 't been in with council for a long period of time and that would enable us to have some further discussions uh with the owner and his consultant who have presented to council and we could come back to the december council meeting with a set of conditions that might be appropriate to approving the development and council could consider those conditions and if you 're unhappy with those conditions we could work through the changing and the wording to the conditions but a blanket approval would not be a recommended way to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was it was at the the december meeting didn 't you just say that um the conditions of building and so on already exists i mean isn 't what we 're looking at is the access and so on that 's there anyway that 's not going to change as paul has said that 's not going to change that doesn 't matter what your building designs like that access and idris are still going to remain the same so that 's all we 're making a decision on but there 's also the uh the issue of the how the building can withstand the flood that comes through so i think but that would be part of the whole building design acceptance there 's not any any uh detail about that i think that 's what you 're getting at isn 't it is there no detail on that in the in the submission yeah mr holton would you like to respond to that yeah certainly that was a matter that we would have um been you know under further uh assessment of the application we would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was my understanding but the getting in and out he 's fully well aware of that and he and as we 've talked about before floods are not going to come up and down quickly he 'll have time to get out so i would prefer to see that we get more information about how the building will withstand the floods and come back to the december meeting with that cause turn well i i don 't know why we can 't approve it subject to him providing a um an engineer 's report that says it can withstand the thing of it i mean if an engineer says it 's going to withstand it then it 's not for us to say to the engineer that it 's not i mean we could already say that now subject to him providing that that information i mean that 's not rocket science i agree councillors can can i advise you that you 're running a higher risk process approving it with some information that you don 't know what the end result is going to be a four week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not even four weeks it 's running on the 10th of december isn 't unreasonable amount of time to properly consider this matter and come back with recommendations that are that are very clear and conditions that are clear around council 's intent to approve um this development we 've heard very clearly what you 've had to say today and what the consultants have had to say and i believe that with a bit more discussion there that we could work through something because otherwise the the conditions might not actually suit the consultant or the owner of that particular development as well so we would be uh better working through that together and bringing a report back in december agreement we agree mucking around arguing about something we don 't know about let him just get come back with a proper report for recommendation counselors i have while we 've had this discussion uh drafted up um a little bit addition to that but i do note that councillor smith has been waiting to talk for a while my main concern about this mr chair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of building his house if it 's going to be built and and that we do whatever we do decide we don 't delay a decision unnecessarily and try and expedite this as soon as possible bearing in mind that there are other dwellings already in that area in that flood plain there are other applications before and coming to council for that same area we 're dealing with a bigger picture than just one man building a house and we need to get it right we need to get it right as soon as possible when i look at the attachments that we have in front of us here for this report um there are so many plans so many elements of this this presentation he 's done a flood risk assessment he 's a septic design he 's got flood reports and he 's got um site surveys and environmental effects and his site plan and so much that our council team must have looked at before they came to decide no because of the egress of the of the actual site surely they 've not looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at it so we 're still only deciding whether it 's just to do with you coming in i mean that 's there 's a lot of information there um and if i may just make one other comment through you mr deputy mayor whilst the access and egress you know is a very very uh clear um issue from a planning perspective and you know like having people residing in an area that they can 't get in and out of um as has been sort of pointed out in the report to council the area is considered a high hazard flood area and further into the report um it uh it also notes that our development uh control plan um does uh almost prohibits or does prohibit um development in high hazard flood areas so um there 's a whole range of matters there that um that require further investigation and um and reporting back to council um knowing what council 's view on the matter is um it would be a matter of bringing the special report back to council and addressing some of those matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter um it did so with uh the full uh range of facts at their at their disposal councils we could also supply some risk evaluation of approval with conditions in that report as well sounds good like me to share the screen deputy mayor with an alternative that 's wrong so what i 've got suggested there is a little bit in purple down there so the defer making a determination for the da and request council staff report back to council at the december 2020 meeting with the conditions appropriate for council to consider the matter if council is inclined to approve the da if if councillors were inclined to go down that path the um movers and seconders of the original motion would have to withdraw that and we would have to put up an alternative motion given your own committee of councils my wish to discuss what 's your views i 'm happy to withdraw and have that that 's fine because it 's it 's not saying no it 's saying with conditions for us to consider the matter we 're not saying no we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to be positive about what we want to do and say look we really want to help you yes we want you to have it but we just need to continue to consider a few more things personally i would just like to take out reviews and let him go ahead but never mind i 'll accept that i agree with you recommendation yeah i agree with that stop sharing the screen so the american deputy mayor can see everyone clearly move away out of committee out of committee first yes councillor wrestleman 's moving we 're going to committee do we have a secondary the council all those in favor it 's unanimous okay and then uh let 's cancel uh him and this one and i think is it yep um so are you uh prepared counsellors to um so we just don 't even receive it and we look at it in december yeah good plan um okay so we 'll just need to move uh for the new uh resolution which uh do you want that back on the board or you 're happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cancel a recently any further discussion all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor is anyone against it no no all right that 's uh could be here we maybe just i don 't know whether it 's appropriate mr c but if if there is anything that uh is flagged in that uh report that you think may will be uh uh requires some further work do you think that could be flagged at an earlier workshop or something with us so that we can work through it counsellors will once we 've got that work through with the developer and the owner we will circulate a draft report around for councillors consideration and we will if needs be run a formal gathering with the developer the owner the relevant council officers and the councillors that are interested in having that discussion all right 12.1 uh minutes at the audit risk an improvement committee three recommendations mover tesla ham counselor benjamin any discussion i would like to refer mine over to councillor cross who was actually at the meeting there were no issues raised or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor against that 's carried unanimously all right batlow development league 12.2 three recommendations you have a mover counsellorism cancel across anyone wish to speak if i may um is that possible for them for what they 've mentioned their phones allocated for the pedestrian crossing to be moved to the toilet block i mean is that just by the sky stuff is that happening if i may um mr deputy man the project that was originally approved by the administrator that is within the general scope of that so it is possible so it 'll be a refurbishment for that facility mr corsh may wish to provide further comment on that or not just while we 're waiting for mister so the pedestrian crossing is not going to go ahead now through your deputy mayor councillor island my understanding of the crossing is that once we get the 40 kilometer speed zone sorted we will then be able to review and see if we can get the crossing in but we will be looking at uh securing funding for that so in order to meet the um timelines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had we 've reallocated it to the to the toilets um because we just weren 't going to get the crossing in in the time that was allowable to us we 're still hoping to get the crossing in but on the speed zone so talkings or crossings in batlow the one from the top h to the school needs a a bit of a revamp a bit of a paint just looking really hard to see that that long bow being drawn again counselor hand oh just on the topic any i 've yeah nothing further all right all those in favor against let 's carry it unanimously 12.3 the minutes of the can carbon coover cancel a ham councilor benjamin do you wish to speak cancer here i 've just got three very quick points one is um congratulations to dean cameron who 's going to get that store up and open which is just brilliant for that shopping precinct which looks so fantastic now it 's been redone um probably i 'm not sure i might be for the executive director of um community and corporate um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening from these minutes with the country club and the cag hoban hall at the moment mr through you mr deputy mayor um the i 'll start with the ken cobin hall and i just advised that i met with um the uh president of the uh tumbrama chamber of commerce commerce recently uh he has accepted a uh he and the committee have accepted a tender for the removal of the asbestos uh in the building uh which is well within the budget that they have for the funding that they received so that uh project is um is uh about to begin which is really good news um in respect to the can coven country club um the um as as i understand it the um they the debt that they had with the car with the bank of new south wales i think was why uh was was written off by the bank um and um and council is still awaiting the resolution uh and the issuing of titles in respect of a uh allotment that council agreed to purchase in respect of the decision uh that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the country club 's financial situation okay yeah so and so really it 's nothing to do with us is it the country club council doesn 't uh own or operate um it 's operated entirely by the committee um who are still uh incorporated as at this time and um but there is a small matter of you know the issuing of titles um so that um council may just um end its its involvement i think we still uh they there are still uh there are still rates and things like that that the country club needs um to address uh issues around rates that they may need to address with council lovely thank you happy to move oh sorry over to council with me councillors here yes another item in relation to uh ken cobin the only coffee shop was shut down recently trev 's place and those people that are going to operate the new store have stepped in and they are opening it and running it six days a week full time extended hours to benefit the visitors and the people of cancoben and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so we look forward to them getting their their business up and running and then i don 't know what will happen to the coffee shop but it very likely will continue on in some form or another all right if there 's nothing further then i 'll put that uh all those in favor against that 's carrying what that brings uh to close the ordinary section of the council meeting the local government act provides that council may close to the public that part of the meeting that deals with matters of a confidential nature section 10 2 lists such matters the grounds on which a

a good fund as as i understand it if it 's a new it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's being replaced council plays the whole lot and usually uh government departments don 't pay anything so council worth the full cost in this case is that there is a slight difference if it 's a new development so it 's a new government entity we do negotiate with them but there 's no requirement as such to contribute for a government and my next question for you mr mayor we went to we learned about recycled tyres being able to be used as a substitute for concrete the advantage of those is that the water will percolate through rather than cause root damage and i note that there are lots of trees beautiful gum trees along that path and i would ask that when the report is being put together that that is considered as a substitute for concrete thank you council that will be the case yes thank you anything further thank you that 's carried unanimously [Music] 10.1 councillors uh the draft council sealed policy for adoption thank you councilmember that 's of course fairly self-explanatory any comment unanimous thank you councillor 10.2 financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just about the monthly going over the budget by you know a significant 11 11.6 over the budget with employee costs now and every month this is um most of it is recoverable under disaster management planning or commercial work income so um i suppose my point is is that our budget our year-to-date budget obviously didn 't take into account the grants and um i just want to be assured that although it 's 11 over we are basically getting most of that uh money back so that is my first question do you see it this is a year to date report so from the beginning of the year all the extra costs have been accumulated that 's why it 's higher every month it 's not a monthly report and you are correct we are being refunded for these additional costs from a number of different funding bodies question two just so so to the cfa that 's okay so you 've got no concern we 're pretty much on par with the budget as it should be when it comes to employee costs through you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on par with the qbi3 however this monthly report compares to the original budget so all the adjustments that were made in qbi 1 2 and 3 are not reported here because the financial reporting goes against the original budget okay that makes sense thank you very much and my second question is probably more to the director of infrastructure that 's okay is just i i 'm wondering about the design and construction of the telbingo boat ramp continuing to gain weight and is that happening and when through you mr mayor cancer cancer ham the um the pontoons are currently being fabricated and i understand uh very close to completion the next phase of the project will be then to install those on site and undertake works on the actual boat ramp to accommodate that we are reliant on the water level being dropped for that so we 're in close consultation with snowy hydro in regard to the timing last i heard we should be on site by the end of this month pending water levels thank you council costs yes um i noticed in here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wondered what the story was behind that is apologies through you mr mayor council cross it is in a large part due to the additional private works that we were able to secure thank you anything further counsellors that 's enough information all in favor generous thank you the how many people um i 'm just bringing up the main cash disbursement there just um looking at fogo and um it 's more of a comment than a question if that 's all right mr man just to say i went along to the fogo launch and the um play for the children of the snowy valleys council and just how very very well done that is i love the marketing that 's coming out and the energy that is in the whole council area which bogo are coming out so congratulations to everybody i don 't i reiterate that nothing positive there 's been some discussion about the new rubbish bins that have been delivered and the fact that they i know this is not totally related but what it would be to bring it up that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not coming out of revenue is that correct i 'll ask the uh yeah through you through you mr mayor um cancel across yeah that 's correct the um the organic bins are funded externally through some grant funding through the epa the actual bin harmonisation project which is the replacement of the other bins the general waste bin and some of the recycling bins that sells that 's funded through cancel through the the waste charge um mr benjamin i know you wrote about the financial assistance grants have we received anything corresponding to that not unaware of but um it was very much discussed at the alba conference there was some some very clear messages sent to the government um so we 've just got to watch this space but i can 't see it changing the future is drinking water management system annual report 2020. that 's the cross council of infrastructure about the security of our water supply how secure is it from by the physical attacks or cyber attacks and what 's in place to protect our water supply from things like disaffected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water treatment plants uh are all secured in the defense their um swipe card access um and staff are very mindful of potential threats and and do and do regularly monitor for that as well as that we we do do regular monitoring of the water quality and we 've got various alarm systems in in in place attached to those facilities we also make water ahead of time so for example uh turmeric we 've got about 24 hours capacity in the system so when we make water pump it up to the to the reservoirs we 've got a 24 hour gap there so if there was an issue we could dump water and make more water if we if if we had to before it got into the reticulation system and thank you three year mr mayor councillor cross uh we also have a cyber security report coming up to the risk and improvement committee at the next meeting which talks about what council 's progress is and we recently had an external provider doing on our council systems and processes and a couple of other council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite good we do have further work that has to be done and that will [Music] driver thank you a community consultation finance report and spatial assessment plans for the former batman cannery side there has been a lot of discussion in the community about the canary site a lot of investigations a lot of ideas have been put forward and various planes and you know people that put forward their own particular plans and uh the fact that this process has been undertaken and is now completed completion is very welcome because it gives some basis um for looking at the future for this site which is a very complex issue with lots of things to be considered with it um so yeah these plans that have been put forward or ideas have been performed under this plan i think uh very helpful for the patellar community to think about the and it is such a large and visibly visible highly visible site for residents and visitors to battle and there 's a lot of potential for it and i think it 's good that they 've got something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more detailed assessments and plans future use of that site thank you council smith this to me is probably one of the uh one of the particular highlights of the [Music] of our tenure in the council to to essentially uh inherit what was an asbestos mess uh you know that was ravaged by fire after after we after we 'd come up with a plan to fix it and you know to be at this point now you know just for the staff to get get to the point where now we 're looking at uh this sort of uh ongoing um uh use for the site is remarkable i mean i don 't think anyone in butler uh four years ago would have thought this plan would have been here now so it 's testimony to what can be achieved thank you council lada nothing further yes yes sir thanks for listening sorry thank you mr may um through you i 'd just like to um compliment the report in recognizing the investment contribution that 's been made through the pine plantation um enterprise and and its realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we need we need people to come forward with investments to further develop this site and um and i just reiterate i complement the um the plan in recognizing um that established business thank you councillor the investment not only helps butler it helps the entire region with the uh the seedlings around there councillor ham uh i 'd just like to admit a former councillor who 's sadly passed away um cedric and how pleased you 'd be that people that this report is taking up his suggestion of residential independent living he would be delighted thank you all right i 'll put the motion all in favor let 's put some unanimous 1.3 declaration of new dog off leash areas that 's the ham that 's the cross council great to see this is finally coming up just got a bit of a problem with the fact that the red line goes down the middle of the creek and my dog i know will not stay on one side of the creek um just if we could talk to the director of corporate head and community if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easement on any other side of the creek which surely there just has to be um just through common sense mr holt yes thank you uh through you mr mayor um the the uh the area that we uh um advertised that would be declared was i guess the area that um that is indicated in the map that was uh provided with the report um the issue of dogs wanting to swim across the uh the creek um i i guess i 'm not sure that our um local laws officers will be paying that much attention to to dogs doing that and if they do i 'm sure owners will be able to get them back noting that regardless of their status is off leash all dogs are required to be under effective control of their owner um so that 's a given no matter whether it 's at off-leash area or not um i 'm not sure about the uh the provision of a um a uh an easement um or or the existence of an easement along that area uh however i would gladly take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further information thank you thank you smith mr man the summer members of the community and tumblr have commented on the the fact that the other side of the creek ought to be included in this affliction area and wonder why it wasn 't included i understand that because this area that has been marked as of soft leash was being used that way unofficially uh however in the future should that uh be be considered desirable to extend the area to the other side of the creek as well uh there would be no problem in putting forward another another proposal to do that i can 't see an issue with it mr holton would there be an issue with um passing this and then in the future extending the the to the other side of the creek uh through you mr may um the the um area that was advertised is the area that um that we 're proposing and because it was um there was support for that general support for that we 're putting that forward as the the area for declaration were we to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process we would need to re-notify it so in order to get the tumbarumba community the an off-leash area as quickly as um as they can given their general support for an off-leash area in in bicentennial park we put this recommendation up to council for today 's meeting in the future should there be um you know if we if we wish to extend it it 's a simple process of um re-notifying um the extended area and then bringing it back to council all right that 's that 's what we want to hear thank you any further counsellors put the motion all in favor unanimous thank you thanks for your work on that one uh recovering resilience grants 11.4 council hand council there 'd be some very happy organizations after these are granted nothing further with the motion oh you want to say well i 'll just say you know that just that goes to show that not everything 's down this end of the uh one of those is for chairman the rest of them are you know elsewhere majority of them in tumba rumba so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that we don 't disperse funds he 's he is evident [Music] 4.1 minutes of the diag translate across counselor hand just across yes if i have an issue with the terms of reference that they 've put forward i find their objectives one of their objectives is really very very badly written and it really doesn 't make much sense so i really can 't support accepting this current terms of reference so what do you suggest if you haven 't so do you want do you want to let this lapse until the next meeting well i can give you what i see should be right um but i 'm not quite sure how you will do the research [Music] can we change the word you can change the wording at this meeting if it 's not a sorry through the chair if it 's not a substantial change we could just do that but if it is a substantial change then we 'll have to go back to second one so yeah okay so if you look at the number five objectives of the committee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans actions and projects in order to facilitate access to services facilities and activities which within the area for people who have disability and their carers i prefer to see something along the lines of provide feedback to council 's plans and pro actions and projects in order to facilitate access to allow appropriate access to services facilities and activities for people with disability and their carers i think that makes a lot more sense good journey could we please slowly reread your statement thank you to provide feedback to council 's plans actions and projects in order to allow appropriate access to services facilities and activities for people with disability and their carers i think that makes a lot of sense given the current statement in the objectives i would say that 's a minor change and it should be okay and it 's just one one thing errol todd dot point four one d in todd [Music] so that concludes the ordinary meeting um the open section uh local government act provides the council may close close to the public that part of the meeting that deals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters the grounds on which a meeting is closed the public must be specified in the decision to close the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the meeting we have recommendations here that council move into

regulation 2005 which gives council of discretion to allow councils to attend to remotely under exceptional circumstances north payton unanimous thank you counselor do we have any declarations of the canary interest stage thank you nothing from the public forum across gives us um i was just wanting to follow up on the sculptures that were um so kindly donated to the snorri valley 's council is there a timeline on when they should be delivered um i believe the um uh that they are scheduled to be uh i i guess installation finalized in july and there 's a working group let 's look at the sculptures and as there 's a um an advisory committee that was established by sculptures by the sea that involves art experts as well as some local input and uh i believe they 've met and come up with a short list wonderful thank you mr holland council i was going to ask if there was any update to that sculpture so they got the money funding to do that um no that 's still clearly uh f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's going to be down but there has been um some sculptures donated by the australian new zealand danish association organisation to install three sculptures in uh correspondence no promotions no miracle minutes 10.1 councillors training opportunity the recommendations ask the latter council again that 's hello any others discussion emotional in favor um i feel we live in a great council area within our counselors down there work very hard and the remuneration um reflects this and i would also like this to be [Music] this increase because we 've got new councillors coming up and it does come out across being in council and um you know at the moment i forgot to get my car fixed because it was just by kangaroo on the way back from a um a council event and i just think this money at least you go well at least i 've got some sort of um incidental expenses that come from being council trust me oh i don 't speak against i believe that we 're out with our great players saying how we can 't afford anything and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well you know we don 't really need that two percent so we shouldn 't impose on our ratepayers that extra cost all that not all that much for us all those little things add up to a you know when you look at the remuneration that 's offered the councillors that may need to come into the 21st century and this is just ridiculous if you want to attract people to local government then you need to do as they 've done in other states and make it very competitive and um and remunerate it for the work that 's done uh you know people are getting more money than this for sitting on board four times a year um you know when you equate it to what 's uh you know required of of counsellors and i mean there 's obviously good counsellors and there 's councillors who don 't do a lot of work but our council is very good i know that um it 's like any profession there 's those that do the minimum and those that go beyond and i know everyone here goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good that the superannuation hopefully will be included um for the next term of council i think that 's a very positive move in the right direction but i feel that these fees need to be reviewed thank you thank you thank you very much uh governance and finance reports new council implementation fund ncla wonderful to see so many uh with the in the status column completed [Music] this really is an amazing result but particularly really i think it 's fantastic that you 've been able to get so much interest on those on the funding around those projects because that has meant that that can cover getting an expert project management team in place for the only stuff to support that so it reduces the need to actually use that money to supply that so i think it 's an absolutely excellent job it 's really good could i just ask a question more about it financially i 'm noticing here that if a if one of these projects coming under budget that money can be used elsewhere is that is this a one-off thing or can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair counseling numbers and redistribution within the program but not outside the program that is fairly unusual usually it has to stay with everything and you 're equipped okay and i think that recognized the fact that uh these um opportunities and ideas were developed very quickly during the multiple process they didn 't have much project planning so once that project planning happened the scope changes a little bit the cost evaluation changes a little bit so it allows for that flexibility definitely thanks a lot and i just say to all those people that are passing judgment uh they 've obviously got blinkers on i mean because you 've only got to look at what 's been completed and undertaken in the areas of batlow and tumbarumba etc do cetera to understand that this council has in my view over i mean the the the bat load of caravan park for example um tumbrum caravan park i mean the tumblr on the caravan park was a basket case before we fixed it it was it was losing and now it 's making uh the amenity there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic what we 've been able to achieve in this council and the improvements that have been made throughout the state valley 's council areas it 's it 's a credit to uh to the um staff that have undertaken the work and the contractors and the state federal government for helping us develop those uh assets and uh infrastructure and uh and for us for uh having that the gumption to actually get on and do it yes i 'd like to comment on the purchase of the ken goblins which was completed in march this year and it 's noting there that the contract of sale has been withdrawn and replaced with a an intent to purchase after a two-year lease and renovations have commenced i can report that the renovations are more or less complete and it is now operating very successfully uh in fact the results have far exceeded the expectations of the new messi and i 'm very confident that the intent to purchase will be completed in two years time because it is such a great success and such an asset to the can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tumor district community transport advisory committee sorry operational plan 10.4 thank you um um thank you for this i i just had one question about the i find that the development of the new draft lep since i 've been on council for three and half years it 's like the lmv is going to happen the early p 's going to happen and people are going well what 's going to be in the new lep and here we are three and half years into our council period and we don 't have an led just wondering we met with uh representatives of the department of planning industry environment uh last year to discuss uh the harmonisation of the leps uh our initial um thoughts were that we would do a very quick harmonization and just basically pull the best bits from each one the department felt that it was it would be better to do a much more thorough lep and throw the whole thing everything up in the air and have a really good look at it additionally they did mention you know the boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it may be better to do some preliminary scoping work in this financial year and launch into the uh a really thorough review of the lep to give the best of the best can get so to that end we are currently undertaking a rural land use study and the next project will be a residential uh land study uh which will feed into um a comprehensive uh lep which really should get the settings right rather than just doing a plain harmonization of the two so really examine the you know the needs that we have in respect of agricultural land and things like that so and the changing conditions related to those eventually okay and that pool of money still remains to do it going into the next one so i 'm at the moment exploring opportunities to get further funding to undertake the uh the studies so we 've used the funding that was available for the lep to fund the rural land use strategy which is very important because prior to uh you know when the form the other leps were put together the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is now there have been you know the advent of the horticultural industry sort of with berries wine etc in the southern end of the municipality really drives a different kind of set of needs and uh so if we 're going to do the lev i think it 's really important that we do it right and dpie uh in i guess advice just the same and hopefully because they 've advised us they will actually financially support us actively uh finding ways to assist us okay thank you thank you hello on one of the operation um items 3.5.1 about three homing of animals and i wondered how um we seem to have lost some of the organizations we have lost those organizations uh we might take that on notice unless anyone can answer it through you [Music] like which is really a great benefit with telling letting yourself know what 's happening but i just wonder how that 's how it easily showed that everyone will see something [Music] that all those forms of communication is there a check on that they actually do recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about actually getting out to those areas including our uh remote uh works work areas like can cover and battle and add along that they are actually printed out and given to those staff in those areas all of our other communication is uh followed up through our supervision processes as well so the staff do use my newsletter and some other information to inform their toolbox talks and their meetings about their staff thank you and just one more 5.3.1 us shoulders for schools i just wondered is that our responsibility or is that the education department systems [Music] etc um 2.2.6 uh actively gives you opportunities to promote the region and they do talk a little bit about them about the human model track i 'm aware that the humans will question them by centenary is coming up in 2024 and that they seem a long time away but have we got a working group that 's going to start through the chair council again um believe that our economic development tourism team are currently working with the cuban hockey people around the bicentenary and uh they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thank you further [Music] district community transport advisory [Music] is [Music] [Music] initiative [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you adoption of gifts and benefits procedures around anybody it 's pretty self-explanatory sort to me again paul taylor mr nervous thank you governance and finance reports 10.8 that 's the hand um thank you to the seafood for thanking me so well i 'm concerned about this bushfire grant money with the milestone and the pushed by hearing um we 're doing a lot of work that way which is huge and as i have to agree with council a lot of what this council has achieved particularly synthetic however um are we being you know we 're looking at sustainability are we being paid for this are we being covered is there money outstanding uh how is this affecting us financially for you um we currently have over nine million dollars um what works outstanding that we are claiming from a variety of funding bodies the majority of this is the wrong side clean up but there 's also work on other roads and um can you mitigate blood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put in it is a very obvious and time consuming process get the money back and we expect to be reverse equal with the demand yes over 90 dollars in cash outstanding and when are we expected to get this money i wouldn 't be going to give you that so i would like to um suspiciously move a motion that we write a letter to mr elliot um to either see him or simply write a letter saying this isn 't good enough we we 're paying we 're in a financial bio um vulnerable situation and the state 's not supporting us at all um so do you want to add that as number two the recommendation yeah absolutely and should we go and visit him yes minister for police and emergency services and we are requesting uh meetings with ministers on the 10th of june at the moment we have some confirmations of those so we could ask minnesota but it 's a matter of urgency you can write to him thank you councillor benjamin are you happy with that in january so we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors on 10th of june [Music] um um [Music] um it is a good time to borrow money but we also have a foreign policy that we have to adhere to thank you another question the reseal contract 70 19 000 um was that a private works contract or was that just what was that just out of business as usual [Music] across um we did both we did two resealing programs one under our road maintenance contract with transport for new south wales um which is which is under our commercial works arrangements and then we did approximately 30 kilometres of reseal so we managed to deliver that program with the very tight hotlines we had a wet start a very wet start to the construction um so yeah great job to get that a little bit on time excellent thank you thank you through you now i just wanted to commend the team in regards to the resealing that 's been recently done for our whole council area they 've done a fantastic job and i 've been getting some really good feedback on that so thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there i just wanted to make a further statement about that money that 's outstanding from the uh from the minister of emergency services i think it would also be um silly of us not to uh take up with him because i can 't believe the government would uh would be allowing this to happen but if i 'm not mistaken mr cash might be able to explain a bit better but there was also a crazy situation where we had to take individual photographs of like 4 000 guide posts or something to send off for this nonsense i mean who would who would allow that sort of garbage to go on and go it 's just madness but somebody 's had to sit down and individually take four thousand pictures i would guide you no four thousand different people yeah that 's not the same that sort of information in our submission to the grants inquiry process um and made it very clear about making sure that those processes are administratively suitable so the cost of doing them doesn 't outweigh the cost of um practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays attention to it of course you didn 't want to given we 're recording this in a different method that we all project our voices very well so that it can go through on the recording on the live stream you 're having trouble hearing me we can i was we were going to committing about this very well presented report you can move that way do you have a second counselor across are we not invited yes we are thank you um i 'd like to discuss with this cfo it 's okay like uh looking at this at the moment it looks like we are gonna have a profit of nine million dollars which makes me very excited and then the next one and then operating result before capital items they were going to make a loss of 3.2 can you just explain the difference there um i do know but it seems to me that every year we come to this place and it looks like we 're doing okay but then you 've got to take away all the grant money but the grant money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to you know put up you know to agree with us to put our rates up however we we seem to have this system in new south wales at the moment that we don 't have enough money to to cover or everything operationally and yet it comes to this stage where we do because we 've had grants but the grants aren 't allowed to be covered in um in the bottom line so i um you know i can see why people aren 't that excited for putting the rates up because it seems like there 's enough money but then then you and then you say well no there 's not because we 've got to take away those grants that we seem to get every year anyhow um the problem with looking at this is that the capital is on this property loss whereas the capital expenditure are in separate account so we are we are expanding all this um capital income on capital extension which doesn 't show up in the operational expenditure it is an anomaly in the way of reporting this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capping items is the one that we are benchmarked against by the office of long-term it is supposed to be in positive territory in other words above zero and we 're going to beat three million down that is the forecast at this stage three months yeah so if we if we got say the nine what did you say how much is outstanding for bushfires so if we got that in before the 30th of june it would be okay well that is that is purely cash flow yes in the attachment page 62 on page 13 of 17 whatever you 're looking at and so we have something like the cash and investments council consolidated okay i 'm concerned well basically i 'm concerned about the asset replacement of 531 000 which is the extension to the depot office space so this these these two things were not planned for the they weren 't in our budget weather and so um the extension to maybe you could speak to why do we need that and then i 'd like to talk about the design of the next section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item that has come to be during the year as we progress through [Music] been in discussion for some time and been being accelerated uh this financial year due to the uh traineeship and community chips that we 've been bringing on board so we 've got a trainee project manager and we 're in discussion at the moment to bring you the trainee cadet engineer and hopefully too so we need that additional space at the veto to accommodate those trainees 231 000. yeah um and yeah and we 've been managing um shortages at the depot for quite some time um so it sorts that those pre-existing issues out as well and provides us with me and if it didn 't happen now it 'll happen after the 30th of june so um the look i would love the brindabella road to be done but i i just feel that we 're going out to the public talking about the srv talking about um light costs of things talking about depreciation and now we want another 300 our budget to design the next section of the brindabella road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it i don 't know if we can afford it so is this a proven spend of three hundred thousand dollars [Music] oh and i i just don 't know if this is the right time to be i just think for 300 000 um and i know um it 's going to help what 's in our advocacy plan but i was under the understanding we might revisit our advocacy plan in look at sustainability this three hundred thousand dollars in this last quarter just seems a bit excessive when to me you could probably get a grant for the three hundred thousand dollars for the bridle bella road and yeah i mean the end of the day has local government ever been sustainable i i mean you know like we 're always running on a trajectory that 's down you know the old tumblr council said they were fit for the future but they were running on about a 25 grand income so you know maybe they weren 't fit for the future maybe they were just good at getting grants so you know i i love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take responsibility for them in the hope that they 'll build your population and build your growth and their opportunities and you know we 've historically taken on assets things like say the batlow literacy institute you know like we 'll let it run down for 50 years and then we 'll put in for a grant to get a liquor paid for it and that 's how we 've operated um and as it is was you saw during the uh some of the long weekends we 've had dreams have been invasive you couldn 't get around the town if the window road goes in and then go on the google maps is the shortest route between the southern states and canberra this place has become like another brainwave or something don 't expect me but yeah i think it destroyed the in the top of the township nightly okay okay original name that 's not me [Music] is um we won 't be actively pursuing the collection of the old things right there get away from you um the album 's um intention is to recover them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into new things so it closes that whole apple cycle uh yeah someone feels as though they 've got another use for them uh yes correct the the bodies are completely made from recyclable terrain uh the lids and then the red bin is going to be larger than we currently have uh yes three years um yeah it goes from uh the tube that the general most things here in tune that are about 120 later the u1 should be 140 liter and that will be consistent across the fga thank you okay thanks very much all right sort of information there put the motion in favor against let 's cancel him against week in review update yeah councilman spent before we actually move forward just like the highlight suggest to do it to just um yes which is to improve one voucher to remain available for each eligible residential property within the lga reporting [Music] in that order yes you yes well that amendment certainly goes a long way to help deal with the confusion that 's out in the community about the change to this process i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just outline in a simple form what this change actually is going to mean to the community through through mission there i suppose it um gives us a an alternative that 's closer aligned to the quarterly free race reviews that [Music] they 'd be eligible to apply for another voucher for the next quarter so similar to lace weekends if you miss one you can go to the you can go that should alleviate the concerns in the community that they were only going to have the one opportunity each year but now they do have the opportunity to do it once a quarter each year just encourage everyone to download the app um so that it makes it an easy transition and what this will allow is to ensure that you know we don 't end up with 300 box trailers turning up on the one day and you know people getting frustrated you know they 're sitting in line for now so you can essentially pick your date and it suits you and hopefully you know it 'll all be a lot smoother i think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's [Music] rather than just dump them just don 't happen to know so it 's very it 's going to be a new room because it means that the community will sort their rubbish that so that less will go to landfill which in turn is okay all right so counselor thank you mr mayor um i just wanted to ask if say for example if someone doesn 't have the app and they 're waiting to get the vouchers how is there another way that we 're going to be able to either put a mail the technology they consider coming to customer service excellent thank you thank you thank you this will eliminate the possibility of people coming from outside that area and using the waste as well if it 's linked to an address because i think that currently happens and also means that people won 't store up all their their waste and then come and just now we 're looking at implementing it for the next financial year and then we 'll review it again as part of our budget process and excellency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meaning was that people want to come and do multiple trips in around multiple race facilities like that like has been happening that would be eliminated as well that 's right just when this was all first mentioned um there was something called bobs for people on farms which was the bank of bins just just um i 've been excited about that ever since but it seemed conference i went to which was absolutely excellent they talked about you know um it was some vegan council talked about getting a pair of funding to look at banks and things for people um anyone else i have read it children 's services policy for public exhibition in counseling and council across i 've also read it and seems to support the children 's services strategic aboriginal cultural heritage assessment for land has to be resigned as industrial that 's going forward new south wales public spaces legacy program two here we go and the castle cross yes suggesting are we all the time of going to communities [Music] could i just start saying that sometimes people say as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tumbarama playground and the amenities there that get flooded every year and being a concern of myself but people in tumbarumba particularly in the tub of test committee every year when all the toilets block up and this has been mentioned to council and i just want to congratulate people who have taken this to task and have really worked hard to and now we 've got a letter saying hey we can have it so i 'm just delighted about this part i know um others talk about pioneer um as well but thank you very much to the people who scoped this who made it possible and i certainly will be voting for that and with the top rubber rotary pioneer park um very excited about that i i probably more as an outsider i 'm a little bit confused about how this is a little bit close to what lately miller also um offered and so are we going to get them involved and say great you know you want something we 've got some money for can we work together uh landscape designers or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stick in this space accepts this offer for uh funding and the black mcmillan foundation has expressed that they would like to see what the end product is and they will consider funding components of that plan um they have been offered a position on the working club i believe at this stage they 've declined that position but they 're interested in steward in the project and evaluating all the actions yeah because i think this is a golden opportunity to provide facilities the community has been calling out more toilets down there and this gives us a wonderful opportunity to provide that community it 's also investing you know our young people and and then that 's something that has people in the community have been saying that we need to grow our population and if we 've got really attractive place spaces for our children that are exciting creative and really give them an opportunity to to problem-solve and i think that you know that is really going to um make our area very special the i know that late night foundation used a consultant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ english and philosophy so i think it would be really good if we could if we get creative about the why the kinds of things that we put into that to pioneer part then hopefully it will reduce the impact on council 's [Music] is just wonderful as it is now i go through it regularly and uh yeah it 's got an atmosphere about us but that 's that 's what nature made it and we have to be very careful if we don 't destroy the destroyer but play your areas there already [Music] we should interfere too much with the [Music] very artificial i mean villapar could do with some proper signage uh more tables and things like that i think the money should be spent spend over the full length of the river walk not just not enough buying it though thank you councilman i think i think this is more than one that 's right i think less is more is sometimes and uh needs to be done to fit in with the environment i don 't think it needs to be too unofficial yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying because i think we were probably on the council of not tackling this in the first place and people have probably forgotten very quickly but that precinct was the subject of severe flow uh not just you know minor fighting it was you know above the playground um and would have caused um hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to that equipment haven 't been there um and i think what you 're saying mr mayor is right it 's it 's sometimes less is more and um you know there 's an issue down there with the toilets and i know that 's probably something that needs to be looked at in that thing um with this money but uh you know in relation to the blackney miller uh foundation you know you know they do wonderful work uh but you know we can 't have a situation like that we 're offering you know we 'll give you the money but you do as we tell you that 's not how it works so i 'm happy for them to be involved but you know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way forward not not a dictatorship um you know the community sets the agenda for this not one organisation so you know we have to encompass everyone um the reality is um you know we 've seen what happens when we get things wrong we 've got that silly bit of concrete down there that you know this labyrinth so that 's a complete matter fast forward they got away with that it 's just six foot of concrete for the ducks to crack on you know and and look what happens it 's madness complete madness that you 'd waste a million dollars on that garbage so that 's that 's you will find you um well i think that 's the overwhelming view of the community i mean there might be a few people who have got their heads um [Music] just two things on very congress of the fact that i sat in montreal theater the other day and people were saying that too much and you know what why are we why are we putting our hands up to improve things and i think from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things but they come at a cost and uh this is one of the examples where you you say yes and you 'll take money and then you 've got the costs of maintaining or you say no and yet you you have a community that 's not as nice as a community that people don 't choose to come to i think that 's a retrograde to other areas thank you mr may just know council richard that we did through this process trying to negotiate across a number of parks across the whole lga and within different localities and the funding body would only accept two specific parts and localities so we did try for a number of our communities um and we weren 't successful with that so the money does it 's very clear the money does have to be spent in uh pioneer park and parking lot and that 's that 's their own so we can apply for other funding through other opportunities but for this particular one has to be in those locations how do you extend the name of i am [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unfortunate that this uh covers two uh distinctly different areas of our shire um because the tumbarumba side of it certainly is going to have less impact on their bottom line because it 's going to save work in terms of annual costs or at least annually if not more uh recovering from floods and things like that uh and i wonder if we can get a um an estimate from our cfo about the actual amount that it 's costing now to do that recovery work after each incident in comparison to the whole life cost of the program uh particularly the tumbarumba program and uh leading on from that are we in a position to be able to accept part of this offer um 1.98 million to do just one part of it and not do the other that 's the clean-up costume two years um yeah i could probably help with a couple of those those questions but yeah the um opportunity to split the funding um yeah we talked to the funding administrator they they were very clear that this is it we can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate it out and very clearly that we have to make a yes or no decision they weren 't giving us an opportunity to offer up or projects thank you can any of that money be used uh is very very specific and we 've had a really difficult time negotiating um or totally modify it or at risk of losing a whole lot of funding won 't take long to get there if we if we refuse to take this offer for all the reasons does that put us at risk certainly there 's some reputational damage given we 've launched the application that the state government is looking for opportunities to provide better spaces for communities [Music] okay recommendations there i 'll put them on the table that 's your name man it was a very productive meeting uh and one of the key things that came out of it was the need for better consultation with council [Music] [Music] you don 't have to say in relation to that uh hiring cost on that easy toilet yeah the mayor and i were part of a um part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um quite substantially too i think it 's a bit disingenuous that you know they want three thousand dollars a day to help at a public function you know i think these people need to have a look at you know what we 're trying to achieve here at social inclusion and you know that to me isn 't addressing any of that that that 's a bit disingenuous thank you i think this is one of the things that we 'll be talking about about the museum is how we can negotiate with that and perhaps put it in a place thank you community transport advisory committee [Music] um two recommendations there [Music] um it was something that i wanted to make i just while you 're thinking of it i just wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate the um side of test i was up there on the weekend it was cold um but certainly it was well organized and uh yeah a lot of people up there and despite the cold they stayed and yes there has been quite a bit of talk about the toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the battle development league that council holds off demolishing the toilets near the tennis courts that 's a memorial park and they are in bad condition and i 've looked at them personally and just cracking the walls and so on so i 'm very happy to see that council has just now and in fact there was a news item there this morning that the mountable toilet has been placed in that area as of today i think and it 's going to be commissioned next week so that there will be continued facilities there um and it seems to me that demolishing the unsafe building um the interim whilst that facility is available it is a something that we need to do and whether it 's built back at a later stage uh to be decided but um one of the issues for the battle development league was that the toilet facilities that were built at the showground have now been closed to the public because of the concerns that campers who were free camping there it 's a great facility for tourists um to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are showers in those facilities but they might use those instead of going to the council caravan park i don 't believe that that would be the case i think that people are going to use either the caravan park or the free camping um so you know for them to use the toilet facilities would not really be very frequent because most of those people have their own onboard facilities so it seems to me that in the longer term those toilet facilities that are excellent um that have been provided should be available to people that are using that local area and the parks in that area um yes just yeah just uh through you through the intention is that before we uh proceed with the demolition works that we undertake the strategy in regard to that space and how we manage public communities across that whole area and then that will take consideration issues such as thank you [Music] that 's does that cover the cost of um the grant for community transport does it cover the cost of vehicle placing um there 's recent changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are now under the terms of the agreement um but we do have a reserve that has been built up before the replacement but um given the changes in the uh contract arrangements uh we 're getting through heavy um the local government act provides the council may close to the public that part of the meeting reveals confidential nature uh section 10 to miss such matters the grounds in which such a meeting is closed for the public most specified decisions the recommendation is the council movement it 's confidential to consider the matters listed in

arising from that nothing okay did i put that motion all in jared thank you um correspondence and petitions there 's nothing no rescission motors notices no merrill uh brings us on to governance with and financial reports 10.1 the annual financial statements we just moved that one mr mayor till later on the agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 42 electronically page 39 on the paper version thank you i 've arrived code of conduct complaints statistics for the reporting period first of september 29th and 31st of august 2020 remember councillor smith councillor ham councillor smith anything to say uh just the comment that uh it is such a miniscule um document there has been very little activity in code of conduct which is very pleasing thank you any other counselors um i was just wondering if we could have an extra recommendation to that to us whether we could write to the minister of local government to have this code of conduct and area of local government better resourced for because what i 've heard and what i 've researched and what i 've seen is code of conducts come in and they take a lot of money and they take a lot of time and i 'm basically a toothless tiger i think it 's something that should all be reviewed so what 's your uh recommendation i think that 's my recommendation is to write to the minister of local government to say can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have in what way move into second are happy with that uh mr mayor the um just the matter has been moved and seconded by uh council smith councillor ham so if you uh those councils agree to that edition council schmidt yes fine thank you okay cancel a picture i was just saying it 's a vague motion i think we should put some your body to it you know what you want to review strengthen to weakened or made more sensible i 'm looking for words there jeff so i appreciate that um yeah well you know if you 're having a code of conduct hopefully a code of conduct 's been put in with a lot of thought behind it for something to be made and changed pretty quickly and and the other thing is if it 's a person if you 're the person that 's had the code of conduct against you it can take up to two or three years to get a resolution back which is a lot of stress for people i just would like it i think i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker turnaround does have we got a recommendation to reflect that i 'm just typing that up at the moment mr man keep typing how 's the ladder uh can i just say i i think there needs to be some input around the vexatious complaints and i also wonder whether the general manager should be taken out of the process because i think uh you know with respect to the uh the ceo or general manager um it 's very difficult for them to even if they want to uh investigate these matters i mean they come in and there 's you know there 's very little substance to a lot of the stuff that comes across the table but i think the the hierarchy feel as though if it doesn 't get outsourced then there 's always that oh you know the sea swept is under the carpet to protect the council uh so i mean i 'll be interested in the ceo 's views on it but um these people who just kept complaining for the sake of it and costing us a lot of money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're doing and it 's usually the same suspects they should be put on a serial complainance list and we shouldn 't have to investigate any of their vexation stuff ceo mr mayor um yes uh most complaints on average cost us about three and a half thousand to four thousand in getting investigators to investigate the matter um i do agree with what council later has said in regards to the ceo that matter and that has been raised with the office of local government a number of times by a number of local governments and we are trying to get that change in place to take the ceo out of out of that process at the moment at snowy valley 's council we do refer to the panel of providers through the canberra joint organization to do those investigations and every one of those investigations is facilitated by our complaints officer and council and that facilitation also costs time and money so it is important in in our process to have that ability for people to lodge requests and complaints about matters but where that is abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rate payer money that can be spent on other matters thank you sir councillors uh given we 've got now number three i might put the put the recommendations the three recommendations together would you like me to put that up on the screen mr man i think we should need to see it first before we vote on it i 'll just share that screen i 'm happy with that thank you very much see ya any any further comments well i 'd maybe just put you know add something like responsible matter because i i think the problem is these these things aren 't uh they 're just outsourced for the sake of it because i 've never resolved in more timely any responsible matters and responsible matter timely and responsible manner and do you want to put in there without input from the ceo yeah i think that 's important i think we need to reiterate that because uh you know yeah yeah great happy to support that okay counselors we 've settled on that move and say maybe you 're happy with that thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thanks councillors um local government new south wales annual conference which was held virtually uh just recently thank the ceo for the uh for the report do i have a mover kessler ham seconder councillor benjamin any comment oh yeah it was a virtual conference which um rather than having a day and a half to go through all the resolutions it was done in half a day and um personally i found that a little bit frustrating that a lot of the emotions that i was interested in are now going to be decided by a board which made me wonder why we were there for even half a day if it was the majority were going to be decided by board anyhow um i realized there was limitations because it was by soon i was very pleased to see that we were able to have our resolutions about weeds and that was caught up and accepted we were able to say verbally how we felt that the grant that we got since we 've merged was not um we actually lost out when we emerged the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion about the essential workers of um child in child care and early childhood services will be passed thank you anything further put the motion all in favor one and two it 's carried unanimously thank you planning online of conduct online code of conduct for councillors councillor ham recommendations there have the report on training received the report on training yep one and two mover council smith secondary councillor right thanks councillor wright uh pretty self-explanatory um i would uh i would suggest that maybe if if the move and second are happy that um we might add a point three there that uh uh should any counsellor wish to avail themselves of their code of conduct uh training uh it be uh approved second to be happy with that yes sir ceo can you add that please that 'll that 'll save us bringing another report i recommended it was pretty very good thank you councillors with the addition of that third point which is pretty self-explanatory i 'll put the motion all in favor that 's unanimous thank you 2021 meeting calendar council ladder kessler benjamin castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion all in favor harry thank you statement of investments 10.6 this might take a little longer mover chancellor hand seconder councilor larda councillor ham i just wanted to keep the statewide mutual progress payment um i presume that is for insurance and if so is that all we 're going to get are we happy with that insurance payment is there anything else we need to know about what 's happening with insurance and has our premium gone up sorry cfo that 's all the questions i 've got cfo thank you for you mr mayor thank you council him it is an insurance payment for the damage of fixed assets so um i believe it was a toilet block and some other fixed assets and um there is still a small amount outstanding the insurance claim has not been finalized and yes our premiums have gone up but not due to the bushfires insurance premiums are rising australia-wide right okay thank you does it did that so would that that would have included the awning hall i presume uh through you mr mayor i am not sure whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hall is part of our insurance claim right thank you councillor esselman thank you mr mayor i 'm through you please um the tree removal claimable what 's the funding on tree removal on our roads and so on in relation to the fires is this just an ongoing amount every month until it 's finally done or is there a what 's the situation with tree remember i might refer that to executive director course yep sorry just getting the video up yeah the the works are ongoing we 're paying the invoices as we go we 've got several contractors working on that and concurrently sorting through the claim in that that work is claimable under natural disaster recovery funding arrangements we are still having issues with the claim and currently sorting those out now so we 're still yet to claim the work so people only able to identify trees to be looked at right at the beginning or now that there 's nearly a year gone by and trees are dying and there 's a new round of trees in danger what what situation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're doing is is very much within our local road corridors i suppose if areas that we 've already been to and these issues have since occurred we 'd be hoping that the residents would let us know we 'll go and have a look and reassess but we need them to be specific and let us know we 're not going to go back unless we 've got a request to do so all right thank you financially we 're okay with tree removal financially um it is covered on the natural disaster recovery funding arrangements yes castle smith as you travel around the region uh there 's there 's obviously a lot of that work going on and there 's a lot of road hold-ups i 'm just wondering if there 's any indication how long this process is going to be going on for um and yes the the funding has been covered already but how long do we anticipate that this process will continue uh through you mr mayor for me um yeah so the work we 've been doing on our local road corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of february next year we think we 're going to we are going to achieve that work has just started on the state road corridors and that might be what you 've seen more recently core in that the state are now getting into that we 're we 're helping manage that work they 've only just started that work over the last week or so so i expect that i 'll have several months to run yet um i 've been getting some feedback that with the clearing that it 's been a little bit too aggressive um particularly in terms of land care and of um you know animals living in trees and and that everything 's been cleared and then and then on the flip side i 've been told that that was part of the 79 recommendations that the corridors were to be completely cleared and do you have what what what do we say as a council to people clearing the corridors yeah our clearing is very much focused on reducing the hazard from dangerous trees and stockpiled debris as far as bushfire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the need to also retain hollow logs both standing and on the ground for native habitat so that 's very much part of the work and we do have an environmentalist with us on the job sites advising on that so we 're very much very understanding of that balance and very much trying to reduce the hazard reduce the risk for our community but also not al also minimise or create habitat for um for our floor on fire thank you there 's another issue that i 've become aware of through a local resident that um through that process of removing those trees they 've also included private land and fences boundary fences between road and council sorry and private land have been removed and just piled up um there has been some warning prior to that happening in that the contractors have said if you want to salvage any material from your fence to do that because it 's going to be removed now when that happens who bears the cost of replacing those fences um councillor smith i 'm not sure on that one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushfire recovery officer later on thank you just just on individual cases it will probably vary uh council has any other questions on the councillor right you had a question yeah i just wondered what was saying on this subject um what 's happening with the um edit way anybody any news that nothing 's happened no contracts have been led i just wondered what 's going on there let 's see yeah through the chair if i may um councillor right the tender documents have been drafted up however the significant rain event that we received not long ago has caused some additional damage so i believe there 's four tenders that have been been or about to be let in regards to the stabilization works on that area and there 's further assessment to happen on the new areas that have now become more unstable and there will be further tenders that will come out on that we have been advocating at every opportunity we have to get that opened and uh it is has been very well heard and when i attend uh regional coordination group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from myself and uh we 're getting updates from national parks and wildlife service about how they 're progressing on that it is a highly complex matter and they 're looking at how they create opportunities to get that work done as fast as possible thank you sarah nothing further okay we 'll put that notion all in favor unanimous thank you takes us on to uh 10.7 financial report moving it counselor pritchard or scratching counselor ham counselor benjamin thanks mr mayor if i could just ask the ceo um why employee costs seem we 're only you know where i know we 've had the bushfires and i realized it would be up a bit but why employee costs would be above budget by 18 um in this second you know the first half of this financial year what 's happening there yes certainly thanks the question council ham ceo um thank you through the chair councillor ham we have got a lot of additional projects happening at the moment and there 's still extensive bushfire work happening we just heard mr couch talk about uh the roadside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response so even though a lot of those costs are up there they are recoverable and we 'll go about that recovery process so as the quarterly budget review comes through i will be revising some of the income and the expenditure around those particular matters now that we have a better handle on what those costs will be i don 't believe that it 's anything alarmist at this stage and certainly we have got an internal program to ensure that our capitalization starts to happen a lot more because a lot of our wages do get capitalized for the projects that are building infrastructure in our area thank you council pitcher asking a question uh councillor lada just in relation to the employment um can we get an update on whether we 're eligible for the federal government schemes for the apprenticeships and the offset of the wages mr mayor uh councillor lada we do qualify in the capacity that the amount of income that we 've lost uh certainly justifies us getting that funding that 's been released by the new south wales government however the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay off staff and we have got an amendment to the award which facilitates a process that we 've negotiated with the local government new south wales and the unions however we we believe that it 's an economic stimulus keeping our employees employed and that creates money turning over in our economy so while we did lose some income we are trying to redeploy our staff and we 've been continuing continuing with business as usual so on that component that we haven 't laid off any staff we don 't qualify for that funding we did put a motion up to the local government new south wales conference to look at a different distribution of those funding to the councils in need i believe that only three councils have actually realized funds from that fund to this state and the rest of the money is being held by the state government so it would be great to get that money released and local government new south wales is considering that as a board motion at the moment thank you that wasn 't um whilst that was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more asking about the federal money where the federal government has released funds for a uh an apprenticeship incentive scheme where they 're they 're taking on i think 50 of the the wages for the first year um on any apprentice that 's uh brought into the system so uh given the fact that we uh we have spoken previously about having a very bold program for apprentices do we qualify for that um council larry i 'd have to take that matter on notice i know we have raised it with our staff and we have quite a considerable entry-level program uh that we 're implementing over a three-year period we are looking at whether we can incorporate additional positions due to the funding that we 're able to receive we haven 't got uh the full responses on that yet but um i 'll certainly take that matter on notice and provide some feedback to the councillors thank you thank you council lada uh nothing further put the motion all in favor it 's unanimous thank you um budget principles eleven point one castle ham councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council workshop very happy with that i 'm very happy that um particularly with point number eight that we advocate for support from all levels of government and i feel like us as councillors that 's part of our role that we should be advocating as much as possible to support these principles thank you council ham well summed up anything further councillors put the motion all in favor it 's unanimous thank you local rights and community infrastructure program funding round two castle lada councillor benjamin castellatta brad just told any other any counsellors commenting thank you there 's some certainly some uh very worthwhile projects in there and uh i think the staff are putting it together put the motion on favor here unanimously thank you pioneer park tumor proposed master plan councillor smith kessler han council hammer you moving that we go into committee was that what what that was i am so do i am reading my mind yeah secondary counselor pritchard councillor hand oh councillor schmidt i think it is tesla schmidt sorry no uh i was going to actually yes move to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of different ideas about this whole process um i believe that the offer of 55 000 to create a master plan for pioneer park is a is a very generous offer i also believe that we should look at the reasons why this offer has been made and what the purpose behind it is and if we do decide to accept this offer and have this organization create a master plan that council should not in any way be beholden to executing that private master plan as as it is developed from a private organization but that it could only be used as a guide in any future discussions or planning or developments in that park because it is clearly a park that is um highly valued by many people in the community um and that it really should be managed by council or the community um however having a master plan prepared such as this proposed that it could be useful for council to refer to it and use it as a consultative community may or may not be wanting thank you council smith that 's um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in committee can i just check with the minute taker that we 've moved into committee have we yep yep we are in committee so are the councils speaking councillor pritchard on mute jeff yes mr that the pioneer park down there is not a separate entity it 's part of the riverwalk which extends from go cup road and bill moore creek right down to the racecourse it 's all one integrated uh park area uh riverwalk and it was done by over many years incrementally it was opened officially when i was at the mayor at the time and there 's a stone down at the parking area at the park and i 've got a photograph of it here and i 've sent it on to the general manager but if there 's a sound down there with a parking lot you can all go and see deumate which is the aboriginal word for tumor tim at riverwalk pioneer park turmeric this was a joint project uh that 's established by the australian nature conservation agency the mujung aboriginal corporation and the chimichanga council was officially opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years ago when we opened it and that had been preceded by a lot of work a lot of work it wrote we cleaned up the pioneer park and different community bodies did different parts and we had a long hard journey amalgamating in the orlando into this wonderful river walk which is a prime that is a jewel in our crown really and pioneer park is the center piece of it and it can 't be separated off from the rest of it and and have the development decided by an outside consultant who 's based in sydney at the cost of 55 000 dollars to do the plan for it to my mind it 's uh it 's a gem and i think it 's been well developed at the moment with the exception of that labyrinth but it 's as it is it 's just wonderful it 's full of trees and it 's beautiful ambience and whatever uh it 's got the playground it 's got all sorts of things in it and i think it 's developed to the maximum extent that we needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what the future the whole river walk you know i 'd like to see it extended upstream to angle bend where the tuna used to be just beyond the race course i 'd like to see different a shortcut between the football entrance near the showground along by the to the to the bull paddock there are all sorts of little bits and bits we could add to it but we can 't pick out one area i don 't think and over develop it and it would be over development if you just go and walk around there you it 's just wonderful to spend 35 000 on a master plan and that then would require whatever the master band says to do all sorts of different things we 're not a chinese gardener you know this is just a wonderful natural asset and to interfere with it in any other significant in a significant way nothing can be wrong uh and i don 't like the thought of an outside body being and we don 't know who who who who 's involved in it uh to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't think we need this isopanel it 's coming from the macmillan foundation which which is set up for the good of the tuna people and that fifty five thousand dollars would be in my opinion be better spent on looking out for some of our compression community needs elsewhere we can continue the development of the river walk by setting up a committee of interested citizens and doing it bit by bit as we 've done for the last 30 or 40 years and i 'd be opposed to i 'd be voting against any to this motion completely thank you councillor pritchard other speakers councillor lara yeah i just concur with what counselor pritchard just said it concerns me greatly that the the organizers or or people in charge of blakely miller can essentially dictate to council what happens in a council area essentially i mean this document says that they they 're going to give us 55 000 but you know it 's it 's conditional and the fact that they can basically hijack hijack the uh the rights to tell us what we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't think that that 's um in keeping with with the sentiments of of uh the blakeney miller foundation or or the lady who made the very generous donation to the chamber community i mean i think the whole idea and the way that that organization structured needs to be looked at and i think the public should start asking some questions about how uh how these arrangements are taking place they 've pulled the funding for the the high school education uh trips they 've in my view wasted in excess of half a million dollars on a concrete slab in the middle of this park for the ducks to crap on it 's just a complete waste of money now i think there needs to be a overhaul of their system and there needs to be some more public uh involvement in what happens with that uh process maybe they need to come up with you know 10 um benefits or or uh opportunities that that that money could be used for on an annual basis and people vote on it in the chairman community very similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know a cartel telling telling the turmeric community what they 're going to spend the money on uh like like that complete waste of time uh labyrinth that was just a waste of money um and and and release the figures on it let everyone know exactly what it did cost because it was in excess of half a million dollars and i understand well in excess of half a million um and i 'm not sure what benefit it 's uh providing and i i just think it 's an absolute mistake um to allow them um to to basically dictate to us what we do in this park and um the fifty five thousand dollars could be could be better put to use to serving the community of turmeric i mean they won 't they won 't entertain the idea of doing a master plan for a sporting uh indoor centre uh which i would have thought was in keeping with with with their um with their mandate but that 's obviously not on their agenda they want to you know attack pioneer park so i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not something i 'm wanting to entertain i completely completely agree with the councillor pritchard on this castle hand um this recommendation has been put forward by the executive um for infrastructure i 'm just wondering if he could give his i mean this is put forward to accept the 55 000 and you know i 'm all for accepting money into the council i can see that i i find it hard to find out that we need 8 352 for administration and management so i need to understand that better and um yeah would would the executive director of infrastructure be able to talk on that for me very well um executive director are you through you miss mr mayor um the money um offered by the foundation only covers the cost the direct costs of the consultant so normally when we 're managing projects uh through through to through the you know through to delivery which in this case would be the completion of a master plan there 's obviously significant consultation that needs to go on there 'll be progress payments potentially there 's there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or aspect of that we normally allow between 10 and 15 in this case we 've allowed 15 um that could be a conservative estimate it might be high it might come in less than that um but that 's the uh that 's that 's the basis behind that eight thousand dollars in regard to the consideration of the offer in putting this report together i felt that i had to convey the information that was conveyed to me from the foundation i didn 't want to what 's the word influence the decision of cancel in any way i 've just got to provided a report as it is as the request came to us from the foundation i hope that helps yeah no no that 's fine so as someone who is you know doing infrastructure all the time and finding it hard to get money do you think this is good value do you do you think this is something we should come you know you 're not going to you know like do you think this is a good idea i think um the pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think from an asset management perspective to have a plan in place for how we 're going to how we 're going to manage that facility in years to come that 's that 's a good thing to have but i very much understand you 're just starting to break up a bit you might need to be closer to your microphone councillorism mr may um i cannot vote to accept this recommendation on a number of issues the first one i take is on three two a2 where they 're asking us to enter into a consultancy agreement i believe that 's against our um tendering responsibilities as a council when we 're asked to actually accept a tender a particular company to do it and i think that 's against our principles of tendering which i think is wrong i 'm also against this because at three nine um they 're asking council and telling council that we 'll donate this money so long as you don 't do any more in the park until we get the master plan accepted and finished those two things in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make is that with respect to our executive a master plan for the sake of a master plan doesn 't make a good good decision we have had on various occasions in council 's um history master master plans that have been developed that have been incredibly wrong and that keep coming back to bite the actual executive and the planners because that 's on the books and that 's not what we want here thirdly i 'd really really support councillor pritchard 's position in relation to the ambience of that particular area and what it is and how it is important to tune it as much as i love and appreciate the tumba rumbas um street um creekscape i certainly don 't want pioneer park to become another highly over developed environment that loses all the natural beauty running beside the river that we have at the moment so those those reasons are really important i think to the whole community and really to to our um to us as council we mustn 't be caught up by a master plan that is going to keep coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input on it and we don 't have opportunities to have a tender situation to get the master plan designed then it 's not a council plan we 're being held in some respects with our hands behind our back for fifty five thousand dollars and i accept what council allah has said as well i personally believe that as a council we should ask the um blatantly lodge foundation to find somewhere else to spend this money that would support the truman community because at this time it 's not appropriate for us to accept it thank you council listen i 'll just correct that so blakely miller um my apologies yes okay that 's okay um counselors any any further counselor benjamin thank you mr mayor i 've just got a question for the director of infrastructure has the foundation actually um had any community consultation with the community in regards to this master plan proposal executive director uh through you mr mayor um not that i 'm aware of councillor benjamin that they have been discussing it with cancer officers okay we have had some something good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other consultation yeah i think it 's i do know sorry i 'm sorry i do know in the um in the proposal put forward by the consultant that it does include community uh workshop and consultation lost you again uh okay now i 've got a couple more councillors uh councillor can i just ask um if there 's been any consultation with the proponents of this of this plan um and and and what what what that uh what those uh dealings were were they were they willing to uh deal with counselling on this or or was there or was it it was just basically like it or lump it who 's going to answer that question i haven 't spoken to them um if if i made through that chair i think they 've put a proposal forward and there 's been a minor discussion back with their representative it 's up to council whether they choose to alter the conditions and go back to them with alternative proposal um we can either do that formally in the resolution or defer the matter for further consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment and direction around what where to go back and negotiate on councillors i just um at this point just they haven 't come to to council to the councillors at all my um my feeling is this and and uh i 'll leave it up to you but maybe we if we let all those recommendations lapse and replace them with that the counselors meet with uh the the board of the um black miller foundation to discuss funding proposals full stop i 'd support that i 'm not swinging against what you suggest mr mayor but i 've tried to contact this organization they 're a private philanthropic organization whose responsibility or interest is in tumi itself i went on their website to find out who to contact and there was nobody to contact you could put your own details in and they would contact you we don 't know who the board is we have no idea it 's an anonymous organization and i refuse to have anything to do with them in those circumstances and i don 't want to meet with them i think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore it i i look councillor pritchard that that may be the case but i think the point is the money was left in good faith for the community of tumar and i think as council we 're we 're here to serve the whole council area but but tumid as well so we we would be negligent i believe if we resolve not to meet with them because they are they are the um the keepers of this money uh they are responsible for it and uh i think we should we should um give them the opportunity to meet with us uh they may well refuse to meet with us um but i think i think that 's only the only fair thing to do and i think it would um you know it may well resolve uh a lot of differences and may well give us the opportunity to find out a little bit more about the uh the way the black manila foundation is operating in now and into the future councillor mr mayor i hear what you 're saying but it seems to be consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board that for some reason the board does not meet and one or maybe two people have turned up to the meeting now if you call that meeting as you 're suggesting then are we going to get the old board or will we just have the repetition of what we 've had before and one or two people turn up so my my position is if i may um if i could move emotion in respect to this is that out of order at the present moment you can foreshadow one i suppose um foreshadow one if i may um my foreshadowing information so you can move sorry council listen when you can move an amendment amendment yes just give us an idea of what you want to do first all right i would like to say we 're still in you can 't move on you yeah i would uh foreshadow a motion where i actually say that we don 't accept this offer um because as it 's been stated that would benefit the community better in some other way and that we form a council committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area and that we um invite the um black to black knee miller foundation board to attend a meeting with all councillors that 's my three-point proposed motion thank you okay my my my suggestion there is that that limits it just to the just to the um uh pioneer park yeah i i think you 're right mr mayor i think the the issue is here it 's not just about the park is it you know it 's about all the other money that 's going to waste i mean so we need to have some influence back into their uh into their hierarchy to find out what what the motors is here you know like we want this money as i 'm sure the founder did and the the mrs blakeney miller she obviously wanted to benefit the community um and i think a lot of people in the community think that this money 's just been flushed down the toilet um uh other councillors wouldn 't that be why we met with them yeah i agree let 's meet with them mr mayor having thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on i believe that the issue is simply that we have a motion on our books and some recommendations about what to do about it and i believe that your suggestion of altering those recommendations and having just the one recommendation that council contact the organization that 's making this very generous offer and offer to meet with them to formulate a way forward that would be uh acceptable to council as well as to the foundation to uh if indeed the as one would expect it 's a genuine offer of benefiting the community and having a a good plan for this park which i have used for the last 20 years and love and you know walking quite regularly if that is a a genuine offer we should not be seen to just uh you know refuse that or not not be prepared to look into it but at least by having a recommendation that we offer to meet with the organization to discuss this further i think is a a good way forward and i would accept that uh change in recommendation right uh thank thanks councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think yes sorry about that but the the fact remains is that the um likely like the blakely miller foundation has given us a very comprehensive outline of what they expect for these fifty five thousand dollars they haven 't just offered it and said you know we 'll just do this and you know we 'll chat with it later they 've laid it out and they 've got you know confidential papers that they 've given us and a whole range of things this is a really intense this is what we want to do i can 't say that meeting with them on this issue is going to necessarily make a great deal of change about where they want to go i mean it 's there in you know black and white these are the conditions we want so in that respect that 's why i say i can 't accept this recommendation and i really do think that we need to go with please pass the money onto someone else in the community we would like to meet with you to discuss other matters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direction as far as our council goes we 've got a committee that 's going to look at forward planning that can support other situations that might come up in relation to master planning of this area we 've had executives tell us that a master plan would be an advantage a good thing to have so yes let 's get on and do it but do it through a committee that 's a council committee not being directed by an unknown group thank you uh councillor uh esselman um i think firstly i think meeting with them is is polite and it would be a good start and i think we probably need to do that uh secondly i think probably we you know we 're we 're in the process of trying to um you know divest ourselves of of committees and maybe we 'd be better off with just a simple working group and and uh and do it that way because after all we 're you know we 're not and then the finances show we 're not in a great position so we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are going to cost us more money as well and that councilwork and group would be quite fine fine okay so councils i might suggest that we move out of uh out of committee and and after that i might i might propose um an amendment to the motion councilor lard are you moving out moving councillor benjamin all in favor okay counselors that takes us out of committee councillors i propose an amendment from the chair which would be that council meets with the full board of the black new miller if it 's acceptable to them but meets with the full board of the blakeney miller uh to discuss funding opportunities full stop that 's it do i have a sec so that 's that 's the amendment to uh so i 'll move that do i have a second council of larder just a question an amendment to what amendment to the to the five to the sixth recommendation but it 's a separate motion it 'd be it would replace that yes but that 's not an amendment as letting that one lapse or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to um the mover and seconder can choose to withdraw the original motion that was put forward um and if that doesn 't happen you can vote on that if you wish um all the um the mayor can move um an alternative motion uh of which you 'd vote on um the alternative first and then the amendment as such becomes the motion if that gets up so up to you how you want to procedurally do deal with this so so we did have a a move and a second it was a bit confused right at the start but i think it was councillor smith and councillor and yep are you happy to let that lapse i 'm happy to do as you suggested to mr mayor that we replace the recommendations that we have with the one recommendation that we meet with them to discuss further i want to yet to discuss further funding opportunities but i do want to give the concession i suppose to the blackney miller foundation that the discussion be centered around the development of a master plan for pioneer park because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're saying by doing this is yes we would be willing to enter into discussion with you to develop this but we need to have a good roundtable conference with council and the foundation that thank you councilman that will obviously be the catalyst yes or he 's the catalyst um counselors so i 've got a so we we 're assuming that one 's going to lapse um mr may it needs to be formally withdrawn so counsellor smit and councillor ham need to agree to it to be withdrawn do we have uh that condition available to withdraw it on condition that it 's replaced with that recommendation no you said no that 's self order it 's probably easier just to vote on it and then just uh the mech and then can just decide about his motion when when one or two things happens okay i 'm happy to put the mate put the motion one to six i 'll vote for you don 't get that what we 're doing i 'm happy with that have you let councillor schmidt you happy with put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment on you further at this stage counselor hand you happy to put the motion anyone any further discussion tell us what the motion is precisely motion is one to six the recommendations as as proposed in the report on page 66 electronically item 11.3 everyone clear we 're putting those six motions [Music] put the motion all in favor council ham 's in favor against okay six against thank you council as old now proposed that we the uh motion i proposed earlier we meet blackney miller do i have a seconder first uh thank you any further discussion put the motion all in favor you 'd like me to display that on the screen mr man i think it was pretty self-explanatory wasn 't it it was yes yeah okay uh in favor against uh so i 've got two against uh council benjamin you 're against now councillor pritchard 's against councillor island four against again against okay so i 've got two against thank you thank you councillors uh moving on do we have uh counselor need to have a vote sorry you 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please uh it 's been voted on did put it forward i did put it we can we can we can look at something next next meeting our councillor island and i 'm not sure we 'll be meeting before then and i think the other thing of course is this is all coming towards the end of this council and if we um you know we 've got to be we 've got to be um sort of cognizant of the fact that we might be proposing things that a new council will look at and throw straight out so we 've got to be aware of that as well counseling point of order i did put in in committee a suggestion that i was going to put a mission forward and and no disrespect to you mr may but you didn 't give me a chance to put that motion up and apologize for that uh that 's why i 'm asking you to have an amendment to your motion it 's it 's already par it 's already been voted on so you can 't we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what i was doing an additional question counselor wrestleman it 's a bit confused but anyhow let 's often that i agree yeah uh what 's what 's your motion counselor islam that we we form a workshop a work working group in council please to assist in developing a master plan for pioneer park well how about we make it the river walk and uh and we and we um look after all of councillor pritchard 's um suggestions through there haven 't we already got that proposed i don 't know whether it 's actually formalized yet so this is not for us mr mayor can i just put this yeah so you can see that motion the original motion uh was lost and um council lada move that we meet with the board which was passed um and then council island is moving but we need a second uh uh the council formal working group to advance the riverwalk precinct master plan and the council invite the blake blackney miller foundation to be a participant in the engagement process although that ocean first motion was passed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to vote want to have it rescinded you can yes can you say that to me again you want to receive the whole first six recommendations now we we 've voted that 's gone he 's rescinding my my recommendation i 'm leaving the other one do we have a third that lapses okay let 's move on councillor esselman yes you 've got your recommendation you 've got a seconder do you have a seconder i 'm willing to second that thank you councillor smith any further discussion although there 's been a lot um no i think i 'll just make the comment that by not passing the original recommendation 0.2 means we do not accept the donation thank you sir that 's good thank you i 'll put the motion all in favor points one and two [Music] that 's unanimous thank you rydo do we have brad here yet mr yes i 'll just invite brad into the meeting so do we need a motion that we go back to that or we don 't do we no that 's fine because you passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right back at the start presentation of financial statements that 's on page 38. thank you welcome brad hello thank you sorry to hold you up that 's quite okay no problem at all um so it it 's the best way perhaps if i um jump in and just share on the screen the conduct report um because this being the main item that um the new south wales ordered office issued so in the pack matt flagged it and i 'll just have it up on the screen and talk through it and call out some of the key highlights um as we go so importantly the first point would be um just here that we received our um audit sign off on the 19th of november and for this year the deadline was the 30th of november so well inside the o financial statements were lodged on the 23rd of november so from a project delivery perspective we were completed and done on time the next bit of importance of page one is that we achieved an unmodified or what 's in simple language known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shooting for is to get it done on time and get a clean audit outcome and and that 's what 's um is expressed in that in that statement there so really encouraging considering the overlay was bushfires back in the january february period and then rolling into coven there are a number of challenges um for council to deal with and as we roll then into the the more balanced date activity um there were some other demands pulling on the finance team in in terms of supplying data and information to um the the commission inquiry and and different activities as well so we really appreciate um the efforts to get to this point working with um council 's finance team and and having a clean unqualified audit opinion for 30 june this conduct report is inspired the annual financial statements and there 's a public document available for for all all stakeholders to view and the format follows one similar to the prior year from an income statement perspective which is your profit and loss what is outlined here are the primary lines inside it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um for snowy valleys and you can see there 's a small 1.8 percent uplift and then grants some conscious communities implementation funding and some capital funding is really what drove that increase from 22 to um 27 million for the for the 2020 year because of that additional one-off funding for stronger implementation and some capital funding we achieved a net surplus from operations of four million um and that 's up on the prize year 's balance of 3.2 million so that that at face value looks encouraging the next line is the one which is around the longer term sustainability of council that says if we withdrew and take out the capital-based funding um it shows the loss that was um were generated in the absence of that capital grant funding coming through which which can be quite lumpy and since snowy valleys has initially amalgamated um has had a range of funding of that nature coming through um for for its operations the next page gives us great i 've lost brother of course yes please maybe stop screen sharing we 've got this in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him oh you 've lost him yeah we can 't you in and out brad [Music] oh i 'm sorry yes is that better oh i 'm sorry yes sorry um julia you 've got a question oh just just are you not concerned that um you know that that you know it 's the variance is 381 like is this something that we should be very concerned about where are you bro you know with um the net operating result before capital grants and contributions there 's no doubt in a longer term sustainability outcome um that the council has some concerns um that need to be factored in in its long-term management plan um matthew and suzanne would be more across those and that 's some of the um the outcomes of all regional councils one of the key challenges is maintaining an extensive road network and not having um the way the current funding is structured for that and the number of rate payers to support that outcome is is one of those items um and making sure that um in terms of the desired service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams which which is translated a bit of a user pays type system or working out are the services that we 're actually still providing for our stakeholders the services that we need to and should continue to into the future so there 's a bit of a melting pot of things going on um but what i would say is in the short-term horizon because as the external auditor is sort of defining responsibilities here mines are very much a short-term horizon snowy valleys can pay their debts as and when they fall due in the short-term horizon but there would certainly be an amber light for you as there is a range of other regional councils around more that medium term to understand that are we heading a pathway that aligns with um sustainability or are we continuing to whittle away our reserves thank you right can i ask a question are there any councils um particularly category 11 councils that are that are actually in the black before um before grants or or are we all relying on grants the vast majority james you make a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a couple um of of odd ones that that are um and they 're not a healthy surplus but but slightly above um but but you 're right the majority of councils as you move more to a a rural setting the elusive profit is harder and harder and one of the the key challenges is as infrastructure assets continue to go up in value the depreciation associated with that makes makes achieving a break-even result harder and harder each year yeah and and that 's one of the issues and i 've got it written down here more and more assets and we keep keep uh getting um you know opportunities to to increase assets not not replace assets but new assets and yet we 've got to depreciate them and usually yes even if you 're getting assets yep um so the the next page of the conduct report is around the statement of cash flows your council is the same as every other council in the sense that you generate positive cash from operations and and rates and then fundamentally you spend it via two ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you predominantly that 's roads or if the asset management plan so suggests it 's deferred in term deposits until such time as we as we will spend it um and council has got a a manageable level of debt is the third bar in your cash flow statement there around 8 million which relative to council size is is is certainly not large at all statement of financial position this is an interesting area and one that 's got a fair amount of coverage in new south wales local government just recently um and certainly in the press around the level of restrictions so if we just talk through that at 30 june 2020 council had something in the order of 42 million worth of cash and investments and then what we look at is how is that restricted you 've got external restrictions which are predominantly for water and sewer so 27 million of that money is restricted from external orientation so it must be spent on the purpose for which it was raised then we 've got internal restrictions this is where money is restricted based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside to fund employee leave entitlements plant replacement and and while the grant is in advance a lot of them have setting aside that portion of advance to make sure that we can appropriately match it to when the revenue comes through what that comes down to is saying that council snowy valleys has 2 million of unrestricted cash so it 's it 's really good that it 's a positive number but as it works through those the cascading mechanisms we started with 42 million after taking into account reserves for both external and internal purposes what 's remaining is is two million dollars of unrestricted cash it 's a small improvement on the prior year which was 1.6 million um but it 's not a particularly healthy um it 's not a large balance which goes to julia 's point around that sustainability of where you know your your clarity needs to be um very much focused in on the decisions we 're doing and the spending um it needs to be consistent with the longer term financial planning um that that council has done to help understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures um there 's a series of ratios there the t corp ones that come through from a note down the back of your financial statements councillors would be familiar with these from prior years the the one that 's always a challenge for rural regional councils is that own source operating revenue one where the benchmark is set at 60 um and the suggestion is that you should have your own source of funds to be above that bar and the reality is very few councils in a rural regional setting are you 're very heavily reliant on grant funding and council should continue its activities here i think it 's appropriate to say at this point for each of those six graphics that you see at this section of the report they should be understood in total as a group uh rather than trying to take anything away from one particular measure because if you stopped obtaining grant funding to improve the result on your own source operating revenue that 's very easy to do just don 't get any more grants that would that would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating performance one it would just push it further down so so you kind of need to understand them as a as a collective rather than being focused on any one metric alone council does have the ability to pay its debts as and when they fall due at 30 june we held 3.35 cents for every one dollar of liabilities so that means that we 've got financial capacity um which is which is encouraging as a as a trading partner with the community and and rates and annual charges outstanding with covert coming in and bushfires we were watching this as an area of some concern coming into 30 june encouragingly your rate payers have have continued to maintain those repayment levels below the benchmark the benchmark set at 10 and and the result for snowy valleys was was seven percent so so still well inside the framework albeit acknowledging there was a there was a small uplift in the in the result council 's business is is renewing infrastructure assets in the 1920 year you renewed 11.3 million worth of assets compared to 13 million in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a road network that 's been maintained there were some new accounting standards that come into play for the year which required a couple of journal entries direct to the statement of changes in equity so they didn 't come through the profit and loss so we flagged some visibility there and importantly for council no instances of legislative non-compliance um so so um that is a a big tick forward and a challenge for some councils but for snowy is really pleasing to get the audit done again this year considering some new challenges um and get a clean ordered opinion and we 're looking forward to the 2021 year um and and council has some some goal posts to navigate moving forward around the longer term sustainability of council which i 'm aware that that management are fully aware of any other questions i think i think you answered a couple of mine in through there when we talked about um changes in financial standards uh for reporting um accounting for volunteers uh we 're doing that as well because we 've done a lot of work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's come into play and and for not for profit entities who use volunteers it can make the accounting a little more complex but snowy valley certainly does enjoy the support of a number of volunteers um the accounting for those works off those that you would otherwise pay for if you weren 't weren 't obtaining them and so you can you can see how that introduces a level of complexity to that accounting thank you all right councillor ryan youtube yep um i 'm just wondering about the volunteers and the financial statements and we 're losing a lot of three five five committees so it 's not going to make any difference to our accounting for those valuable volunteers i know there 's a hell of a lot of them are in the 355 so now they 're going to be lost to us so will that make much difference from a from an external audit financial reporting perspective um the answer is no that won 't make a great deal of difference um the the whether they 're inside a 355 committee or simply operating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the accounting um bruce however there we 've been keeping a figure of um in note 7c that um the revenue was recognized by volunteers of 99 000 so surely that will be different is that you know um maybe the cfo might be able to explain that cfo you 're mr mayor um 99 000 in revenue was recognized but also in expenses so there is no bottom line impact on our financial state statements that is what the accounting standard demands and we only recognize those volunteer services that we would otherwise have to pay now whether they 're working as an independent volunteer organization a section 355 committee or just volunteers doesn 't matter we would still recognize that particular effort of those volunteers so for example the um historical society is becoming incorporated um however they 're still working the in the vic that their services will be recognized that way through you mr mayor absolutely if we consider that we would be running the week as it is run with the volunteer services if we didn 't get the volunteer services yes we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone thanks for including me bye-bye thank you very much thanks thanks for waiting nice sweat so counselors we have the um have the recommendation there three recommendations [Music] we have a new page reference please uh 38 my mind electronically secondary counselor benjamin you you 're with us miss counselor wrestling okay any further comment put the motion all in favor that 's unanimous thank you councillors that takes us to back to um 11.4 age 70. um 73 electronically svc child safety organization driver mover for those councillor ham secondary council lada i 'd just like to congratulate the executive director of community and corporate and the people who worked on this it is um mandatory that we have this in in terms of having child care um in the in the law for child care protection particularly in um in line of abuse or domestic violence or something like that um i do like the the accompanying report and the way that the council has gone and taken each part one by one and gone through it and you can see very closely their thinking and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough conversations um to be coming forward so congratulations on that and i would very much support both these recommendations thank you any further discussion all in favor carrie thank you that 's unanimous uh 11.5 assessment to the da bombali avenue bombali uh three recommendations there councillor smith councillor lana councillor smith on mute still counselors the bigger pardon given that i was unable to attend the discussion and workshop on this matter the other day i welcome the fact that recommendation 2 suggests that we defer consideration of this application until such time as a full assessment and notification process has been completed so yeah move that thank you i think that makes perfect sense anything else councillors council of latter just from an operational point point of view i just wonder whether the general manager could perhaps take out an advertisement and perhaps ask the local paper for some editorial and perhaps even get the responsible team to organise a an interview with dave eisenhower just giving the public a little bit of orientation and feedback about what constitutes a building right so that you know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh obviously left um wondering what 's happening and uh the council staff aren 't um uh you know wasting time um assessing things without the proper information um i just think that that would be a good good thing operationally for us to do that 's that 's just to um make the point that a that a building right by for a building permit basically uh ceo you happy to do something along those lines yes uh mr mayor that uh would be fine to do that that 's a good initiative for our community thank you lana okay so i 've got the motion there three recommendations put the put the recommendations all in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you um committee meetings 12.1 disability inclusion access reference group meeting i know councillor cross attended both these meetings i was unable to um she didn 't pass on anything in particular to me but it 's um i i did comment on one of them it continues to be a very proactive uh committee and um yeah looking forward to working with them next year fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you takes us to batlow development league four recommendations there adopting the new core members collection of offspring the minutes and the report councillor esselman you 're moving that way councillors smith councillor or something that 's just on you point of clarification please mr me are you moving that or yeah i 'll move it got it thank you um i just want to um suggest that we not adopt point three and seek further information because we 're asking people as office bearers in this community um committee and we don 't have um and number four that we don 't have actual names and employment we don 't have any details about these people so i feel we need something more than just an initial and last name to actually as a council accept these people into the committee so i i 'd really appreciate the fact that we had more more information on that committee look i think i think we they 've been given to us in good faith and they 're you know most of them we can recognize so i think if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the whole thing up yeah happy with that that 'll be fine thank you okay um anything further councillors council smith given the fact that the 355 committee is going to uh or moving towards incorporation it 's probably a moot point that by the end of this uh fun and yeah by the end of this financial year it will no longer be a council committee thank you councillor smith good point they might decide otherwise they might but anyhow that 's that 's up to them um and council i suppose so i 'll put the motion that we accept those minutes uh all in favor councilwoman you 're voting uh against council of whistleman 's against uh so that 's not unanimous thank you uh tell bingo progress three recommendations there mover council lada seconder councillor benjamin anything arising i 'll put the motion all in favor carried unanimous thank you uh rrl advisory committee meeting i 'd just like to add an extra emotion to this because kate cross wasn 't able to attend these last two meetings so the recommendation three to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to attend and i think that 's that 's got to go back to their real advisory committee [Music] mr mayor um councillor ham if we could just take that on notice rather than having a resolution on that matter and look into the constitution and provide some advice to councillors and then if um if the constitution allows us we 'll um we will put that up as a council uh recommendation um and if the constitution doesn 't allow us we will ask um the council representative to raise it as a matter for the committee to consider if that is suitable yeah oh it 's just such to work well i mean the river in a regional library is tremendous and does so much for the whole snowy valley 's council i just think it 's good if we 've got a voice there i would be surprised if there 's not a vehicle for an alternate delegate in their constitution but i 've been surprised before council lada oh i was just going to say that if there is an absent abs somebody 's absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uh for the councillor to nominate or contact a a uh a replacement we 'll find out i 'll put the motion all in favor dr benjamin carrie unanimous thank you councillors that concludes the uh the the ordinary meeting um so we will move to confidential where um where counsellors participate in meetings remotely by audio visual link they continue to be obliged to protect any confidential information considered at the meeting where meetings are close to the public under section 10a of the act council should ensure that they participate in the meeting in a location where it cannot be seen or heard by anyone else councillors to have a mover to move into confidential council latter councillor pritchard all in favor"

@ @ unanimously thank you declarations of pecuniary interest assume none um takes us through to um there were some castle smith there were some hands up i think for pecuniary interest not that i saw does anyone have any kind of interest no sorry that 's okay thank you council smith um do we have a business without notice an urgent business without nurse ceo uh mr mayor i will just uh share a screen here for a promotion that was raised by councillor pritchard [Music] thank you can we scroll to the top of that so it 's just um i i might just read through that um and i think councillor pritchard for his his efforts in this and his expertise which we uh which we defer to uh quite often um the the notion is that council endorsed the snowy valley 's community being vigilant to protect our community through supporting the new south wales health messaging to assist in the management of the coronavirus through social distancing good hand hygiene if you feel unwell stay home get tested and isolated home until negative result received if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active two recommend to the snowy valleys community to stay informed limit travel outside the local government area and non-essential visitation from outside the lga limit social gatherings ensure physical distancing when greeting other people reduce frequency of essential activities in the community be aware and avoid current hot spots wear a mask if you can 't socially distance ensure high touch surfaces are regularly cleaned use hand sanitizers regularly when in public spaces and avoid touching your face all businesses should have hand sanitizers available for their customers use protective glass gloves when touching hot high use public facilities we 're face masks when preparing and serving food in public spaces and three encourage the community to work in partnership with government agencies and businesses that are working to assist us with the meeting of public health order requirements pritchard are you moving that yes mr yeah i mean this is all fairly obvious getting bombarded with these messages but uh yeah the point of no return quite frankly this is when you look at the overseas news it 's just incredible what 's going on overseas and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven 't had any virus in our shower area but it 's looming at the doors victoria has just gone into extraordinary numbers that she uh yes in the last 24 hours and in new south wales the spots stop jumping everywhere so we really have to think that it 's here out here and now and we have to do it all together and i think it 's whilst it 's a primary health department 's business in the local government act we have an obligation in public health to our own community and i think we have to ourselves lead the way we 've not got mars on now because we 're all social distances but once we get outside we have to put marks on and one of the problems with the masks is that the initial use of them is for people who had the virus to stop them suspending it but now it 's turned around that the the virus is being applied to us by people visiting through the area and a mask will cover your nose and mouth but that doesn 't cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting there is to get into get a droplet in your eye and that runs down the electrolyte into the respiratory system so we need to wear shields and goggles or goggles on top of your mask and i think we have to do that now and when we 're whenever we 're out the open uh it 's up to individuals to keep up to date on it there 's so much poor advice coming up that you need to sift through it yourselves and work out what 's really necessary we have to pretend that it 's here now we 're going to get one chance ourselves i mean all of us are not not chickens and i 've reluctantly had to stop my grandkids coming down here in the next week and we 're going to have a zoom meeting and we 're all going to have to be vigilant and we have to think it could be it happened to us anytime these recommendations that we 've put up are probably not complete if you like but you need to read through them and pretend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our community is going to be in australia it 's going to be enormous and yes but if we all work together and we 'll get through it all right thank you council appreciate any other speakers councillor han i was wondering if we could go into committee about this mr mayor uh is it necessary you 're gonna you 're gonna talk a lot are you you 'd like to move committee counselor second well i um i 'd like to go that 's supported thank you i hang on let 's put the motion unanimous thank you i think councillor pritchard brings up lots of good points which are listed there but i it also brings up the point of um we are a border council area and i 'd like to take this opportunity to ask um the ceo how we are going how um towns like cross um can coven gingerlink are coping with the cross-border issues what we 're doing as a council to support those people and um i 'm i 'm not sure whether anyone can tell me how india 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into victoria to come back into new south wales to where they live um i was just wondering if we could have an update from the ceo so yeah through the mayor uh yes we 've uh the mayor and myself have a daily meeting with the cross border commissioner and that has been very successful and that we 've put a number of suggestions up and they 've been very quickly changed we 've been in contact with various people in the community to see what their issues have been and we 've requested feedback from a number of different sources so we believe at this stage it is it is definitely an extreme measure and so there 's always going to be some complications around that but we 've been very happy with the progress of the detail around the public health order and ensuring that businesses and farmers and the various recovery operations can continue to operate in our local government area there was some quite good negotiations especially around the kencoburn area about being able to access groceries and fuel and and essential services across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ken koben community and many other communities in our local government area actually go across the border and into victoria and and do you know specifically how they 're going at vigorous uh not specifically at bigger um i have asked uh some uh farmers in in the orni area um about um how things are going down there but no not specifically bigger yeah and there is there any cost um to snorri valley 's council like do we are we providing any of the barricades or anything like that are we financially implicated at all through the mayor council ham uh we are contracted to do some uh work there and provide that but that is um at the cost of the state and the state are giving us the information about what needs to be provided and we 're providing that and they 're reimbursing those costs great well done um i 'd just like to say just on the cross-border updates every day just what a what a grand job that james mctavish is doing uh it keeps us informed and uh i you know there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions get tighter uh i can i can see a possibility of that um but to to date everything we 've asked for uh we as far as i know we 've been successful in gaming so um getting uh additional bridges opened and the likes uh we 've been successful in and um most issues uh that people have brought to us we 've been able to resolve satisfactorily for them that 's a very big commitment to you mr mayor so thank you that 's fine thank you anything further you meet council ham you 're moving that we go out of committee yeah the committee of one 's moving all right all in favor is that counselor right second of that the right was the second that yep and was unanimous so uh councilor pitcher we put the motion or do you want to speak to it again i think it 's pretty self-explanatory but we mustn 't let our guard down if there 's going to be any good thing that comes out of this maybe after the end of it and this is maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we administer health across the nation i mean these state borders are dressed ridiculous we should and having state and federal giving different policies and whatever is also ridiculous they tried i think kevin rudd tried to put up some years ago that health be put in one bucket and administer in sensible regions you see canberra should be the center of the south east of new south wales from a health point of view including water and whatever it was but we 've got the ridiculous situation where canberra is now overflowing into the st into the state and uh yeah so forth i won 't carry on about that now but we 'll keep it until after the end of all this and hopefully get some proper reform out of it i 'm sure it won 't be the last time we hear from you on that but look i i just like to implore people if if you don 't need to go somewhere where don 't go if you can if you can do all your shopping for the week in one in one outing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermarket every day you just try and limit um your excursions as much as you can and keep yourself safe councils i put the motion all in favor unanimous thank you councillors that takes us to um the management reports uh no sorry the governance and financial reports draft borrowing policy do i have a move for that policy council ham councillor cross councillor ham um thanks mr mayor um i 'd probably like to talk to the cfo about this this is great to have this policy um tidied up i i noticed that um council will not use long-term debt to finance current operations and maybe if the cfo could just um clarify exactly i know we 've got debt um we took some borrowing for the caravan park so so when when would we borrow cfo for the mayor um council ham we would be borrowing against um for example a business if we 're building or expanding a caravan park that has a clear revenue stream against it into the future um also against our business units of water and sewerage because they have clear revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will clearly save us operational costs for example the led report that we had up at last council meeting where we had a report that said in the future these operational costs will be saved it 's the equivalent of a revenue as we are having smaller expenditures that would be basically it thank you okay thank you any other case and carry on counseling and there 's two ways to borrow we can borrow externally and internally from from reserves is that correct through the mayor yes council hem that is correct uh doesn 't have to be reserves it can also be um just against the business unit internally and not and nothing can be borrowed unless it comes to council and we sign off on it council hamdad is correct terrific thanks very much thank you councillors anything further so i 'll put the the motion that we accept the uh draft borrowing policy that goes out for public exhibition and uh 28 days is it this one people have yes time for comment thank you all in favor that 's unanimous thank you draft liquid trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right any discussion i 'll put the motion all in favor cancel the picture did i see your hand for the technology that 's unanimous thank you uh draft water and wastewater charging policy for public exhibition 7.2 mover councillor right council across noting that these are all out for public exhibition any comment put the motion all in favor unanimous thank you draft stock grids and gates policy just before we we put this i would encourage anybody with and uh i have a i have a stock bid for myself so i 'd encourage anybody who 's uh got a stock grid or or gates um to uh to look at this raven mover that 's the ham councillor pritchard any discussion i need to agree with you um james and i think this is one of the policies you probably don 't look at until something goes wrong so um anyone any farmer with uh or any um residential owner with a grid or gate on their property i think it 's important to read this before it gets passed on a public and it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out for many many years it 's just that people a lot of people aren 't aware of it i 'll put the motion all in favor unanimous thank you draft street activity policy counselor hand cast across um once again i think this is a good one for people to have a look at just two things um i 'd like this policy to be directed to diag the disability action group um and if that could be directly sent to them for comment we the the group is very active and they have um tremendous ideas and this is a way that that some of those ideas could go into action so um that that would be my recommendation there our counselor costs i 'd also like it to go to the chambers of commerce because i think it 's it 's a key document for them to have a look at to give us feedback for thank you castle cross and it 's pretty long vote to draw but yesterday councillor crosston myself and uh met at the tune of main street to see uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such activity there and um yeah so looking forward to seeing that finished and i think also we need to add that the chamber of commerce we 're there as we 're business owners to to for us to have a conversation with and how 's it looking it looks wonderful really really good good uh put the motion all in favor thank you um cemeteries policy for adoption this is for adoption councillor smith council lacrosse any comment counselor smith no not really i 'll put the notion all in favor oh council cross you want to say something or yes look i was a bit disappointed that with it nowhere in the policy was it stated that the reservation fees were going to be used to maintain the plots i thought i know that that 's caused some questions in the past and i thought it should be clarified in the policy thanks for clarifying that maybe we can put an innocent addendum later on the other issue i wanted to bring up as well was the fact that some people had difficulty in accessing the actual policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was any uh if that situation had been remedied and if and ensuring that it won 't happen again uh we maybe direct that question through to the ceo thanks council across um through the mayor uh there was an issue with some people in regards to trying to compare the policies to the former council policies we were able to provide those policies directly to that person who inquired about them however the former policies don 't go up on our website so we were able to work that through with the customer who wanted to do that comparison thank you nothing further all in favor unanimous thank you alcohol free zone policy for adoption council ham council i think this is one of those mandatory policies which um um it 's great we 've got it and um i have no trouble with it um but just using this opportunity to ask how we 're going with you know we 've showed our interest in ctc tv and what 's happening with the if i could ask that question please certainly uh i don 't think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking there you go thanks mr mayor uh councillor ham council has adopted its um crime prevention plan uh recently and cctv is addressed in that plan um as per the community consultation that occurred at the time we have already been in discussion with some of the community groups who have been in contact with us looking to obtain funding directly themselves for their particular community as they believe that cctv would be quite useful in their community and we 've put them in touch with some state funding that is available and they 've advised that they 've made contact with the state funding body and the funding is currently open in their intent to lodge an application we 've also said that we 'll work together with that community in respect to their application and but as a council we we are not pushing for it to be down the main streets or anything like that the um crime prevention uh plan actually details out that uh council is supportive of cctv uh but doesn 't say the council will install cctv excellent thank you thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor that 's unanimous thank you councillors that concludes the meeting for today thank you very much everybody"

thanks mr mayor i 'd just like to bring up the um tumbarumba caravan park again so that report was brought forward and created some discussion but there has been discussion that the council has been approached to um lease the caravan park out to a big organization involved i believe they 're just rumors but i was wondering if the ceo through you mr mayor might be able to talk on that thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair um councillor ham uh yes um council has got a caravan park strategy coming forward to talk about um how we will be managing the parks across the whole snowy valleys into the future um there have has been an approach by an accompany initial approach um but there 's been no discussion about that until council proceeds with its caravan park strategy we will continue on our current path and and that is partly to to ensure the availability for local contractors uh in the area and also tourism uh in the area to be catered through the various different components of each of our parks at each location so there 's no way it can be hired out completely like that without going through council who would require a report to council if we were to lock down that facility for one

some entrepreneur out there possibly thank you council ham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmute your um mic thanks yeah the motion 193 stroke 20 regarding the covert 19 um i 'm very unhappy with that because i don 't want to discuss that matter informally without for formal minutes and uh emotions i can 't personally empower somebody else to speak from for my thoughts about the matter i think we 're going to have a an explosion of this virus very shortly and i think we need to be very agile and uh make the right decisions and i 'm not going to be guided by other people 's unqualified decisions so i reserve the right to speak independently thank you councillor pritchard anything further from those minutes i 'll put the emotion all in favor of accepting those minutes before [Music] benjamin thank you that 's unanimous um moving on to the rural fire service bushfire preparedness plans 7.1 council ham thanks mr mayor could we move into can we get to discuss this or i 'm moving out moving that would move into committee council wrestleman all in over against assume that 's unanimous thank you counselor hand thanks mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had um with the bush visor now now we 're coming into a new bushfire season and um we don 't have the dryness of last year however we 've had an extraordinary spring and we have um a lot of grass and certainly as someone living on a rural property i 'm nervous and i brought this up because i believe that a lot of people in the community are and we need to be prepared for what happens and also uh it 's probably a time that um maybe someone from the executive league team could actually just talk about how as a council what our role is um and council staff is in bushfire preparedness i think that 's a question directed to the ceo thanks mr mayor um through the chair i might ask um uh mr corsh to respond to that in regards to council 's local emergency management committee as the first step in that process thank you through you mr through you mr mayor our role with the local emergency management committee as per the act is largely as facilitator and providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting together including the rfs and sharing in information in regard to emergency incidents across the lga we met just last month and we 'll meet again in in december and uh yeah i 've got no i 've got um i 'm very very sure that a lot of that discussion will be around the bushfires um and the rfs response to the um to the commission 's work that they 've recently done um yeah and like i say our role is very much about facilitating the meetings making sure that uh that information gets out there and gets and gets shared across the combating agencies we 're not a combating agency ourselves just a facilitator thank you mr kash um councillor ham anything further from that um no i 'll let councillor pritchard speak first that 's the picture still on mute jeff still muted jeff um yeah look one of the problems in the last bushfire was a lack of communication proper communication to everyone it 's all very able to rely on the local radio but some people don 't listen to it or don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is getting uh alert to the people who are in isolated areas and make sure that we 've got contact with them all and we need as a brought up regarding other situations we need to have a shower-wide alarm system like airaid alarms that they have in this in the during the world wars something to alert people to get them to go to the local notice board or speak to somebody who has an internet connection uh whether it 's done by aircraft or by a fleet of police cars with sirens or by john lara and his merry men running around the countryside but we have to be able to alarm everyone get an alarm through everyone as in war thank you councillor pitcher and certainly note that um during the fires i i got plenty of uh text messages uh suggesting evacuation and the like whether that was because i was pretty mobile during the time i 'm not sure but um certainly got those through um i i think the the issue for for me is as councillor ham suggested this there 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild winter in a very good spring and we 've got a lot of biomass there the roadsides are just chock a block full of grass the paddocks of chocobo full of grass most properties are are well under stocked so we are going to have the very real risk of um of grass fires and maybe some crop fires further out west so uh that 's you know we 're going to have to be aware of that so roadside verges are an issue and then also overgrown blocks in town and those blocks that we or other agencies manage that are that aren 't grazed uh and are full of um full of fuel right right up to the boundaries of towns like like the town common and like a lot of the land around butler they 're going to cause issues for us and we really need to be on top of those and we probably need the experts in the field which is the rural fire service i assume in this case to give us advice and uh and make suggestions as to what needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced and how to do it so i guess we 're reliant on them and whether they 're able to do that is another is another question so that 's more of a statement basically i agree with you totally james because you have a look around at the roadside verges and the grass is already really high and nobody 's probably got stuck to feed off them but yeah surely there 's something that can be done to reduce that roadside verges because that was one of our big tinder boxes um earlier this year or late last year shocking thank you any other councillors castle cross i think it 's a get ready program that 's been come out as a result of them of the bushfire emergencies is a really good first step to getting that coordination coordinated response i don 't know if anybody has watched the abc program that craig roykershaw has done but that really really highlights the fact that people aren 't just don 't know how to prepare for a bushfire i think that going hand in hand with with the get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will coordinate that response is a really great first step thank you council across cancellata i was just going to add there 's been some recent legislative changes in the last couple of weeks in regards to the way the commissioner is able to order um land to be managed i think particularly in relation to private land holders they can now give them an order to to clean their yards up all their properties uh which i think is is is a very good move but um you know look essentially what we need to do is make sure that we don 't take our foot off the accelerator on these other matters like you know crown lands and national parks and all these other bodies that are that are essentially growing blackberries out of control um you know and they don 't want to um back burn or do anything because they 're worried about some you know possum that 's you know uh endangered or something you know but look at the end of the day we we just need to get on and do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're fortunate to have some of the best volunteers uh in the world in our area working in the rfs and uh they 're very capably led by people like john gregory and the like so um you know there 's a lot of things in our favor but uh you know we just need to make sure that uh that those other things are looked after so that uh you know we don 't have any repeats of the catastrophic events that we 've previously had thank you councillor for the comments do we move back into out of ready yes council ham councillor thistleman all in favor that 's unanimous thank you which brings us to the recommendations council ham you 're happy to move them now i am and i recommend that people have a look at the get ready program once that 's released um and take action across any further discussion all in favor that 's unanimous thank you um 10.1 governance and financial reports public hearings boundary review commission snowy valley 's council council ham each one of these five um separately or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant in this discussion i think i think that we 've had the minister for local government philly hancock come and visit she 's listened to people she has supported the view to go to the boundaries review commission and i am strongly in support of this however i don 't think that third point supports that yeah look i 'm happy to uh to redact that one and so that would mean that we 're recommending one given that the boundaries just have to check the mover and the second is happy with um item three being removed from from that remove it the move is suggesting and the secondary is i mean any further further discussion no okay i 'll put the motion in favor of one two four that 's unanimous and three lapses okay moving on mr may your um your voice is cutting in and out so to speak a little bit louder for it to transform my mind you don 't have a very ordinary internet connection for about a week just have to you know this is what we 've got to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have no problem with it at all thank you put the motion all in favor carried unanimously have to keep scrolling through what pages they 're on page 47 of the paper 50 of the electronic version now hearing interest returns item 10.3 okay 10.3 pecuniary interests three recommendations counselor right you 're moving that way counselor wrestleman discussion pretty self-explanatory all in favor dynamis thank you operational plan first quarter update 30th september 10.4 mover castle cross councillor ham council across it 's really pleasing to see that in spite of all the natural disasters that we 've faced 97 of our actions that 's 117 of our actions are progressing so um but i did have some individual uh ones from our strategy that i wanted to query please if i may certainly yep so so on 1.5.4 the tumor chamber of commerce at the meeting we had on tuesday night highlighted the need for a calendar of events so that council in the ca and the chamber could coordinate resources that were needed prior to any event i wondered if um that could be taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the fact that as a result of diag the disability action group that meets monthly that because of that consultative because snowy valley 's school is on board with that we were able to get a work experience student happening i think that 's a really really great outcome that needs to be shared um one point nine point three that 's the cross before you go on we 'll we 'll answer one and then two and then we 'll just go through them one at a time okay sorry mr mayor i 'll just uh refer item one about the calendar events to uh mr holton um thanks for that question council lacrosse um i too was at that um at um chamber of commerce um meeting and certainly we can work with the chamber of commerce and develop a schedule which um looks at public holidays and and special events that are happening around the region and uh then work with our um infrastructure team to ensure that we can present our municipality in the best possible way for those special events yes because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them at the weekend the long weekend that 'd be great so number two the snowy valleys work experience student is working with council which i think is such a great it 's taken years i believe for that to happen and it 's now actually happening and i think that 's really great so i wondered how they were going through the chair yes um uh uh shelly if you 'd like to respond to that um through you mr may thank you councillor cross it 's certainly a big achievement for the organization we 're very proud to have that student working in the governance team um first day this week had a very very positive day yeah thank you thank you for the question thank you third one 1.9.3 the 98 within two months of the development applications is uh is the turnaround and i think that 's that 's above expectations and that 's really good i wondered what had changed in that in that space to have allow that to happen through you mr mayor and and thank you for the question councillor cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um development applications which are generally turned around in a very quick quick amount of time so uh that would really reflect the nature of the applications that we 've received in the in the reporting period and we are you know many of those applications that we are trying to turn around very quickly are related to rebuilds following the bush fires so where possible we get those out the door in a matter of days and um i have done some analysis on our on our turnaround figures for the past three years and the average or the um the median turnover time is in fact at this stage 23 days so that 's across a three year three year period i think that 's a really great outcome for our community to know because development applications have always you know people have always had a very negative uh thinking around what council does with those so you know the fact that it 's being dealt with so quickly is fantastic council ham you had a question oh just to add to that we were um i remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would be under the special activation precinct with snowy hydro have have we heard anything about that did that come to fusion thank you thank you councillor hammer i remember um deputy premier varelaro myself um but no uh that 's just gingerbrine we didn 't it didn 't trickle down far enough for us right thank you if when that announcement was made the area was undetermined and there was a thought that it may come into our local government area but later on when the determination was done it 's it 's fully in the snowy monaro regional council in that gender buying area so there is an aim to look at other means of activation precincts not necessarily special activation precincts but our planning team is working very closely uh with the new south wales planning department at the moment on a number of matters in regards to snowy 2.0 and the development that is needed and changes that are needed in our local government area and you will also notice that um there was funds in the in the federal budget for those special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bucket of money castle costs continue 2.1.3 the tourism initiatives these were outlined to the chamber of commerce on tuesday evening and what was really interesting that came out of that was that businesses actually acknowledged that they needed to get behind the uh tourism promotions that snowy valleys is doing so it was really good to see that they were seeing how we could work together on that 2.2.3 there 's been great feedback from the video the tourism video as well so that 's a really positive outcome so um i 'm not sure if paul 's got anything to add to that um yes uh councillor cross um thank you and through you mr mayor um there have been there 's a couple of initiatives there 's the uh the rebranding uh of our tourism initiatives which uh was part of the video um that has met with quite a good a lot of positive feedback uh more recently we 've also had a rebranding of the snowy valley 's way and uh we 're getting really really good feedback from um the uh the sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowy valley 's way promotional initiative is a is a collaborative effort with a number of other councils that um that go from uh gundagai through to snowy valleys to taong to the um indigo shire and eventually wangaratta city council and that initiative is seeks to encourage drivers travellers to leave the hume highway and travel south via our municipality and those other municipalities i mentioned so we 're very pleased with the response we 're getting from those from those initiatives and uh 3.3.1 the climate change adaptation policy says that they 've the insurance company has released their report into the into that and is that available to us have we got that the advice we have is that the insurance company has have completed the development but we have not yet seen the final copy we 've seen some earlier copies and i 'm happy to make that available to councillors but we won 't um we won 't release the those drafts until we won 't we we won 't release those drafts but we will release the the final documentation seemed good because i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change adaptation committee to to start with and it was just the last one four point five point uh no sorry yeah 4.5.4 was in the project um framework has it has that whole of life uh been included in that so that when when projects are undertaken there 's the there 's the knowledge that what what will happen to the uh anything that 's not fit for purpose anymore has that been taken into consideration uh mr hyde sorry mr mayor i missed that one question regarding uh sorry counselor cross can you repeat the question the whole of life uh so that when if a resource is no longer needed there is a plan for how it will be disposed of or what will happen to it i presume you 're talking about physical resources not human resources that 's captured in our project methodology and i might ask um uh shelley jones to respond to that one yeah thank you thank you council across through you mr mayor um the refresh project management framework that we 're currently developing council across certainly takes into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should include some of those components it certainly includes whole of life costing for a new asset um and and waste that 's actually a good point we will take note of that to make sure that 's included thank you excellent thank you thank you thank you council across uh any other councillors council ham um just two points thanks mr mayor um 1.8.1 snow viewer estates just if i could talk to our mr paul holton about snow view her state and how 's that going and rumor has the da has finally been lodged is this correct and what time frame are we looking at at getting it started mr holton thank you mr mayor through you and uh thanks for the question councillor ham the d.a um is in the consultant who will lodge that on council 's behalf um that is expected to um uh be relatively straightforward given that um we have all of the design drawings and things at hand so it 's just a matter of putting those things together and lodging that that should be processed relatively quickly and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commence um selling uh land off the plan um rather than waiting for the civil works to be completed um speaking to my colleague the director executive director infrastructure heinz um he felt quite confident that uh if we got the civil works underway early in the new year we would be looking at a completion date towards the middle of the year certainly by the end of this financial year uh notwithstanding any unforeseen circumstances that may arise and as we know the unforeseen circumstances do arise uh on occasions in our municipality suddenly in 2020 they do and um just direct a question to the executive director of infrastructure so um civil works will they be contracted out or will they be done by council combination thereof so the road related works and and the bulk earthworks we 're intending to do those ourselves obviously things like the power the comms and those services that they would be contracted at thank you and and the second point was um first of all thank you very much to the executive director of community incorporation um for taking bruce wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the independent living units there what 's written in that operational plan seems a little bit different from what i saw in the fact that um the community centre is now finished and there 's a two unit independent living unit vacant and a one unit vacant and just wondering uh look they looked beautiful fantastic great i did not understand that i said up there but how do we advertise that and um i 'm sure that there would be some people interested in moving into those places uh through you mr mayor and thank you for the question councillor ham the um the the two unit um sorry the two-bedroom unit and the community center are um a part of the one structure and um they were the the two bedroom unit was constructed at the same time as the community center was being refurbished and um at the time that that that that project was uh held up because there were issues with the solvency of the of the contractor engaged to do the works and uh anyway the uh there were minor parts of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been completed and the uh and uh and the certificate certificate of occupancy uh i i believe is in hand so we can commence with the um uh putting that one out there to our networks and through the uh the various places um to uh to get people into those um into those facilities the um the vacant one-bedroom unit um was um came about due to the um the passing of the previous occupant and there was um a bit of a delay between uh that person uh passing on and being able to have the have that unit prepared for um for use um going forward but again that will be put out there through the multi-service outlet that we have in tumbarumba and certainly we would consider seeking expressions of interest through some kind of public process to ensure that they 're occupied as soon as possible thank you mr hull uh councillor tesla ham thank you for your question uh customer estimate question i 'm mute still councillor usman thank you um looking at um 1.5.1 facilitate and provide support to community events and programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on festivals that have been cancelled this year and the funding that we would have normally produced and given on to those festivals um and an explanation on um the bushfire recovery event programs that have been obtained i think another question for mr halton through you mr mayor thank you uh councillor iceland um the uh there are a number of festivals and events that yes they were cancelled like the batlow um uh cider fest as well as rock the turf these uh these events were eligible for um funding through destination new south wales and um they were granted that funding we negotiated with the state government and the the various authorities that were in control of that funding to ensure that that was able to be carried forward into 2021 and um and so those events and we 've actually paid that money i handed that money over to the organizers of those events um assuming that um they the events will go ahead in 2021. now some of the you know because the situation is still not resolved with in terms of the global pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those events can proceed in the new year in which case arrangements will be put in place for them to hold over those funds and and apply them to a to a subsequent festival because i i think in the spirit of um of fairness um it is uh you know there 's no fault of theirs that um they cannot um undertake those events in the way that they they may uh need to um i can 't speak on the um bushfire recovery events um i uh uh but um except for one that was um we were very fortunate um snowy valley 's council was very fortunate in uh obtaining significant funding through austrade a federal government uh initiative for events for a significant event to be uh held across um adelong batlow and um tumbarumba uh a winter festival or called winter bites aimed at attracting visitors to those places during the winter which is not not our high high season in terms of tourists but the the aim is to get people there this time and hopefully they 'll see uh what a magical place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination for their winter holidays in future years as well thank you mr holton and over what time does this festival hold all right certainly so with the winter bites festival will take place over the month of june july and august um there will be specific highlight days um on on weekends uh in each of those places uh in the so um adelong i think is the month of june uh tumblr under the month of july and um battler will bring it home uh in in august but in between there will be um there 'll be other key events now i can 't give too much detail because we 've only just um we 've gone out uh seeking expressions of interest for a festival coordinator or an event coordinator and uh once uh that person 's on board we will be able to put a lot more um uh detail to uh councillors and and to the community as well thank you thank you mr walton any further outcast of course just to add to what uh the direct director of community and cooperation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a bucket of eight million dollars available around australia for that and i think that that really shows how seriously uh the we we were so seriously impacted by the bushfires that that 's a credit to those who wrote those grants that we got that amount of money and it 's recognition of that impact that the bushfires did have on us so i think there 's a congratulations to those people in the in the council who wrote that grant really well done to get that money because that will bring our communities together thank you council across anything further because the pritchard yes i think this virus thing is going to stay linger along if not for a long period will be for a long period but we all say that these viruses have been or plagues have been here with mankind for forever and there 'll be more in the future particularly with the increasing population i think everything we have to do needs to be planned with that in mind i think we need to de-emphasize festivals and then and and then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking and horse riding and that sort of thing we want to have get away from having everyone crowded in together thank you guys um yes very valid points there and we 'll i 'm sure mr half will look good and the team will look at ways of of alleviating that and keeping everyone as covered safe as possible um nothing further we 'll put that motion then all in favor that 's unanimous thank you uh counselors that takes us to the financials statement of investments 10.5 could i have a page reference because i 've got to return to the business page i 've got 57 57 of the electronic and one recommendation there do i have a mover councillor hamm councillor cross council ham first of all thank you to the chief financial officer this is terrifically well set out and every question i have i read down in the report and you 've answered it so much so that i don 't have a question for you however i do have a question for the executive director of infrastructure about the tumba rumba pool progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one i mean it 's tremendous to drive past and see what 's happening just wondering if it 's on schedule is the pool going to open in time and then two there 's quite a bit of uproar not much more but questioning in tumba rubber about the the pool hours and the hours um i know when we were deciding on the hours you explained to us very much about usage and how the hours were set so and that they were flexibility would you mind talking on those two points executive director mr mayor thank you councillor ham in regard to the new pool and water play area as you said it 's it 's progressing quite well in that the below groundworks are complete there was a drop test undertaken on the concrete pour and all that passed which is which is fantastic concourse has also been poured so now we start with the finishing services surface surfaces not services and that works we 'll go over the next few weeks so it won 't be finished in time for the actual pool opening as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one end of the pool so we 're only packed on the normal operation of the pool but yeah hoping to have it well and truly done in time for the school school holidays so i hope and have that space ready to go when when when the kids are finished uh school so we 're talking about sort of um mid towards the end of november that work should be complete um in regard to the opening hours yes very very much it 's about managing budget and optimizing when the pool is open so so we do get usage um we very much can 't afford to open the pool and have no one using it um it 's not a it 's not a good spend and um yeah just it just yeah and we have troubles finding staff to staff those periods and when there 's no one using the pool there 's there 's not a lot of um certainly always agreed that we 'd have a degree of flexibility as far as pull out pull ours go so if it 's hot we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that opportunity to do for the tumba rumba pool for example um from the 19th of december that pool will be opening from 12 noon so once those school holidays kick off kick on it will be opening at lunchtime through till 6 30 pm that goes from mid december through to the end of january and again if it 's hot we can extend those periods um the adelong pool which is currently open um it 'll it 'll open at 10 a.m from mid-december through to the end of january 10 a.m until 6 30 p.m and again you know if it 's hot and there 's high usage we 've got the option to to adjust adjust those hours this this time of year our usage is generally fairly low so not a lot of point opening the pools earlier at this time i hope that answers the question yes so so just a scenario if um tumba rubber was going quite hot it could open at 10 a.m like avalon as well yes yes most but most definitely if there 's demand and people using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yes we set the pool hours but then we review and it 's the same you know if there 's different user groups that want access to the pool outside of those hours that 's obviously not a problem they just book it and we we make it available and obviously we 've got the swipe cards now across all the pools which pretty much go from seven in the morning till seven at night so our lap sweet thank you for your answer as well thank you okay um and of course the other thing about the pools is the the longer they 're open and the more people use them the more income they can generate uh council this woman thank you mr mayor um question about um the main expenditure for the month the tree removal claimable um 222 000 just wondering if this funding for tree removal is likely to continue for the next month and a few months after that or is it is it an end some councillorism and i 'll show it i 'm sure it 'll end at some stage but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are you mr mayor councillor insulin um we 're yeah the funding at this stage um it 's through natural disaster recovery funding arrangements and um the authority has agreed to extend that work through till february next year so we 've currently got three three separate crews out there doing that work and the schedule they 're on schedule for completion february so um and the funding 's been extended to accommodate that i must say though that that work is limited to the cleanup of road corridors local road corridors that have been impacted by fire so it 's about getting in and cleaning up the rubbish material that 's lying on the ground and all that and we 're taking that away and getting that chipped um and hopefully we can find a find a reuse for it and by local corridors you lean right right controlled by council yes correct mister yes thank you council have you finished oh i was about to say look they 've been doing the road up to tomorrow and an incredible job and i know some people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a a pink dot on them suddenly they don 't get removed i i 'm very impressed yeah so mike thank you i 'm sure we all are councillor pritchard still on me at jeff with a tree removal it is indeed removing the nesting sites for birds and small animals and whatever and this has been an ongoing problem and nationally i was in germany once and i noticed in the pine forests there the commercial ones that they had bird shelters high up and they 're all numbered so every time they cut down a row of trees they 'd beforehand they 'd remove the bird shelters and nesting nesting boxes and whatever and move them onto another lot of trees and that was done on a systematic scale and we really should getting around to where we need to do that here because when you drive from here to well this is before the fires when you drive from here to from schumer to tumbarumba or you know once you got beyond battle you hardly ever saw a bird and um we need to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be simple to do to get the woodworkers to make the appropriate size and whatever and do it as a routine and i think that 's in train i think probably not to the extent that 's needed but i do believe that the um some of the men 's sheds are constructing bird boxes okay uh any further questions counsellors mr mayor um just a question about rhodes and maritime service payment i wondered if the that was what that was for please oh yes um executive director you mr mayor thank you councillor cancel across um that work is is actually income and that 's income uh for work that um cancel does on state manage roads under under a road maintenance contract and that 's i think that would be the the first quarter payment looking at that amount that 's great so that 's contract work that we 're getting private work that we 're getting yes non-non-cancer work year yep um heinz can you give us some examples of some of those roads please just for the for the listeners yeah um so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads across the lga excluding snowy mountains highway so the batlow road for example we look after that on behalf of the state under a maintenance contract alpine way go we do some works on go cut road as well yeah thank you very much is there the capacity to grow that uh private work across a shower with the roads yeah through you mr mayor can 't cancel across always looking for opportunities to to grow our commercial works yes and quite actively having discussions with different different organizations to to do that thank you i may miss mr mayor just note that uh the mayor was with uh minister tool the other day and um his advisers and some of the people high up in the department and we um are continuing to have that conversation about extending our rmcc contract thank you put the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you race harmonization endorsement of proposed raising structure who 'd like to move this councillor ham wants a name attached to it councillorism as well i i 'd you get to speak first all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on with it but there 's a few things there 's just two things that i 'd like clarification from is um why our rule residential um rating system why is that going and just before we pass number three um we 're going to consult with royal clubs but what 's the what is the philosophy behind um rating rural clubs my understanding is that some have have been paying rates for years and some haven 't so once it 's harmonizing across the board but um maybe ceo can answer these questions i think it 's certainly a question for the ceo he may direct it on yeah we 'll have the cfo respond to that please suzanne through you mr mayor thank you council again um the rural residential category has been uh evaluated we had more than half of rural residential properties come and nearly half in the extrema child that do not comply with the act so we need to move them to um residential category anyway and as you would have read in the race options study and then also in the update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommends to actually abolish the entire rural residential category because there is hardly any difference between the proposal of when keeping it or when moving it back to residential and it will be much easier to administer if they were all in the one category although that 's not the main concern the main concern really is we have a large number of non-compliant properties and a very very small difference between the two categories under the harmonized writing structure and and financially how are they going to be impacted um that is outlined in the study rural residential is generally the one category that is impacted the most unfortunately because of all those um incompatible properties within that category they will have to move regardless what we do and the others obviously are impacted then as well but it is generally an increase to rights for rural residential okay and for your second question through you mr mayor the philosophy in writing rural clubs i think it it is very hard to say with hindsight why this was done it has only been affected this way in the extembaramba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different type of rates to three clubs whereas the extrema choir um either gave no relief to rates or did it through a donation and generally is accepted that it is a much better way for council to um help its community whatever you know whatever category it is in through a donations policy or something similar rather than through the rating structure so what we want to do is actually align all clubs and and be very open to support and have a mineral mou about how we can support them if need be exactly exactly thank you thank you very much that 's the councillor i no longer have a conflict interesting because i 've just sold my farm but i paid rural residential for many years and i never argued about it because i was on council but i had 50 acres and ran a couple of about a dozen cows and read them at times and also ran a commercial peony crop how do you define what 's a rural property and what 's uh what 's a real residential was i think about most unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rated now residential cfo thank you mr mayor councillor preacher it is defined under the local government act how these categories are set it from memory i would have to be corrected by um our specialist but if remember it 's 40 hectares now sorry 40 acres that is the um cut off but it is also about what is the main purpose of your property as in is is its main purpose a residential purpose or is its main purpose to make a profit from farming so some of these borderline properties still have to be looked at case by case basis apply for a refund can i over the for over the years that 's under the 58 because at least that 's 50 acres which is above the cut-off point i think i i think you probably needed to mention your peculiar interest at the start of the uh i don 't think there 's a definition discuss later on um but yeah it sounds like um sounds like you got the rough end of the stick there any other questions or comments or or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people that this has been a really really challenging process that we have not undertaken lightly and that feedback from the community that i 've been heard has been that they too appreciate just how complicated it actually is uh and they 've as well they 've really appreciated the opportunity to have a zoom or a telephone consultation to understand the process and have gained a much better understanding of it through that consultation thank you council across and i also understand once this is um once this is accepted by council there will be a tool available on the website for people to put their their information in and uh and see what the difference is in their um in their rates so this is really not the end of it but but a process along the way so that there 's another process to come so that people know that we 're not making a decision today a final decision today correct counselor cost the wheels do not move as quickly as some other areas i was just going to ask if they in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the service provision that council provides in relation to say garbage collection uh to the ceo first yeah through the mayor council lada the service charges in regards to service collection are separate and we are in a constant review of those with uh each of the um each of the budget adopted and the rating structure adopted a doctor because they 're one of our charges we have harmonized those in the past and we do have some major works happening in those areas with the changes across to fogo so there 'll be a review of that coming into into the budget process we 're very fortunate with the fogo project to have a very large grant to support the initiation of that proposal but we will bring back some more information in the budget process around those charges for waste has it not been the case though that in some instances those that are currently marked as rural residential are being charged a garbage and waste service when in theory they don 't receive one uh because i i know previously that this has uh been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice was that uh you still may put garbage into a bin in in the cvd of of the township and therefore you 're a contributor to that castle we do have a defined garbage area in that area anyone that has a property in that does pay that collection fee that garbage collection area and we will be looking at whether some areas need to be added to that but if a person chooses not to put out um their bins or access that service they are still in the garbage uh defined area and therefore have to pay the fees i think i mean say say for instance in my case i mean i could put the bin out but nobody collect it okay i think uh we 'll look into that matter unless uh mr corsh wants to uh respond to that at all we might do that later on i think right thank you councillor lana uh we might uh move on just uh just a question so basically residential farmland and business is more closely reflected to the former tumbarumba rating structure than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is correct but also um residential the the entire proposed structure is actually closer to the former tamarama child and to the former geometry okay nothing further put the motion all in favor thank you councillor right that 's unanimous warning hall reconstruction uh just before we we did have a uh a presentation from deity greenhouse uh from the orny before before this meeting started and i thank her for a contribution and i thank the community and i understand the hardship they 've been through do we have a mover for this these six recommendations councillor wright councillor smith counselor right one mute castle right can 't hear your castle right still on you right now um yes i think it 's important we support this all the way through um and i think you know like um on number six we should also listen to our direct our executive about what else we can do to the long-term um support of it but um you know i 'm 100 for this whole project thank you council ryan and i 'd also suggest to the people of orni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good people of the gilmore valley who who have a similar setup with with their with their hall any other councillors counselor i 'd just like to congratulate deidre greenhouse for a presentation this morning which was um just spoken with so much passion and also i 'm very aware of how much work deidre and the whole community have had putting in submissions getting the local member justin clancy to come and visit um this is a community that has had three bushfires in five years and they 're being proactive because you know it 's it 's the way of life now and they 're making sure that they 're covered for things that may go wrong in the future and for good times as well so congratulations and good luck with this project thank you council ham nothing further put the motion all six recommendations all in favor that 's unanimous thank you uh 11.3 management reports planning proposal trim at local environment plan amendment number six mover council lacrosse council wrestleman castle lacrosse on mute castle costs this proposal was outlined at the chamber of commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the director of company a community incorporation and it was really really positively and well received the general feeling was how refreshing it was to have a council that was so proactive in anticipating something that could actually help support businesses and grow our communities it provided a great opportunity for boutique operations and for to attract more tourists to the area as well so they could see the great social benefit they understand that it could take some time but the whole concept they embrace was really well embraced by that by the business community thank you council across certainly exciting concept let 's see how quickly it can be done um i was just going to ask in relation to this soon as it 's a change is there any requirement for this to go out for a public comment happy to take that question through you mr mayor um this uh yes the whole process does require extensive consultation uh what happens following council 's determination of this recommendation if council if council does determine to go with the recommendations the matter will be referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um there will be extensive consultation around that uh where we will seek public comment and feedback regarding the proposal and then the matter will come to council again at some time in the future for a final uh approval and then ultimately it would be gazetted okay so essentially we 're only giving the green light here to to making the inquiry and and getting further information yes to get it through the the first hurdle which is the gateway process through the state government that 's correct i i have a question mr hollands it 's it 's got costs and benefits uh ni surely there 's a cost to council to do something uh to make an amendment to the lep uh no there 's no uh look the i guess um the only cost has been that um we we have him have on uh on a retainer a consultant who was dealing with some uh strategic land use um projects um but that uh that uh contractor is dealing with a range of our strategic land use um projects as well so it 's considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor um they 're doing they 're working on a um on our um uh on a rural land use study as well and they also prepared our lsps so um the next stage is to refer to the state government which is of no cost to council um if there are costs there of a very minor nature okay thank you uh any other comments cause the prichard yes the uh addison as a word i wasn 't looked it up the other night and it does include some very noisy activities you know such as welding and metal work and woodwork and whatever and i think that really has to be we have to be very careful that we don 't allow the noisy industries in there um and i guess the hours of operating too if it 's going to be in residential areas i mean it 's nice to think of all of this is people doing crocheting and so forth but there are some noisy things and whether there should be a list of allowed or disallowed activities should be considered i i 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and um mr holton would you like to comment yes yes through you mr mayor this is not about um giving carte blanche to artisan um uh food and drink premises uh in the cbd it 's merely allowing for those types of activities to be to seek a dea so as such any any proposal would be subject to all of um the you know the assessment um and uh and presumably um approved only where appropriate and where um uh and through through the usual ga assessment process and it 's not just artisan everything it 's artisan food and drink uh which is a specific uh category of use that is uh mentioned in the planning scheme thank you mr halton castle lada ladder i was just going to say yeah i 'm the only concern that i have i mean we obviously need to have a a a good long hard look at it i i concur what councillor pritchard says there the thing that worries me is that in some way you know we 've got these businesses that are setting up that going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know there might be the council rates for for being a commercial business and essentially they 're doing the same business as what some of these other people now be doing under the umbrella of being artisan and and they 're not having to you know comply with all that regulatory and financial impulse and you know we just need to be very careful about uh what what what we 're creating here um because i mean it 's not dissimilar to the um you know the the b and b process uh you know where people are paying commercial rates to run a hotel uh and all the insurances and all those things that go with it but somebody can have a b and b uh or a uh airbnb and they 're not subject to that so it 's it 's it 's it 's uh it 's not without its difficulties if i may respond through you mr mayor this um the uh what what is before you at the moment uh if it went through to its um conclusion successfully would not uh see uh unregulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely to allow that uh people wishing to use land for that purpose to actually apply for a d.a currently uh if you uh have an artist in food and drink premises you cannot apply for a d.a to conduct that type of business within the cbd um so it is not a removal of any regulatory um framework it is just merely to allow applications to be lodged for that use within the cbd and each application will be determined on its merits and the relevant planning fees and and other environmental health and food premises registration requirements will be uh as they as they are for any other business so it 's not a free run for anybody thank you anything further counselors counselors i 'm sorry i thought i 'd unmuted it um yes i 'd like to make the comment um a year or so ago we took a trip to northern victoria and saw some very interesting developments with food and drink artisans and so forth um in a in the commercial areas sorry in the residential or yet commercial areas center of town which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas and i would certainly welcome seeing that kind of development take place in the tomb at cbd to attract visitors and bring more business to the area thank you uh anyone further and just do you actually have to be uh i mean it has to be specific for tumit because because of the other areas are okay is that my understanding um paul um through you mr mayor thank you for the question council lacrosse um in our smaller villages the zoning in the central parts of those um those towns and and places are um are generally uh have a have a a lot more scope for a range of different activities so in this instance um tumut um is the uh is the town that 's most affected by this and again i 'd stress this is not opening it up to you know unregulated or any other any other act any other thing it 's just allowing people to apply for that that that use the same as if you were in battle timber umber or um or adlock you could then apply for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district thank you that 's very clear anything further councillors i 've got the um the motion there put the motion all in favor that 's unanimous thank you takes us to community recovery report quarter quarter one mover kessler ham councillor cross tesla ham um first of all across the board i i i just have to congratulate the people who are who are working with the recovery um i just get compliments after compliments about what people are doing and people are being heard they 're being seen um you know and and you read through you know the newsletters the social media now there 's um community events um you know obviously being aware of how people 's mental health has been affected throughout all this um i would like to congratulate everyone involved in this which is actually every person who works for council who have been absolutely outstanding right from the 28th of december so um there 's that actually we probably need to go into committee about this mr mayor and you 're moving that way yep do you have any colleague who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody in favor i 'm not sure about councillor pritchard yes yeah here we go oh that 's unanimous we 're in committee okay thank you and and i 'll continue the only the only thing i am hearing and um a lot about is that there 's seems to be an awful lot of money for mental health which is fabulous and fantastic but um no criticism against anyone who 's trying to do it but it 's it 's a really hard thing to hit the mark with and hit words you know i don 't have the solution but just the comment that very grateful the money 's there but um i 'm not sure who in the executive team might be able to direct that but just how how hard it is to have this money in to make it effective thank you councillor hamill i 've also noticed that through as well with the interagencies and and the like and also a lot of the grant application process we 've seen a lot of outside providers um looking for a tail hold in the snowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to comment yeah certainly it 's very pleasing to see the the interactions and and the ability of our staff to be able to advocate for additional funding specifically where the needs in our uh snowy valleys community are and we have seen some initiatives that have been released statewide many of them have actually started here in the snowy valleys so we 've been right at the forefront of that and our staff have been able to work with the state government staff and get some really good initiatives out there and not only good initiatives but good ways in going about that so that it reduces the amount of paperwork that someone has to fill out and all those sorts of things and we 're trying to get that cross-fertilization of ideas so it 's certainly been very well done did that answer your question uh counselor ham uh not really well well it it it reinforced part of my statement but it 's yeah i i don 't know if anyone can answer is when the funding 's not hitting the mark well you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've both spoken on it it 'll be fine it 's keeping people employed i guess so the question directly was again sorry counselor ham well it was probably in the area of mental health that there seems to be an awful lot of money being thrown like money like we 've never seen before and in the community said that there is the comment that sometimes it 's not actually hitting the mark no no criticism of the people trying to do it but sometimes with mental health you can 't fix a problem with money and in covert it 's just being exasperated more absolutely the the contact has made that one um very difficult and we can um as agencies as neighbours as friends we can do a lot of things to help people out but if the person doesn 't specifically want that help at that time it can can be quite difficult so we can identify those people that are likely in need and there 's been lots of training available in our community to to link into what things we should be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive that assistance then it is quite difficult thank you yes i i i get you um i get you for it it 's it 's uh that 's right exasperating isn 't it i think it 's a it 's a new word yeah sorry james i 've just difficulty hearing you at the moment sorry uh any other counsellors no so it was a committee of one yes okay so all right let 's move back into our committee that 's the ham council of wrestleman all in favor that 's unanimous thank you so do we have a move in a second or for that i 'm sorry on airmen cross any further comment all in fact unanimous thank you committee meetings 12 battle development league council smith i have no comments to make on that particularly um apart from the fact that we 're finding it very helpful indeed to have mr holton there and he 's able to answer all the questions and give all the assistance required at that meeting and that has simplified the process quite a lot i believe thank you thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put the motion all in favor it 's carried unanimously councillors um that concludes the uh the uh open section of council uh local government act provides the council may close to the public that part of the meeting that deals with matters of the confidential nature section 10.2 lists such commanders the grounds on which a meeting is closed the public must be specified in the decision to close the meeting recorded in the minutes um recommendation is that council move into confidential

counselors before i proceed on i just would like to acknowledge i have heard of two uh individuals who received queen 's birthday honours only two moment there may be others but i 'd like to um give my uh congratulations to john melrose and batmo and also mick garraway as well so congratulations to those two jimmy yes not in our council area but he hasn 't had a lot of influence right over the time so so yes there are there are some and uh i encourage um uh people to to nominate the queensberg family confirmation of minutes 5.1 would be meeting 20th may 2021 councillor class and council again and the business of writing from there nothing access to governance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably um while in fact janetta 's carrying [Music] uh 10.1 integrated planning and reporting suite for adoption across we 're in committee council um well first of all it was an extraordinary amount of feedback we got on the ipr and um to the people who make the effort to give any sort of feedback i congratulate you and thank you very much because um it does take effort and it is probably was an extreme way to get a community engaged but engaged people were and um and that 's what we want i mean we want to know what people think there 's just a couple of things i 'd like to bring up in particular first one would be in the attachment 10.1 page five and that is a submission number seven it would be about children 's services but i will just point out that um the person who sent that through i thought it was a very thoughtful submission thank you but if i could just think up about um children 's services saying that we were children services what ran as a deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually a typo and i am really really happy and proud to say that children 's services is council i 'm at a working profit and um and i think that 's the way it always should be so if i could just pick up that point thank you for making that other things um number eight they talked about having material cultural change um that 's using aboriginal signage and place names for out of town environmental features great idea thank you for that um i and then 41 which is like about logo the comment made was that food and organic waste project seems to be a waste of money energy and environment projects and svc need to be economically justified just to have a put in that thoughtful comment um i was wondering if i could just maybe ask the director of the infrastructure how pogo is funded and how not only is it not a waste of be making money that would be all right certainly and uh just of course you might even mention the uh ministers environments statement yesterday i believe going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely funded through funding agreement motivating us through the epa which takes into account um as you 've said mr mayor that this will become a regulation and it is required that we do provide an organic service for all our community in the in the future so very much expected that we so i suppose for us we 're in a really good position we 're able to access significant amount of funding which covers the majority of the service being both the collection service and vision of our processes so we 'll be able to process that material locally local jobs we 're doing that in partnership with belmar so lots of benefit back to the community as well as removing that organic material from landfill where it um as it breaks down it creates meat and gas which has an impact big impact on our atmosphere 20 odd little times um we also have a benefit locally with that material being processed locally and hopefully reuse locally so lots of benefits to the community out of this great opportunity for the community to do its thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking advantage of the service and is there a funding stream coming out of this like the pogo gets broken down and then you 're going to rip on sell things yeah yeah so we did a lot of a lot of modeling back in the early days too and particularly with processing it here locally value adding to that material and on selling it yeah there 's an attention that that would cover all costs and equal return that 'll take some time to get to that point but yeah certainly that 's that 's that 's the aim so having that c money up front from the epa and then being able to value if but when i read through um 495 were just copies of what somebody had gone through and i found that really really disappointing to find that that people hadn 't taken the opportunity to do it for themselves but they had just copied what somebody else had said and i i find that i wondered why we were handed all of these submissions at the military theater without public meeting it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissions that are all from the one area they 're all from the tumbarumba region where they 're those [Music] it 's absolutely disingenuous that you would make a submission based on a template if we wanted to have done that we 'd put our survey i mean you know predominantly they 're all based around the svc and the misinformation uh that 's being peddled about that unfortunately and hey and once again you know it 's the uh uh you find it hard to believe would be like sheep you know why would you why would you do that i mean if you want to have some genuine into what council is considering in its long-term financial uh viability why would you just go and copy copy and paste the same thing from 500 people and submit it i mean it 's just completely completely ridiculous that they would do that i mean it just it to me just demonstrates just how lackluster the whole um saved tumblr on the shy campaign is you know that 's that 's that 's how they operate so uh once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't get the real concerns out in the community we just get this push to to do merge based on you know the the wants of of the people of orange and tumbaruma um not not the not the overwhelming community i mean the overwhelming community have haven 't spoken in these submissions about these concerns i mean they 're obviously reasonably satisfied with the explanation that we 've given and i think what what explanation we have given in relation to our financial situation is uh it 's very reasonable i mean we 're not uh we 're not imploding uh you know we 're not in a situation that local government hasn 't found itself in for the last 50 years it 's essentially about making sure that with with the um possible drying up of funds at a federal and state level because of the uh you know the massive burden that uh the state and federal governments have had to encounter uh with the economy in relation to covet and fires and floods and and other natural disasters they 've had to shore up the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in jobs uh you know and we just can 't be guaranteed that that that usual income that we receive from the state and federal government is going to be forthcoming uh in the short in the short term so we need to make sure that whatever services that we 're offering as a council and they 're numerous um you know whether it be the roads we travel on or the footpaths or the um garbage collections there 's just so much we do um that people don 't recognize and see um but we need to be able to have that debate with the community about what their expectations are in relation to servicing um and whether they want to continue their current service levels if that 's the case then we have to make sure that we we can pay for it and that 's that 's exactly where we 're heading down and i commend the council for being brave enough to have that decision three months out from an election because you know as much as we 're not committing to it uh we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable and brave of the staff and the uh and and and the elected representatives around this table to to actually have that uh discussion with the community thank you council mark chancellor smith um yes mr man i 'm looking at the graph representation the feedback i find it quite extraordinary that the long-term financial plan has attracted 523 responses compared to the overall ibnr feedback of only four responses the sustainability plan which clearly is one of the most significant parts of this whole suite of documents also only received four responses the revenue policy one response the fees of charges seven responses and the operational planning budget nine responses i think that there is a very clear bias and skewed uh representation uh on this and when we look at where the submissions came from in the demographics and all of that from a large proportion 506 of those responses came from uh area of postcode area 2653 which happens to be my local post code um so you know in compared to the cubits basically there were only 16 responses in open so i think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i find that you know maybe we shouldn 't necessarily put a lot of weight on those skewed we should look at the ones that come from the whole demographic area has a more realistic feedback i think justin [Music] um um i 'm i 'm interested to know um just what proportion of weighting he put on the um that was that was supplied to the council um it does concern me that the 450 plus people would take time to put their name to a submission um i would have been far more interested to see that they were posted rather than potentially hand in person in montreal or did some people hand in bulks of signs i 'm not sure could someone answer that question so not only did it not get handled that tangible person came in like a survey as you mentioned which which to me democratically erodes the level of information someone can sign up never even without reading it and not know what we 've done so i have a concern about the fact that that it 's not a democratic process in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that when we have four template letters we have considered the content of those four different templates in our assessment and as we 've done i 'm just concerned that we perhaps as a council may have had an opportunity but right now we have an opportunity to learn from the process we went through to get those those responses and some of the things that concern me is when we look at page 23 in this report we 've got committee meetings and community meetings hosted by um external parties and it concerns me that we we were leading ourselves not necessarily leading our community allowing people who had hidden agendas to to misinform the community that came to their meetings and i do hope that we will look at this process and and develop it to a more strengthened process because i think we 've got the response that will come from doing something like that so i know that 's common rather than the question but that 's how i said situation thank you jefferson i will um suggest that form letters from filling them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it but it certainly made a point and as i said earlier it was part of the theater of the theater um for the importance of these documents we have workshopped these documents so so carefully we 've gone out with public consultation we 've done everything possible to get community impact and i really do think that they disrespect me that only um [Music] actual responses now i 'd also like to make a point about sustainability that one step that contains what we want to do in the future it 's really about starting a conversation about how we 've only balanced service delivery with with our financial situation it 's not really just the thing and i don 't know how many times we have to say it but the special rate variation is not a bad idea it is for the next counselling to decide and i don 't know how many times we have to sell right out to people before they get it one of the things that i noticed in the in the documents is people complained about the the consultants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and thought well in my household i outsourced to a specialist to do my plumbing to do my hpr electricals i could sure i could probably probably do them myself if i google but often it 's much more cost effective and much you get a much better quality if you 're outsourced to an expert and that 's what we do as a council that is what council 's role is to make sure that what with the infrastructure we build with plans that we make are the best quality and it would be wonderful to have staff that could do all that but i challenge anyone in house in this room that they could do everything uh without having to go to some kind of consulting to get it in so i really just wanted to make that and i think you know if you look at the state park and the pump tracks that we 've done they 're a good example of getting an expert in to make sure that those facilities are well used and beautifully or planned i 've just got two points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the srv with all these submissions and what 's been in the media the people i 'm most worried about is the vulnerable in our community and um i feel there 's a lot of fear um that you know our rates like you know one of these submission set our rates are going to go up 60 so i i 'd really like to hear from the cfo about how how percentages work um how rates are not going to go up 60 and um also to the very vulnerable people in the community how we would look after them super sure you will miss them there thank you councilman percentages um a mathematical issue and i think um secondary school so sorry um it 's it 's not that hard what we 're proposing in our srv scenario is that they will the general rates will go up by 12 in year you have to add the right cape to that so there 's another two percent possibly we don 't know yet but let 's say it 's two percent the rates will go up 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again so what you get is you have 14 that you increase the rates before and then you actually increase the rates on those 14 cents as well that 's why in the end we get to a higher than just add them up figure and that is called compounding it 's the same in your mortgage is the same when you 're playing back in your house or your car it 's it 's not a new concept but it doesn 't add up to 60 percent i think the people who were talking about 60 or similar figures were referring to rates islandization first which we all acknowledge there are some increases coming out of the race harmonization and then they just kept adding adding adding um further the rates increases the other thing is these increases are going to be only on the general rate if they get through and not on water or waste charges so it 's only a small part of your great spill that will have to increase and as for vulnerable people there is archie provisions in place under the local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's also nothing new and people will be able to apply under party provisions if they have problems thank you and then on a happier story i noticed that where donations 261 000 um is our contribution that we give in donations and i 'm particularly um excited to see the new donations to the roosevelt golf club can cover the cultural club tumblr umber golf club to be in line with performance human clubs being funded so that 's terribly positive and also the um section 355 committee 's transferring over um promised insurance assistance now that is promised that 's written in lack of response so um i look forward to meeting with those communities and seeing that council has actually followed through and paid for the insurance thank you for listening um mr mayor who um i noticed that um there seems to be some lack of regularity in the donation that we have here too and what i wonder how each of these donations are arrived at and how long have some of these been historically in place and how many people or groups have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we have an opportunity here in the next new council to look at these donations and make sure that we 're not perhaps missing opportunities to support community groups or perhaps supporting community groups that now no longer need the support we 're getting um and i i i 'm just concerned that we haven 't got consistency in the appearance of this appearance but you know you wonder why some of the football clubs explored with other football clubs mentioned adobe but i just feel that there 's a historical embedded um degree in paper and perhaps we need um sessions then they were used for special purposes and where we 've been for a finite amount of money a specific purpose when that money 's paid and this is a permanent that 's what it 's all about [Music] is [Music] if [Music] um [Music] where the reality is we will keep fighting for a change in this costume that 's that 's the best scenario that 's our best scenario and we will keep doing that we 'll advocate with state and federal governments to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know we have a flood event we have a bushfire people home and confidence insurance goes up and people don 't blink an island and you know as much as it is i 'm not saying it isn 't um and 500 a year to somebody is a lot of money but you know we provide a lot of we provide a lot of services um probably a lot of services that we shouldn 't be providing um but we choose to do that and that 's our choice so that 's the discussion we need to have mr okay so cancel sweet hair we have the recommendations there but can we run ask and cross whether the financial assembly yes yes [Music] this is rakes we cast for rates to be harmonized which is um often since 2016 has been coming and um as the cfo alluded to some people rates will go up quite significantly not a not a huge amount of people but there are some and on the other side there are some people whose grades are actually dropping and to those people would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're number five and the domestic waste charges they 've all been we 've just passed those in our um in our and our fees is moving on do i have any other things put the marshmallows right that 's the picture no thanks 10.3 governments and finance reports on financial performance [Music] um significantly but you 're saying that natural disaster money will uh conveniently cover those prices if the money coming in if there yes the money coming in so to speak is actually accounted for in that table you can see that other charges of fees are above budget so part of that is already handled here and um the good news is um for 5.6 million dollars in the first installment against soundcloud thank you and the other is the rncc reported words 1.9 million does that work so is that is this is usually um [Music] noticed in the previous yes and also giving us the opportunity to you 've got um asked to see it a couple of questions about the overall council 's summary so uh operating result at the moment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time are we backing back on are we are we getting better is our loss going to be not as bad as what um we have been anticipating and also i don 't understand the last column about original budget um the quarterly budget review was presented to the council last month and it forecasts pretty much 3.67 million um deficit at the end of the year and i think we are on track to achieve that this is purely a snapshot at a certain time yeah sure and it 's also influenced by the rising of the budget so if something 's out of back in the phasing of the budget compared to when we actually spend the money or receive the money that will influence that particular month so um the quarterly budget review is forwarded in more accurate forecast as of before the end of the year the final column original budget is the total budget for the year whereas the budget here today is to face so that final column is saying we 'll make a profit of four million dollars but that 's with capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't i guess thank you of income from other identified as other income and we have an idea of what that is about and i also want to comment on the interest and investment revenue of 400 and 2 today that 's quite remarkable considering the interest rates that are around at the moment it 's a pretty good result so far thank you mr mayor thank you smith everything that is not ground funded or rights so it can be anything bringing contributions to um certain reimbursements from states and similar things the um obviously the investment return at the moment is not generally good um but that is vital to currently given that situation that 's quite a good reason okay she doesn 't agree [Laughter] i 'm not watching recommendation investments um i was just going to ask about the breakup of those cash investments um i noticed that we 've stuck on the national australian bank at point three five percent on the 27th through the year so the bendigo bank seems to only get smaller parcels um 250 but the interest rates are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is there some reason why we can 't book more would bend to go back children there um council martial yes there is a reason we have um limits of how much we can invest in certain um classes of banks and they are rated from asia to underwrite it i believe bendigo bank is currently writing triple b which makes our investments to 30 unfortunately this has basically bank has been breaking down over the last few months or maybe half year [Music] but overall they do have an investment advisor that on a monthly basis advises us where we can [Music] [Music] um it would be my view that we obviously need to try and get the best return for our investment but you know we need to take into account those other items that aren 't necessarily seen when we make those to see um so it would be my view that if those limits aren 't at their capacity in regards to what money we can put with what bank that those decisions may be come back to council for consideration because it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank is actually putting into the community in kind um to support our communities um you know and if we can get a comparable interest rate with them as compared to one of the other banks that you know then i think we should be my viewers i think should be supporting those that want to help us so it might it might not necessarily be bendigo bank i mean there might be other local banks that that are here as well that that can uh maybe assist us but you know i think it 's something we should look at sort of maximize our our community again through the council ladder the [Music] it is hard to evaluate there 's a number of banks that operate in an area that provides a community group it 's hard to evaluate that we can ensure that we deal with that policy so if we 're doing the direction one thank you um just looking at the growth on page 37 i 'm interested that um we might consider corporate methods making decisions and having the largest investment we have in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's quite a few community groups and councils hanging out for the next round to be announced has been in education through the chair [Music] so there 's another one there there 's two side by side so it 's one million and fifty seven thousand eight hundred million dollars it seems quite an odd figure um but there 's obviously two investments of the same amount on the same day the same maturity day so it 's role model sure you missed the man castle there must have been roll rollovers at this time and they were rolled over including the english table at that stage which probably was a mistake but it 's not hurting us in any way and if i may answer them through the two investments is 10.5 community radio 2 tvr which we 've got sounds of the mountains 12.3 least renewal four recommendations there however the street secondary council across yes [Music] it was really about the only form of communication that people were able to access so and we have an absolutely wonderful person who runs it which is so enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote whatever thing they 're having not at the moment so i like actually it 's just stuff in my brain we do this why i 'm curious i don 't there were some statistics [Music] certainly certainly [Music] [Music] it is today and and you know it 's not only a great community benefit but you know in times of emergency it 's a go-to point for local residents to find out information and um dave eisenhower is one of those community members just go beyond the what 's expected of on him in that situation and provide so much so just a big thank you from from the council and thank you and all the volunteers national favor unanimous thank you update on future directions and council communities so there 's two recommendations there um [Music] there has been an awful lot of discussion about this it 's been workshopped i think every committee has been supported by councils so um there has there have been some hiccups along the way that i 've known about it and i i actually would just really like to thank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 've put through something he 's been acted on straight away to make this as soon as possible so very much appreciated um big move and i hope that a lot of these communities now can apply for massive amounts of funding and they continue to thrive progress through a lot of these changes because they 've been really really challenged by it but i think now that they 've come through the other side they can see how exciting it 's going to be for them that it will give them a much greater voice and feel on being in charge of their their destiny so i look forward to continuing to be involved with them as they try and become an incorporated body thank you just listen um speed for um just um recalling some of the fear and expressions of criticism learning against this council very beginning where we were going to disband the northwest her 355 committees and it was quite a campaign against who we were and i just compliment the staff on how to manage this process and and taken our wonderful volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council and if they do a place where they are comfortable and accept the fact that this is the new horizon and the good space and council has taken a very positive step to retrieve this community wonderful thank you to staffordshire i think it 's worth mentioning that the background is that many of the emotional committees that are now going to be dissolved um we 're not typical three five five and six and three five five commissions uh in as much as they didn 't really exist with the purpose of the section three five five uh determines and they were more community organizations that came under council 's umbrella partly for financial reasons things like insurance status they came under council 's insurance budget um so one of that that turned out to be one of the main issues for a lot of the groups that they were going to have to fund their own insurance am pleased to note that the council now has agreed to actually reimburse their costs as part of the process of tidying up this whole council committee situation and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been able to do that during this term to go back to what section 355 is really all about and to give a great advice and great opportunity for this community through our organization to become self-governing in that sense they are now able to be completely open and free about what they feel and thinking about put their ideas to councils in a more um relaxed kind of way whereas previously they were a committee of council and therefore couldn 't really tell council what to do um now they 're in a position where they 're able to speak freely and i think that 's a great thing [Music] [Music] technically some of them have quite substantial financial assets are they held in our bank account so so when when they append over that meaning that down potential [Music] but most of these communities hold their own house and three five five committees are they supposed to hold their own accounts or they 're supposed to go [Music] [Music] insurance is that one i um [Music] culture you okay christmas and cheering come here discussion there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bit of confusion around this um particular one and it was probably the one in there that caused me the most reef because but there is a lot of background behind the scene stuff going on with this that is probably incompetent so um i 'm confident that um with the information that i that i have and i think the executive of the camp hudson organisation should now have that that should be a prosperous opportunity and committee for them into the future [Music] in into the council or into the community is there any money that is generated from that is it back to cancer no i believe it goes back [Music] and it is quite a complicated thing because we actually have a list of national parks which is coming [Music] so it 's only going to continue until mid-november by the um recommendations of council number four at the end of at least it 's going 30th november and that 's when that 's going to be new v8 falling leaf our counselors uh once again this has been a really uh uh wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to do excellent things it 's at of battles and you know often have difficulties attracting people quite often was left for the same two or three people to do everything as once committees do but they sold it on and you know once again we thank them for the wonderful um and wish them all the best it 's certainly been something that brought people to you i remember seeing people just standing within the phones he believes that the changing colors everywhere so good and as an aside but not right [Music] association and um they do a lot of work and they raise funds themselves through their op shop um they actually were a registered association for incorporation to incorporated and but i will say why um council has been working council stuff and working closely with them they they are still exhibiting quite a lot of fear that they 're going to be stuck with a really um big bill so who you smear can i just check with the cfo that their insurance will be paid and um and also they also have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know do they need 20 million public liability um so i realize that you have to start working on this but just um a confirmation that yes council will be paying for the agent um certainly part of that donation subject we expect that they will buy for their investment or insurance on sale better or not council will then be in position retirement is open but we have made that total amount of donations available big enough to what we think is required and yes i can 't um give any advice on what interests them need i think they will need their own legal advice on that and they 're struggling with that there 's certainly probably blind know that more generally with soccer clubs and netball and all that sort of stuff there 's insurance companies i can see what 's going to happen you know they 're going to charge top dollar for all these individuals through the roof so can i suggest that perhaps we have a coordinated approach with all these groups that we 're [Music] you know exiting so that perhaps we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know we 'll ask um council is obviously involved with statewide and they have a community program and we have given their information to all the records back in november and we are still happy to assist in the process should they request to get in touch supporting them and council staff to assist them uh can i ask the question what level of support they will be offered now that they are becoming independent incorporated [Music] um continue every one of these committees has has different different activities and events from shops to events to uh community markets to maintaining facilities those insurance needs are not a one size fits all has grown in stature from the day that that small group of uh individuals started this concept and it 's grown and grown and grown and it 's going to end up being i think you know a new wild benchmark event in time that people from all over the state of hampton state have come to visit so obviously thank you unanimous thank you association has done this whole process it 's been very very initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would work but i think as we 've moved through uh i can see english very quickly to be independent of but still having a language 10 15 just lives in tumblr historical society thank you to some things online from the powerhouse museum um that now need to be insured once again uh reassurance that this that council will help pay with that insurance and of course being a museum that asset enormous so thank you to everyone particularly for working with me to make this happen once again once again this has been another um very understated um group of individuals who have essentially gone about maintaining that beautiful park since 2001 um and it 's a beautiful council asset that many people have been able to enjoy and have weddings in fact we 've uh continues to be a beautiful place and just wish them every success and thank them for all their efforts uh past and around the precept of the library and other parts um they have a continuing i think as a that 's a volunteer regional health services advisory committee favor sorry yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this and the reason is um because there 's not a counsellor on the back or tumbarama and um as a council i 've always felt that this is all happening and i 'm getting feedback and i know there is a council person on there but they have no idea what 's happening and i would stress for the new council that comes in to write to the other community government to apply for a position [Music] it does it makes perfect sense and certainly from my perspective being able to talk to it is a much more sensible engagement to be able to have those uh because your services themselves are all there and it was obvious that it was becoming very difficult for them to come to another meeting so they saw it as a duplication center i strongly urge you to get in touch helsings was saying for example um suggested to be introduced in council face-to-face context we 've got an emergency in the area that 's not advised a few days later and then the last there 's a few things like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing things yes [Music] is [Music] activities i think we should um from chair thank all these organizations and all the volunteers will be so so reliable to keep their community touching and beautiful and i think so thanks to all the people involved in all these communities and all the other communities that you don 't have input into working so hard particularly these people who serve [Music] against that the trying to change their adaptation so um mr hoffman [Music] [Music] workshop uh it was agreed that the council itself would form that committee [Music] and certainly certainly we 've been promoting your cause and their cause and uh that 's you know one of the things that we discussed when you were present with um david shoebridge uh and we 've further prosecuted the case of the council 's uh green credentials um with minister king the other day i think we 're on a bit of a role in that winner hey so we 've got um quite a lot we 've got ten uh recommendations there we have uh pride in many representations [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person um [Music] and um it 's certainly a project i 100 endorsed it 's fabulous and having seen the plans can 't wait for it to happen so personally i 'd love to give all the support it um so so you 're asking the direct executive director some questions and the first one well let 's just do these questions the first question is what do you think um i suppose um you know we 've been having a lot of discussions about sustainability and affordability so for us as an officer of cancer to work towards making sure the benefit of the potential that could come out about this but also in consideration and to make sure that people perform and not become a cost burden in the longer term thank you do you have another question um yeah i think i was a bit concerned about and like if someone could explain to me why we have to give a letter of support for the project but then also priority and rank it against a grant that we 're also putting in which of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion for the lines from this um the project okay okay yeah i i personally don 't think the state government organizing the the grant should be asking us to do any ranking business of conflict we 're putting in another round the same did you have another question thank you any other term questions i think it 's worth noting that the german pools have got a secure government fund federal government funding apart from their development is relatively minor and it is quite necessary to secure their project actually being able to get off the ground for is the director of infrastructure is that the inclined contribution or is it actually your financial contribution yes yes from my understanding the intention is that with respect to those parts of the project but from my understanding i seek advice from regard to this even though we 're to support the project it still needs to be accounted for as a as a donation yes mayor that 's great thank you i just really uh uh recommend this project uh it 's just i know if you don 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another facility for canada this is uh this is a great opportunity by a club who 's got off their backsides and put together a a program and an infrastructure program to suit the future of community needs locally and on a regional basis i mean i had the pleasure of representing the mayor uh at the indigenous round uh at the oval uh uh only last week and uh you know what shane harrington and the club did down there and um you know bringing you know the contact people with matt chapman and coach on board and you know what what they can do for for women um you know by having this inclusive uh facility with you know state-of-the-art change rooms um you know look at the uh the the the excellent uh um footballers we produce locally here you know we 've got uh michelle perry piper duck and shaney williams i mean three in the face of a few years um that have played for australia i mean they 've come from snowy valleys council regions just magnificent so you know this is a breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support it and the schools will get great use out of this facility and so will the community and the region you know it will allow us to hook in with people like brumby 's and suru and all [Music] me people in the get anything we have a look at this they 're getting young and creepy that is really cool so yep oh sorry every job would be wrong for christmas when you look at it yeah i don 't see how they can complain about not us not doing anything give him a template and i 'll complain about anything don 't worry let 's move on um so do i have a can i have a move in a second across the hand less let 's put the motion [Music] services strategic plan is anyone moving there i 've got my speech she likes to get the work done how tremendous that this is here and to look through the next five years where it 's going you know we have a children 's services that are viable that are looked upon from outside as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that we will actually expand our services to um to meet the needs of the more um isolated and vulnerable people in our community i mean congratulations fantastic thank you to all the hard work that went into my life and um it was delighted and there was one comment saying that this is only about castle it is about council services but kate and i are very active in the snowy valley 's children 's services committee and um i think we should develop for the region and i 'd really endorse what you 're saying but also complement the staff and things together because having worked in the early childhood industry i know how many levels and layers of regulations and hoops that you have to go through to put this together and it really to be such a concise beautifully presented very clear very easy to read document just just incredible really great thank you any speakers again for the motion favor carrick thank you unanimously um spoke to the minister of the audit risk and improvement committee may 2021 that 's the cost yes yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community she has significant very extensive experience in this and in financial management and in local government teaching is going to be a real asset and uh you 'll get a lot of track about our financial and our way we do things but eric is an external body that oversees everything we do to all the functions of council and it 's such a reassurance and i think you know people out in the community can feel very assured that we are on track and we 're doing a really good job shortly together but uh having eric there is a he 's very very very sure [Music] thank you local traffic committee and a few items there that 's the smith against the head really good recommendations have been made knowing that area well i 've seen that streets that can be quite dangerous um i 'm very pleased to see that they 're really on the [Music] or whatever we should see some um and that 's actually run by the ultra marathon um committee that normally runs through human model track but because of guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapting and for heroes to council for having a great rail trail facility of 21 kilometers that we can run a marathon there and back again it 's great interested thank you and only reading the minutes i was saddened to see that neil christie and annelise slieber are both resigning at the next agent and both of those lead out outstanding committee members there so i hope [Music] association [Music] recreation um [Music] the council may close to the public that part of the meeting is working in confidential nature section 10.2 this such matters the grounds in which meeting is placed must be specified in the decision place meeting recorded in the minutes of the meeting recommendation i have before us is the council movement of competition the confidential section of the agenda in accordance with section 2 of the local government 1993 the region 's festival mr really known urgent nation no i 'm not at the moment selling point one is the software working group growing locally according to funding support do i have a against the handful and fighter"

    "text": "this video has been produced to support community engagement about the rate options study for snowy valleys council it 's part of a series of videos as shown on your screen i 'd encourage you to start with the introduction video as this provides the background and context for what i 'll go through specifically in relation to residential land for this video as a starting point we 'll have a look at the current rating structure that 's in place for residential land in each of the former councils so firstly in turmeric you can see here the relationship between rates and land values so as land value goes up the rates go up and that 's what 's known as the ad valorem rate or rate in the dollar but in each of the categories in turmeric there is a 540 minimum rate so you can see that below a certain threshold here with residential it 's about fifty three thousand dollars everyone pays five hundred and forty dollars regardless of the value of their land before the tumber ambershower council used the other option available under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that everyone pays 232 dollars as a base rate and then the ad valorem is applied on top of it when we compare the two the system in tumbarumba is arguably fairer in tune everyone below that fifty three thousand dollar threshold plays the 540 dollar minimum rate regardless of the value of their land in tumbarumba everyone 's paying that 232 dollar base rate so everyone 's making a contribution to the cost of the services the benefits that they enjoy but rates are also going up with land value so there 's that ability to pay principal coming in and that 's probably the the key issue in this whole discussion is how much influence land value should have on the rates people pay when you look at the available tax information on incomes in different towns you can see that there is a difference between the typical incomes in each town but when we put this information alongside land values you can see that there 's not a strong correlation land values in tumor are significantly higher than in bat low but there 's not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the options for the residential category and to do this i 'll be using a couple of charts that do take some getting head around but as they say a picture tells a thousand words and to really understand these options um and their impacts on different land values you really do need to to see it in those terms so the chart i 've added at the bottom there shows the distribution of property values in the form of tumbershire and you can see that generally they 're at the bottom end of that scale when i add the distribution from former tumor chair you can see is there 's a lot more properties above that 60 000 mark so here 's option a for residential which is shown by the grain line and the chart above this starts at the same point as the current rating system in tumbarumba and that 's because the base rate is pretty much the same as what it is there now the blue line that i 've added at the bottom there shows the impact on ratepayers in chairman under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values that are currently paying the 540 minimum you can see that they 'll receive quite a considerable saving of up to 30 or 40 for that large number of properties in the mid range the 60 to 70 000 value range you can see that the green line 's slightly higher than the blue so those people would pay about 15 more than they are then at the top end of the values in turmeric you can see the green lines a little bit lower than the blue so those people would see a small saving the red line that i 've added at the bottom there shows impacts of this option on ratepayers in the form of tumblrshire and you can see that right across the red line is higher than the yellow line which indicates that the rates would increase and that simply reflects that when you bring together the rates of the former councils turmeric 's rates were higher so when you put them together their tumbarumba rates increase the thing to notice about this is that the increases for the majority of properties down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten percent mark but at the higher end of the properties in tumbarumba the the increases are significant uh around 25 percent there 's less properties in that end of the scale but the increases are very significant and this is where we 're going to come back to the question of what is the fairest rating system under this option someone with a property worth forty thousand dollars would pay about five hundred and thirty dollars a year in rates well someone with a property worth eighty thousand dollars would pay eight hundred and forty dollars a year in rates sixty percent more and you 've got to ask whether that 's fair given that there is not a strong correlation between the value of land and people 's ability to pay which is why option b is worth considering the base rate here is higher 344 dollars a year so that means everyone is paying closer to the same amount council would be generating 50 percent of its revenues from residential rates from the base rate in this case and that 's why the purple line is parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base rate is actually generating 50 of the rates you can see though that the impacts of this option on ratepayers with land of different values is quite different from option a though in tumbarumba the impact in dollar terms at the higher and lower end of values is about the same it 's the difference in in the base rate but the increase in percentage terms is a lot higher at the at the lower end than at the top end so in terms of the impacts on tumor rate pace you can see those at the at the lower end currently on the minimum don 't see as big as saving because of the higher base rate those in the middle do see a slight slightly greater increase than under the option a but those at the higher end see a larger saving again because of the higher base rate so looking again at the rates people would pay on properties a different value whereas in option a the uh eighty thousand dollar block would attract sixty percent higher rates than the forty thousand dollar block uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down to about forty percent so in terms of fairness if we 're not sure that the person with the 80 000 block um is far far better positioned to pay higher rates then it probably makes sense to reduce the gap between the amounts each of them pay so moving on to option c for residential this one has a lower base rate and that has the effect of reducing rates for lower value properties and increasing them for higher value property and when we look at the impact of this option on ratepayers with different land values you can see particularly with that red line in tumbarumba that the higher value properties are paying considerably more up to about 30 while the lower value properties are seeing a few savings down that bottom end so if we consider again the rates paid on a property valued at 80 000 versus 40 000 the gap between those two was now widened out to 67 percent so when we look at these options side by side you can start to see a bit better what 's going on option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tumbarumba and that 's why it was recommended in the study option b flattens out the rating structure so it tends to increase the rates for lower value properties and decrease it for higher value properties but if we 're not sure that the people with high value land um are actually able to pay heaps more then that 's probably fairer and option c really does push up the rates paid on higher valued land which is arguably less fair particularly for residential um properties given that the benefits that landowners receive the the value of the services that they enjoy is pretty consistent from one block to another regardless of the value of that land so thanks for taking the time to watch this video and understand a little bit more about the options for rating of residential land in snowy valleys council and again i 'd encourage you to complete the survey available at the link shown on your screen"

exhibition period closes on the 7th of may so we just wanted to give you a brief run through on our integrated planning and reporting documents and essentially it starts with our community strategic plan which was done four years ago and then council develops a delivery program which is the term of council what they 're going to do over that period each year then we adopt a operational plan and a budget that 's associated with that operational plan and that 's the patch that we 're out consulting on at the moment so we are talking about the 2122 operational plan and the budget there 's a whole lot of other strategic documents that are associated during the integrated planning and reporting processes and they sit on the side and feed into this process the integrated planning and reporting guidelines for new south wales have a very specific outline that it 's about planning for a sustainable future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term financial plan forecasts what we 're going to do over that 10-year period and checks in to see whether our operations are sustainable just a bit of a wrap-up on a snapshot on this year 's budget it 's a 73 million dollar total budget there 's 35.4 million dollars worth of capital works which includes 13.6 million in our transport network 10.5 in economic development 2.8 million investment into our food organics and garden organics 2.6 million investment into renewals and upgrades for water service network 1.8 million investment into renewals in upgrade of our water waste water network this year there is a 2 rate cap set by ipart and that 's made up of 1.8 percent for the normal general cap plus 0.2 of a percent for our council election costs we 're also entering into our harmonized rating system our new rating system that brings the two former shires together under one rating structure and that commences from 1 july 2021 our operating income for this year is 65.8 million and our operating expenditure is 48.4 million our operating deficit is 1.7 million before capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants there are a number of cost pressures on local government and snowy valleys is affected by those as well our rate cap has been well below the relevant price index for years particularly the public sector wage index and wage increases required by the local government award we 've also lost our special rate variation from 1 july 2020 and that contributed 650 000 to the from the turmeric area into our rates a whole lot of other cost pressures like at the emergency services levy uh has grown 65 percent over the last four years and just in the last year there was a 28 increase in that in that levy and that represents eight percent of our revenue we 've had an increased number of upgraded levels of council assets and increased maintenance and renewal costs reduced operational funding from the financial assistance grants and limited rationalization opportunities from the merger process our service level harmonisation has generally meant that our services have gone to the highest level and there 's an increased cost associated with that i 'd like to introduce now our chief financial officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our current funding model this is the model of next year 's budget you can say we receive in rates and annual charges 28 of our revenue on the other hand 45 percent of our revenue is made up by capital and operating grants which come from federal and state and some other agencies this is in contrast to what is happening across australia on average australian local governments receive 38 of their revenue in rates and annual charges and only 14 in grants so we have a quite different funding model compared to your average local government the snowy valley 's long-term financial plan is currently on exhibition and this is what we would like your feedback on we have three scenarios of the long-term financial plan on exhibition one is a continuation of the existing budget the second one is the one that you see here in this graph it 's what we call the srv scenario it proposes a 25 special rate variation from year two and the third one is an optimistic scenario and as i said we would like feedback on these scenarios and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we put up multiple scenarios to give the community an idea of how the long-term financial sustainability of council looks like the cash position forecast is quite an important one while we um proposing to have deficits under the baseline scenario for the next 10 years we are also having a problem with our cash you can see the red line going down downwards and the red line is actually our baseline scenario so if council doesn 't do anything on the expenditure side or the revenue side this is what 's going to happen to our cash holdings and the depletion of cash holdings to a level that is completely unsustainable and actually below the requirements of our funding agreements the purple line on the other hand shows you the cash position forecast that we would achieve did we get the srv and the expenditures savings that we 're proposing we do have an obligation as an organization to achieve internal savings as well and part of the documents out for consultation includes the sustainability plan and the sustainability plan talks through the various options that we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiencies and i commend that you also have a look at that document the integrated planning documents include a proposal to consult on a special rate variation to be very clear that is not to include a special rate variation in the in the next budget it will include an option to go out and engage with the community and consult about the community 's opinion and sentiment around a special rate variation we anticipate that that will happen in the next month and heading into later this year we will then present that information that the community has given us through to the new council and the new council will make a decision on whether it wishes to lodge to ipad to have a special rate variation the proposal is for a special rate variation over a two year period totaling about 25 the community engagement process for that includes uh the 23rd of april is now the seventh the community engagement process uh includes uh submissions being lodged by the 7th of may friday the 7th of may into council by close of business the community strategic plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ july and on the 17th of june council will adopt the current integrated planning and reporting documents which includes the operational plan and budget on the 4th of september we have council elections and in november december and january will be starting to consult on our community strategic plan and the special rate variation application january february moving into the delivery plan and our integrated planning and reporting documents for 2022 all of our documents are available on our website and there 's various links there i commend you to go in and have a look at those documents if you have any questions please come and ask us it is very complex we 've tried to simplify it down today and essentially very important to note that council is adopting the operational plan and budget for the 21 year we are not including in that a special rate variation it does include our rates harmonisation but the special rate variation will just be an engagement process in that financial year thank you very much"
