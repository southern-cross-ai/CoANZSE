I welcome Tom Jamison to provide us with a presentation thank you Tom three mr. mayor morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation on the purpose to provide an overview and an update on the Sunshine Coast Council 's response to the curve at nineteen pandemic as you 're aware the local disaster management group the L dmg is coordinated by counsels disaster management team and the local Disaster Management Group has three key objectives and that is firstly to have a key role in responding to disasters or emergency situations to manage key assets and to provide essential community services the L dmg which is chaired by the mayor would move to stand up activation level on the 23rd of March 2020 in support of the lead agency Queensland Health in response to the kovat 19 pandemic and today the financial implications of the covert 19 pandemic to council through to the 30th of June 2020 as being approximately eight million dollars the L dmg is made up of multiple agencies and organisations and is as per the disaster management act 2003 the LG mg responds as a set to request coming through from Queensland Health but also from the district disaster coordinator and we have four key roles as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the local authority in charge with maintaining the disaster management plans we also act as the service provider and supplier of essential services with expectations that we continued provision of such services and that we those will be guaranteed we also have a role a key role as being a guardian to the community and filling our social obligations and finally we have a responsibility as a responsible employer to ensure ensure the well-being of all our staff and contractors working on our projects on the 16th of March in response to the activation of L dmg and from Queensland Health we determined and introduced this structure with Council the executive leadership team and the local disaster management team on the right-hand side being supported supported by two key groups firstly the covert nineteen control group chaired by the mayor and the deputy mayor which contains the executive officers and also key officers meeting three times a week and that group being supported by the covert nineteen working group which in in times has been working full-time and as contains key officers throughout Council and with other agencies ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to the control group since the 16th of March the control group has taken many actions these include the number of closed of our community facilities playground shelters barbecues in our parks areas exercise equipment but also locations like the Sunshine Coast Stadium Marucci multi sports Mary King Cross etcetera as well as all libraries contact centers and receptions in addition we have closed revenue producing assets holiday parks venue one one four pools and and paid parking in Bettina and Calandra we have also introduced services particularly soap dispensers throughout our amenity blocks additional cleaning as well as education patrols we 've tried to where possible transfer services and programs online to ensure that our community still can access particularly our library services and environmental programs as well as looking at new online music well-being and festivals and through our economic development team they have developed three tranches so far of particularly economic development stimulus programs to have been enacted tranche 1 and tranche 2 and of particular note is that bringing forward of capital works and ensuring that we try as much as possible to bring forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at some key actions business continuity and business resilience plans a lot of work has been done to identify key essential services within council and the implementation of social distancing and in particular this has been with our field crews who are undertaking the the park 's work construction work etc in additionally we 've been looking at how we support employees to work remotely crucially fast payments supplier invoices has been introduced and as I mentioned bringing forward of capital works and maintenance programs we 've undertaken extensive external communication and consultation with the unions finally we 've through our covert kindness campaign we 've recent numbers in terms of reach that that campaign has has achieved and while we 're going through these at this stage in terms of support to the community through the pandemic were also established a strategy team to start looking at the medium to long term for the recovery this week you will have heard the premier and the mayor both announced that changes to the relaxation changes to the how we can how the community can start to move about some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and so from midnight Friday the following areas will have been reopened the previously all closed car parks particularly those the beachside car parks council boat ramps and council shelters have been opened but we 're keen to stress that the barbecues exercise equipment playground skate parks at this stage are not being reopened and the the strong messaging that 's been put out is very much for the community to respect the new relaxation that has been put in but to please to comply and particularly over this long weekend to ensure that those social distancing measures are maintained so in conclusion the officer recommendation is that council receive and note the report titled covert 19 response and should it be the recommendation be accepted that the chief executive officer is able to continue and progressively implement recommendations from the strategy work stream as well as to assist with the planning of the recovery phase to consider and implement economic tranches and finally to progress identified internal work force adjustments thank you Thank You mr. mayor and thank you mr. Jameson and I want to thank the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's an incredibly important part of our our organization how we connect with all parts of services that come together during disasters during the crisis within our community and that we can actually work very quickly with other levels of government our community and and be able to deal with the pandemic one take this opportunity obviously to thank that group for the work that it 's done even leading into this pandemic it did tremendous work last year with the fires and the whole range of other issues that we 've had and it 's probably hasn 't had much of a rest in that period of time so I want to thank every member of that group for the work that it 's done the mayor for the way that you 've led that group congratulations I think our community has been well served the focus obviously with this pandemic has been on the safety and well-being of our community I think we 've been able to see that our community has responded well and been able to take directions from all different levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play its role in being able to manage the the safety and well-being within our community in all of that we have to also be mindful of the impacts on our community on individuals families in particular with their financial situations relationships that we have that are under stress the mental health issues that come out of this especially when we understand the challenges that we all have in terms of the uncertainty of employment uncertainty how we can cope with the pressures of everyday life and we are and had been as a community incredibly you know it impacted because of the fact that we are so much committed to our lives being able to move ahead our children and with all of that the pressures of in most cases every member of the family having to work to be able to get ahead in life and of course when we have a situation like this and that changes dramatically then impact on our individuals and our families is quite significant and also our business community I don 't think it I 've ever seen having been in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the business community that we 've ever been challenged as much as this the fallout might be that there 'll be significant businesses that won 't be able to reopen and I think we 'll will see a different landscape when we emerge out of this crisis and as I said I believe the community has played its part in working towards trying to solve the current problems that we 've got at the moment so I want to thank them I want to thank the front line work is because they 've made an amazing contribution putting themselves right at their front front line I 'm incredibly encouraged by the counselors the new counselors and the work and the commitment towards becoming a much more compassionate and caring council and I think I 'm encouraged by their comments that they 've made mr. mayor that they want this council to be able to engage with our community in a different way and especially under the covert 19 pandemic that we actually emerge as being a council that does show more compassion and it 's much more caring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of us dealing with the pandemic as it is at the moment as we live out of these restrictions and eventually back to some sort of normality there are hopes and aspirations that I have and I hope that everybody in our community has and and I hope that we have a much more connected community than we had in the past we had this time to reflect and understand that we 've given this opportunity to sit back now even though it 's a disaster but it is also an opportunity for us as the community to be able to understand that we can possibly take a different direction as we merge out of this that we can be a much more caring community and that will be a community which will support our local businesses nothing like we 've done before we go out of our normal habits that make sure that we actually support local businesses that we make a difference and know that every bit of support that we give these businesses will give them that opportunity to get back on their feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can take any positives from this disaster mr. mayor we as individuals and as a community as a whole need to reach out to our neighbors and to those less fortunate to those that are struggling with the this current pandemic crisis they 're struggling to cope and that we can emerge out of this as a much better community in the end thank you mister man Thank You mr. mayor well said Joe it 's like you 're still in campaign mode I just wanted to firstly thank mr. Sturges who was at the back over there for sending through some of that information in relation to the bringing forward of the three million dollars in capital works when I read your email last night it was great to see that we 're actually taking advantage of the closures which have been forced upon us through this pandemic with our kwatak centers our libraries our community centers and our indoor sports stadiums so there they were schedule works that were looking at being done in the next financial year but obviously it 's it 's quite astute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities for less disruptions when restrictions are eased so thank you very much for sending that through councils last night I just want to echo what Joe said actually about thanking the response working group which is the mayor and mr. Jamison both contribute heavily to obviously thank each and every one of the members that have been guiding through our community through this dark time and so it was well said that well mentioned from councilor Natali D so I just wanted to echo those sentiments but at the end of the day I think our response as a council of a public sort of entity is one that the community should be proud of certainly this is being forced upon us through the the uncertain times and I really think that how we 've stepped up to the plate on behalf of our community is highly commendable so thank you Thank You councillor Cox that 's what I pray Thank You mr. mayor through you firstly thanks again to meeting management for setting this up today I believe it 's our first ever ordinary meaning livestreams to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people out there actually watching today and see how it goes so congratulations to you guys congratulations to Tom then your team and all the leadership and to yourself as well mr. Muir in regard to the local Disaster Management Group very responsive very efficient and very decisive if it 's extraordinary how much you can do very quickly in a very short amount of time mr. Muir something that was a little bit was only touched on in the report was what 's called covert kindness now if you haven 't had a good look at this council as I strongly suggest you get on and have a good look at it covert kindness was set up by our media team bindi wore on the her team set it up and they 've put it and they put it out to other councils around Australia and it 's gone nuts I think from this morning there was something like 200 million hits so it 's actually gone global this code would kindness from little tiny sunshine coast is now going across councilors right across Australia and the world so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what cupboard cornice is and what it 's doing we 've been tested to the max not only the Sunshine Coast the state Australia but the whole globe has been tested to the max and we 're talking testing our most important people on the planet which is our health care and our businesses our elderly our families alike they 've been tested and tested time again and they 've responded incredibly well the requests that have come through to this council have been extraordinary and they 've been very very very well received they 've been done pretty much overnight and I give you a great example of one Surf Life Saving Australia and the Life Guards service were put into a testing environment like they all have like all departments have been and there was some failings there was an observation of the community and myself particularly but it was rectified and fixed overnight and then the public had to get on board and the mayor and his team put a media release out only a matter of days later and the the risk at our beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor for that as well for getting that out that message out there very quickly and the other one that really impressed me was the soap dispensers I don 't know how many public amenities that we 've got across the coast tom but that soap dispensers are now in every single public amenity on the Sunshine Coast know that without Koh but that would have been a pretty big job I reckon that would have taken us a few months to get through council get through and get through the funding get through the budgeting and then you actually get into the into the amenities but we 've pretty much done that within a week so well done and congratulations on such a small item but the most probably one of the most critical important mr. mayor I commend this report I think it 's very timely it 's very efficient and I hope I really do hope that over the next weekend coming that the people do behave and they do get everything right and we can get out of this in the next couple of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can count so Dickson thank you and good morning mr. mayor I just wanted to take the opportunity to recognize the staff and also yourself and your leadership through what I would call probably some of the most difficult times we 've ever been through as a community reading through the report I wanted to touch on a few things that really stood out to me and this is where councillor Tolly was talking about the compassion and responding to the community and I noted during the election period and leading into the the new council one of the first things the group did was turn off the the parking meters in the Sunshine Coast they turned them off immediately to respond to people you know to to assist them in the community and I note that our health services and hospitals that have paid parking you know didn 't have that initial response so council was the first local government authority first political authority first government authority to actually do something about that as councillor jason touched on soap dispensers it might sound like a small thing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said council if you 're serious about this get out there put those hand dispensers in the the bathrooms and washrooms and we spent over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars on in hygiene improvements throughout the Sunshine Coast region to do that and we did it very very quickly I know officers in the field our service levels have not gone downhill at all I 'm putting service requests due to stuff every single day and our staff are out there working just as hard as ever to look after our community and I 've got a recent example in my division where we 're responding to some issues around flying foxes and you know it 's very hands-on and very troubling with the community to be working in that space right now yet our staff are out there working at nighttime they 're out there at midnight doing work you know our staff are working so hard and I 'm so proud of them another thing is staff working from home we talked about those in the field those working from home we 've compressed years worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a matter of weeks this organization is now allowing staff to work from home so if you go into the neighbor office or Calandra here today you 'll notice that the car parks are very quiet the buildings are very very quiet it 's unique because our staff are actually for the most part working from home and they are working well mr. mee they 're actually doing their job because they love their job they enjoy coming to work and representing our region just like we do so I 'm very very impressed with that and lastly mr. mayor it 's your visibility I just want to recognize that as far as messaging to the community you 've been consistent you 've been relevant you 've turned out without fear or favor and you 've been very very visible to members of my division and they 've commented that you 've been a central point for information and that councils media team has done a fantastic job in providing the community with all of the information I think councillors should also note that this is just the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get to the next one because that 's where the rubber hits the road in our March financial report we actually talked about those tangible items that we 've delivered right across the community to help the Sunshine Coast I commend today 's report and to mr. Jamison your team are doing a fantastic job looking counselors I 'd like to just reiterate and reinforce all the compliments that have been provided to our team remembering that there are two distinct groups the council control group who as Thomas said has been meeting three days a week first thing in the morning public holidays whatever was necessary to ensure that you know we had a finger on the pulse in terms of what was going on in our community and the local disaster management group which again as someone may have commented on earlier has been called on more often than most over the last several months initially with fires and then we 've had issues with flooding and of course now the the pandemic but I always feel great confidence when our local disaster management group gets together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hat effectively to protect their community and the various members that make up that group or a vast number of agencies right across the spectrum to protect the community the Sunshine Coast and certainly always gives me great confidence that we have you know wonderfully skilled people who really gel and work closely together for the protection of our greater community as dangerous as it is I wanted to single out one group that I think has been particularly pressured and and and and delivered beautifully and that is the Queensland Police Service as I think about all the things and all the tough decisions we 've had to make invariably the police Queensland Police have been at the heart of that and I know it 's been very challenging for them but indeed talking with superintendent just in Overland yesterday you know he shares some of my concerns about the potential for a free-for-all this weekend as people think you know it 's all over and we can get back to normal we 've still got a long way to go and again I ought to encourage our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good work that 's being done by so many people when the sacrifice has been made by so many to you know get a false dawn there 'd be nothing worse so in in wrapping up we 're now gearing up for the recovery and that is going to be as councillor Natali has indicated going to be a challenging period for a lot of people a lot of businesses particularly in the services sector where you know we 're well endowed with a significant number of businesses in that area councillors well-positioned to do what we can to assist and there are a number of procedures in place at the moment so again on behalf of council I want to thank our staff particularly the control group team people like Paul Martin 's and Nicole Bunning in particular of being at the heart of the information gathering and the sharing of that information but certainly all of our members our chief executive obviously Tom Kathy buck also plays a key role but I want to thank everybody for the really genuine contribution they 've made and when you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really rely on those they look to for leadership guidance and support through those disasters so well done everybody okay if there are no further speakers we 'll put the motion to the vote all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you very much move on to item 8.2 which is the March 20 24 mitts report councillor I pray yes man councillors for the meeting to be held on 32 for 30th of the fourth nineteen twenty twenty twenty you 'll get them right sorry 20 20 I 'd like to propose to inform the council that I have a conflict of interest as grant Belcher donated two thousand dollars to my 2012 election campaign and there is a reference to the Coventry Aquatic Center in this item eight point two he is the current lease holder of a number pools across the Sunshine Coast in relation to the personal interest is set out above in accordance with s17 5e I intend to leave the meeting chamber and any any area set aside to the public for the duration of the discussion debate and vote on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the report Thank You Isaac my name is Isaac Vickers Gill and I 'm here today to present the financial performance report for March 2020 as this is the first report for following the recent election I 'll go through the legislative requirements in terms of financial performance reporting our council is required under section 204 of the local government regulation 2012 to produce a financial report every month this report covers a range of financial performance measures including variances to the adopted budget capital works performance cash balance performance as well as investments performance so this financial performance report is slightly different in that it contains the financial impacts of Cobre 19 up until the end of June 19 2020 this amount is investor estimated to be eight million dollars and includes a range of impacts over all areas of Council the full details of these impacts are listed in attachment 2 of the report in summary though council has offered over two million dollars of support to local businesses and community groups through the business support initiatives these initiatives include waiver of fees and charges way over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste cleansing charges the shutdown of parking meters to cloud or CBD and Virginia as well as relaxation of parking regulations throughout the region the business support initiatives has benefit over 3,000 businesses and community groups both directly and more than 10,000 indirectly through business advice support assistance and referrals additional to the business support initiatives Council has supported local business and suppliers by processing payments within seven days instead of the regular 30 days which is placing on average 1.8 million dollars into the local economy earlier our further impact stick over 19 can be attributed to the closure of council facilities which has an impact of 1.1 million dollars the full or park closure of councils holiday parks will have a 2.9 million dollar impact to the 30th of June and further reduction of interest rates is estimated to be 1.5 million dollars as was presented before close to 3 million dollars a capital works has been brought forward on closed council facilities a budget review report we resented a council in the coming months to adjust the budget for 2019 20 so as of March 2020 counselors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget by 730 1,000 down favorable variance consists of revenue below budget at 1.7 million dollars as well as expenses below budget of a million dollars our very assistive variances to the budget for revenue include the continual decline of interest revenue which is attributed to falling interest rates councils received additional revenue from recruitment of works completed for the state government the operating grants is ahead of budget due to the million dollars received for the bushfire payments from the federal government and the container refund scheme continues to provide additional unbudgeted revenue for 2019-20 the variances to budget for councils operating expenses are attributed to grow mainly to rituals and services now the variance is partially attributed to below average expenditure on road maintenance up until 31st of March several projects relating to the heritage slavery will also be deferred into next financial year and finance costs are also training below budget due to the low interest rates council 's capital works program is 69 percent complete the budget with the core program totaling 68 percent council is still on track to achieve over 90 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being either finalized constructive or equivalent stages and is recommended that council receive a note in the March 2020 financial performance report [Music] [Music] they were stated before with the financial implications October 19 to counsel the main impacts 2.1 million through business support initiatives that I 'll cover in a moment 1.1 million due to the closure of council facilities 2.9 million due to the closure of holiday parks which are a major revenue earner for council 1.5 million in reduced interest perceived from investments with the lowering of interest rates and 400,000 reduction in royalties received from the Sunshine Coast Airport now council has been able to quickly and rapidly support our businesses in the community by providing over 2 million dollars in direct financial support to the business support package and may I add this is only because of our strong financial position because their previous management of their finances and with the top three in Queensland for the strong rating in financial management that 's given us an ability to react this support has benefited benefited over 3,000 businesses and community groups directly more than 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these packages include the waving of food licensing fees from the first term us to the 31st of August 2020 that has benefit more than 2300 of our businesses provision of a rental waiver between the 1st and March and 30th of June on commercial and community leases benefit benefiting 200 and one of their businesses delivery of emergency community grants valued at 2,000 for eligible non-for-profits supporting our community counselor supported local businesses and suppliers by processing payments within seven days instead of 30 days which is placing an average of 1.8 million earlier into the economy each week up to 3 million in capital works projects will be brought forward to support local jobs and keep money circulating in our economy now of course this comes at a cost the operating result as of the 31st of March 2020 says none favorable variance of 731 thousand compared to the budget position not all of that is covered 19 what I find pleasing is we 've been able to manage to continue our core capital works program there 's progressed a 68.1% of budget an actual spend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our capital works program one of the biggest impacts we have is interest received from investments interest rates available for term deposits continue to decline with the Reserve Bank of Australia reducing the cash rate by further point five basis points in March this has resulted in the decline and interest received from investments councils year in forecast for investment revenue will be approximately four million dollars below the current budget what is pleasing is councils expenses remain within 1% of budget as the 31st of March while delivering on the 2019 2020 operational plan mr. Muir this is only the beginning we do not know how far 20 over 2019 will go we start our budget deliberations next week and I think this is a very important backdrop for us to start from and because we love we are facing considerable headwinds going into this next year and formulating this next budget oh I feel confident we 've only had two weeks together as a group a team and I believe our community should be confident also that this team will be able to deliver through this time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy it 's going to be hard work but I believe we can do it and the cause we 're in a strong financial position will well-placed to do that but it will take focus teamwork and working with them into continuing to support our community through this hopefully the cove at 19 will start coming out of it towards the end of the year but we cannot be sure how long this is going to go for what the truly impacts and costs are going to be but I look forward to working with each and every one of you to deliver for our community I put this forward to us receiving note as an important starting point in our budget deliberations next week thank you thank you yes anger food let me congratulate all counselors thus far on sticking to the time limit great start councillor Dixon thank you and through you mr. met interesting report and it 's a good follow on from The Cove at 19 update because this is really where the rubber hits the road now we talk about being compassionate just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and wave 260 thousand dollars on food licensing fees that 's over 2,300 businesses which will see that impacts right away rates arrears over 300,000 wiped off as well so I council aren 't chasing you for your rates I think we 're doing the best we can to identify that residents are doing it tough and we 're trying to weather that storm just like they are every single day of the week a few more things that we can do and I 'd like to raise in the future budget more particularly around calls from the commercial sector in our region I 've had many calls from people who owned commercial properties wanting us to put a pause on their rates they 're saying our businesses have been shut down by federal and state legislation why should we be paying rates we 're not operating and I think the kicker for them is that the more did they get in on the day that they can open they 're going to have so many liabilities to deal with in council rates for them it 's just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people of sometimes in some of the businesses mr. mayor had to terminate the employment contracts of their employees people don 't have jobs and they want to get those people back to work as soon as they can so anything we can do to help them is great for business I noted the capital works program as of March the end of March it 's nearly 70% complete and we 're hoping to be 90 percent complete before the end of the financial year now whilst we talk about capital works projects that 's money back in the communities every job that Council and the community as ratepayers invest in and spend that 's going back to local business and as I said in the previous report our staff are out there spending money now on local improvements and to see that we 're up to at least 70% at this time is very impressive considering many of our staff are working from home it shows that many are out there braving this situation and this pandemic to do their job and for that I appreciate it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking infringement so this tells us that maybe we need to have a review on how we are issuing these infringement swear they are being in issued in our community to be 400,000 down right now because we 're issuing warnings shows that I think we need to potentially look at the culture that goes aside with the parking infringement and I 've made this very clear through my election campaign that people are looking for more of a compassionate attitude to do with our local laws and I will talk about that in future reports this morning around portfolios but in this some this point in time I 'd like to say to residents out there that my focus as a councillor will be on how I can help you and your family through this time it may mean that we may need to put capital projects on the back burner for some time but what is important right now is rebuilding the region taking care of residents and hoping that we can kick-start and rebuild those businesses that are doing it tough have closed the strong commitment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbling but more so relevant today mr. Mehra 's the acknowledgement from all the counselors that I 've worked with in the last two weeks I 'm telling me how important it is to get back to basics and support those local families so I 'm I am confident mr. men that this council 's doing the best we can and this is not just going to be a six or 12 month exercise this will affect us for the rest of our term no further speakers counselor Natali just a question through you mr. man to our offices in regards to the current situation we know that we 're taking a hit financially and there 's an organization obviously we take long term views in terms of how we put our budgets together and long term financial forecasting but to me as much as the crisis is there and we had to deal as councillor Dixon said with the issues that we have to deal with that community immediately what are some of the measures that we need to take as an organization to tighten our bill at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need to start to think about the aspects of the community of our organizations obviously this capital works there is debt there 's operational expenses and you know if I could get some indication of where your thinking is coming in terms of where we need as counselors as we formulate our budget and it makes few months where we need to start to think about the impact of cupboard 19 and and possibly that could be quite quite large but at the same time as an organization how are we going to be able to manage that in making sure that financially we can still have a grip over our finances so that we don 't put ourselves at risk mr. Castelo through you mr. mayor I counsel it through the development of the budget for next year any there 'll be some impact obviously on our revenues and we 've talked about the impact so far our strategy is that any of those impacts on the revenue and a reduction needs to have a corresponding adjustment to our operating expenses such that the impact in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced with regards to our capital program we 've talked about the that bring forward of three million dollars of capital projects into this financial year again with the development of the capital program through the for the budget for next year we 've looked at some moderation to the core capital program but a very mindful about what impacts we can have to the economy by pushing as much capital works out there as possible we need to manage that through a combination of of our operating results utilization of our depreciation in debt and as we touched on the other day when we look at utilization of debt that needs to be paid back so any any new lines will be through business units or for the region making projects who have got an opportunity to make a repayments of that debt over time thank you any further speakers to the motion okay we 'll put the motion of the boat all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you councillors will retrieve councillor I pray moving on to item 8.3 and counsellors I 'm informing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 I may have a material personal interest in the matter which is the subject of the agenda item 8.3 on the basis said I 'm the nominee in the report for the position of the district to north representative on the policy executive of the Local Government Association of Queensland in line with the requirements under Section 175 C brackets 2 of the Act I 'll leave the chamber and not participate in the discussion or vote on this matter and I 'd ask the deputy mayor if he 'd come forward and take the chair please so good morning counselors counselors we 're here to consider item 8.3 the nomination of division 2 north representative on the policy executive of the Local Government Association of Queensland and I 'd invite miss to senior staff member Craig Matheson to give us a presentation Thank You deputy me good morning counselors the report before you today is designed to seek a decision in relation to the nomination of the district 2 North representative on the policy executive the Local Government Association of Queensland all councils across Queensland have been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 May which is tomorrow hence the need to bring this report forward for councils consideration today just just as a bit of a bit of a brief background to the matter just in terms of the Local Government Association of Queensland the Association was established in 1896 and is the peak body representing all 77 councils in Queensland its members are councils only there 's no other private member 's or anything like that and over the decades and but principally in the last two to three decades it is a body that has gained considerable political influence and credibility with both sides of politics in the interests of influencing policy programme and financial decision making to make a need in the interests of local governments there 's also a couple of other arms the ljq which include a a commercial entity called peak services and the ojq is also the trustee or a mutual or insurance fund and a WorkCover fund to the extent that today approximately it 's now approximately 22% of its total revenue is derived from membership subscriptions specifically in relation at the policy executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a board which is a requirement of under the Corporations Act and also a policy executive the policy executive comprises the president of the LGA q+ 15 district representatives for the purposes of formation of the policy executive the LGA Q divides the state into twelve twelve to twelve districts southeast Queensland because of the large population large population base has four of those places on the policy executive and then the other eleven district representatives are dispersed across the other eleven districts in Queensland the role of the policy executive is to shape the advocacy platform of the LGA q and also there are three specific functions that are assigned to it under the Constitution and they are to approve are the annual budget of the ljq appointed CEO and also appoint three of its members to the LGA q board mayor jamison was first nominated to the policy executive in May 2016 and from there subsequently was nominated from the policy executive as one of its three nominees on the board and then was subsequently elected by the whole membership as president of the ojq the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different to that of what exists for the policy executive in the board because it 's something that goes back to the whole membership to vote on at the Annual General Meeting so in the context of the district district 2 North which is the the district that our councillors part of there 's a there are three councils that make that I 've make up the cohort for that district now R selves the news to Shire Council and the Moreton Bay Regional Council but the mayors of both Moreton Bay Regional Council and nurses Shire Council would have indicated their support for the nomination of Mayor Jamison as the district 2 North representative for the LGA q and hence there is a recommendation before you today to consider also supporting the nomination of Nia Jamison to the policy executive and the the obviously for council in terms of being representative on the pot represented on the policy executive is very much or around having the ability to directly input to the shaping of advocacy the advocacy platform particularly around legislative measures programmed program design funding arrangements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is something that is before the the state government at the moment that 's a product of the LGA units a product of the work of the oh of the ljq policy executive so the recommendations that are before you today counselor is to note the report and to endorse the nomination of mayor Jemison as the district to policy a pub district 2 North representative on the policy executive of the ljq I 'm happy to take any questions Thank You mr. Matheson any questions for the grave so we 'll need someone to move Thank You counselor Cox Dixon any questions for mr. Matheson to you mr. chair Trudeau and mr. Matheson it would be good just for the audience and those watching at home if you could explain some of the benefits attached with having our mayor as part of the LGA queue and some of the projects that we 've secured for the region there are relationships the partnerships and also the policy changes to help protect local government and some of those 77 councils throughout Queensland certainly through our the through the deputy mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all councils but ours included derive from being part of a member or a member of a member organization such as such as the LGA q I I guess if you would look at at just the last four years alone as opposed to history at the ojq during that time the LGA Q has through its advocacy if it 's secured in the over over 1 billion dollars in funding in terms of additional state and federal government programs including the retention of the transport infrastructure development scheme and the expansion of the roads to recovery program in the first 5 literacy program I also mentioned a moment ago the LGA Q battle plan which is a six hundred and eight million dollar recovery package that will would that if taken up by government will benefit all councils across Queensland amputee and in particular there is a there is a there 's a capital program component of that where one hundred million dollars would be quarantined for South East Queensland Council some of which we of which we are one and that they are that is to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on locally based capital programs that are that are designed to start quickly accelerates spend money back in local local communities and as you 've been deliberating on this morning in relation to the region 's response to the covert 19 pandemic it 's an opportunity a further opportunity to keep money circulating throughout the economy keep local local businesses engaged and local people employed through those those businesses so that 's just a and you that that that battle plan was submitted to both the Queensland Government and also the Queensland opposition is my understanding through some material that was circulated yesterday that the Queensland opposition is already committed to the battle plan and I understand also there are very positive discussions occurring with the state governments so but that 's just one example of other benefit from that there 's also the the ability to influence and shape the legislative programme in the legislature the legislative agenda that the government undertakes in relation to the administration of local government you know we 've seen some very significant wins over the course of the last four years particularly particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial operations waste waste management environmental responsibilities councillor as you know we are developing a coastal our councillors developing a coastal has it has its adaptation strategy there 's funding for that that which we 've which we secured through the ljq its state government funding but the ljq manages the cue Coast funding program that provides that funding for that so again and there 's there 's many other examples I could give but there are there are there are I guess numerous examples that I could I could point to probably the only other one that I would point here which was particularly significant was the wind that was able to be negotiated in relation to the revision of the national national and having with the national disaster recovery arrangements where the LGA Q and as a matter really of of national significance but the LGA too took a very strident in very public advocacy program in terms of retention of various elements of those those arrangements that if they had been removed and there was a very real prospect that would have been removed particularly around things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recovery works and so forth they would have been quite um detrimental part of the interests of councils thank you very much mr. maths that comprehensive response any other questions or comments councillors continue mr. chair I do support this report and we note that Mayor Jamison has been with the LGA queue for some time not only just as councils representative but the representative for Queensland and the National presidents role so I don 't think we take that lightly and and really the benefit for us as a council and a region is that our mayor mark Jamison is very very close to all of the other mayor 's and representatives throughout Queensland and I think that gives us the ability on big projects to have someone spearhead some of those major projects and champion them for the Sunshine Coast so I see a lot of benefit in that notwithstanding those previous comments it also puts a larger amount of work on the deputy mayor and that 's why I believe the deputies met deputy mayor role has such a significant role in the Coast when our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout Queensland the deputy mayor is required to step up quite a lot that important meetings and attending things throughout the community so I acknowledge that too right now we do need leadership and we do need some proven leadership and I do understand the mayor will probably be raising his hand again for the president role later in the year when that opportunity comes up and I hope he does get the support noting that Moreton Bay companions to the south and also those in noosa to the north have fully endorsed mark jamison now mirrors as the region 's representative so happy do endorse the report today and wish the mayor continued goodwill and good luck Thank You the council Dixon any other comments or questions councillors councillor law through you definitely may just a question for mr. Matheson what the consequences should this group not agree to the nomination for the representation of the North Region if we didn 't agree to the nomination through through the chair technically the way the voting the way the voting apportionment works across the division my recollection is that mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes for the nomination to proceed because the voting entitlement the risks with Moreton Bay and noosa combined will exceeds the voting entitlement that 's assigned to Sunshine Coast Council I would have to just check that it may however be the case that they would need to be a service and further conversations with the other two councils in relation to what who and what might be the appropriate approach forward for names Thank You council law for your question any other comments or questions councillors if I may I 'd like to make a comment myself um cancer site like councillor Dixon would just like to really think really our mayor for nominating to some extent I think he would be the first to acknowledge that it does present an extra workload and a challenge to sometimes prioritize it would be worth noting that if there is ever a conflict between his rollers on the ODI queue and as the mayor of the Sunshine Coast his work with council takes priority and he would acknowledge that but I 'd also like to take the opportunity as councillor Dixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils for their support of his nomination and I again wish him well in considering when the opportunity comes up in October to consider his position on whether he would rerun as president and with that Kenneth I 'd asked you to consider the recommendation so any comments to close Thank You councillor Cox and councillors I 'll put the motion to the vote all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you very much sure we can Thank You counselor Borowski we 'll move on to item 8.4 which is the counselor portfolio system for the term beginning 2020 and I 'd call on bill had rule for a presentation thank you bill mr. mayor councillors the purpose of this report is to prevent present for your consideration the establishment of the councilor portfolio system 2020 the designation of councillors to the proposed portfolios and the allocation of portfolio counselors to the Sunshine Coast council order committee counsel in recent terms has operated a counselor portfolio system as part of its governance structure while the establishment of portfolios has no statutory basis they have traditionally been based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities of council and to the core responsibilities that counsel is required to discharge the portfolio system provides counselors with an opportunity to develop a heightened level of knowledge leadership and representation across a region in a specified area of responsibility the counselor portfolio system should also ideally represent and align neatly with a strategic framework of counsel in addition to the councilors responsibilities under the Local Government Act 2009 portfolio counselors keep abreast of counsels proposals issues and other activities which are irrelevant to the portfolio area also have the opportunity to act as the official spokesperson or representative on portfolio relevant matters and to provide input and advice to counsel officers on portfolio relevant matters portfolio counselors do not hold any statutory responsibilities or governance responsibilities beyond those which are ordinarily held as an elected councillor portfolio counselors should maintain a focus on strategic issues relevant to their portfolio area rather than focusing on the day-to-day issue of the day and consistent with the position as elected representative of the region the mayor undertakes a regional leadership and representation or role in line with the functions of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio system that further strengthens the alignment with the strategic framework and priorities of council a strategic alignment portfolio model is proposed that would provide direct line of sight between the five corporate plan goals and portfolio accounts the responsibilities the benefits of such a model include again the line of sight between the five corporate plan goals the regional strategies of counsel and counsel of portfolio responsibilities the opportunity to establish consistent counselor spokespersons between the corporate plan goals and regional strategies and the opportunity to establish six portfolios one each for the five goals of the corporate plan and a sixth portfolio which reflects the mayor 's responsibilities for regional advocacy and intergovernmental relations in recognition of the breadth complexity and overall responsibility of the proposed strategic alignment model it is recommended that a shared or joint portfolio designation structure is considered with the designation of two councillors to each of the five goals the following allocation of Sunshine Coast Regional Council portfolios is recommended or proposed for region shaping projects regional advocacy and intergovernmental relations may Jennison for the community portfolio councillor Borowski and councillor law for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the economy portfolio council Landsberg and councillor o pray for service excellence portfolio councillor dixon and councillor johnson and for the outstanding organization councillor portfolio councillor Hungerford and council anatoliy in addition to the proposed designation of councillors to the portfolio structure is also a requirement for council to consider today the nomination or designation of councillors to the Audit Committee under section 105 2 of the Local Government Act each large local government is required to establish an audit committee the next audit committee of council is scheduled to be held on the 25th of May 2020 to enable full committee membership in accordance with the audit committee charter and to assure effective delivery of the audit committee it is an imperative that we have two councilors recommended to the Audit Committee and appointed by resolution of Council the primary objectives of the audit committee are closely aligned with the responsibilities of the proposed outstanding organization portfolio which includes a focus on finance governance and corporate strategy accordingly it is considered appropriate that the two nominated councillors to the outstanding organization portfolio are allocated to the Sunshine Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today are seeking the approval for the allocation of councillors to the recommended portfolio structure and the approval of the nominated councils councillors to the Audit Committee Thank You mr. Harrell can I have someone move the report please Thank You councillor Dixon councillor pray thank you would you like to open councillor Dixon you mr. May and a good opportunity for a brand new term and if there 's anything I 've learned the last few weeks it 's that you know councillors remind me of their particular interest in the Sunshine Coast and we all have particular interests that we would like to push and that 's why we all ran for council we made commitments to our community and this will assist us in in providing some outcomes for them just particularly on why we do this well we don 't have to portfolio systems don 't have to exist but people do ask us for transparency and they ask for accountability and accountability is where portfolios come into the mix we could all sit back and do our jobs and ignore portfolio responsibilities but the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of interest which I said earlier so if you 've got an interest in custom service or the environment something you want to drive very very hard it might be the the land acquisition of environmental parcels on the Sunshine Coast it might be improving the way council conducts its customer service and interacts with the community it might be the way that we deliver our capital works in the way that we do our place making how things look and feel I think we all need champions in that space and for me as a councillor it 's good to know that I can go to somebody else that I trust on the councilor team and ask them you know how are we going in the environmental department what strategies do we need to improve what do I need to know because I can 't be an expert in everything and I never will be so it means that you can lean on your colleagues and get some help when you need it the system that we 've changed to today is different from the last term it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared responsibility and I think that 's great because it welcomes in embraces new members of the team to the Sunshine Coast Council it it 's like my opportunity to work with councillor Johnston I will learn some things that I didn 't know and we 'll be able to share some great ideas and hopefully get some good outcomes for the community in that as well I 'm stepping up for service excellent so I 'm taking on things that actually started with when I when I joined Council for those who don 't know when I left school actually went to the merger show Council and did a traineeship and my first ever job was a trainee with customer service and records so I actually started in that part of the organization it 's what inspired me to get into local council so to go back there it means that I can improve things around customer service local laws our waste department and also keep on some of those things from my previous role which was development assessment and as we know development assessment is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the community out there and I think it 's one of those things that people often judge a council on and that 's their development applications and the balance that we 've got councillor Winston and I is that we will have focus on the coast and also the hinterland because we represent such different and diverse areas and I 'm hoping that we can take some of those shared experiences from the coast and the hinterland and represent the community mr. mayor I 'm quite excited by this opportunity to move into a shared arrangement with our portfolio system and I would encourage genuinely any new counselor here today to to not be afraid but to get up and and talk about you know your interest in your passion for your division and how you reflect that in your new portfolio I commend this to you and um thank you councilor Cox Thank You mr. mayor I 've taken on the environment and livability portfolio in conjunction with councilor Suarez and I 'm certainly excited by the challenge that this portfolio brings that being said I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this space and I just also wanted to acknowledge councilman Chi for her efforts over probably eight years in that particular portfolio so obviously want to continue some of the other good work that she started and and run with that but just couple of the things that I thought I 'd share with people in the room and and those on line just some of the important characteristics of this portfolio which I hope to bring and that is to maintain a nurture our environment last week I spoke about the importance of preserving and enhancing our natural assets here on the Sunshine Coast because they are very unique and special and certainly that is one of the the main objectives to this particular portfolio one of the other ones and it 's quite critical is responding to the challenges of population growth I know councillor Dixon spoke of that last week and and they are something that our community rule will need to come on the journey with us because the coast is growing it is a very popular destination to live and responding to those challenges will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building resilience against some the proposed impacts of climate change and we 're working through those mr. Matheson 's spoke about some of those earlier creating livable spaces and places to work live and play one of my former portfolios was in the place development and design and and we 've been speaking as a group in the last week about the yellow book or the design strategy book and it 's bringing those principles into play for our built environment also driving renewable energy like we did with the solar farm that has been an outstanding project it 's won numerous awards and it just shows the innovation that council has brought to this particular role and finally I just wanted to say that I really want to live up to the expectations of the future generations this council has an important role to play it 's not one that we take lightly and I certainly hope to be able to deliver on those future expectations so thank you Thank You councillor Cox council Suarez sorry you missed me I just like to follow on from councillor Cox 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together I was very pleased to be allocated to this portfolio the environment is of a personal interest to me and particularly in division 9 we have a very fragile ecosystem up there as well I think that working on the environment portfolio presents opportunities not only for present preservation and rehabilitation but it also provides external opportunities for ecotourism education and research in terms of place development and design this is where people are brought together and communities are created and I think having those two areas put together presents a real opportunity to bring a lot of environmental initiatives into places where people will live work and play I am looking forward to consulting with communities and associations who have interests in both these areas both the environment and Urban Development and working together on policies and strategies with councilor Cox and councillors staff to create a environment that people have come here in the first place to live work play and enjoy the natural environment together it 's two big big opportunity for a new councilors the portfolio system is an amazing system on the Sunshine Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the all the counselors across the entire region it 's something that you 'll learn a lot from not only professionally but also very very much personally tourism sport major events is what I 've looked after for the last eight years and on a personal level I 've learned so much it 's been a great experience for me over the last eight years and I am really looking forward to and embracing the opportunity mr. mayor to enlarge that portfolio and take on economic development innovation tourism sport and major events now that 's a bit of a mouthful but it is a big job for the Sunshine Coast region and I welcome council of wetlands Berg on board here council Landsberg has got a lot of experience in in and around small business particularly and also with sport across the region so I look forward to taking a minute and about but we 're not our own we 're not on our own Council ensberg we will certainly have the support of all this council of the mayor the executive but probably more directly without the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic development communities at the Sunshine Coast we 'll have support of Paul Martin 's and his economic development team and of course Simon Latchford from visit Sunshine Coast so we 've got a great team wrapped around us and we 've got a really really big job to do this year particularly with the small businesses Council as you 've heard my passionate pleas for assistance of this council going forward over the next 18 months to two years particularly for small business we are in dire times we 've said that a thousand times but we need to create action we need to get our small business initiatives off the ground immediately we need to get development of small business out there and on the ground as quickly as we humanly can and I think that 's very very critical and it 's a big job for us councillor Landsberg a couple of the big strategies of the Sunshine Coast Council is of course the Reds the regional and economic development strategy and the major event strategy both parts of myself and councillor Cox and the mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in 2012-13 which has been around it 's going right through to 2030 something so it 's it 's a big part of the Sunshine Coast direction Sunshine Coast Council and the Sunshine Coast community the major events strategy we put put together only a handful of years ago and has been working absolutely brilliantly and major events across the region particularly over the last five or six years have just exploded and as I 've said in the past every major event owner across Australia is looking at our destination to come to town mr. mayor I embrace taking on this role about looking after the economy as a portfolio alongside councillor Landsberg this is a big role for our region going forward in the next two years so I feel like I 've got the experience that I 'm ready to rock and roll and I really want to do this and make sure that we 're doing everything we possibly can for small business and tourism operators across the Sunshine Coast thank you miss me Thank You counsel right council hunger food I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well now I 'm very happy to take on that standing organization as you know I 've always been interested in finance sort of council in the last four years I did a lot of studies and my climbers and things to bring myself up to speed to be I step up to more substantive crawls now in saying that I don 't think I 'm going to be disappointed in the challenge ahead if I wanted more challenge because these are very challenging times the next budget will be very difficult to put together in this current environment I can support their community but as you know I don 't shake from hard work it took me nine years and three elections to get elected in the first place but in saying that I 'm not alone doesn 't have councillor Jonah told me in that portfolio as well there is extensive previous experience in local government and I 'm sure we 'll be resourcing that as much as possible but I think it 's very balanced and I think it 's good to have a team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's know I look forward the way we can head with this we look at it as time goes on but I did do notice that the councillors had a diverse interest in different areas from council we put that together in a very sound way so I look forward to working with you all I think this structural or deliver results thank you Thank You Council on a food council Landsberg thank you through you mr. mayor won 't be as long as Jason can see Jason 's uh use their look I 'm really excited to be a part of the economic development and tourism sporting events with council I pray I think I think the structure is going to work well especially with us new counselors coming on board with the experience that counsel Jason will supply to be from my background in terms of being a business owner yes I think I 've got a lot to bring and I understand that the challenge is out there in our community that we 're witnessing we are really going to have to work very very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong voice for our local communities as well Ben in terms of our corporate goals and having that line-of-sight and being a representative yes definitely it 's a wonderful opportunity to step in such a huge role that does take a lot of responsibilities so I 'm up for the challenge also in terms of our ever-changing environment we will have to diversify our approach greatly and we 'll need a fresh approach and a lot of new ideas I 'm sure will be supported by Greg Liberty there in poor mountains in terms of the advice that we all received and all I want to do is just let everyone know I want to be a strong voice and for our community out there and work as hard as we can which I know we all will thank you Thank You council Landsberg councillor Natale councillors I 'm extremely excited about taking on the role of that standing organization as part of the portfolio and in conjunction with councillor Hungerford we 've already discussed that we would like to work together as a team rather than individually working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong interest in finance but I have a strong interest in all of the different portfolios and I think as counselors we come from our communities we won 't have an interest in a whole range of things within the organisation we accept have a portfolio that may not be as sexy as some of the other portfolios and may be seen as much more structured but I think it 's an opportunity for us both counselor Hunger fitted myself to be able to make it exciting and make it a portfolio that will actually set the bar extremely high for an organization to achieve in both being an outstanding organization and gives us the opportunity to make it extremely outstanding in everything that we do it 's an important portfolio because it sets all the structures in terms of what local government is about it meets all the statutory obligations that we have as an organization and placing both portfolio counselors on the audit committee is an important part of our role as well and that functionality in terms of both setting the framework and the direction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whole process so I welcome the opportunity to be involved in that the corporate plan is to me probably one of the more important documents it sets the real direction in terms of where the organization needs to go and it 's an important document especially at the beginning of the council 's term because as we know we have a number of new councils that have made their their their mark in terms of coming into this organization we have councils that have served for a number of terms as as council Hubbard said and the aspirations of those who have been elected may differ but it 's important to bring all that together in a document that reflects what our community wants and a direction that we can set as different to previous councils so that is our document that we own in terms of our direction and the way that we reflect in terms of the way that we react within our community is so excited about having this portfolio mr. mayor as of city councillors that you will get a hundred 110 percent from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as effective as possible within the organisation but open door with all of the counselors at anytime that want to come and raise any issue with me working collaboratively with hyung at counseling but on that matter as well thank you thank you ollie Kelso Johnston Thank You mr. mayor and Thank You councillor Dixon for the con words that you expressed in running for council there were a number of things that were in the back of my mind and they were that there 's three important aspects of any organization which doesn 't matter whether you 're running an insurance general insurance brokerage like I did or whether you have a cafe or whether you 're running a council or a major corporation and they are a high standard of ethics culture a good culture and also a high degree of quality service and in becoming a counselor they 're all running for council they were some of the things that I talked about that I wanted to see fixed and improved in this council and I 'm really pleased to have been given the opportunity to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come just measuring the standards in this response to customer service service reviews monitoring customer and community satisfaction levels development delivery or monitoring of annual core capital aspects or Works programs and asset management local laws which are so important in the everyday life of the community because it 's the local laws that if you fall foul off you find that there are difficulty and it 's local laws that protect the community from some of the excesses of behavior by certain people or industries also development assessment services and standards and monitoring of those services that they evolved around aspects of town planning well whereas previously councillor Dixon took on a great deal more responsibility in relation to the area of development assessments I 'm pleased to see that this council is now shooting home some of those responsibilities more to the individual councillors and that we will be more involved in the strategies the assessment of the making sure that it 's going in the right direction that the end that the offices following the processes that are in place I 'm also pleased to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is another matter I discussed during the campaign are going to be the responsibility of the entire council and I just like to say that I 'm looking forward to working with James for a and Tom Jamison in particular who I met James the other day and had a great I 'll talk to him we have kindred spirits in some areas and thank you very much I 'm looking forward to meeting with Tom tomorrow because I think I have a lot of ideas in relation to delivery of work services and how employees relate with with the people and I just want everybody to realize that I understand that council officers council employees and indeed councillors are the servants of the people we 're not the bosses and that 's something that I will always remember and always advocate for finally I 'd like to mention that my fellow councillors have been amazing the mayor 's been amazing too he 's given us our head he 's let us make many of the decisions he hasn 't interfered he 's been encouraging at all times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great makeup of it for a council for this environment that we are entering into because it 's going to be hard it 's going to be difficult there 's a good balance of experience knowledge and business acumen and whilst I have a significant interest also in finance my real love is in client service and town planning so I 'm looking forward to working with Council Dixon as I am with all of the other councillors so I congratulate you all on your success and also I 'd like to say that all of the departmental heads that we 've had address us during our induction and training which goes on for some weeks as well as our assistants that have been appointed to help us have been amazing they really very high quality people and I thank them very much thank you Joe Johnston council law and the portfolio system that we 've discussed today I think represents a wonderful opportunity to draw on the expertise of everybody in the council and in the room today so that we can bring our wealth and depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm new to the council this time as everyone is aware but I bring a very deep knowledge of what it is to deliver community services from over 25 years of working in that space and particularly the last 18 years working for people who have a disability so I 'm extremely excited and positive to be working with councilor Borowski to bring forward the policy and strategy around our community to make sure that everyone in the community no matter their background their culture their indigenous origins are able to benefit and enjoy the services of the Sunshine Coast and the environment of the Sunshine Coast so I 'm really looking forward to becoming involved in community services so that I can have that element of representing the whole of the people of division 10 but hopefully everyone on the Sunshine Coast will benefit of the experience I bring to support our communities so thank you very much thank you for this system I think it means that the Sunshine Coast will be going in a very good direction mr. mayor councillors I just like to reinforce an echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the councillors who commented on the portfolio system that it is one that 's going to be drawing on the strengths and experience and the skill sets of both the returning councillors and the new councillors and I 'd like to reply repay the compliment to council or saying I 'm really looking forward to working with him to recognizing that he has an interesting both professional background that 's very relevant to the community aspects of the portfolio but also a personal and a family passion in the Performing Arts which I think I will use to refresh to some extent my own interest as the returning councils will know I 've enjoyed the transport portfolio for eight years and the arts and heritage portfolios for four and they remain incredibly important to me and incredibly important to the region particularly in terms of the transport which I think is moving into a particularly important phase with the mass transit study so this term is going to be particularly interesting of course our our priority and most prominent challenge is to make sure that we get the community back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the portfolio system can only support that thank you do you in a close counselor Dixon 's okay counselors will put the motion to the vote all those in favor that 's carried unanimously counselors that so there are no notices of motion there are no petitions and there are no confidential items to deal with that this meeting so that brings us to the conclusion of the day 's meeting and I 'll record it as closing is at 38 thank you very much for your contribution I doubt that we 'll have assured a meeting over the next four years but thank you very much all the best you"

Christian Dixon well good morning everybody and good morning mr. mayor my fellow councillors executive directors and staff and most of all the Sunshine Coast community who are joining us here for the first time live stream of this Sunshine Coast council well firstly to Division six and we proved that teamwork does make the dream work and if there 's one thing that I stand by and have stood for for some time and that 's working together I achieve nothing on my own it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council staff and also my awesome local assistant in Division six Linda gray who 's my counselor Support Officer we 've proven that we can work together with everybody to deliver some great outcomes and to division six thank you so much for your support it was a very very tough election many changes we 've got the global pandemic at the moment a very different and unique election but we 're still here and we 're still working as a team to the new councillors welcome this is a very very challenging time and for the last three days that I 've spent with you I 've been very very impressed with every single new counselor who 's been elected to the council and I really look forward to working with you and building that relationship into the future because we 're going to achieve some fantastic outcomes not only in your division but for the Sunshine Coast region touching back on some election commitments that I made I made some commitments around scholars drive-in sippy Downs we 've got a local school state government issue around traffic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for the residents of division six in the Sunshine Coast I 'd like to see a library and community facility presented and delivered at soupy down so I think that 's been a thing that we 'd like to see in the community for some time and I 'm driving that very very hard also parks and social spaces I think there 's a great opportunity to see some of our local parks enhanced with new developments across the Sunshine Coast in palmview and calendar south a lot of our residents are seeing these fantastic new parks multi-million dollar parks delivered and when they come out to some of our older communities and sippy downs and Mountain Creek they don 't have that level of embellishment so they 're looking for new play equipment and services for their families and I will work hard to deliver that on policy issues verge parking can used to be a very divisive issue in our community around the verge parking and I believe I have a simple solution that will allow residents to deal with that problem without being fined heavier handedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring to the table we need to push for roads interconnectivity but really what we need to deal with this public transport that is what is overlooked in this region time and time again without critical and effective public transport for the region we will continue to build roads that we don 't need we need to get people into alternate travel modes modes of transport getting them out of the car building the better bus bus networks putting in a light rail getting the connectivity to Brisbane these things need to happen and they can 't be overlooked population growth is a challenge in this region and we need to make sure as a council that we are pushing back to the state government who are responsible for population growth in Queensland and making sure the state government and the federal government deliver money and support and infrastructure on the Sunshine Coast that is vital and we need to work with our community to make that happen but most of all with those things aside I want to see a council who is compassionate who shows kindness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting thing during the election it 's something that I now stand by and I I hold this quite dear to myself as a commitment to residents I want to be the community 's representative in council not councils representative in the community I look forward to the next four years and as I 've said earlier together we will achieve some great things for the community and I look forward to the opportunity and again to division six residents thank you for your support and to even those who did not support me I will work hard for you and I 'll make myself available every day the week all the best [Applause] Thank You councillor Dixon from division 7 odd welcome

hand a very very blessed to have many more friends than that to my colleagues days returning and the new counselors particularly the new counselors I can remember where it 's like to be a first-time council on your first three to six months is a vertical learning curve I think I speak for my returned colleagues there we 're here to help you help you get your feet and particularly get to those public meetings where everyone said of throw tomatoes and potatoes at you I 'll give the commitment to my doors open and I 'm here to help you and give you the best advice possible I won 't tell you how to do your job they 'll always give you unbiased advice from my experience but that you make your own determination on where you stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pandemic the last time we had anything like this was 1919 the Spanish flu influenza we don 't know how long this is going to go for what the effects are going to be especially the impacts on our community in the economy so now more than ever as a council we need to work together as a cohesive team and for the best interests of our residents because we 're gonna have to help people through this not only the state governments and federal governments but every local government in Australia I do not know the exact challenges we 're going to face I want us to work together and face them together and to help our community through this time as best we can that 'll mean there 'll be some tough decisions there is some times when there 's more than one way to look at an issue but if we do that in a constructive and collaborative manner I believe we 'll do the very best we can for residents and that 's what they put us here for so I look forward to working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years thank you I 'd like to welcome

dark times and I 've already talked about it the last eight years my life has been wrapped around getting people to town I 've had tourism sport and major events now for the last eight years and the team at visit Sunshine Coast and the team of economic development have done the best job in Australia up until covert 19 there is no other region in this country that can say what we 've achieved in regards to growth in the way of economic development the way of expenditure and visitation this council has won this region has won Kovan 19 has done more than pulled the rug out from us it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the floor and we are all this country a splattering mess on the floor of the moment tourism has been the backbone of this region forever since day one we need this council to be absolutely 100 percent supportive of our small businesses and our tourism operators that are on their knees I cannot give more commitment and more passion and more love to small businesses in this region than anybody else on this planet I am absolutely committed to making sure that we can offer them every single service possible and beyond this region is thrive for many many many decades we need to make sure that we get out of this on the other side and we make sure that we 're one of those leading regions in Australia yet again and there 's reasons why we 're going to do that and these are the positives this place wins it 's beautiful there 's a reason why we 've got so many people coming to town there 's a reason why every Event Manager in Australia wants to bring their events to this region now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it so so right I 'm to applaud you all because the way that this council over the last eight years particularly has generated their energy to getting people to come to town and spend money and help the mum and dad businesses feed their families employ their staff has been just extraordinary and we will get there again absolutely certain to that so mr. mayor councillors I thank you and I applaud you I congratulate you I love you all the bits and more importantly I love the Sunshine Coast more than anything else on this planet thank you Thank You councillor I pray representing Division 9 I 'd like to welcome councillor Maria Suarez thank you Thank You mr. mayor councillors and management and staff what a campaign is 2020 election has been when I decided to in September of last year to run as a candidate for Division 9 I could never have imagined what would transpire over the following months for other well-regarded candidates join the race and it was a terrific contest where each of us had different strengths and all of us were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division 9 I 'd like to acknowledge the good grace in which each of those candidates round their campaign and their hard work and efforts to my own team I want to express my enormous gratitude I never felt that this was just my campaign but that it was our campaign we worked together enthusiastically at a grassroots level that fundamental to community values and of that I am very proud we were a motley group of strangers who have become friends and I would not be here today without their support and the help of my supporters the coronavirus has presented many challenges and especially in the weeks prior to the election many residents raise their concerns about having to vote under these conditions and it is my hope that lessons are learned from this experience to ensure better processes are in place for all of the future elections council itself has bettered themselves as a result of the socialized social isolation measures and today we have our first live-streamed meeting one of the thrusts of my campaign was to see greater transparency and accountability from council and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant step forward over the last three days we 've had robust conversations that included confidentiality improving community engagement issues with development applications and Town Planning environmental projects working within our divisions and I 've had a brief discussion with our state member regarding infrastructure and public transport arrangements over the coming days and months I will pursue curbside bulky waste collection the airport master plan and issues associated with mushrooming and transitioning communities these are baby steps it 's only been four days but they are steps that I hope to continue forward the priority now is how we best serve our community through this covert 19 period I 'd like to acknowledge the work of all the previous councillors and Steve Robinson 's contribution to division 9 it 's not easy to see a new person pick up the mantle and run with it and I hope at the end of four years he thinks that I have made some positive contributions to his previous electorate I congratulate the mayor and the elected councillors on successful campaigns as a group we have many and varied views which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look forward to working with everyone to continue to advance and improve our lifestyles here on the Sunshine Coast and to help the constituents of division 9 to enhance and protect our beautiful and fragile precinct it would be remiss of me not to mention my friends and family near and far who have accepted that I have been and will be missing in action for much of the time I 'm also grateful knowing that they will keep me grounded when I won the election I conveyed this by telephone to my family and received their congratulations I also received a shopping list of items to collect on my way home and I was greeted at the door by my daughter with what 's for dinner mum there are no fancy-pants airs and graces at my house finally and most importantly to the community you were the reason I stood for Council you were who supported me throughout and you will remain at the forefront of my thoughts so that I always remember that you are who I am here to represent and I will work hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years this new council is proving to be a group who who are willing to listen and share ideas together we will strive towards achieving good outcomes for the Sunshine Coast thank you [Applause] Thank You counsel Juarez I 'd now like to round out the presentations by inviting councillor David law from Division ten thank you David mr. mayor fellow councilors Acting CEO and all your staff it is a privilege to stand here today but the post-election meeting on behalf of the people of Division ten who have put their trust in me to represent them in the 2020 2024 Sunshine Coast Council my campaign slogan was here for good and all my decisions in this chamber will be made for the benefit of the Sunshine Coast region and unique communities of Division ten I like to acknowledge retiring councilor Greg Rogerson for his tireless work and contribution to vision ten and my intention to keep that going I ran in a strong field of diverse candidates there were seven of us and we behaved really well and we worked well together to offer a diverse range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wished to acknowledge the three female candidates who play second third and fourth that has been noted by me last Friday almost was the end of a 20-year career in disability services that career started in Nambour in 2001 when I became the manager of a day Center for people with profound intellectual disabilities some people there were non-verbal they were unable to talk but I discovered that we the ones whose job it was to help them were still able to listen how much easier then to serve this community where the vast majority are able to share their views and hopes and thoughts and a great many have been doing that with me throughout the campaign the and it has been one of the highlights to be door-knocking and getting to know the people in Kenilworth in Mapleton Y and ena eumundi and all the locations in between those town and of course my hometown Namba where I live but now I 'm here and I can 't do this on my own and the council can 't do it alone we need you to stay engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reason for the bed our region for the better for my part I will bring a compassionate leadership and a strong determination to bring about positive change in the six key areas of my campaign firstly strong communities strong communities that collaborate and work together to achieve better outcomes and leave no one behind responsible development that sustains and protects the Wonder and beauty of our environment and the social fabric of our community I also want to ensure that the unique characteristics of the hinterland towns are able to bounce back as we emerge from Co vid 19 and the projects underway and the new ones to be developed so we can continue the recreation of Nambu the heart of the hinterland equity for our sunshine coast into land towns that means every region can benefit from the strength of the Sunshine Coast economy and we leave no area behind the mental and physical health and well-being for our community are always important but never have they been more important than now we need to help each other and in particular those who have no one to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community I am lucky to live in a family full of musicians and I understand the benefits of creative arts and their creativity every day the arts must be supported and the arts bring communities together they help reduce isolation and they help people feel safer art projects can inspire people to take pride in their surroundings and their community spaces for everyone to enjoy the arts can increase empathy even to the point of reducing social isolation and discrimination today I am both pleased and excited to be at the point where I can start to make a difference with my fellow councillors in the mayor of the Sunshine Coast thank you thank you very much counselor at law and to all councillors congratulations on your opening presentation it 's much appreciated I there 's an array of ambition and importantly a strong resolve and determination from everybody to to work together and as a the point I 've been making all week is that we serve our community best as a team that 's not to say we 'll always agree on everything but as a team we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly difficult to ever win majority so I 'm heartened by everybody 's enthusiasm and determination clearly the impact of kovin 19 and in terms of its duration and the impacts it has on our economy our community our regional psyche is yet to be played out and we will play pivotal roles in ensuring the guardianship of our community so thank you again we 're now going to move to item 4.1 which is the appointment of a deputy mayor for the 2020 to 2024 term Dixon yes three mr. mayor I 'd like to move item 4.1 and I would like to move that councillor Rick Babur Oski be appointed as the deputy mayor of the Sunshine Coast of

endeavored to do this in a spirit of fairness and respect I have only worked with this group for a few days but I 'm already confident that every counselor here has valuable experience and important contribution to make to all of our debates I 'd like to acknowledge the previous Deputy Mayor Tim Dwyer councillor Dwyer was a very dedicated deputy mayor I 'm lucky to have been able to observe his work and learn from him over the last four years this is also an important symbol for the hinterland for the three terms that the Sunshine Coast Council has existed it has always had a deputy mayor based on the coast I want to thank my colleagues for sharing that this council is not controlled as some people think by a coastal block and that the hinterland is recognized as an important part of the region now we have some hard work to do and these are difficult times this will put us to the test I 'm optimistic however about the future and again I 'd like to personally thank you for the nomination I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust but now as required by section 175 C of the Local Government Act of 2009 I would like to inform the meeting of a material personal inflict sorry material personal interest in relation to item 4.2 as the nominee for the position of deputy mayor and I will now leave a meeting for the duration of this item Thank You counselor barofsky can we just record I think that 's item 4.1 that 's fine does anybody wish to speak to the motion at all mr. Mehra will Thank You 3 mr. mee I just want to recognize and congratulate council of a barosky but notwithstanding that that there are several capable people in this room who could also do that role we recognize that the deputy mayor 's position is an extremely important position and we know that because you find yourself very very busy with your community events and events right around the Queensland State the deputy mayor and previously that was councillor Tim Dwyer councillor Tim had to chair quite a few meetings and be there I 'm happening as mayor in many instances and obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on the ability of that deputy mayor I will support councillor Rick as best I can and I 'm sure as a team we will support councillor Rick in your absence and I commend and congratulate councillor Rick today Thank You councillor Dixon no further speakers councilors will put the motion to the vote all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you very much can we retrieve councillor Thurber Oski congratulations counselor Borowski is the new deputy counselors were moved now to item four point two which council meeting dates and I 'll ask Megan friend if she 'll provide a basic introduction and then I 'll have us someone to move please at the post-election meeting councils required to do two things and that be a pointer deputy mayor and consider the day in time for its ongoing council meetings this report considers those and recommends that we have all three meetings on a monthly basis which carries for what we 've previously done thank you friend who have a move on we 'd like to be the first of our new recruits to jump to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a second our council law thank you very much [Music] would you like to speak to the motion counselor Suarez that 's fine is there anybody who would like to speak okay we 'll put the motion to the bathroom just smear my apologies I hit the button thinking you would catch it if I can raise my hand sorry you 'd like speaker mr.

    "text": "hello everyone and welcome to this year 's comms day summit one that 's the circumstances are very different from the normal but I 'm sure that we can get plenty of value out of participating in this year 's event my name 's Greg Oliver D and I 'm a group executive with Sunshine Coast Council the video today is being shot on the Sunshine Coast which is a location that 's traditionally had a reputation as a great place for a holiday but hasn 't necessarily been viewed as a place where someone would think seriously about starting a business in 2013 council set about changing that perception of the Sunshine Coast with the adoption of the regional economic development strategy the strategy is a 20-year blueprint that has got four very ambitious goals included in it the first of those goals relates to the economic size of the region the goal is to grow the gross regional product from 13 billion to thirty three billion over that 20-year period in 2013 when the strategy was adopted the average wage on the Sunshine Coast was 20% below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectify where we look for the average wage on the Sunshine Coast to be higher than the average in Queensland and one of the ways we 're going to do that is by building a significant number a hundred thousand to be exact of high value jobs and last but not least we 're looking to increase the amount of exports of goods and services from the Sunshine Coast a greater than 20 percent at the end of the first year five-year action plan council is well on the way to achieving those goals and the Sunshine Coast has developed into one of Australia 's key economic growth regions the region 's is one of the five that are identified by infrastructure Australia in its Australia infrastructure plan that will be required to underpin the productivity of the Australian economy Sunshine Coast Council is one of the largest councils in Australia with an annual budget in excess of 700 million dollars and more than six billion dollars worth of assets under management as well as in excess of 1,800 staff the organization has certainly benefited as has the region from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils that 's provided a significantly larger Council that 's provided economies of scale and that has allowed the council to undertake a range of projects and initiatives that has placed the Sunshine Coast region in such a good place that it is today the economic building blocks for the Sunshine Coast are very strong with the average annual growth rate of the economy being more than 4% for more than a decade so that 's well in excess of the Australian average and there 's no reason with the projects and initiatives that are underway that this shouldn 't continue into the future there are currently more than 320,000 people living on the Sunshine Coast and this is forecast to grow to more than 500,000 by 2041 it 's worth noting that the Sunshine Coast is part of the southeast Queensland region that stretches from the Sunshine Coast to the Gold Coast and more than one in seven Australians call that region home and certainly across that region the population growth will continue long into the future importantly this population growth is supported by significant private and public sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects map that outline a whole range of projects that have been delivered on the Sunshine Coast it 's a very ambitious list of projects but one that is very much achievable and there are a number of those projects that have already been delivered or well underway in relation to private sector investment the Sunshine Plaza retail center at Maroochydore has recently seen the completion of a four hundred million dollar expansion the Ora development to the south of Caloundra which is coming out of the ground we 'll see 20,000 dwellings which will accommodate 50,000 people and that 's the larger residential development currently underway in the country a little further north is the harmony development that will see 8,000 Wellings accommodate 17,000 people so clearly the population growth has been planned it is occurring in certain areas and that will minimize the urban sprawl and maintain the outstanding character that the Sunshine Coast is currently recognized for in addition to these retail and residential investments there are a range of commercial and other investments that are currently underway or in the pollak line in raishin to public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maroochydore this 53 hectare site has had the benefit of being designated a priority development area by the Queensland Government this designation is significant because of the benefit that the increased planning certainty that it brings a lot of that planning is already been approved and obviously any planning certain certainty and the streamlining of planning approvals is a great incentive being a greenfield development we have the advantage of being able to put infrastructure in the ground in advance in particular already in place in stage one of that development fibers that run to every block that is currently under development and also in place is an underground way system the first of its kind in Australia at the entry to this development is the location for the cable landing station that houses the Sunshine Coast branch submarine cable and obviously that connectivity from the cable landing station directly into some of those development sites is a really important advantage for a whole range of businesses the 1.8 billion dollar Sunshine Coast University Hospital was completed in 2017 and this has made a significant contribution to seeing a fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now the largest employment sector on the Sunshine Coast this is overtaking the traditional retail tourism and construction sectors that we have largely relied on for many years in the past so that change in the structure of the economy is one of the goals of the regional economic development strategy that we are already seen start to play out the Sunshine Coast Airport will have a new international runway that will open in December of this year which looking at the current climate will be very good timing to benefit from what should be a strong rebound from the current circumstances that we 're dealing with Council has traditionally been the owner and operator of that Airport but with the significant expansion plans in place Council has entered into a 99 year lease with palisade and that will give that operation a much stronger commercial focus and allow it to grow into the future the University of the Sunshine Coast has recently completed expansions in excess of 80 million dollars both at the CP downs campus as well as the opening of the new campus at the Petrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of very strong leadership for council is that council has completed the construction and commissioning of a 15 watt megawatt solar farm which provides all of councils electricity needs and that 's in the last financial year a hundred and nine percent of council 's electricity needs were generated from that solar farm with the remaining 9% being sold back into the grid and that 's a fantastic achievement both from a leadership perspective but also the retail and commercial a range of associated with that project all the projects that I 've touched on already are some of the largest and very unique projects for a local government clearly the most unique project that the council has undertaken is the Sunshine Coast International Broadband Network project and that submarine cable landing on the Sunshine Coast is the one that would be most relevant from the comms day summit attendees initially counsels focus was to work with ACMA to get a cable protection zone application approved so that we provided some increased certainty for an operator to actually land a cable on the Sunshine Coast however in the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was very difficult to try and get that cable protection zone application approved so council took a bold decision to invest thirty five million dollars to get that branch constructed and provide the necessary land side infrastructure for that cable to land this thirty-five million dollar investment for council isn 't partly offset by a fifteen million dollar grant from the Queensland Government they were being hugely supportive of this project and certainly have indicated a willingness to provide support for future investment attraction activities that council might undertake to take advantage of that submarine cable landing council has secured a partnership with RTI for the landing of that branch which was delivered by Alcatel submarine networks importantly that RTI cable joins the JTA South Network that provides connectivity from the Sunshine Coast to Sydney which is an important domestic connection but also to Guam to the United States and not far behind that seamless connectivity into Japan which we done by the middle of this calendar year and there not long before that after that there will be connectivity into Hong Kong and then hopefully down the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection to Singapore so why did Council take the opportunity to invest in such a project the key driver for the project were the economic benefits that council expected to achieve for the local economy and more broadly to Queensland in 2017 with funding from the Commonwealth Government Council engaged gqi to undertake a feasibility study that indicated that the project would bring additional jobs to the Sunshine Coast as well as stop the leakage of some of the high value jobs that might be lost to the region without connectivity existing the feasibility study identified that the economic benefits for the state of Queensland were estimated at 927 million dollars and included up to 800 jobs directly for the Sunshine Coast over the life of the project while the cable only achieved ready for service in the past few days the interest in the project has been rapidly growing in the last few months there was clearly some skepticism when council originally started talking about the idea idea of landing a cable here in 2015 but at certain points in recent months as the cable has been delivered there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cable on the beach on the 23rd of December and certainly the announcements around it being ready for service in recent days has seen the interest spark dramatically in recent weeks council has also undertaken a range of investment attraction campaigns predominantly focused on digital platforms that have generated in excess of 1,400 new investment leads now these are mainly around the submarine cable and also The Associated improvements in the telecommunication infrastructure or in the region one of those examples that has already played out is the attraction of huddle insurance to the Sunshine Coast so like last year huddle insurance announced that they would establish a presence on the Sunshine Coast the head office is based in Sydney but they cited the cable as a real draw card for their business to expand to the Sunshine Coast huddle much prefer to be known as a technology company rather than an insurance company and this is backed by significant use of artificial intelligence machine learning and the use of bots that assess and approve claims in a matter of minutes similarly another Sydney firm set up operations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HQ are a Tele networking company that is again sided improving telecommunications infrastructure on the showing coast to establish an operation on the Sunshine Coast and then to expand their operations on the Sunshine Coast in December last year office HQ and asked that they would put on an additional 40 FTEs on the Sunshine Coast to take their total employment on the Sunshine Coast to a hundred and ten the technology that office HQ operate on allows 90 percent of their staff to work from home and that 's technology and an arrangement that has become incredibly important in responding to the current covert 19 circumstance that we face local firms have also responded to the opportunities that the landing of the submarine cable presents for the Sunshine Coast there are multiple local companies who are taking the lead with the construction of new fiber and also new wireless networks around the sumption Sunshine Coast in some cases these are connections to individual businesses who are after the international connectivity that is available from the submarine cable or in some cases simply the improved and greater resilience that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their customers or to their existing operations Council is currently in conversations with a number of carriers in relation to connectivity from the cable landing station in Maroochydore being made available to all parts of not only the Sunshine Coast but more broader to the state of Queensland downstairs in the cable learning station there 's a MeetMe room that 's got 24 rax available and that is certainly attracting attention from both carriers and also businesses who want to set up operations on the Sunshine Coast similarly there are companies that are announcing new fiber bills from regional parts of Queensland with a view to connecting directly into the cable landing station at Maroochydore and again while the actual submarine cable landing on the Sunshine Coast and providing that international connectivity capacity diversity low latency is really important the success of that will be generated by the domestic connectivity that has brought that has seen quite a lot of interesting recent times there has also been an international firm who was interested in establishing operation in Australia and they are currently looking at the Sunshine Coast as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cut the International connectivity the low costs the low operating costs associated with doing business on the Sunshine Coast the wonderful lifestyle locations are certainly things that are attractive to the Sunshine Coast as is the fact that there are more than thirty thousand small businesses here that are currently underserved in relation to some of those digital services that are available in capital cities at the moment so the firm will deploy a range of cloud services both platform and software as a service that will be really important for the competitiveness of local businesses on the Sunshine Coast obviously near the submarine cable is ready for service capacity sales have also inquiries around capacity sales have also been received both to Sydney and internationally and those sales are currently being led by RTI and again with that supporting domestic connectivity we 're hopeful let those that strong leads that are coming for that in national capacity will continue as well as individual businesses the submarine cable opportunity infrastructure will open up opportunities we 've also seen an additional industry pathways that are starting to emerge in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest on the Sunshine Coast since the announcement of the submarine cable the Sunshine Coast is already home to Heidi care which is in Australia and New Zealand identity and cyber support services and they offer a range of unique services to individuals and businesses who have had their identities compromised and they 've already helped our thousands of people and businesses who have been unfortunately subject to those breaches the University of the Sunshine Coast and seeker University both offer programs in cyber security and those types of pro grams are really important to improve the reputation of the Sunshine Coast in relation to the cybersecurity offering over the last month the council has been approached by a cyber security company who has expressed an interest in moving their operations to the Sunshine Coast from other location in Australia and this is because the cable and the diverse paths the risk management business redundancy as well as international connectivity and latency that are now a viable direct from the Sunshine Coast combined with the great lifestyle location that we are one of the key things that attracted Council to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service is offered as I mentioned earlier there is significant connectivity available from Central Coast to Sydney which is an important domestic connection but also to Guam and there are lots of connective connectivity options from Guam and RTI are investing in a facility there that will see even greater connectivity available importantly the RTO network allows seamless connectivity from the Sunshine Coast to Sydney to the United States to Japan in the near future Hong Kong not far behind that and then down the track a little bit further to Singapore which is a very attractive option for a range of businesses both on the Sunshine Coast and more broadly Queensland and potentially even the Northern Territory for the Sunshine Coast right now there are a couple of things that have happened that mean we 're about to ramp up the activities that are happening obviously the ready for service point in the project is a really important one and now that traffic is available to go live on that project the second key thing for us at the moment you might have read that there were local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next week or so council will come out of caretaker provisions so while we 've been in caretaker provisions there are a range of restrictions that we have had placed upon us but now we 're coming out the other side of that and it 's an ideal time now to take advantage and have a strong focus on the attraction of businesses and attracting the infrastructure that is in place obviously these are trying and unusual times but there is no question that connectivity is vitally important in the current circumstances where a lot more people are working remotely as I mentioned earlier in the CLS there are currently negotiations underway and draft documents are being discussed about access to the MeetMe room and providing that domestic connectivity in addition the attraction of a data center operator will now become a key focus for council Council has undertaken a number of activities in preparation for that work to begin we 've undertaken a survey of local businesses to understand their data center needs and certainly council as a business is very happy to throw our data center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a data center operators set up on the Sunshine Coast there is also an option at the moment with the cable landing station having for transmission rooms upstairs obviously the first being occupied by the RTI cable but there is the ability for a micro data center that includes up to 45 racks to be established upstairs in some of those empty transmission rooms potentially up to 45 racks that would allow a revenue stream to be generated by a data center operator while they look at a more permanent option or larger scale option to provide a whole range of services for those Sunshine Coast businesses obviously we understand that the building of such a revenue stream would be an important justification for that cabling for that data center operator to consider the Sunshine Coast as a side there are a range of options for the location of that data center including a site right next to the cable landing station but there are also other sites available in some of the industrial areas around the Sunshine Coast or potentially even the hinterland and obviously with the cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are those planning advantages that are referenced earlier as I said at the start the Sunshine Coast has long held a great reputation as a fantastic place for a holiday but now it 's very much an attractive place to start expand or relocate a business it 's still a one for lifestyle region only an hours north of a capital city in Brisbane there is significant private and public sector investment occurring there is a very supportive local government entity on the Sunshine Coast in the Sunshine Coast Council and they will continue to be strong population growth on the Sunshine Coast connectivity is the key both from a transport perspective with the Sunshine Coast Airport new runway opening in December this year and from a communication perspective with the landing of the Sunshine Coast international broadband as well as the domestic connections that are currently in negotiations it 's not very often that you have a fantastic lifestyle location with all those things together so certainly I hope that you don 't forget about the Sunshine Coast when you start to make future business and investment decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to providing more information on the Sunshine Coast and my best wishes in these challenging times"

    "text": "hello my name is dmitri simeon arcus and welcome to sunshine coast council 's workshop on doing business with counsel everyone thank you very much for coming an overview of what the workshop is about today we 'll start off with telling you a little bit about our local government going into the legislation and policy that governs the way we enter into contracts then we 'll move into how we go about that how we procure the exceptions for the rules there 's always exceptions moving into the evaluation criteria that we use then our tender and quote response forms which you have in front of you and some feedback Sunshine Coast Council our vision is to be the most sustainable region healthy smart and creative in 2017-18 financial year our procurement spend 75% of which was spent with locals that we have a legally mandated and unashamed push to engage with local business and you 'll see how that 's how that 's driven further down into the workshop our balanced budget for the current financial year is 864 million 370 million of that is our capital works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main item of legislation that governs what we do in procurement under that the subordinate legislation is the local government regulation you 'll hear me refer to that as the LGR our policy sits under the statutory legislation that 's procurement policy contract manual and there 's a contracting plan and some associated guidelines we 'll get into them in detail a bit later on to then under that is the delegations of authority to undertake procurement activities so the Local Government Act it has principles that we must follow the local government principles are transparent and effective processes and decision-making in the public interest sustainable development and management of assets and infrastructure and delivery of effective services democratic representation social inclusion and meaningful community engagement good governance of and by local government and finally ethical and legal behavior of councillors and local government employees sitting under the local government principals are the sound contracting principles now you 'll see some overlap between the two the sound contracting principles which must be taken into consideration every time we enter into a contract value for money now value for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it greater consideration than any of the others in state government it does actually sit above the rest in local government it 's one of the five next is open and effective competition development of competitive local business in industry there it is as I mentioned before a legally mandated push for us to engage with our locals next is environmental protection and finally ethical behavior and fair dealing the strategic contracting procedures now the local government regulation the LGR has in it default contracting procedures so it 's basically a rulebook that it outlines for local governments to follow unless they wish to go down the path of drafting their own rulebook that complies with the sound contracting principles as of July 1 we switched over to the strategic contracting procedures to empower us to pursue better outcomes in contracting now the procurement framework under the strategic contracting procedures includes our policy the manual or contracting plan and these are the guidelines that sit under it as well there 's a local preference of procurement guideline a social benefit procurement guideline indigenous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement guideline that 's a mouthful and it 's coming soon that final one that hasn 't yet been drafted so how do we procure the rules that we 've drafted allows for us to take a couple of different approaches we can run a public tender or we can request quotes a request for quote process referred to as an RFQ so when we 're undertaking a public tender will advertise it via a ten dollar service and also in queue tenders now queue tenders is run by the Department of Housing and Public Works it 's a state government tender box so we 'll use that not just to to release and advertise our tenders but it 's also the tinderbox by which you will submit your submission it 's best to have separation between us and a tender box we think is in everyone 's best interest it 's not even about the potential for wrongdoing but even the perception of it that we wish to avoid if we can 't even be perceived to do to be doing the wrong thing then that 's even better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you submit your application to them your your tender to them when the tender closes well then two officers must go in simultaneously to acknowledge that they 're opening the tender box and download the submissions tenders must be open for a minimum of 14 days now in the default contracting procedures it 's the minimum of 21 days for public tenders we 've dropped it to 14 not to say that will force you to do in 14 days what you ought to be permitted 21 days to do if we always put ourselves in the shoes of our respondents and if it 's going to take at least three weeks to put together a response then will allow 21 days we might even allow 28 or more but if it 's very straightforward response that 's expected then why keep it open for 21 so we 've dropped the minimum to 14 the evaluation criteria are predetermined you 'll be pleased to know the goalposts are placed after we 've seen your submissions it 's very important we go to market and the market responds with their offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for quote process it 's about us choosing capable businesses to to ask quotes from we assess the market and decide who it is that we 're going to approach we release it via counsels a tendering portal that too has a tender box that 's secure it 's open for a reasonable time having regard to the contract now again 14 days is the norm however if it 's something that is very straight forward and you can respond to very quickly again why would we leave it open any longer than is necessary the evaluation criteria is predetermined Jews who are going to invite quite from in the market responds with their offers so the the thresholds that determine the process is going to be followed if the value of the contract is estimated to be up to 25,000 then we must seek a minimum of one quote now those numbers are on the right-hand side there the one three and five I reiterate their minimums there 's nothing stopping me from getting five quotes for a ten thousand dollar contract in fact if I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money how am I going to demonstrate value for money a mess of salt multiple quotes so it 's really it can be done it 's just not as easy so it 's important to ensure that quotes are sort and the minimums aren 't always followed twenty-five thousand to two hundred and fifty thousand dollar value contracts at least three quotes who must be sought or we might decide to run a public tender from between 250 and a million that 's a minimum of five quotes to be sought from capable businesses and million above it 's a public tender so again from 250 a Pike and silver on a public tender if that 's decided to be the best procurement route for that contractor so the tender or quite package that 's released to market or to the total respondents includes an invitation to tender you 've got a copy of that in front of you a specification or the project brief for what 's required the terms and conditions of contract when it comes to terms and conditions we generally use the Australian standards one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services we 've had bespoke terms and conditions drafted for us but for the rest we 've stuck with the Australian standards the market knows them the market likes them so rather than getting bespoke ones drafted for for those as well we 've decided to stick with Australian standards for the time being and of course the tender process terms is also included in that package now the tender process terms is essentially the rulebook for that process of the the tender or request for quote process now it 's a rule book not just for you and how we 're going to what you we 're going to hold you to during that tender process but it 's a rules for you to hold us to that process as well we don 't include them physically within the tender package we prefer to put them by link we find for some smaller businesses it can be a little bit overwhelming when the first document they see is this rulebook right on the front so it 's available by link for you to click on and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or quote response form exceptions okay so supply arrangements as we mentioned before they can be established by public tender or RFQ process now usually they in under the default contracting procedures a supplier arrangement can only be established by a public tender we 've included the opportunity now that we 've switched to strategic to create one via an RFQ process as well it 's yet to be done I can I can 't see it really being done too often it 'd be something for very low value engagements I would say if we 're going to conduct an RFQ rather than a public tender to create an arrangement now we do that to identify and prequalify suppliers who have the technical financial and managerial capability to perform what it is that we 're looking for the respondents are evaluated against the predetermined criteria and we may have a priced supplier arrangement or a non price supplier arrangement that depends on the goods and services that we 're setting it up for for instance if it 's something where rates can be allocated then we 'll allocate those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's got a price against it so we 'll simply be able to go to the arrangement I need these goods or services I 've got the rates I can see who 's offering the best price I 'll go to them first all the other criteria are evaluated prior as well all I need to do is ask them how they 're going to go about it and how much it 's going to cost as far as the ranked ones are I already know how much is going to cost because I 've got their rights I can still see quotes for larger bodies of work from ranked arrangements to get the supplies to sharpen their pencils a bit if it 's if it 's a large body of work but generally it 'd be a case of already know your rates here 's the job if it 's not if it 's not ranked if he doesn 't have prices against it again all the other criteria have been evaluated I can still choose to to reassess some of the criteria if it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safety credentials but generally if it 's not a ranked arrangement I 'll be asking you how much and how you gonna do it the methodology we 'll get into the rest of the criteria shortly when forming a contract via an arrangement the RFQ process is simplified as the suppliers have already been pre-qualified at the moment we have I think it 's 24 or 26 supply arrangements we don 't have supply arrangements for everything that council enters into contracts for here are some of them some of the non price ones for infrastructure and open space design services marketing and communication services dry hire that is the higher plant with without an operator trade and general maintenance regional planning services and as far as the price ones we 've got some went higher labor higher traffic control construction of concrete pathways and quarry material haulage that 's just a sample of what we 've we currently have established we usually sit in a supply arrangement up for I 'm gonna say an average of three to four years sometimes even two we have the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and two years on a few of the entities on that arrangement aren 't doing business anymore or there might be some some suppliers that aren 't performing particularly well another good reason to change it to refresh it is that the market itself has changed say it 's a ranked arrangement with prices attached to it and it was established at a time where the market was at its peak two years on if the markets changed and competition is a bit more fierce it 's in our interest to make sure that that 's refreshed now if we were to refresh it will go back out to to the market to see who else might be interested in coming on board if I 'm going to do that I need to afford those that are already on the arrangement the opportunity to reassess their pricing because of course they don 't want to be priced out they need the chance to meet the market and adjust their pricing as well once an arrangement has been established it will see out its term unless it 's not performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be can be great that can work really well but they don 't come without their problems if I if I put too many suppliers onto an arrangement and there 's always going to be someone that doesn 't get any work at all out of it is there always that chance if I put too a few on the arrangement then where we can find ourselves in trouble if those suppliers either are performing or aren 't responding to quotes you 'd be surprised the trouble that not just Council but the market goes to in establishing arrangement you know the respondents go to a lot of effort in preparing their submissions to make it onto an arrangement they get on there and then suddenly we 're asking them for quotes but they 're too busy with other work and they 're not responding so they 're taking up a place on that arrangement that others would would kill to to have as I said we don 't have arrangements for everything they cancel does and once we set it up it needs to see at its term unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions local by the Local Government Association of Queensland every every site has its own local government Association the LGA Q is Queensland 's one it has each one has a body such as ours being local buy or peak services where they set up arrangements apply arrangements for the use of all local governments and other government agencies for that matter so they set them up and it 's it 's in their interest it 's in local buys interest to ensure that there 's sufficient local representation of each local government on those panels otherwise we won 't be interested in using them so one of our rules internally if I have somebody preparing their procurement plan getting ready to go to market for something other last they 'll check is there a panel of our own for this for these goods or services no there isn 't is there a government panel or a local by panel for these services yes there is have you looked at that panel and is a sufficient local representation on it no there isn 't so if the answer is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it 's in our interest to make sure that our locals have a chance use of another local government contract or government agency governmental Arrangements like the whole of government panels sold or specialized supplies for a sole supplier the council officer submitting the application must satisfy the CEO that there is only one supplier who is reasonably available and for a supplier to be deemed as a specialized supplier that will be due to the specialized or confidential nature of the services sort making it impractical or disadvantageous to invite quotes or tenders next genuine emergency now genuine emergency is exactly that a genuine emergency having a supplier come an internal council officer come to me and saying look I 've got to get this work done it 's an emergency this is the supplier that can do the job and they can do it now can I engage them if the value is 50k now or fifty according to our thresholds that requires a competitive quick process doesn 't it there 's a supply on an arrangement no oh okay that makes it even harder because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thresholds what 's next okay though there is a genuine emergency provision what is the emergency you know we 've got a storm or is there a levee about to break or what 's what 's going on I 'm just going I 'm going to run out of time to deliver the project or I 've got some say comment funding that 's going to expire unless I enter into the contract now that 's not a genuine emergency not good enough run up quite process get it done auction purchase so some of these are borrowed from the default contracting procedures if you purchase something via all auction then that or secondhand goods for that matter then the thresholds don 't apply and then of course there 's the market led proposal guideline which is coming soon okay the criteria that we use price number one now we 've got capability and experience methodology for delivery in the country followed by contribution to local economy and then our social benefit engagement or indigenous engagement the other five criteria that we apply and will be established it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract now or to set up a panel for future use some councils disclose their weightings we 've chosen not to for the time being it 's a it 's a contentious issue we 've some believe we ought to well the reason we don 't is we 'd like suppliers to put their best foot forward across all criteria as opposed to favoring one over another and the criteria aren 't fixed for all procurements they 're decided on a case-by-case basis so for each contract that were entering into we 'll all sit and determine okay what 's most important what 's most important to us here and allocate those weightings accordingly across all five the one criteria that has had its weighting disclosed I believe by our mayor some time ago and we don 't dispute is the waiting for local contribution it 's rare that will deviate from 15 percent for local now that doesn 't mean on the local I get 15 percent you 're not local you don 't there 's a bit more to it than that the local preference in procurement guideline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a one quote process then we 'll only be approaching locals it 's rare that will they have the business area wishing to enter into the contract must come up with a very good reason for us to not for us to approach a non-local for something that 's valued under 25 there are provisions within the local preference in procurement guideline to deem a supplier local even if they 're not local so and we acknowledge in this day and age of globalization and and virtual businesses having bricks and mortar isn 't always necessary to get the job done so having having a business on the Sunshine Coast but we 're using we 're still using that as the as a benchmark to decide whether someone is and isn 't local to be deemed a local you have to demonstrate if your office isn 't based here you have to demonstrate that you have personnel that live within our region a significant portion of your business is conducted within the Sunshine Coast local government area as well and once you 're deemed the local you 're then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if somebody isn 't if a council officer isn 't following these thresholds for instance the next one for the three quit process of 25 to 250 at least two of those minimum of three must be locals for the 250 to a million again at least two must be local with that 15 percent weighting allocated to assess their their submission on what their contribution to the local community an economy is if someone wishes to enter into a contract with a non-local or can 't for whatever reason it that 's not in accordance with these guidelines then they must it 's not about seeking permission to they don 't seek permission they just have to demonstrate why they have to provide a good reason why they 're not going to follow this local preference in procurement guideline that gets forwarded to the manager of business development and also to the CEO and they 'll be talking with our economic development team so then so because we 've now identified a gap within the market on the Sunshine Coast and it 's in our interests and the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach non locals in that trade in that industry and say hey we don 't we clearly don 't have a good representation of what you do within our region come and set up shop if you 're a local supplier of those of that 15 percent that 's allocated the minimum you can earn is 10 say you leave and again this is also contentious but it 's a benchmark that we 're setting for assessing this so say you 're a local and you 're resting on your laurels a little bit in your submission thinking I 'm local I 'm going to get all those marks and you leave it blank entirely and you 'll see what the questions are later to assess what the contribution is that that local that left a blank submission in the local criteria will still get a minimum of 10 that 's a decent leg up then you can have a deemed local we 'll get a minimum of five even if they don 't put in anything however a deemed local can still earn the maximum of the full 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their contributions to our local economy and community and employment for that matter the maximum that can earn is 10 and of course if they leave a bank well then they getting zero next evaluating the office so this is a process well the panel is appointed we have a probity plan the probity plan outlines the obligations of all evaluation panel members that they 've signed up to if when when agreeing to be part of an evaluation panel it sets out the criteria and the waiting 's as well so the the panel is appointed prior to release into market or at the very least prior to closed of submissions the tenders closed submissions are in someone 's gone in and open the tender box the Sakura tender box downloaded the submissions check to see who signed the probity plan if they 've got a property plan that hasn 't been signed by all parties well they 're not getting those submissions once it 's all signed or release the submissions to all evaluation panel members and each one individually assesses each and every submission against each criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together at least we can do is put give you the jus effort in reviewing submissions we might shortlist and conduct interviews we don 't have to but there might be in our best interest to do so if there 's some clarifications required the panel meets to moderate the scores I 'll book you a book a meeting room not unlike this one get together and say okay for ABC proprietary limited and capability experience I gave them a score of 80 and these are my reasons why and someone else might pipe up and say well I 've been working with them for a while and I think they 're a really solid performer I 've given them 95 someone else and so actually I had a really bad experience with with site supervisor once and and that 's really and that 's who they 've nominated it for this job as well I 've given them sixty and so though they 'll not a doubt they 'll work through and come together with a moderated school for that criteria of that submission and then move on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done of every single submission so if the tenders closed and two three weeks later you still haven 't heard what the answer is now you know why a fair bit of time goes into these evaluations for to set up a panel it 's not uncommon for us to have 80 submissions it 's a fair bit of work to get through the panel comes to a decision as to which offer is the most advantageous to counsel the most advantageous offer may not be the lowest priced it 's not uncommon for us to accept an offer that wasn 't the cheapest remember price is only one of the five criteria we evaluate to determine the most advantageous offer to counsel we recommend that offer for award and the contract is awarded okay the tender or quote response form this is where it 's won or lost your job is to go through the submission go through the specification pardon me there and the project brief and tell us how it is it gonna deliver that job and tell us why you 're the best one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form don 't leave anything blank if you leave it blank well you can pretty much guarantee what the marks gonna be unless it 's that local criteria we talked about answer the scheduled questions respond to the criteria we ask you to please be succinct clear and precise putting us we put ourselves in your shoes regularly when making decisions on what we 're asking for and how we 're going to get the job done put yourself in our shoes when it comes to reviewing these submissions if you 're throwing into perf Lewis material that doesn 't clearly and directly respond and positively contribute to that criteria and it 's it 's a waste of time and if I 've got to look for a needle in a haystack to give you some points and I 've got eighty other submissions to get through and the one that 's clearly demonstrated where that needle lies is going to get the points feedback if you 'd like it we can provide it again we do ask me your patience we do make it clear to our council offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got the the project that you bid for and perhaps weren 't successful for isn 't the only job that they 're running they 've got many others on the go as well about providing feedback to those unsuccessful is in our best interests as much as it is in your best interest because we want to make sure that the market for those those interest industries is strong so if we 're not giving you feedback on how to better improve your submissions then we 're not strengthening the market so I do however ask you to be patient when it comes to waiting for that feedback to come it 'll be written feedback we have a template form the procurement specialist and the contract administrator will go through your submission against against that criteria and tell you how you went against each criteria we can give you feedback on your submission we 're not giving you feedback on your competitors submissions or how you were placed against them I 'm sure you wouldn 't be very pleased if we were telling your competitors about your submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your competitors submissions opportunities so as I mentioned previously the Sunshine Coast counsel tender alert service there 's a link there if you don 't want to copy that down you can always just google Sunshine Coast counsel tender alerts and you 'll get a copy of that link Sunshine Coast business gateway so there 's the ICN business gateway we 've had our own business gateway set up and that 's an opportunity for the principal contractor or contractors of larger projects to put their job up and for subcontractors to see what that is and engage with them it 's not uncommon actually another opportunity I 'll mention now I think it 's a good time to to mention say you 're in the business of providing goods and services that you know we require and you see a tender come up and you know that your goods and services would be required in that project however you 're not in a position to deliver that project as a whole you 're not going to put in a bid as a principal contractor sometimes it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little portion of work that that particular supplier wants to do for the larger project that 's a non-conforming bid I can 't do anything with that it 's rare that will undertake a tender process oh I shouldn 't say rare it does happen for us to project manage a job and engage all the contractors and acting as principal contractor ourselves usually will go to market for the principal who will then engage their subcontractors so if that 's you if you 're in the business of providing goods or services that are a part of the bigger picture and you see a tender come-up attend the information session because prospective principal respondents will be at that information session and that 's your chance just prove yourselves give them your business cards and engage with them and be part of that bid that bow be submitting it 's a great opportunity local buy arrangements we talked about them before website local by net are you queensland government tender alert service again that 's who we mentioned previously that we use the tender box off by subscribing to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up you 'll hear about our project from us and you 'll hear about our project from them as well you 'll also hear about projects from other local governments and other state governments from cue tenders and despite the double-up that you 're hearing about our projects you 'd be surprised how many people still miss opportunities that are directly relevant to them and it kills me when that occurs especially if it 's for the establishment of an arrangement that 's going to last for four years whenever I get approached by a business to say hi I 'm this is who I am and this is what I do and I 'm local and do you have an arrangement for these goods and services if I look into that for them and find that yes we do have an arrangement and it was established two months ago see you in four years that 's that 's tough so if you 're subscribed to these and you go through those notifications then you won 't miss out on an opportunity and finally the council 's local business support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with council offices that seek the the kind of work that you do you 've already got a leg up there and you 're already known to them and you 'll be in the forefront of their minds when it comes to conducting a request for quote process if you 're not known by them as I mentioned before it 's in your best interest to be learned by them the best way to do so is by contacting business development at Sunshine Coast Queensland grabbed a you and one of our business development facilitators well we 'll work with you and putting you in touch with the right business areas isn 't all they do they do a hell of a lot more than that into making sure that you are business ready to do work with us thanks for watching I hope you found that to be a value any further queries please direct them to tender inquiries at Sunshine Coast QLD are you all the best in doing business with Council"

    "text": "hi everyone so yeah I want to talk about the future of healthy water and I 'm talking about water in the environment not bottled water there are a range of reasons why water can become unhealthy through nutrient pollution and that can be through still want to run off off the streets where it picks up pollution and nitrogen from our day-to-day living such as cleaning cars and the things that we do but also as well as fertilizer use and a range of other industrial processes all that adds small amounts of nutrient and they collectively gather in the water and so we have different systems such as wetlands riverbank remediation and most manage stormwater on the way to the rivers the fact is we still have these issues there are still areas that are full of clogging weed we still have blue-green algal blooms and fish kills as we 've seen in the murray-darling quite recently so all of these issues are driven by algae growing in the wrong way and causing problems for us so our belief is that the best and easiest way to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is a biological problem the back of this picture is of some microscopic pictures of diatoms cells and diatoms are a type of algae that will grow and we that 's what we 're going to encourage and the reason we want to encourage this type of algae and not other types of algae is because they 're at the bottom of the food chain so diatoms appear pretty much everywhere from a river stream at the top of the mountain all the way down those rivers ponds lakes dams lagoons and all the way out to sea and there are a lot actually a lot more diatoms growing in the sea than there are in freshwater so our system is called diatomics and as you can see there from that food chain diatoms will grow and then something will eat them and then something eats them all the way through and it 's not just limited to fish there are insect larvae Turtles eels birds all of these things so basically we 're trying to turn nutrient pollution into animals that we all like to see in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that in that requirement just like we you know need iron in our diet and vitamin C and all these very very small amounts of certain things diatomics adds the things that are missing the vast amount of nitrogen and phosphorus that 's in the water and that 's how we solve the problem for them and diatomics is only available biologically to diatoms so blue-green algae look at it and don 't care not interested they won 't get the benefit of that boost so just to take you through some examples of what we 've done this is it down at Logan and a wastewater treatment plant there was three million selves of blue-green algae per mil in that side and the year in a bit later it 's looking much healthier it also looked like that after six weeks so we have it 's a very quick turnaround for us this is in a council pond where they had massive problems with filamentous algae they cleaned it all out as they were doing very regularly and within three weeks it 's going back once we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and one of the things with with weed removal is sites look bad when they say right get the weed removal in and then you rip you ripple that out the water looks rubbish for ages and then for a short period of time it 's okay whilst that 's coming back and then it starts looking rubbish until the point where you go we have to get them back with our system it just gets better and better and better and you don 't need that don 't have that problem this is a unity water wetland site where they were getting a lot of floating Azolla over on the top there as well as filamentous algae and after a hundred days the waters much clearer looking much healthier and that doesn 't matter whether we 're talking this sort of site or even the waterway that goes through Sunshine Plaza where it looks usually pretty green and nasty there are fish in there and if you could clear up that water and reduce increase the clarity the whole system looks more attractive and so wherever you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look better and in that way you 've enhanced the aesthetic value so there 's many many wins on that sort of a system and this is part of a video part of that wetland system I put the underwater camera in we 're we 're not treating it and we 're we are treating it and you can see there are a lot of dissolved oxygen and that 's why I say we 're limiting the will potentially we 're totally removing the number of fish kills because there 's so much oxygen produced and also the water clarity is improved then there are a lot more animals and things zooming around inside there yes so we 're decided over here so if you want to talk about what what the options are and how we manage the water we 'll be more than happy to talk to you thank you [Applause]"

    "text": "hello world is Lee Kelson coming to you from Mountain Creek Creek State High School and I 'm here with gray and Breen welcome Graeme thanks very much Lee so Graham just for our viewers out there give us a little bit of your backstory and how you arrived here at Mountain Creek High School yeah sure I had a at a production company in Alice Springs for a number of years and left there to come over the East Coast thought I 'd get back into teaching until I got the business up and going and get and found I liked it so much so I quit the business and and doing this full-time I really enjoy following on from that I bought all those skill sets that we were talking about with in relation to business that I 'd learnt in business and I 'm tried to bring them into the into the school environment to give kids some real-world experience so let 's just touch on Alice Springs for a little bit that 's an interesting place to live I lived in Cannon era in the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started my music management business and touring business up there way back in the 80s so tell us a little bit about Alice so in the 1990s it would have been early 2000s had a production company called red Beck productions we did a lot of work for with all the tourist Commission up there and local businesses a lot of people that fly into town for particular activities the the Remax balloon activity there a while ago I remember was that were involved in that those sorts of one-off activities and just responding to what clients are after and all of those skill sets we bring into high school like problem-solving etcetera just lends itself to that sort of work it 's great right yeah and so here you doing some amazing stuff around entrepreneurship in the Entrepreneurship program so tell us a little bit about that so the history to it is in 2013 when the digital technologies curriculum the new course the Australian Curriculum course was proposed we identified that we wanted to obscure with the lorentz and primary school teachers so here in the high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that we provided about a thousand seats of training for teachers and on the other side of the coin we wanted to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate what they could do with these new digital technology skills which to require overtime did a bit of research and found that Lean Startup and the Startup Weekend program specifically lends itself to to that sort of model so I attended the first adult Startup Weekend out at the Innovation Centre loved the model of the idea and it was short and sharp and to the point covered all the theory and have started introducing that here at school we positioned we decided we also wanted to promote it to the wider community so we were involved in felt as a founding member in the mayor 's Telstra Technology Award we are a couple of teachers here started up the Startup Weekend for youth weekends with and now we 're bringing it into the classrooms now that the our knowledge is matured and the environments matured so we 've got a but a few places where we have it positioned already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term in the year and the year 10 digital technologies cost a term fall we do it at the end of each of our semester length courses in years 7 8 and we also have a STEM Academy we run here runs for a semester each of the each year it 's across 7 8 9 and the second term is allocated entirely to Lean Startup which is the application of all that stem knowledge the students have developed and and further developed in the academy to real-world problems and it 's interesting because I of parents and a lot of people in in my travels but one of them the questions I get asked all the time is what 's all this gold rush about innovation and entrepreneurship bring it what 's it all about yeah great so motivation for us always has been with there 's enough commentators are saying now that all the jobs are changing in nature to a greater or lesser extent numbers of 40% of current jobs will disappear those sorts of figures are being touted so we need to equip our students with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills modelling when I went to school they 're more around what we call 21st century skills so problem-solving creative thinking collaboration all those sorts of skills and I have a lot of meetings with employers now and they all say we can train him in the in the other schools that we want them to have we just want them to having those skills so it 's consistent with what people are after it 's working really well well there are three top skills here at beat city that we love talking about is creative thinking problem-solving and critical thinking critical thinking and another one yeah yeah and and I should say this doesn 't need to be outside the Australian Curriculum as well the Australian Curriculum good for these sorts of skills just needs to mature over time and I think that will be spread throughout all schools it 's just it 's only been implemented in a few years well it doesn 't get rolled out for digital technologies till 2020 so it 's still in its infancy but I think come in time schools will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where where that some going to be taught those skills but at the moment we 're with trialing it with their Lean Startup Academy stem Academy and so you I mean I love obviously a lot of other schools are taking on entrepreneurship grams and we were just did a program last week at Somerset College on the Gold Coast they do a great couple of days and I know a V Patterson on the Gold Coast so there 's a number of schools that are doing it but it 's still very much his trial blazing stuff isn 't it it is it is it is to the extent that there 's possibly not a lot of awareness around exactly what 's involved and how it can be implemented I think from my experience with people I 've spoken to teachers I 've spoken to tends to be the ones who maybe have had some exposure to business previously who can see the the way forward other other teachers are keen just unsure about how to how to progress and we speak to a lot of schools because all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that pathway forward yeah and so from your perspective that take up with with the students and the the you know response from the students is it positive that 's really positive we 've heard um we 've had strange all the way through grades seven eight nine since we 've launched it only a year two years ago now and it looks like we 'll have multiple years seven classes next year so I 've seen what it 's widening its scope I think as well as some take-up of entrepreneurship generally we worked with them all of our TAFE down here to introduce a cert three a night but with an entrepreneurship focus and that 's seems really really popular because that 's the that 's the trouble with the years 11 and 12 causes is this they 're so full they 're very very busy those students so to be able to provide a vet qualification or cert 3 is the next step in getting entrepreneurship out there and getting those skill sets we just talked about King knows that there yeah fantastic well it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up the good work thanks for having a chat with us today and I 'm sure we 'll be hearing more from you in the future thanks Lou thank you Tom Thanks"

    "text": "and hello world as Li Kelson coming to you on behalf of invest Sunshine Coast and I 'm here in downtown sunny mooloolaba and I 'm with Chad Kerry of Chima adventures how H ed good man how are you I 'm very well so Chad just before we get in and talk about Qi mo can you just give the audience a little bit of background on your story yes I guess business part of mine Greg and myself start up the business about 14 years ago we started really trying to sell tours to Peru that was sort of our idea when we started off but arranged from there we went all over South America you know we actually started selling we really started as very much a digital business we sold most of our tours originally to the UK and then as we went we built up a market here in Australia but it was really about to spend a nice tour operator to South America that go into Antarctica and tell who 's actually our biggest part of our business yeah you know and and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know so selling around the world all to the Latin America and Antarctica so I want to talk to about Antarctica song cane I 'm gonna go but so what 's your what 's your sort of previous life before chimú before Jimmy I was a civil engineer and I worked in Australia but in the UK as well and that 's really we came up with the idea and I enjoyed civil inching I liked the technical challenge of it but I just found that I got bogged down in the I guess a bureaucracy of it all and things like that so I wanted to start up my own business I was traveling a lot as it was through Europe and I really wanted to go to Latin America so I sort of saw it as a project to travel there for six months learning about the place to a business plan just to start up this new business and that 's essentially how it worked and so what was what 's like the the the natio or the opportunity that you saw when when you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sort of get a bit technical here on the travel industry but I guess in the travel industry this two ways people can travel to mind my said you know it 's overland to us and forgetting crews and things that you can go as a group to her which means so you 're on a set bar set itinerary with it could be 15 20 30 people or whatever all there is what we call them the industry fi t which is really tailor made bespoke travel which is what we do and what I saw in Latin America Latin America is one of those areas that people just did a little bit scared of and you ever had that option of doing group shuffle which is reasonably affordable but recently fixed what was fixed you had to follow the itinerary or he could do that tailor-made option but it was mostly restricted to Firestar and where and where we I guess changed the dynamic there as we said well we want to do flexible itineraries that available from everyone three three to five star and and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were we where we really made one of their biggest impacts was going into Antarctica because a lot of the travel operators at the time would just sell him one or two ships and that would be their product what we did with the Antarctica is we really became the world 's first aggregator for Antarctica and that we saw just about all the ships that travel into Antarctica so our point of difference was look we can give you the pros and cons of all the different ships and and help you make an informed decision because it 's a lot of money to travel to Antarctica so you don 't want us you don 't want to be just pushing one ship and tell you this is great for everyone because it 's not you know different ships different people so that 's where we 've I guess mainly our biggest impact you and in terms of adventure travel I mean what do you collect what do we classify as adventure travel yeah well that 's a good question and an adventure I guess is a broad term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been very active you know bungee jumping things like that that 's not what our travel is most of our clients are over 50 50 to really 65 but for us I guess South America as a destination is the adventure because it 's an adventure adventure sort of place to go you 've got to be pretty open-minded and things like that so yeah I mean for us it 's it 's more adventure continent I think is the way we look at it yeah and so is it a is it a sort of an online business or you know is that a digital style business is that how you started or was that the idea yeah well I guess we were originally very digital focus but now I guess with sort of the clicks and mortar type a business now where we have actually you know come full circle but a lot of businesses in travel have started with that that old old-school distribution model of going through travel agents and things like that and then they 've tried to go digital but a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand focused digitally to start with and it 's our direct business is still more than 50% of our business but we then we 've got so many travel agents wanting to book our trips so we 're now have you know very strong distribution network as well through travel agents and things like that as well so we have broad distribution mix so you mentioned you 've been going for 14 years I imagine in that 14 years well it 's that takes back to 2004 sort of the early 2000s you know sort of the advent of the consumer web and and everything 's starting to move online there 's been a real transition over the period you 've been in business and we hear a lot about the traveling to the traditional travel entities being under pressure margins are under pressure people wring the travel age and get all the info then go and shop it online so can you talk about your experience in that and how you manage that transition yeah I think I mean I think that was the that sort of advent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't it wasn 't started when but it was really starting to take off in 2004 and that was our opportunity because there were all these well-established businesses that had these distribution channels we didn 't have any of that so things like Google AdWords just cost per click advertising which is where no one was on that in 2004 in the travel industry so we jumped on it straight away just started only generating revenue and obviously from what could be done then to now exchange a huge amount but it really give it gave us that that kickstart I guess and so in terms of doing business here in Mooloolaba and on the Sunshine Coast I mean there 's amazing stuff happening in terms of infrastructure and the submarine cable coming through do you see that number one being an impact and how have you found working and operating out of the region oh I mean for us it 's it 's it 's magic as this travel operators like us there 's one or two small ones but really nothing here on the Sunshine Coast and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office in Sydney for example in the Contra and I can see the contrast between run a new business here in Sydney quite easily and what I love about the Sunshine Coast is there 's such a great pool of talent here of people you know at least for the sort of roles that we 're looking for there 's travel to South America you know tertiary education who just can 't find roles because at the moment there isn 't that sort of groundswell of business is above the SME you know standard sort of businesses here that they sort of larger corporates so for us we get you know really well-educated staff without paying them like what would lessen what we would pay in Sydney and they stick around for a long time you know we have some great retention so that probably is the biggest thing but just a lower-cost place generally you know and as you say with a submarine cable and things like coming without coming in that the digital space is so important to us so the faster the better for us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some recent talk from from a federal government perspective about the cities being overcrowded and trying to push people into the regions but a lot of people I talk to tend to have concerns about going into regions I think they think they 're going to be isolated or whatever I mean what would your world your sort of view on that be yeah and I you know I think that 's a fair point to some extent I mean I don 't want to go to weeper for example upset everyone from weeping here but you know there are there are different places where I wouldn 't want to go to but I mean I find the Sunshine Coast you really do get a lot of the benefits you have at an urban centre and I 've lived in London and Sydney and all these places but you 've obviously got a lot more affordability and that 's the other great thing with our staff is on the wages that they get here they can live a great lifestyle where as compared to Sydney it 's a pretty tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show or something like that I mean Brisbane is just down the road it 's an hour 's drive if you 're living in Tokyo or London or New York everything 's an hour 's drive anyway so what 's the difference right so I think you sort of get the best of both worlds here yeah and I think most people commute an hour in Melbourne and Sydney anyway both ways you know so there 's the travel thing so listen my wife and I have been a passionate travelers and with South America is one of those places that 's been on our radar but there 's just a little bit of nervousness about it you know because as you say it 's it 's a little bit of a wild frontier what would you say to somebody that is looking to travel to South America it 's sort of appease their concern well I mean I think that 's the thing is sometimes South America scene is quite dangerous and and I can tell you I mean Venezuela is a bit volatile at the moment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brazil which you might have seen during the Olympics that are a little bit dicey but the rest of South America I would walk around at night anytime it 's generally pretty safe I think the biggest challenge there is just a language barrier there 's not a lot of people that speak English and just going around in South America without Spanish or in Brazil Portuguese is a struggle so I don 't think it 's it 's a safety issue it 's just a more you know having somebody like us to to make sure everything goes smoothly is quite important but I can tell you I mean you know if people have a look at our website some of the properties there the hotels in South America I tell you a better standard of what we have here in Australia I mean I love Australia love travelling around Australia but some of some of the properties we have in Australia are a little bit tired when you see over in South America some of the standards they have over there it 's pretty much mind-blowing yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there yourself so what 's that experience like and you know how do you go back traveling there what 's what 's the main thing that you need to be aware of yes so I mean so you know we operate our own trips down there and I think it 's the thing about Antarctica is it 's I think it 's the last place on earth where you can really go still go on a proper expedition you know everywhere else in the world travel is almost a commodity you know even if you 're in Africa and South America tour in a certain extent you go see the sights and it 's on a bus and it 's reasonably controlled and tarukas not like that it 's almost like going to say the moon it 's an uncontrolled environment there 's no infrastructure there the weather is changeable and and that adds to the excitement because when you set off on that ship you don 't know there 's a rough itinerary you don 't know where you 're going to go because of weather could change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different variables so you do the itinerary is completely dynamic changing literally by the hour and that 's and you do feel like you 're on expedition and I 'm side from that it 's just that pristine environment it was really the last pristine environment less left on earth and the amount of wildlife down there is staggering I mean been on trips where you go ashore and the rule is you 're not meant to get within five meters of the animals but I 've been ashore on beaches where there 's just no way you could land if that was if you applied that rule because there are so many animals you 're literally having to move them out of the way to get ashore you know I mean and and you can 't have that experience king penguins you know which are which a reasonable-sized sort of penguins been on beaches in South Georgia which is one of the sub-antarctic islands and there 's half a million king penguins there you know this is this is the stuff you see on the on those documentaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free money interested in adventure travel chimo is the place and chad and your team here obviously the people to speak to so it was it chimú comm chair adventures calm yeah Adventures calm and I have to talk to you about an Tatia thanks very cute oh geez"

blockchain developers and we were just talking in take one and off-camera about blockchain and cryptocurrencies and how they are sort of inextricably linked correct but blockchain has much farah application than just cryptocurrency right correct I think of blockchain and cryptocurrency is kind of the left hand and the right hand side of a interesting set of technology solutions so you could think of it as a database that you can 't edit the information so it kind of becomes truthful data and then on the other side it 's truthful transactions of money so that 's the cryptocurrency side we 're kind of in the middle we use the cryptocurrency to do international payments and we use the blockchain side side to make sure your health data is absolutely secure not secured but is validated so that every day we know what our health status is yeah and so you 're just telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get run through that for us right so we our blockchain developers is not that we develop block chains but what we do is we take the existing technologies like file security around healthcare or IP communication financial transactions and see where blockchain can solve some of the problems we 've had in the past there 's one of the most well known problems solved by blockchain is what 's called the double spend problem I can give you ten dollars but I can 't accidentally give someone else ten dollars I can electronically fake my money blockchain solves that problem for cryptocurrency so you and I know that if I got a value transfer between us that I didn 't go behind your back and it 's also paid for that service with the same amount of money so because you can validate data on the blockchain things like voting becomes more real and accurate your health records become much more real and accessible your the amount of money you 're storing in your bank account is actually your money and not the banks and I detect it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was I 'll see if I can do them all I was born in Canada and then I moved to Tennessee then I lived in California for a little while and now I 'm in Queensland I can 't do it although Steve Irwin was a huge hero of mine I could never be as Queensland as he was he was definitely Queensland and so living on the Sunshine Coast how did you end up on the Sunshine Coast oh boy 27 years ago I was in love with this girl and I didn 't ask her to marry me she ended up got divorced she ended up getting divorced and she found me on Facebook and the the conversation went from she 's saying hey do you remember me to me answering I 'm still in love with you where are you I 'll come right now she and I thought I could get in the car and drive there and then she said she was in Australia and I found there were no roads so it took me a year and a half to sell my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just came here sight unseen I 've been here ever since and how have you found setting up your business and and operating as an entrepreneur on the Sunshine Coast well the first I came in 2010 and from 2010 until I found the Innovation Centre in 2014 I found it very difficult there was not a ecosystem like there was in California for technology and kind of a brotherhood around technology but when I found this place completely accidentally I immediately found that kinship I enrolled and within a month we were in the Innovation Centre and started developing our secure file platform for medicine but we were missing a component the indelible ti and the truthfulness of those records by sending the information to all these different hospitals you lose control of it personally so we when we found blockchain found a easy way to articulate bringing the data to the user so that the user could Trant because I lived all around the world my health records are all over the place if I had this tool I know my surgery 's from Canada Tennessee California etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your primary care physician so much more clear yep they 're not going they 're not looking and going oh fifty year old male knee problems okay I 'm gonna give them XYZ pill they are actually looking at your information and treating you as the primary source of information and how are you are you mainly doing work here in Australia are you exporting well we found the regulations around certain privacy laws and certain ownership of data problematic in Australia and in a number of Juris number of jurisdictions around the world so what we did is we launched our legal entity in Dubai because self sovereignty is part of their culture so your money in the bank is actually your money not the bank 's money we 're here it 's the bank 's money and you have access to it same thing with your health records the government and the hospitals on your health records even though legally you should be able to get a copy whenever you want and Dubai data is yours money is yours so we launched that a Dubai because it meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for and so are you pitching today oh yeah i-i 've actually pitched here many times before I 've won one of the pitches here blockchain now three years later is kind of an easy topic to have much more easy when I won and so we were avoiding the the blockchain topics back then but this week coming up we 're doing crypto coast convention noosa at the Pridgen digital hub and here at the innovation center we 're gonna have a three day event around blockchain so it 's gonna be great for me because we 'll be able to do some really deep dives into some cool to be hanging out with blockchain dudes yeah boxing geek so that 's what we call ourselves exactly I should say geeks and gals we have a very large contingent of female entrepreneurs that have developed a very substantial Network here in Brisbane Sydney and Melbourne called women and blockchain and it 's pretty amazing but doesn 't gates cover everyone anyway no geeks does but now that we have a new entrepreneur in residence Leeanne camp she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great that we 're able to go to the entrepreneur in residence and actually talk blockchain which I couldn 't do with the last two gentlemen that were in that role yep okay so if people want to find out more about you where can they find information about your company succour comm is our website and then the D Health Network dot IO or the u s-- at USA t io websites will get they all kind of intermix because we 're all one consortium okay oh thanks Ivan thank you so much thanks for talking with this yeah we 'll be coming back with more from the Innovation Center here on the Sunshine Coast"

    "text": "good morning everybody has everybody going out there okay yep a few nods it 's a beautiful morning this morning so on behalf of mere mark Jamison and sunshine coach council I 'd like to welcome you along this morning and look forward to seeing how the rest of the morning pans out if I could just do a few acknowledgments I 'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we live in today the the Sunshine Coast local government area and they are the kabhi kabhi people of the northern hinterland and coastal plains and the Jinna borough people of the southern plains and I 'd like to pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging I 'd also like to acknowledge Paul Scullin here and a manager of business development Chris Sturges the boss of project delivery and and the rest of the council staff and of course you you here today before I get started I just like to maybe just get a show of hands if I may of those small businesses or local businesses who have been to supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands where I can poll 50% there and the next leading question I have for you is color just have a show of hands of those businesses that have heard of or at least an awareness of the Sunshine Coast regional economic development strategy maybe even a little bit more which is terrific I 'd like to maybe just acknowledge all of you here today the local businesses because as we know here on the Sunshine Coast you 're the the engine room of the economy and as the portfolio councillor for economic development it 's really important for me to do what what I can and what counsel to ensure that our economy continues to prosper and drive forward so the regional economic development strategy and I 'll just go into that very briefly is a 20-year blueprint or or a road map if you like of how we can continue to drive the Sunshine Coast economy and for those of you who 've been on the Sunshine Coast for many years of which which I have you might remember that our economy was quite narrow relied on tourism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite subject to the the peaks and troughs of the region and so you 'd certainly get you know times when it was just really tough going and I was the regional manager of Master Builders back in the day and I certainly had many many builders and subbies and whatever who just couldn 't find work here on the Sunshine Coast and so that economic development strategy that we said about putting together isn 't just a council document it 's a document for the region it was put together by Council by the business community University everybody put their minds to how we can broaden the economy which is which is what it 's all about and it just made sense to us and this is in the strategy of playing to our strengths and if you have a think about it our strengths were pretty simple to look at or to understand and so you know we had a university here we have great tapes we 've got some great educational institutions and so in those high-value industries which we talked about it made sense that education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner obviously with the two billion dollar hospital and the health precinct and allied health professionals that go beyond that it makes sense that health and well-being would be one of those sectors and so as we sort of put the pieces of the jigsaw together you 'll see that in those sectors there has been some significant projects that are helping drive the economy forward and hopefully giving new people in the local business sector opportunities in that space and more recently you 've seen hopefully you 've seen if you 've driven up north the progress of the the new runway project and again aviation and aerospace is one of those sick that will broaden that economy and give you opportunities if you have a think about what 's been happening on the Sunshine Coast then over the last five years we started off when we did that strategy with a thirteen billion dollar economy and we are now sitting at 17 point two billion dollars so anybody who 's been in the business over the last few years might get an understanding of why there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know grabbing those opportunities or whatever but it 's certainly those opportunities are there and if you ever think about those projects that I 've talked about the new CVD the subsea Cabell Oceanside just across the way you will continue to see growth and development in this region and in those sectors that I talked about so that 's good news for everybody from our point of view and that 's why we 're here today to encourage you to have a look at what councils doing but to also understand the broader context that this is a 20-year journey we 're in year five of the 20-year journey you 're going to hear lots more about new projects as they come to fruition we 're already working on the new City Hall project and you know and there 's many more even in my little local town of Bly Bly there is 20 odd million dollars worth of projects being developed in the main street as we speak today so I hope that you 're all sort of encouraged and and want to embark on on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging that is but hopefully you get a sense an appreciation that you know the plan we 're hearing strictly to the plan there are lots of opportunities for you and I 'm sure that many of you will take those opportunities in the coming years one final thing I 'd like to say is just a little bit of a you 'll see on your you 'll see on your chairs that particular brochure there about the the upcoming game between the Rabbitohs and warriors for those of you who may know that up until this year we 've only ever had trial in RL games here at the Sunshine Coast Stadium which has been fantastic and you know we 've got you know great attendances at that game but this is a game that is worth points and so the Sydney Rabbitohs are here for a three-year contract they 're going to come here every year over the next three years and so with that opportunity comes corporate opportunities and so if you just have a look at that brochure it may be something that you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you because naturally the more opportunities it creates then the more for you so have a great day today make sure you ask heaps of questions I 'm sure you 're going to learn a lot from their various presenters and you 've certainly got expert council staff around you and make sure that you leave today with no question unanswered and all the best for your businesses in 2019 I reckon it 's going to be a cracker over the year and hopefully you 'll part of it Cheers Thank You councillor Robinson we will move on now we have a bit of a journey to go on one of the things that council holds most dear is its health and safety position the way that it works with and for its employees to be helped healthy and safe but also in engaging with contractors and the work that we ask and expect of them in terms of safety when the delivering the projects that they 've been in debt yeah engaged to deliver we 're going to have a slight change of names for the delivery I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our work health and safety team he 's going to give take you on a quick brief of what we would like and what we would like to partner with you in delivering in the course of delivering some of our projects when it comes to safety thanks very much fun thanks for well good morning everyone I 've been asked to talk about workplace inspections and I 'm going to go through a number of points in respect of that won 't be a very long presentation but hopefully it 's informative for you what our workplace inspections they 're an opportunity to consult with our contractors on safety matters at the coalface and they 're also a legislative requirement you can 't even have inspectors from work work safer Queensland come in and inspect your sites so they are a reality and there 's something which we encourage not only internally but among our contractors who carries them out Sunshine Coast workers project managers inspectors within within Council Sunshine Coast management and we also encourage contractors to do their own inspections of of their own sites the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inspection is what has been called for when submissions are made for for tenders from contractors we ask for real we try to ask for real live examples of such documents as traffic management plans construction project plans Safe Work method statements risk assessments etc and and when the the actual inspection occurs we we look at it from that perspective it 's it 's the old adage you say what you 're going to do and then you do what you say it 's it 's it 's a common thing within quality management as well as safety and environmental so what would you expect as part of a workplace inspection every inspection is unique based upon its scope they can be a a small scope and you can look at a particular item or you can be very wide and cover the whole the whole site it 's always conducted with the contractors representative where possible and we believe that is a key thing because the cooperation between Council and contractors on an ongoing basis for the success of safety on sites is vital the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are persons in control of a business unit and we both we both PCB use so working together for the safety of all people the Sunshine Coast personnel will report to the person in control of the site so B there 'll be no surprises they 'll expect an induction the site and and be told about the risks that are present within the site and as I say it 's it 's consultative and proactive we we look at it as as a as a partnership sure there be areas for improvement and and and they will be nominated as the inspection goes through so what items will be looked for Safe Work method statements are a vital document this is the the way that we show the staff and the workers the safest way that we believe as an organization they should work and we encourage the workers to be part of that as well a big part because they have a lot of valuable ideas on what is the safest way to work and we amend the Safe Work method statements constantly so there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Docs qualifications of operators VOCs which verifications of competency to see that they 've had their required training and they 're required they 've been proved competent we look at plant and equipment the the condition of it the way it 's maintained etc and we look at controls nominated in the Safe Work method statements to see if they are effective and are in place resourcing levels are also important so the mechanism we use at Council is a system called sinter light it has a contractor 's sight observation module within it and within that module there are a series of questions that are linked to the the latest legislation within Queensland to ensure that we cover all bases and and they have they have a selection of options and those options are compliant non-compliant needs improvement and we 'll discuss that through with with the person that is involved in the inspections so yeah it 's a um it 's an important part both internally within such our Coast Council but within the work that our staff do with contractors on a day-to-day basis in a in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much for your time [Applause] next I 'll ask for Chris he 's the Christo jizz he 's the manager of project delivery to come up we 'll move in now to a series of presenters who will be outlining the projects that we intend releasing to the market and will need some assistance in delivering for the remainder of this one enter you morning all has Paul said my name 's Christo Jess I 'm a manager project delivery at Sunshine Coast Council doesn 't seem long ago we 're here doing the same or a similar presentation another 12 months on and I think as councillor Robinson said a busy year ahead for project delivery and council so we 've got a few pictures of some of the most recent projects up there on the screen the likes of the glasshouse district park upgrade Burke Street access into Calandra and then new Mooloolaba walk and ride bridge I think you know what that shows is a range of projects delivered on the Sunshine Coast using contractors and council staff which also acts as act accesses contractors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very keen to continue to build relationships with both the consultants and contractors to deliver these vital projects for the coast today is an opportunity for us to talk to you about some of those projects coming to market in the coming months and explain in a bit of detail and I know Paul will go through it further as well about how you might secure work with the Sunshine Coast Council I 'll also talk briefly about our safety improvement journey Martin 's giving you a little bit of a flavor of perhaps some of the more technical aspects of inspections but we certainly have been on a bit of a journey in terms of safety improvement over the last 12 months and anyone who 's worked with my project delivery staff in a contract sense will probably have felt that through those types of audits and whatnot that Martin talked about before so in terms of the 2018-19 capital program the core capital program which is on the left there is made up of a range of different program areas that 's how it 's budgeted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty three four million dollar mark there are other projects like the airport which is significant that takes it up to about three hundred and eighty all up my team doesn 't get involved with the full gamut there are projects outside of project deliveries remit and some of those providers that he will counsel staff a here today to talk to you about things like our annual reseal and rehabilitation program for example of that 180 the project delivery team of which there 's three teams the civil team the urban projects team and the recreation projects team deliver around about a hundred and five million dollars worth of that program so the pie chart there really just shows the I guess the different pieces of the puzzle from Transport to buildings and facilities parks and gardens stormwater and alike so that 's generally how it split up probably important to note that at this point of the year we are now getting to the I guess the point where we 're looking forward to next year 's program the 1920 program so for those of you who kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much get to sort of November December and we 're already starting to work on the next year 's capital program development and that really is a Vermonter to go to council and around about the March timeframe so the last quarter of each financial year we can begin to look ahead at what 's coming down down the pipeline for the next financial year so well I 'll probably talk about projects today that are more of the 1819 projects it 'll be important for those who are perhaps trying to shape their year to talk to us about what will be coming up in any capital program a lot of our more significant projects are funded across a couple of years so they may be starting this year some work commencing you know in that may timeframe and then flowing into the next financial year okay so just to give you a flavor of where the volume of work is I think there 's probably always a question mark about where most of the work hits the market over the last couple of presentations I 've tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders we put out effectively contracts if you like across the board the chart on the left hand side is purchase orders by number and we 've got to financially is there one being a seventeen eighteen which is the previous one in orange and one being this current year which is the blue bar so on the far left you can see that by far the volume of orders that we put out to contract below 250,000 so there 's a lot of I guess smaller work there for people on the coast small business contractors and consultants who may be in that smaller end of the market there 's there 's a lot of volume in there if you move over to the left side that 's purchase orders by dollar value and again between that it starts with the below 250 range on the left and moves through to 250 to a million and in over a million so we 've generally been finding that there 's as much value in that in the below 250 as those bigger contracts less in numbers but about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back maybe this is the same civil projects team not quite and Ben McGovern leads up the civil projects team for council so few of the project projects that will be out in the market in the next probably month or two starting at the top we 've got torille drive upgrades around that sippy Downs area so we 've done some work by contract last financial year so we 've got another package coming to market which is further stormwater and drainage works upgrades at Oriole Drive we 've got a road widening job at bundlers Boulevard at Mountain Creek coming through and you 'll see that 's the type of thing where we 'll be out in quarter four which is that you know May June period and into next financial year which is the quarter one construction for that type of project but River Road bridge some work there between increased load capacity by the sounds of that and we 've packaged up a couple of gross pollutant traps GP tees water quality improvement devices in in both calendar and Mirchi door that are about to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant work there in terms of drainage upgrades in the recreation project space Peter Osborne who 's here today and by all means come and talk to Peter after the presentations he 's got a range of jobs coming out over the next short period at the top we 've got some drained carpark pathway work at point Perry so there 's some civil works in that one I showed you earlier the glasshouse mountains district park which is one of our larger parks it 's got more stages for delivery so there 's another million-dollar contract going to go out for the glasshouse mountains park we 've got some amenities at both Colin Dale and multiple gonna hit the market so that 's up at Russell family park where we 've been doing works over the past year as well with a new car park upgrade we 've got some work at the Dickey Beach Holiday Park so new holiday Park sites there and ongoing work at the Meriden Sports Complex so again we 've been building some new ovals out there by contract over the last sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another 1.2 million dollar spend out of Meriden where we move into the change room and amenities in the urban projects space we have matt de gand heading up that so that team generally handles most of our waste projects so you can see there 's some fairly big numbers coming through over the next 12 months two years in that waste delivery space so the nimble resource recovery centered around that sort of 10 million ish mark for a design tender and a construction 10 is a pretty big one that 's it 's ready to hit the market at the moment another holiday Park which is the Mooloolaba Hollywood holiday Park will go out very shortly and that 's a real I suppose full redevelopment of the Malabar caravan park down dere sea life there in Malabar so we 'll have some tight timeframes around that so we can hopefully get that one open for Christmas and back in business we 've got the bud room resource Recovery Center so another waste project there similar to the top one changes at the BU our Aquatic Center so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work there more aquatic center work across multiple sites so we 've got a number of aquatic centers that we 're looking to do maintenance and renewal work and a bio Basin in the bud room landfill site so to treat water so quite a range there as well all coming to market very shortly so I guess just to reiterate what services we 've got on tap internally and what we seek from the external market no real changes from when I talked to you last our survey area we use a mix of internal and external we have some survey capacity not licensed survey so we definitely use externals there we don 't have any geotechnical capability so we 're always seeking that from the market we have basically some capacity probably around 50 for us for the work that we deliver through our civil design and landscape design offices so generally fine we 're trying to access those markets particularly for designs that we 're trying to do perhaps one two years out in advance so that we 're buying ourselves time to get through approvals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any capacity it 's all out sourced as is structural design lighting and traffic signal design internally we have our day laborer internal work force for civil construction then we work closely with but they don 't they only deliver about 50% of the civil program annually so there 's still a large portion of work that 's going to market from a civil construction point of view as I mentioned before they are also subcontracting a lot of work whether it be kerbin channel or procurement of product as well so there 's still a large external procurement that goes on even when we 're delivering through our internal staff landscape construction though is all externally contracted as is lighting and traffic signals installation so in terms of some of those arrangements and how we get work from the market we do use a range of methods we tend to rely a lot on our panel arrangements though these are some panel arrangements that my branch in project delivery administers against repeater so if you need to talk to talk about them he 's available today but basically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two panels are in the process of taking a year extension of the MOU which will take them through tomorrow April 2020 and as you can see they 're the playground and exercise equipments through to October 2020 so not looking to renew right now we did a renewal last year and I think added some to one of those panels so not actually looking to to do that again at this point in time so I guess what 's important to us is is relationship building is understanding who 's in the market building those relationships so we know what contractors and consultants capabilities are and you know how we like to do business some of the key things for returning information to us as part of those bids and tenders quotes is to try and really detail out the methodology methodology on how you going to deliver something for us so we can understand we know that you 've thought about it the track record is definitely important we want to work with people obviously who 've performed well I think that 's you know part and parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though that we want to focus on safety we have had quite a journey of safety improvement we 'll continue that focus but we work you know predominately all of our work is in in the public arena it 's in brownfield sites you know so we 're working in streets and parks and areas where the public you know are walking through it 7 so you know one of our key values is how you 're dealing with the public and how there is there safety is important to you as it is to us when you 're working on those projects for us we definitely want to support local Brissac business and there 's a good component of waiting that goes towards that in our evaluation process and a positive approach but with long-term benefits you know we want to be working with people for the longer term again with good relationships and understanding of how we like to do business so Martin did speak about our safety focus but I think for those of you who have done some work with us we 've certainly changed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our safety specification with every contract brief we put out nowadays which is pretty much the codes of practice the stuff that you 're required to do as a contractor anyway but we 've really tried to get that information up front so you know as you 're going into those those tender processes exactly what those safety requirements are and that what you 're I guess tendering to us on the basis of and what we will be measuring you on as you deliver those projects for council in the community we 've tried not to use I guess the big stick approach and more of a mentoring and working with you we understand that you know there 's some capacity building that has to go on in that space and we 're very interest in that we 've been taking that journey ourselves for building knowledge and capacity in our safety in our teams for safety so we also want to want to see that happen with with contractors as well so that 's pretty much it for me so I 'll leave you back with Paul thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what Chris had to say is particularly with those two two of those three supply arrangements the other thing that the procurement team gets asked almost the most number of questions about how do I get on the supply arrangement for supply arrangement of the size of the two that were at the top there I 'll see if I can go back sometime today of those two there while they the extension will be exercised in order to create an arrangement of that size one we will do it by tender and secondly we 'll take a solid six months worth of work and we don 't want to be left without one so in order to have it in and effective to start when this one ends or those two end in April 2020 we will realistically be coming to the market in from about June of this year on sometime between June July August of this year I tell you that so that you one keep an eye out on it for those who are interested in it they 're too big arrangements that we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it allows us to go to our true tried-and-true suppliers who we 've been engaging with for some time if you 're not on it you can 't be invited to respond to a quote from it so importantly I would keep it in mind of those for anyone in the supply chain for either of the services that are covered by the names and keep in mind that back off of this calendar year we 'll be out to the market to form something that will kick off from April 20 2020 the second thing is and we also the second most popular question we get asked is how can I get into a supply chain with things that we don 't directly bqr and part of the answer that that is almost me telling you how to run your businesses but it 's to take the opportunities that here not just to listen to us but to talk to those people who are beside you and around you to start forming the relationships that we 're saying we want with principled contractors and that you have the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too many of the contractors who do some of those larger works will be able to deliver all of it without some sub subcontracting and not encourage you to use this as a forum not just to speak with us but to speak with each other about forming new relationships that allow you both to do some business and after preaching for me the next presenter that we have is from a property management management it 's from Jeff Lamont as you 'll have seen from Chris he 's got the the civil projects in particularly we 're going to get into our property discussions now and what the proper property team for building facilities will be looking to deliver for the remainder of the year good morning everyone it 's my pleasure to be presenting on behalf of the property management branch here today and I 'd like to share with you a few opportunities that we have coming forward in our agenda for 2019 I 'd like to let you know a little bit about the property management branch before we get onto that the property management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management unit and our building and facilities asset management unit the land unit provides coordinated management of counsel corporate land assets and land dealings associated with councils owned and controlled land including acquisitions disposals granting of easements

leased building and facilities these facilities include administration buildings their pose sporting venues aquatic centers libraries public amenities holiday parks as part of providing contemporary

that range from a thousand to ten thousand liters and lastly our maintenance and cleaning services for our saltwater recreation facilities which are the Kings Beach Ocean pool and Jr Ford pond will be an open tender and April this year with an August start date with our current contracts in in particular our registered of pre-qualified suppliers we 've exercised our first extension first one-year extension of a two-year option and that 's currently in review for the second year so we 'll know that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this opportunity to thank our service providers for their efforts and I like to point out the property management have formed some fantastic relationships with our service providers and business who employ great people in our community and take pride in servicing and maintenance for council please feel free to come over and see us at the table across the way there I have great Sam Darryl and Sarah with me today and they 'll be able to assist with any questions you may have so thank you back on to talking about that supplier arrangement there that is one of the largest ones that we have while there is the potential for an extension it is made up of there 's more than 50 Sunshine Coast businesses that are on that trade and general maintenance services in fact I think that 's actually more like 70 but I 'll stick comfortably with 50 so I can 't understand that I 'm getting on an arrangement of that type is very valuable to both council in needing those services in high volume and regularly and also to the wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reviewing it there isn 't it 's no guarantee that we will extend it on occasions we have bought them to an end we 'll have to look at its depth and capability at the moment before we make that decision again it would be formed by a tender and we would be if it wasn 't going to be extended need to be out in the market they 're relatively soon and if it was extended about this time next year we 'd be looking to get out there because we would naturally expect you know more than a hundred responses to get on an arrangement of that size thank you the next presentation we have is from Mandy day she 's from economic development team come up she would like to talk to you about some opportunities we have to partner together to work on an improved business and the economy for the Sunshine Coast Thank You Paul and thank you everyone for joining us this morning my name is Mandy day and I am one of two business development facilitators that 's employed within councils economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our business development program now I meet with businesses every day and in 99% of the meetings I conduct I find that business owners are unaware of number one who sits with within councils economic development branch what we do and how they can connect to our activities so I 'd like to take this opportunity to provide you with a quick overview so the economic development branch has activities are governed by our regional economic development strategy or the Reds which is which it is commonly referred to council Robertson has spoken about that already and it is a clearly articulated 20 year action plan for the period 2013 to 2033 developed in partnership with Sunshine Coast Council with the state government University of the Sunshine Coast and key local business and industry partners and the vision is to grow our economy from a thirteen billion dollar economy through to a thirty three billion dollar economy and there are three teams that sit within councils economic development branch that are charged with the implementation of the Reds action plans and they are trade and investment industry advancement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is charged with creating more career employment opportunities for Sunshine Coast residents they are promoting our region 's amazing business capability both nationally and internationally to drive new business investment to the region so a case case study for this is bringing us headquarters here they are also actively promoting local business expansion and can assist you in this and they have a great export program so if that 's something of interest to you they do have a workshop coming up this Monday and there are flyers on our table that you can take the information from we also have our tourism and major events team that sits within our branch their activities are governed by the Reds but also councils major events strategy and they 're working hard to deliver the vision of the Sunshine Coast to be recognized as Australia 's premier regional events destination this involves delivering around 60 major events each year in non peak periods to stimulate our economy so in this space there may be sponsorship or even volunteering opportunities that you could be connecting to if you 've never considered it volunteering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business people so I certainly recommend it the third is our industry advancement team and they 're engaged in some incredible activities focused around developing the seven high-value industries as well as activities aligned with the five pathways outlined in the Reds so for five years this team has done an incredible job building task force 's attracting local national and international investment and creating jobs within health and well-being education and research manufacturing and clean technologies agribusiness which is a huge growth industry here on the coast tourism sport and leisure aviation and aerospace and our professional service industry and the business development team sits within this team so that keeps us closely connected to the activities and opportunities across a wide range of industry sectors and these are opportunities that we can connect you to so the two main reasons for sharing this information is because I want you to feel confident that our economic development team strategically focused on developing our economy but more importantly I want you to know that you 're not alone in all of our day-to-day activities we 've become very connected so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazing business network listening to many sunshine posts business success stories the common theme is often that they 're really appreciative of the business assistance that they 've received so they 've put their hand up and they 're receiving assistance from counsel from chambers of commerce from industry groups they 've sought out funding opportunities they started out in incubators like the Innovation Center and they got involved in programs so just a quick hands up how many businesses have sort local business support through councils business development program so if you haven 't this next slide is for you we offer within our business development program tailored one-on-one support meetings so that is one hour in our office or on-site with you where you have an opportunity to introduce your business to us and

appreciate your contribution to the economy so to assist you with developing capabilities and growing your business there are a couple of specific opportunities that I 'd like to discuss today if you

've been able to convey how passionate I am about what we do and about how important we feel it is to support our business community so if there 's anyone out there experiencing difficulty or looking at opportunities to grow their business and I hope you will connect with our team we 're only an email away or come visit the team in our economic development table and introduce yourself after the presentation so thank you for your time and I wish you all a prosperous 2019 thank you very much the next set of questions that we traditionally get asked when when this presentation was more just what work is coming would be how do I then get that work how do we make the partnership and and get the contract that results from the work that we 're seeking some of you will have seen this before for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but it 's just a quick brief on how counsel will go about forming its contracts so very rarely if ever do we do a contract that the market doesn 't in some way become aware of for this year we have a full budget of eight hundred and sixty four million three hundred and seventy of that was for capital works so the material that Chris presented before was about thirty million dollars worth of works that will come to the market within the next quarter and be delivered over the next six months there are areas such as property management and also our roads teams who do work in significant amounts of it that contributes to that three hundred and seventy million and the largest portion of it or the largest single portion of it at this point in time is also with the airport expansion project we 're not doing too bad with our local spenders we 'll see from that for seventeen and eighteen we 've spent two hundred and twenty-one million was just under seventy five percent with local suppliers that 's from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market for and do go to the market for we 're almost at three and four dollars coming back into the local economy and for some of our more major projects and offer use the airport as an example it 's a contract with John Holland 's for the delivery of it they 're not considered local but the subcontracting that they do is with a significant number of locals now that 's not included in that seventy five percent if we 've engaged directly with the local will we will be able to count that if we have a major contractor like John Holland 's who then does some subcontracting we don 't count it but nonetheless there are opportunities for you when our major projects come to town and it 's not being delivered by locals to again seek work further down the supply chain this part might be a little mundane this is my bread and butter you can swap jobs with some of you feel like but we 'll form our contracts through two main forms one 's a request for quote the others a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be directly to a provider or it could be to by and by provider I mean a number of providers for contracts twenty five thousand to two hundred and fifty we will invite three quotes for contracts two hundred and fifty up to a million we will either invite five quotes or do a tender and we 'll use those symbol similar numbers when we 're forming a contract from the supply arrangement so again very rarely do we do we not invite a minimum number of suppliers to bid for a piece of work it also goes to highlight how valuable to us the supplier arrangements are that we have and how valuable it can be for you in order to get on to them the benefit for both parties in getting onto the supply arrangement is that we don 't have to then go through you 're effectively pre-qualified when you 've been on it we 've tested your work health and safety we 've tested your ability to deliver projects against a methodology we 've checked your capability and experience so it 's a shorter form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your price will be and will be far more interested in knowing how you 'll deliver that particular project which gives us a quicker turnaround time and also gives you less of a response required in order to get a piece of work noting that you will have had replied to the tender when we form the arrangement so one big tender gets us a lot of shorter form engagements the invitation and the request is about giving to you a specification or some type of document with which you can make an assessment of the cost of the work and your company 's ability to deliver it will also put out our terms and conditions which are relatively standard but I 'm always happy to talk with there is standard country generally so I 'm always happy to talk with people who have had challenges with some of them that council takes a fairly generic response to how it deals with indemnities and insurances and the like we have in the past had a few challenges with that we 've been in my view a little bit overly demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a point that gives us enough protection having regard to the industry and the size of the companies that we 'll be engaging with this just basically the rest of the presentation basically answers the questions we get asked at the end of these presentations about how we do things so we 've been asked before do we keep our evaluation criteria secret the answer to that is absolutely not our evaluation criteria will always be the vast majority if not all of those six that are there there is occasions when one or two of them the price for example we want to know something to do with price but we might structure a tender to get an upfront price for a piece of the work with a view of once it 's been designed for example getting a more comprehensive price but price capability experience from methodology the relevant parts of those sub points their contributions the local economy is always important to us and also our engagement with social benefiting and indigenous employers or indigenous groups indigenous companies the response form is where it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of you if we open up a tender response form and we have a local business who responds to the contribution to the local economy both by saying I 'm a local first your competitor who is also a local who says I 'm a local I 've been on the coast I employ ten people who live locally we have three vehicles that we source through here we have few accounts that we source through here we do and a series of subcontracting I 'd actually put yourselves in our position for we would be able to assess that criteria for local it 's it 's tributed with about 15% of the response so it forms a integral part of separating average responses from local businesses from good responses from local businesses so I 'd encourage you to take the time to tell you a story about how the fact that your existence as a business on the Sunshine Coast also supports other businesses and that sort of takes us back on the journey to the to the material amanda was talking about before with their general economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social benefit there will be occasions when we acknowledge that it won 't be an opportunity to directly engage with social benefit providers and as a result we can remove some of that from the invitation we 'll always be looking for opportunities to see what indeed opportunities exist for indigenous employers for indigenous companies and also for any provider in how they go about putting their business together and their engagement with the indigenous community to ultimately build the capability of the indigenous groups on the coast supplier Arrangements has given you probably enough information although I 'm happy to take any more questions that we have on and we have about 28 or 29 of at the at the moment some of them depending on the nature of the industry that we engage with who reformed with the pricing mechanism in that case when we come to engage from it we will know the pricing that will generally be ranked where we 'll go with the best price first available and work down the list for some of them we 're in civil and construction where you couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to you with a different structured response form for a quote to say price doing this piece of work in terms of the two to four years we 've wound back quite generally we can create them for two years and then we 've generally given ourselves to one-year options just to make an assessment of where the market is when we get to the end of the two years we 're not extending as much as we previously did we acknowledge the wall at some more work for us it 's a good refreshing opportunity for the council in getting a list of suppliers who are keen to do the work and it also means that locals who either come into existence or for some reason didn 't respond to or weren 't successful previously don 't have to wait three and four years for another opportunity again if I connected some of the things that have talked today working with Mandy 's group in economic development to take on any of the opportunity you can to improve your business and align it with what councils going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent particularly in the lead up to what is the release of some of these supplier arrangements I 'd encourage you can do that stole my thunder before we got 28 or 29 of at the moment yeah there 's that there 's a couple of hundred suppliers in total across all of them we don 't have them for everything some people seem to think that we you can 't actually create them for everything so what we do is create them for the high volume or more riskier work that we would like to engage them more openly and directly without shorter list of people rather than continually going to the open market and having tender responses from all over Australia of that 29 arrangements than 100 suppliers more than 80% of them are local and some of them a hundred percent of them are local I 've covered a fair degree so this is running at a battery when we do an engagement we had the number of quotes we guarantee that wherever possible we 'll invite a minimum number of locals to do it so what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers by the way I would prefer that wherever possible we was a hundred percent of locals get invited but sometimes the markets and sometimes the opportunities don 't always present that way so in terms of a three quote process at least two will be in terms of five quote process at least three will be local and four written tenders locals have that 15% opportunity to give us the best effort of explaining their supply chains and explaining how they contribute to and exist in the Sunshine Coast Chris has already spoken as is mainly about building relationships we need to understand and know how for the remainder of the financial year is what 's coming you oh and who is working in our area we just don 't go to the phone book and show how old I am mentioning a phone book some of you might not know what that is but we want to know who the locals are in an area there are new businesses being formed all the time there are people moving within businesses all the time so please take those opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the council know about your business and what it does being a local government and needing to justify how we spend our money means that we will create a what 's called a probity environment for the course of our procurement what that does is a form of ensuring that we treat everyone equally so while we can naturally have a preference for local providers as opposed to the non-local in terms of when we conduct request for quote or a tender from the moment it 's released so goes in the paper in the case of a tender was released on cue tender or we issue the three quotes we will treat the three of you completely equally in all five or every one in terms of how we give responses the information that we give you and how we deal with you so that you are all in the same position when it comes to putting in your offer to do a piece of work for us and by that I mean to the point where if you ask your question or one of your competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on either giving you the opportunity of not asking a question or asking it and we will publish the answer so that you were all put in exactly the same position and no one has a more nor any less information than the others that 's very important for council that we maintain that it 's good for business and it 's actually good for a local government to be approaching things in a way that always has us being able to clearly justify our decision making and our treatment of the companies that we engage with what other opportunities are there part of our existence again going back to Mandy 's present presentation is to assist other businesses is to assist the businesses in the area knowing and understanding what other opportunities they have so while we don 't want you doing too much work for others so that you can do it for us we put these up there the tender alert service comes out every week with the tenders that we have been published or being released at that time the Queensland Government Kew tender website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going through so if you 're not on either of those I would suggest you do we offer some doing business with council workshops which will take you through the tender and request for quote response work so that you can better understand what the forms will look like what the content will be required what content will be requested and how you can best go about responding to an invite to do some work for us we 've also already mentioned Amanda did the ICN Gateway there the business gateway we also have the black business finder local buy is a state government organization that has a series of supplier arrangements for local governments to use there is they have more supply arrangements with us and they cover the entirety of Queensland and some of the Northern Territory so getting on to their supplier arrangements is further opportunities for work I 've mentioned the Sunshine Coast Airport expansion and we also have down at Maroochydore in our newly developed city centre Sun Central who is a wholly owned government entity that is doing a significant body of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a significant amount of civil work going on and once we progress through the Civil Works they 'll move into vertical building as well as selling off the blocks and the opportunities that exist for the purchases of those blocks to engage with locals hopefully in work to develop the site those doing businesses with counsel we have two workshops coming up ones on the 22nd of February ones on the topic next is on the 22nd 26th sorry of April and we also for those who would like the taste of it have recently released they 're doing business with business with Council online workshop it 's a video that goes for about 45 minutes I think you can skip through parts that are not to your liking but it will step you through the initial stages of engaging with council and it complements what you can also get in a little more detail from their workshops in February and April we run there at those workshops every quarter and we 'll intend to but for those who either can 't get to them immediately and would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the online workshop that is all I won 't take you through the Bible of procurement it 's can get a little on the dull side despite the fact that it is absolutely necessary if you 're wanting to engage with the council that you respond to it but that should be enough I would hope to give you an indication of what we will be asking for you 've seen from the work that we 're releasing now that we 've got well from Chris 's presentation at least 30 million dollars worth of work there you 've got a number of supply range moments coming that have not are not set but significant amount and with that I 'll thank you all for coming and bring the presentation to a close thank you you"

    "text": "LOL dysley Kelson coming to you again from the Sunshine Coast Innovation Center and I have with me Leanne Kemp the CEO of ever ledger and our newly appointed Queensland chief entrepreneur please have it I have it on good authority so I was at the breakfast event that you did this morning and I just want to say to you that it was fantastic to hear some of the views that you have and hopefully some of the insights that you 're bringing into the ecosystem but I guess one of the things that came out of it for me was the idea of community I mean you mentioned community a couple of times and I wanted to ask you what does community mean to you community means to me a series of people that can come together with like-mindedness that clearly share the same passion and enthusiasm and can actually work collectively in a similar environment like you know I 'm standing here in this building and I 've just come from a series of pitched sessions in there and to be honest with you this place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startups and beyond that actually there 's companies here that already have global reach I 'm a bit shell-shocked actually by what I 've just walked out of this it 's it 's amazing yeah it 's it 's incredible so I 've been going around the Sunshine Coast for the last couple of months interviewing entrepreneurs and getting entrepreneur stories before invest Sunshine Coast and I 'm like you I 'm just blown away with the stories and the international global reach of some of these companies and they 're operating out of here but I mean it is it 's fantastic to see but I think just go back to the community thing I want to talk about how important is to you is diversity in those communities I mean diversity creates genius right it creates innovation from my perspective and I think that community in one respect the ability to be able to share ideas and do it in a sort of safe a safe space emotionally and and contractually is really important for innovation and it 's very clear that through the journey of entrepreneurship or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with uncertainty uncertainty around the idea or the technology that you 're working with and and communities that come together in such a way to be able to bring the diversity of thought and really sort of challenge maybe even some of the entrepreneurial thinking that 's in the space but do it in such a way that is safe to understand that penultimately the journey is one that is a shared a shared pathway and so I think the collective minds that can come together across communities is an incredibly important secret ingredient to making a place like the Sunshine Coast so special to be able to then operationalize and execute out of these communities is also that kind of the next stage that I 'm seeing yeah so you mentioned this morning also that you started ever ledger out of a train with some goats bleating in the background bought it on eBay actually I woke up the next morning after a hangover and it said you 've won a train wow really awesome but I think the thing that I took out of that was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of places but Australia is first thing we think about is innovation is we 've got to build a shrine to innovation so we 've got to go and put infrastructure and build a place and build a building but you can do it from anywhere now right I think you should deliberately put yourself in an environment that doesn 't necessarily sit within a construct of tradition because that puts you in a place of uncertainty and and and your mind then begins to think it through the creative process and to allow yourself to be free in that thought process is really where certain genius times come together and I did was talking today you know we have incredible locations in Australia that I 'm quite sure you know we go to seek out so there 's solidarity moments in mountains and do you know moments of um to find you know the inner soul and that same kind of process to a certain extent is what happens in in innovation so I you know created something inside of my train at 3 o 'clock in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goats bleating in the background I 'm quite sure they were hungry or they 're probably thinking when you turn the light off you know we 're trying to sleep too but it was that sort of quietness of mine that ended up being able to sort of give birth to something was truly unique yeah so the the circle economy I just want to touch on that they 're giving me the wind up but it 's an economy they 're rough yeah I want to ask you about that the idea that the circle economy and bringing the end of the design of products Yammy needs a race to the bottom so we you know we 've built our in entire sort of population on consumerism and which is fine right so we have to live breathe and experience certain parts of quality of life but the reality is we have not really thought about the full the full circle of product and if we start thinking about its being really a race to the bottom let 's go bigger better faster or get it cheaper and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to India but to be able to rethink product at a design level when we start seeing an understanding where these technologies are playing with 3d printing you know I think designers will be at the forefront of innovation and we should really be thinking about it not only from a perspective of building product but have the sustainability footprint built within that actual product itself even potentially change the way we label things that labeling shouldn 't just be looking at you know don 't you 're dry clean this shirt and don 't wash in you know hot water but actually there is an another life to that t-shirt right let 's think about what that next life is yes fantastic and just one last question the entrepreneurial purpose and the idea of social entrepreneurship triple bottom-line and I think it 's bright it 's got to come from in the investment community to accept yeah that this is actually a very real financial construct and it 's very clear that financial markets are really thinking about you know green and an impact investing is a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and investor a VC community that triple bottom-line is something that should really be read and should be invested in is really an important next step there yeah and there 's often a separation between sort of social entrepreneurship doing good while doing well but actually forgive that from a profit perspective is not necessarily the truth yet yeah they 're giving them windup oh my god they 're really top thank you very much"

    "text": "hello world as Li Kelson coming to you again from the Sunshine Coast Innovation Center or Innovation Centre Sunshine Coast and I 'm here with Mick Black who 's a local tech creative we call you that creative technologist professional maker inventor for hire all of those things and do you operate out of here me sometimes yeah yeah so I try to share my time around the Innovation Center and also the bridge in tech hub as well and you had a very interesting project you did what a couple of weeks ago a week ago yeah a few weeks ago we were we were asking the question about Australia being part of the space industry and and we 've seen the Australian Space Agency and other things like that sort of happened but it seems a little bit out of reach and so like if you were to think about it you 'd say there 's a pie in the sky idea that Australia would be part of that and that you know it could be something that somebody in a school would aspire to be a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff so we thought we just start there and we 'll put us a pie up there talk us through how do you put a pie literally a pie in the sky so it takes four days but an enormous amount of planning prior to those four days and we worked with teams from you NSW 's TechConnect delta-v blue Sat there 's a whole bunch of really like amazing professional companies who gave us the begrudging okay for us to actually launch this thing because there 's a lot of I mean there 's a lot of approvals you have to go through to be able to do this kind of stuff and you sort of walk into these meetings like what I 'm about to say is not a joke and I still need the approvals but look I mean it sounds fun and frivolous of course and it did get us a bit of media attention as well which is what we wanted we wanted it to be part of the story that we 're actually now doing things you know and and even in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making and all of those kinds of things so the whole thing is to make it much more accessible that anybody can think yeah I might start seeing what I can do in space so if you can put a pie in the sky literally then you can do anything right that 's right that 's right next time somebody says to you that 's a pie in the sky idea say yeah we did that too so what was it a balloon or hey break it down how do you how do you go about that yeah so we actually sent up two different payloads one was a scientific instruments one and the other one was the the hero pie they went up on a weather balloon so I think what you call near space but didn 't quite hit space space because they can 't do that in a balloon but the the idea of the pie ended up being this this laser-cut mount that was gyroscopically stabilized side and sensors on the other side evenly balanced so that and 360 cameras on there as well so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside it was a bunch of sensors and a power generation device that we worked with the kids from Ronald McDonald House to build so they assembled this power generation device so they felt like they were part of it as well like it was all that sort of inclusive yeah we 're all we 're all doing something together from the serious stuff that went up in the first payload through to the the pie and so obviously you 're very active on the Sunshine Coast and you operate out of the sunshine okay so what 's it like being an entrepreneur and and living and working out of a place like Sunshine Coast well this is a place I come this is where I 've raised my family this is the place where I come to recharge and also to connect with this amazing supportive community that we have like I feel like I sort of go out and collect a new crazy story and bring it back and go and share it with everybody and and everybody 's always pretty excited to hear about it and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 've got a really beautiful thing here in our community it 's very supportive I wouldn 't be doing these things if it wasn 't for a few key members of the community vouching for me only in 2015 yeah like I 've only been doing this stuff since 2015 oh hell and then amount of time and I 'd have to say that that 's yeah II feel safe like you to use the space analogy like you 're going out walking on the you know on the exterior of the shuttle but you 've got this nice big tether coming back with oxygen and everything that you need and this is the tether yeah the Sunshine Coast is absolutely the tether and the beautiful people that live here that 's that 's fantastic analogy so you 've obviously got serious business as well that you do apart from sending pies up into space yes yeah yeah so I operate an inventor for hire service called Mike 's lab it 's my lab and that allows me to do like in collaboration do all kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from grow lights for algae through to weaponized systems for robots to voice-activated farms to automobile stuff like it 's it 's sort of if you can 't buy it you can 't look it up nobody 's even tried it before yeah now we 're interested like big slab is the place to go yeah definitely I 'm interested in the stuff because that 's the way we can compete so when it 's an organization that has say the force of Google or Amazon they have 10,000 people just research something on Stack Overflow like until it works but it really takes some you know mixed and buried confusing background of things and and and great connections in with different people that I 've met from around the world that are part of what I consider you know my network as it were and those those are the things that can come together in weird and wonderful ways to solve really unusual problems like really outrageously crazy unusual problems and and that 's that 's our sweet spot for sure fantastic so if people want to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can they get in touch with you yeah so jump on my website Mike 's lab comm so it 's em ICS Mike like the microphone em ICS la be calm or find me on LinkedIn and connect up that way excellent thanks for talking with us today well done with the pie in the sky I love it"

    "text": "and HelloWorld ously Kelson coming to you from the balcony in Maroochydore of the head office of prevent him and I 'm here with the co-founder Steve Huff how a Steve goodnight how are you I 'm very well thanks bit overcast today but we 've got an amazing view not a bad pad to be operating your business it 's a good spot it 's a great spot to work out although we love it so Steve you 've got an interesting background tell us a little bit about your background and how you arrived on the Sunshine Coast well I moved to the coasts almost 20 years ago now and my first startup was 2001 here on the coast and we were the first company out of the innovation center in a company called typify which I think once more wards are recently here in Australia as well yeah yeah yeah so but that was my first startup and then from there I 've probably had another 10 or 11 here out of the coast and we were talking earlier how you were you were proficient at taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market and then looking at an M&A so it 's been a really interesting run did some investing along the way and always had a focus on social entrepreneurship so really had some companies here out of the coast that focused on everything from parenting to solar lighting to what we 're doing now with the opioid crisis in America I don 't know whether I said I was proficient but I said I had a crack at a few of them yeah there you go so we 're vets in the States he originally from originally from North Carolina which is kind of between Washington DC and Atlanta Georgia and I was from up in the mountains in a little town called Asheville which is actually the craft beer capital of America now so good spot to be from and so what did you do you went to uni over there yeah I did I did a major in history at my uni or my college did a four-year degree and then did a master 's in in business and organization development from the University of Western North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent them came out of a really practical idea it was really an interesting interesting way that it came about we we heard a guy from Facebook speak a couple of years ago he came to the coast and he was talking about these concepts like big data and gamification artificial intelligence and how you could use a platform and use those techniques like Facebook does to keep people engaged and we were listening all of this and then one of the people who was with us afterwards we took this guy out to dinner and we 're talking to him and I was my partner Jacky who 's just started her PhD in child childhood injury prevention and Public Health from University of Queensland and she asked a question could you use those same principles of gamification to prevent childhood injuries and we thought sure we can you know we 're entrepreneurs right we can do anything and of course she went on to explain that public health is a real challenge particularly in prevention and it 's hard to change people 's behavior and ultimately that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the challenge we partnered with the University of Queensland and worked into her study a single blinded randomized control child attest gamification and its efficacy and injury prevention and we did a study on childhood burns here in Australia when all over Queensland and it was really interesting and we used an app and his mother has learned about preventing childhood burns they were able to earn points and rewards so we use gamification to in a public health context and it was a world-first study it 's now been written up I think there 's about seven different peer-reviewed articles exploring all aspects of it which is great and from there we went over to the states and started talking to state governments we did a MoU with the CDC the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta signed an MoU with Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore and we we just had this amazing experience where we everywhere we went they said you guys are doing something that no one 's doing you guys are actually able to engage millions of people but individualize that engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have this platform to do public health campaigns and engage your populations on obesity or violence against women or smoking cessation or whatever your public health issue is and so we started meeting with a number of Commissioners for Health in different states and I think we were in Alabama about a year and a half ago and a health commissioner there said guys the only thing that we can focus on is the opioid crisis coming back when you have something that will work for that and of course the opioid crisis is unlike any public health crisis Americans ever face so currently it 's estimated that about a hundred and seventy-five 180 people a day are dying of accidental overdose from opioids which means that 's the same the equivalent for the American population who when they fought the Vietnam War they lost fifty five thousand soldiers so for America it 's like losing a Vietnam War every year just in to drugs and to overdose so we started working on that and then in December we got a call from a music producer out of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour a music tour called the Vans Warped Tour and this is the longest-running music festival in American history it 's a punk alternative festival so bands like Green Day and believe won a to Katy Perry Gwen Stefani all got their start on the Warped Tour and so he said look my friends and family are dying you know he was friends with Tom Petty he new prints and he knew that these people had died of accidental overdoses and not to mention the thousands and thousands of kids that he connected with every summer who were dying and so he he asked if we could do something so we did we created a brand new type of public health campaign called finned which you 'll see my hat which stands for full energy no drugs and we have a nonprofit in the u.s. that is working with state governments now to roll-out finned we have our first two states who have come on board Utah and Virginia and that 's very exciting and then our plan is to roll it out across the 50 states so our little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the IP and will license that technology to these state governments as it rolls out and then we 'll be able to roll out this incredible campaign so that 's essentially what prevent him is it 's about individualizing engagement I know this is a huge story I didn 't know if you wanted my origin story fantastic now I love it it 's great but that 's how we got started and and that 's where we came to where we are today and we already have some some great revenue coming in and we 're in the middle of our we just kicked off a new series a fundraising round 15 million u.s. we we successfully completed a seed round here on the Sunshine Coast of 250,000 and then completed an angel round of 2 million u.s. and we 're now on to our our series a which is really exciting for us because we 're we have a team in in California we have a team in New York and we 're just about to hit those institutional investors so we 've got great investors here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our New Zealand and Bermuda and the u.s. is where our investors come from fantastic and you 've done all this just from the Sunshine Coast yeah not just this location we 've had a couple other units over the years we like we 'd like to to hang out and have a great view and it 's really really good spot to work yeah we were just talking about that the the typical commercial offices you know they can be a bit sterile on mid stage but but this is actually a residential apartment or it 's a unit that they 're we that we have and it 's great and you know it 's it 's a pad you know we 're in the penthouse suite and we 've got a little pool upstairs and a swot sauna you know we have a wine cellar and it 's a good spot to be it 's fantastic and so tell me to wrap up living on the Sunshine Coast and operating how do you how do you find that well we love it I mean we wouldn 't live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live and as you know with the technology that we 've seen over the last 20 years it 's so easy to work and live anywhere but we choose to be here I travel to the States one week a month for a week or two weeks and you know every time I lands in Brisbane Airport and I Drive up and as soon as I get on the coast I start to relax and it 's just like it melts away and this is the place to live yeah absolutely and so I just tell me about finned you know obviously the opioid crisis isn 't just in the US there 's a problem here in Australia as well it 's actually really really pretty scary right now what 's happening in Australia I think we had over 800 deaths last year to opioids and that doubled between the year before last and last year and that if the trends continue we 're going to lose more and more people to accidental overdose and so our job is in prevention we know that out of the US and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say between 18 and 24 dollars in the healthcare costs just by doing prevention so we want to we 're starting to talk to some folks here in Australia and hopefully catch up with some folks here in Queensland and say look this is not only and of course the beauty of finned is that we can also combine other drugs such as ice or some of the shadow epidemics for for teens like adderall and Ritalin and some of those things so we can really have a drug education campaign unlike any anything that 's ever existed sorry my stage fame check it out if you got a website full energy no drugs I love it yeah check out the finned app on the App Store but WWE prevent um com Steve been a pleasure mate that was fantastic story and all the best we 've prevented hope you get you a 15 million round away yeah absolutely"

    "text": "hello world Isley Kelson coming to you live on the deck of Sun care and I 'm here with the CEO Russell Mason how are you Russell I 'm greatly great to see you thanks for chatting with us today and just before we get in and talk about you a little bit of your interesting backstory range of Russell I want to just talk about what 's in the background over here can you tell us what 's happening over here so what 's in the background here what you can see him step out the way is the groundwork of a new smart city coming out of the ground so it is was 45 hectares that was originally a golf course right in the middle of Maroochydore in the middle of the Sunshine Coast which has now been purchased by the council and is having the infrastructure laid down to turn it into the first green field smart city in Australia probably in the southern southern hemisphere but certainly in Australia in the last 30 years we haven 't seen a new city centre come out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's amazing and when you say smart City and Greenfield what are we talking about when we talk Greenfield it means it is it doesn 't have existing infrastructure in place there 's no buildings there 's no underground conduits there 's no water you know there 's nothing it 's completely fresh so everything has been planned from the beginning to actually be a smart city which means when you 're putting in all the con juice all the information you 're putting in all the cables all the fiber optics all of the bits and pieces we now need in today 's world to actually utilize all the digital tools that are available to us so what sort of things are we gonna see in a smart city like this so there 's all sorts of infrastructure things you can see and there 's gonna be a whole heap of software spin-offs but one of the infrastructure areas is instead of having rubbish trucks come along and pick up rubbish on a weekly basis there 's pneumatic tubes being put in the whole city so it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you you 're in an apartment you know as many as halls it is your rubbish goes down a chute disappears great thing is you can sleep in in the morning without the rubbish truck waking you up yeah the second great thing is all of the rubbish goes into one place and can actually be reused so you can actually sort it as it 's going through that process as well that 's one thing another thing is all the lighting will be smart so all the lighting as you walk around the city will turn off when it 's unnecessary turn on when it is people will be track so we know what 's being used what 's doing it just following mobile phones things fatso we know what amenities people are using what they 're not using what 's working what 's not working if you 've got an event on you can see where people are congregating which allows if you like to look and make sure you 've got the right people in place to ensure that you can help them get to where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that 's just the the infrastructure side the buildings will be smart because they 'll have all of the the high-tech information which means they can all be set up to utilize Sun utilize solar energy utilize the actual smarts of the new fiber-optic cables it 'll be a 10 gigabyte system that 's coming in here so you know you talk about gig cities this is minimum 10 gig city every every building in this will have the ability to turn up their internet speed so they can access the world what 's also interesting is now that we 've got the submarine fiber-optic cable linking us with Hong Kong into the u.s. directly into the US and also into remember the fourth location Hong Kong ah qualm it 's going through Guam Hawaii into the US as well what this means is because this is a cable that 's owned by the city is that by the Sunshine Coast City I say it means that people will be able to have direct access to these locations faster access and as much speed as they need so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it sounds like what it is around the world most telecommunications that we use so if you 're sending this video around the world and people are watching this in in Sweden it 's actually been transmitted by a fiber-optic cable under the oceans it 's not going via the satellites 99% of all communications in the world go under a fiber-optic which is ain 't met this big cable that goes underneath the world and interconnects so what it is it 's the Sunshine Coast will be one of only four locations in Australia actually three that which is Perth Sydney and the Sunshine Coast who actually have a linkage to the rest of the world because we 're also closer to places like Hong Kong than say Sydney it also means the information the latency the speed of which the data arrives is going to be quicker than it is say in Sydney or Perth so we have a lot of advantages with something like amazing and so just a little bit about your your background so you told me just off-camera that you started life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back even further I was once upon a time a ski instructor in Canada and did all the wonderful things that you do but yeah more recently I you know and in the 90s I was a ranger in Victoria Parks Victoria chief Ranger visitor services at one stage and ran tourism visitor programs down there it was a great life and so how did you transition into the Sunshine Coast and what brought you here well my background was hospitality and tourism and the reason I got into visitor services in Parks Victoria was because of that it was the recognition that the parks needed to be opened up so that people could actually enjoy them not locked away and hidden and the more we could educate people about the environment and sustainability in the environment meant that people appreciated it so I was actually brought into Parks Victoria as part of that process so from there I then transitioned into Taronga Zoo and worked there for nearly a decade before coming up to the Sunshine Coast in tourism and you started work with well I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you tell us a little about your involvement there and the first sort of start of the digital city I guess sure look I started working for Regional Development Australia in 2010 and set up that call get well started that organization along with a number of other people and one of the things that we did as part of our regional roadmap for their for the region to try and explore the opportunities coming that we could see from the digital area era was to set up a digital Sunshine Coast which was a strategy for the region which enabled the region to sort of have a glimpse of some of the opportunities that digital change was bringing some of the spin-offs from that included things such as on the coast we had the silicon coast group set up which is a whole bunch of entrepreneurs and innovators on the Sunshine Coast they get together on a very regular occasion to actually exchange ideas to talk to socialise just to see how we can grow the coast and you 've obviously been involved in helping lobby to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real role apart from all these other activities is the CEO of Sun care so tell us about the Sun care amazing story of Sanka so I was approached to get involved with Sun care about three and a half years ago now and the real reason for that is Sun care is look does in-home care generally for our elderly looking after the carers to ensure that they 're looked after and ensure that our our elders are really well catered for and have in-home care so Sankyo specializes in in-home care so we don 't do residential or any of that sort of care we allow people to remain living where they choose to live but the real reason I was selected was because there was a recognition that the sector needed to change it needed to turn from an analogue business into a digital business so what I 've been doing over the last three and a half years is taking what was effectively an old legacy style business and really turning it on its head and turn it into a digital business so all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after people are using mobile phones they 're using laptops they we have an open disc style office we 've used we 've embraced co-working if you like and we have a very very fluid and digital way of using everything so everything is cloud-based or everything is data center based really we utilize the tools that we 've talked about that are going to be available in this smart City and that 's what we see is our competitive advantage as we move forward into the 2020s and how many people do employee on the Sunshine Coast so on the Sunshine Coast we 've got about a hundred and fifty people all up across all the regions we work in from Rockhampton down to the Gold Coast it 's about 360 it 's a sizeable operation and and you in regional Queensland only or are you starting to look elsewhere and maybe you know export markets look the opportunity is to you know always to look more broadly but you know the areas that we 're currently in still are growing so rapidly the the opportunities for us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking and particularly northern New South Wales there 's an opportunity for us down through the central coast or Byron Bay down through the hunter down the Central Coast and Sydney great opportunity for us however we don 't want to go too far away from our roots this point in time and we really want to ensure that we 've mastered what we have before we then try to move too deeply into other regions build a solid foundation correct get that right and then looked at how do we scale that greater from there and so in terms of lifestyle and living and operating and working and a business this size on the Sunshine Coast so their challenges advantages look there are absolutely challenges one of the benefits of embracing digital technology is that I can work from home I can work home it being Mooloolaba or I can work from anywhere but the flipside to that is a lot of the meetings that you know you 're expected to go to are in Canberra yeah because our funders generally come out of Canberra so you spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in Sydney and for anybody that lives on the Sunshine Coast you know they 'll know I can actually fly to Sydney and be in a meeting at nine o 'clock in Sydney more easily than I can in Brisbane because of the Bruce Highway so you know there 's there 's issues there but what it means is I put a lot of kilometres on the car as well yeah so you still have to do the old school you still have to talk to people yeah but we try to wherever possible embrace the digital communication tools as well I was talking to someone earlier today and they said that they used to live in now its southern suburbs of Melbourne and and sometimes when the traffic was that bad they could actually fly from here into Melbourne get into the city into a meeting in similar time that would take them to commute I can totally feel for that one honestly I can drive from my house and drive to the Gold Coast and if i bypass it using the new gateway the part that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it after nine o 'clock in the morning I can probably do that more quickly than getting into the centre of Brisbane just because of the traffic lights and the city traffic at any time of day is it 's astonishing I could certainly fly to Sydney more easily and now there 's an international airport coming in as well that 's right it 's going to connect it with the rest of the world so that opportunity also means because we have opera operations Rockhampton and looking up at Makai as well on Mackay as the locals call it I 'm Scottish so for me it 's Makai I was born in Glasgow so for me it 's my car but the locals call it Mackay it 's a it 's an interesting one but we we operate up there so but the wit to catch a flight to go and work saying rocky I have to go to Brisbane and then fly at the top of the Sunshine Coast to go there I 'm hopeful that the new airport not only will give us those international but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that want to either contact you are you on LinkedIn ehi kids yeah absolutely so Russell Mason on LinkedIn suncare yep Sun care Community Services so you can just search us on Google or any of your other favorite social medias Instagram and others we do a lot of youtubes and we put a lot of information out on Vimeo and YouTube so if you 're interested in looking at how we 're actually making a difference and helping people just have a good look okay and we 'll then we 'll put the links to the YouTube and some other resources down below this video which will be hopefully you know getting out to you pretty soon so Russell 's been a pleasure mate keep up the excellent you doing and well done to you thanks thanks so much Lee it 's wonderful to meet you and yeah anybody is interested in coming up to the Sunshine Coast great place to come and set up the business"

come into service in early 2020 to mid 20 2000 next year it should really be a foundation element year for any business on the Sunshine Coast to really start understanding how they can benefit and leverage from that kind of infrastructure because outside of Sydney we 're the only place on the east coast of Australia that has it and ours is faster ours is newer house is better what kind of data are they consuming how much are they spending on telecommunications and data because there 's the opportunity through our cable system when it comes online and new service offerings come on the market to start saving but if you don 't know what you pay if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to do comparative shopping so if I 'm a business I 'm understanding my data usage my future data needs I 'm understanding where my data goes am I using a data center in any way or is the supplier I 'm using using a data center in any way because if if you are if they are you 're going to leverage this cable and you 're going to see a better outcome into the future with the addition of the cable we 'll see a further investment in the region and so our work is in partnership with groups like script of the 1,000,000 Innovation Program in collaboration with many others Innovation Center the University and many others about building programs to help not only those who are at the forefront and the bleeding

    "text": "hello well dysley Kelson coming to you on behalf of invest Sunshine Coast and I 'm here with Justin Robinson of load how hey Justin good great to meet you thank you nice to meet you so you were in there pitching earlier today I was here it 's nice to have Lee Camp here today and tell you all a bit and so why don 't you tell us about load and what you do is we 're an online our platform that connects employers in the university talent so we 're about trying to get employers as quickly as possible to the best talent in Australia okay that 's a good 30 second elevator pitch I think it does anything if they 've done that before so yeah look we 're the opposite of a job board so we take the inefficiencies out of that model and just make sure employers can get to the best talent right and so how long have you been operating we 've been going for 10 years and I 've got about 1.3 million members and he ever got some large enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ey and so we 're all about to streamline in that connection right and so what 's your story how did you end up in in this business I 'm a investment banker by trade so I had ten years in Europe during you look like an investment banker now doing large-scale data projects and then I just came back here and I just saw the inefficiencies in recruitment and just wanted to use data in a better way and for us it 's all about the candidate building at the digital profile and then making sure the employers can easily search and approach those you know in a really cool target of weight yeah so it 's interesting because there 's been a proliferation of recruitment apps you know double-sided marketplaces triple sighted marketplaces but it 's it 's all sort of taking the traditional approach to recruitment and digitizing it in a way that 's the way I see it so you 're saying this is the reverse or the flip of that yeah we are we 're putting the candidate at the center of everything and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a natural it 's a natural fit from the employers side so if you wanted to tap into say an intern that studying marketing here that graduates next year there might be a hundred of those it 'll it 'll allow you to just message those hundred and ask those candidates to behave or apply it however you 'd like them to apply yeah and obviously you based yourself on the Sunshine Coast and operated out of here in noosa which is good yeah yeah tough place to be but yeah it 's good it 's good I know lived there and got married there and yeah yes Ben spent many years there ultimately moved away for business purposes but you know came to get back there one day look it 's an interesting story we we started in Brisbane then went down to Melbourne to grow the business and then we sort of challenged ourselves to say you know we wanted to be back on the coast in due course and so we we said what do we need to do our business model to actually scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't doesn 't involve sort of burning the shoe leather going out and selling to large enterprise clients so we went build our last bit of tech that we license directly to universities new so they can bring one side of the marketplace so they can bring the students in alumni for us and then we can go out and give away a really cool freemium level product on the employer side so for us being on the coast is challenged our business model and I think made it a lot better yeah it 's been good and so lifestyle-wise obviously it affords you a pretty good lifestyle up here do you find it challenging though when you are here or it can be for kids is challenging so that 's probably the biggest challenge look more more travel still than I 'd like and and that poses its own challenge you know with being based in noosa but again I think we we try to step back and ask why are we doing what we 're doing and is there a better way to do it so still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 're getting there fantastic so where to from here what is it you know a global domination not not not obsessed about global domination I think we 've done here first rollout which was to Western Sydney University about three weeks ago so that 's our first large-scale University clients so we want to grow a few more domestically and then we 'll look to Asia to start to roll it out in those areas so we 've always built it to scale and ready for that sort of play right fantastic and so your primary customer target is universities it 's both universities but also we want to make sure that we can get talent accessible to SMEs so regardless of their brand they can still use the tool search and approach those candidates at so so we think we 're unlocking enormous value in that SME space we 've had 10 companies from here just over the last few weeks jump on board use it and they 're getting up to can straightaway so I think we 're proving that we work it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about growing out as many employers and SMEs to meet tiers as we can and then growing out the universities using this one fantastic and so people want to find out more information about it just in week and they go I just download comm today you LOD LOD yep come today mate thanks for talking with us today all the best got a great idea thank you"

today Lee it 's a pleasure mate it 's a magnificent day here and the lots of people out on the beach and what a fantastic lifestyle but also great place to have a software company it 's the best place in the world to have a software company I think I mean like you you just can 't beat this environment it 's fantastic so sitting down cutting code all day and then the end of the day you can get up and walk out to the beach and it 's just magnificent antastic so ray give us a little bit of your background how did you get to the coast and and what 's your what 's your journey beam sure my background is I was working in IT in Melbourne I did many startups I think down there I 've done close to 10 startups some have done quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to move up to the Sunshine Coast to semi-retire so my wife and I didn 't have any children at the time so we thought what a magnificent place to raise a family and yeah certainly no regrets on that front so that was the plan and then I guess being the workaholic that I am decided once I got up here that I couldn 't help myself time to get back in to do another startup yeah that 's a bit like I say to my wife that 's it no more for me I 've done it yeah sure yeah that 's exactly right I guess they 're addictive things that they just just the the the passion and the energy of a startup there 's nothing like it and yeah I 'm the Sunshine Coast just an amazing place to be able to do it I feel really fortunate it 's a magnificent place so I 'll cure a software tell us about Al Kyra well okay we got to start when I won that once I moved up to the coast I became friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just watching him struggle trying to just take care of the administration side of his business so do things like you know take bookings doing voicing those types of things so you know I just wrote a little prototype program that allowed him to take care of his business and to use his words it gave him a lot of dignity which is you know felt really really good and then when I started looking into it realized what a huge problem it 's been since all these essential services the you know take we take for granted and been really convenient for us to the fact that moved online so things like banking and transport and and shopping all these great things that we can do and we can access blind people just can 't access in an easy and convenient way so I just thought there had to be a better solution you know in you know in this day and age with the technology where we are that there should be a better solution for for blind and vision-impaired though they have really just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of L Kiera so I thought well I 'll come up with something it 'll probably take me like 12 months and then I 'll do it well in point of fact it turned out to be a really tough problem to solve it took me five years of some pretty dedicated work to get this this up and running but yeah we 've solved it we 've got it and and did this is really a new paradigm and it 's a new way for wine division impaired people to be able to access you know essential services and so can you sort of dumb it down for me how does it how does it work well the way it works is we have some software that has blind people can download so I can run on their computer or their their smartphone tablet and they can use that to essentially get access to website information so our software is smart enough it goes out to the web it works out what the important pieces of information are because if you think of a website there 's an awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the top and the side banners and there 's ads and you know if you 're using technology design for buying people first of all it it 's hard to learn difficult to learn but it 's also very very slow and cumbersome to finally find a way around find exactly what it is that you 're looking for so our software just takes out all that you know there 's a lot of smarts in there to just take out all that all the hard work and just just make things really really easy and how have you found being based on the on the Sunshine Coast and growing that business well to be honest I was really concerned to start with I thought it sort of moved up here I mean I 've done a lot of work in Melbourne a lot of work in Sydney I was really concerned as the company started to grow as it started to expand I thought well you know how deep is the talent pool really gonna be here on the coast and to be honest I 've just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on the coast it 's it 's really wonderful so every time we have a position we need Phil we put the ad out on me and it 's easy to draw people up from Brisbane and Sydney as well it 's it 's a really easy sell you know because we can sell the lifestyle along with the you know the exciting journey that we 're on yeah and how many people do you employ now on the Sunshine Coast well I 'm the Sunshine Coast we 've got four in our team it 's team is just just downsized recently but we 're bringing on two more on Tuesday so we 're gonna have six on the Sunshine Coast and their plan is by the end of this year so over the next couple of months probably to go around 15 okay and what 's your growth trajectory being like over the last say you know fourth I know you say it took you five years to actually get it nailed but what 's that growth been like since then well the vast majority of that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been literally head down so myself and another developer just just head down just just trying to solve the technical problem so we 've only had a commercial company set up about two years ago to actually go out into the market and try and sell this to people and so your back bit of your back story so you were born in Melbourne you 're from Melbourne originally yeah country Victoria so it 's so easy playing and we 're Bethenny 's kids live Lakes Entrance okay I mentioned to you of my family 's all from Afrin salé region I 've spent some time going to school in sales so there 's a lot of six degrees of separation going on I 'm sure there 's a lot of people we both know for sure yeah a lot of my family 's in sale and so you moved from sale and moved to Melbourne is that that way you started your career so yes I moved to Melbourne to go to uni and that that 's where I started my career so my first job out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to join that startup and I was with them for about five years and that was eventually acquired by a US company there was about 30 people I think working for the company when I left and so yeah it was it was a really fun journey I had a really good time and I think that 's where you know the the the the passion for just working in startups you know there 's nothing like the energy and just just the struggle it 's a real roller coaster ride no I think some people are just really really born to it and just love it and thrive thrive from it like you say the struggle yeah and that 's one of the things isn 't it like it is a struggle it 's a day-to-day proposition of just solving one problem after another problem absolutely it 's just will the doors be open next week you know if we got enough cash and you 're always looking at your cash and how far we 're gonna get and just just closing closing that one deal or but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lot of fun it 's a lot of fun well I mean I 've I lived on the Sunshine Coast for many years and and ultimately moved away but now sort of looking at moving back again but over the last 20 or so years that I 've been in and around the Sunshine Coast I 've seen it grow amazingly and there 's some of the infrastructure that we 're seeing now at the smart city and the CBD with stuff that 's happening the International Airport that 's happening I mean you would have seen that growth particularly over the last five years yeah look absolutely and it 's all great too it 's just gonna attract more and more talent to the region which is which is really you know for people doing startups and then it 's got the Sunshine Coast uni the Innovation Centre out there they 're just doing amazing stuff so Sunshine Coast is a real hot spot for for innovation and it 's a wonderful place and as I said it 's a much deeper talent pool I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent

    "text": "hello world its Lee Kelson coming to you from Maroochydore on the Sunshine Coast on behalf of invest Sunshine Coast and I 'm here with Phil Reardon from school zine how I felt I 'm good thanks that 's good so Phil just give us a little bit of your background and then we 'll have a talk about school zine and and how did you sort of come about into school zing okay one from the UK I left school went into to the commodity trading markets so I was a cocoa trader for a few years about 1988 my brother was over here trading bond markets and was saying you got to come over you got to come over have a look so I came over for two week holiday got a job stayed stayed in the markets for a number of years when self employed in the markets and then in 1999 they shut the floors down and it all went computerized so I thought I 'm gonna go up to Sunshine Coast get away from computers I don 't want to work have anything to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade into the European markets but the internet access here was so poor it just couldn 't be done and I saw a course at the local uni University Sunshine Coast where I went down there did a year 's course in multimedia came up some ideas had a couple of false starts then was I had a company that was producing just just tell us about the false starts what were the false starts okay so I 'm started a multimedia company with someone I met at a course didn 't really get on that well so we decided to go our own ways took half the business which was producing media for the craft market out and started using email marketing and pumped into a principal one day yeah and that principal was struggling to communicate and I said all have you ever tried using it email marketing system took an email marketing system that we were labeling at the time into the school so if it 'd make a difference and it made a big impact straightaway and this is 12 years ago I was still using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't a problem the problem was that the person tasked with the job was someone in the admin room and it was generally a female not being drugged it famous was 55 years old on average and had basic computer skills so it was a task that was challenging for her she was very time poor because they would band-aiding knees looking after the prints poured in and with with parents and so we decided to take that laborious task of formatting the content which was taking her days away from her and build a publishing engine to do it for them and it come it was kind of born from that and we 've built it out into a pretty big platform there at handles all digital media going out from the school whether it be the website the app or newsletters and yet we 're just growing and growing or growing it and and you 've grown it all from here at the base in Maroochydore we started off at the Innovation Center the Sunshine Coast we were there for you certainly supposed to be there for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years there 's no such thing as a two years that 's a long incubator yeah there 's no such thing as two years anymore it 's ten or nothing yeah and we moved out probably three years ago into this Center here and so since then how many people you 'll be employing here on the coast we employ around about 45 46 yeah and you 've expanded into international markets now you 're in the UK yep we 've opened an office two years ago in stratford-upon-avon in the Midlands of the UK I 've got about three staff there and they 're ticking along nicely and we 've just opened up an office in Bangkok to handle Southeast Asia and how many schools have you got onboard here in Australia we 're up to about a thousand in Australia so pretty good number that 's 10% of the market and competition other competition coming into this market particularly in Australia or other paths the world what competition can be anything from a lady that sits on the PNC that is a graphic designer all the way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition in the u.s. coming out the u.s. it 's no one that we 've found that actually has everything under the one login often there 's three or four logins to different pieces of software but that 's going to change and so you mentioned that you came up to the Sunshine Coast after the the you know the markets changed and went computerized why the Sunshine Coast well actually what happened was I took a road trip with my brother and we went all the way up to Makai and on the way back I actually stopped off at Sunshine Beach and I got really burnt I 'm a palm and the white skin and I only have to look at the Sun and like I get burned and drove up on to bad room and it was just a little bit cooler right so I thought oh this is nice I 'm gonna drove into Mooloolaba and it was beautiful so yeah I thought this is the spot and so what 's what 's next for school Zayn ah that 's a good question I I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we want to bring we want to keep innovating so we want to keep bringing in new channels for communication into the one platform and I guess keep expanding overseas you know there 's you know 10,000 schools in Australia there 's 32 thousand in the UK there 's a hundred and thirty thousand in the u.s. 1.3 million in India China is a big market especially international schools so Southeast Asia is going to be predominantly international schools are we looking at but we 're talking to some of the government departments in Thailand in a moment so from the infrastructure perspective on the Sunshine Coast how long have you actually been on the Sunshine Coast now as a company or person since 2000 so 18 years so you would have seen some pretty dramatic changes in terms of you see buddy the new smart city the recent announcement of the submarine cable come in yeah yeah yeah Sunshine Coast is a is definitely a good place to set up a business cost wise it 's a lot lower than the big cities it 's a great place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids so you get that real balance you know two of my kids were born here and one was here from a very young age so they were all Sunshine Coast kids one of you kids actually is part of this young Mecca is part of the bait city presenter team based up here on the Sunshine Coast so for those that have seen the the young fella with the big hair that 's that 's Magnus used to have hair like that a long time ago yeah sure he did yeah so I think it 's pretty exciting times really on the Sunshine Coast particularly I was talking to some people over the last couple of days obviously but you know the new CBD the smart city stuff that 's going in and then that submarine cable connection he 's going to open up a whole raft of opportunities yeah yeah yeah yes massive I mean there 's I heard there were more projects going on on the Sunshine Coast than anywhere else in the country yeah so you know the airport the hospital you know yeah yeah fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in where 's the best place what 's your website its WWE schools in comm yeah I 'm and Linkedin feel feel ridden just look me up all right Phil thanks very much it 's been a pleasure talking to you again and all the best with schools in thanks fight is"

    "text": "hello world it 's Lee Kelson from Beach City coming to you on behalf of invest Sunshine Coast and I 'm here with Darrell Edwards who is the deputy head of script Howard Darryl yeah great thanks Lee how are you I 'm very well made I 'm welcome to it 's fantastic to be here again and it 's good to see the Sun starting to come out here on the Sunshine yeah well the Sunshine Coast isn 't all about weather and beaches it 's about getting done and and what we 're doing in terms of supporting innovation and entrepreneurship well that 's exactly what we want to talk to you about today so I know you 're Deputy Chair of script so tell us what what what is script and how did script evolve our script is an innovation program that evolved with the support of advance Queensland funding it evolved out of a collaboration between councils RDA and about 30 businesses and the opportunity was provided by advanced Queensland to invest a million dollars which was co funded by the other government partners in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to identify projects and opportunities that will help support entrepreneurs and innovators on the Sunshine Coast today we 've funded about eight such projects and some of those are complete and some of those are still in progress what that does is support innovators and entrepreneurs at all levels so at the startup and scale up and then also existing businesses or existing businesses who are trying to innovate and improve their business and and you mentioned at the beginning it 's not all about lifestyle and sunshine and everything else I mean there really is a serious sort of Technology vibe happening here have you seen it evolve over the last 10 or so years you know I 've mainly been involved in the last two years after leaving a major bank and working with RTA and it was a surprise to me how active and collaborative the ecosystem was when I first came upon it I was mainly dealing in larger business before but on the Sunshine Coast there 's a vibrant active Tech digital hub an innovation hub alive and well and thriving on the Sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any early-stage company or you know the development of ecosystems community is important mentors are important but also investment is important so what have you seen of sort of happening in terms of investment and what 's what 's coming up in terms of investment yeah sure twelve months ago the RDA was involved with council and others and Innovation Center actually with their annual pitch comp and knowing that there 's a lot of dormant cash out there on the Sunshine Coast what we did was try and and bring the investors together with the entrepreneurs at a lunch and at a pitch comp so people could get excited about innovation in entrepreneurship that 's already happening on the Sunshine Coast so what we 're trying to do is connect capital with opportunity was really well supported we got some really good feedback from that what we actually did then was created a database of people who are interested in investing in startups and an evolution from that is a small group getting together to startups Sunshine Coast angels which will eventually be a op it 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale ups ones that are already generating revenue and are looking for cash to grow their business so when we talk about angel investors a lot of people ask me what exactly is an angel in your in your view what what is an angel investor somebody who 's prepared to take a lot more risks than your traditional traditional investments in in shares hence the angel yeah and a lot of them have experience either in business themselves and can bring can be mentors but also can be can assist that business grow through strategies as well as cash flow as well as investment cash and you know it 's it 's seed money therefore it 's a lot higher risk not all angel investments work and that 's why they have to be prepared to take on a bit higher risk angel investing is being like it 's sort of throwing the proverbial at the wall and seeing some of it hopefully some of it sticks yes and it 's it 's not about picking winners it 's about having a balanced portfolio of opportunities across different industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the innovator yeah rather than the idea your honor the entrepreneur innovator and their team and their ability to bring that idea to life so if you 're an early stage company and you 're trying to identify whether you qualify for an angel I mean again I get asked that question a lot it 's like how do I know whether I 'm ready for a knight you know like I haven 't I 've only got an idea at the moment well angel investors investing that angel investors won 't invest in an idea but there are programs on the Sunshine Coast that help people with ideas startup on ramp is about to launch which has been funded by script and supported by script there 's innovation master class which Colin Graham is doing up at noosa there 's different pitching programs which have also been introduced to help entrepreneurs so if you 've got an idea I would suggest you contact either the Innovation Center or mainly the Innovation Center and they 'll direct you to the right area so you start up on ramp can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startup on ramp is a 12-week program for people who have an idea about a best business or a product and it 's a 12-week program they meet every couple of weeks it 's what do you call it when they 've gotta you know but they 've got a mentor and a program director who takes them through the stages of setting up a business and then they graduate at the end they 've either decided that it 's a great idea and they 're going to take it further or they 've they 've thrown in the can okay okay okay and and you mentioned the innovation master class where 's that taking place Graham is running that out of new sir and that 's for established businesses who are who are to use a term pivot pivoting or or have I changing the direction of their business yeah and it 's again it 's a mentored program structured program that helps support business owners to change the way they 're doing business or come up launched a new product or yeah okay well so fantastic the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time today I appreciate it thanks thanks fine thank you geez"

    "text": "and hello world is Lee Kelson coming to you live from downtown Maroochydore on behalf of investor Sunshine Coast and I found this guy wandering around the streets swag me I dragged you in here and said come and talk to me Simon net from pix moto how are you good man really good that 's good what 's with the what 's with the weather out there oh and you know what I kind of like it out it Chinese is up a bit it 's been pretty dry no it is good myk 's myk 's we couldn 't do that interviews outside but you know we 're all other punches we do we do so we 're in the boardroom we like to try and do things outside in the fresh air but it 's been pretty wet so everything needed a good drink and and everything 's looking a lot greener and better for it so so Simon you 've got an interesting story I know that you spent some time over in Boulder and we 'll touch on that in a bit but for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the Simon App Store Simon app story I started down a fairly interesting road oh I I 'm a qualified accountant and one of those that explained the number crisis so there 's that weird quota soft and then I realized pretty early on it was something that I a skill that I wanted to have but something that I didn 't really want to do full-time but then I even went deeper and I was a forensic accountant Wow nice to chase money launderers right so I used to find all the financial dead Bali bodies yeah right okay well I worked in after a while and that got me to the to the UK so I spent some time over there and work for Tesco over there and launched their online shopping back in 1999 right Wow okay they 're totally dating back in 99 and that was that was the forerunner for the for the you know online environment they were one of the first entries with Amazon yep so helped did was where I was a business analyst and so at a time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of taste of what retails all about right and that was sort of the trigger that was the flick in the brain it was like okay this is this is the thing that it probably is gonna be a little bit more exciting than counting zeroes once yeah yeah Admiralty Bridge version is that I came back did some more forensics back here and you knows but went to the Middle East for four years and open up desire return in the Middle East okay so that was sort of on the background that tells Tesco thing and yeah what a phenomenal company now yeah they 're just mind lies so they 're not a course they 're a fashion company but the realities is there a supply and logistics company whose shipments everywhere have you stopped every store in the world run so they rely on a fast-moving fashion business that 's what it really means is that it 's high turnover of new stock no wastage so they revolutionized that industry and I was really fortunate to work with them and opened up one of their stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of stuck with me and drew us during that time that I thought was about time havoc wrapping something on my own and came back and did some consulting back here in Brisbane and through that process saw that video was starting to appear in the landscape yep which was very expensive to produce you know you know the background yeah for years and years people were trying to use that as a medium to engage audiences online but prohibitively expensive horribly expensive especially for a retailer so the traditional model was go to agent do a brief big production team before you know it 's a hundred grand for a 30-second spot yeah which just blows the budget apart today you can get a video made for two a knife grant yep so the economies of scale were so I started to see that trend again it was your office 's YouTube was huge but I start to see very tireless trying to embrace that as a meme again so that was the trigger for me too from the retail side was hang on I get me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage people and you want to sell your products that 's really what you want yeah people to buy the product it 's in the video but it was a really terrible buying experience in a digital world to close down browsers search for the product name and had you know it Paul that time in the digital world you know if within ten seconds you haven 't got a much dead yep you don 't so that well the Flickr found it you don 't grab him in that first yeah there 's a couple of flicks yep they 're gone yeah 5,000 messages a day we get on those devices so if you miss him you 're gonna wait four thousand nine hundred nine nine times together well I saw an interesting statistic the other day and I think it was 500 thousand videos per minute get uploaded time you get to YouTube alone yeah yeah there are they 're a monster yep smart buy by Google yeah and look there it 's interesting it 's a great it 's a great place to consume and watch content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know America 's Got Talent or you know a small little series or something like that in that world great but from a retail point of view it 's not a great transactional platform no because it 's friction I want you to keep watching videos yes but I want you by and I know what your lady it 's the same thing with Facebook yeah you know advertising on Facebook 's great but it 's a wall garden for a reason yeah I want you there to stage time on Facebook yeah so I 'm just just touching on that from the YouTube perspective I someone spoke to someone a couple of weeks ago and they are making comment about the fact that you know it 's just YouTube is so huge and it is like behemoth but there is so much there and it 's almost like you know we 're at the point where we need to start looking at curation of that how do we stand till soon it 's it 's not organizing it oh wow found itself hard so we 're structuring YouTube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do run they want unstructured toward to an extent so you see Facebook 's now bringing out Facebook watch so they 're trying to bring that same environment in there what underpins that model is ads so they 're they 're they want you on there because the more the longer you 're on there the more ads they can serve and that 's their model that 's an ad based model and it 's very similar for a lot of the video environments in today 's world and digital world it 's pretty real it 's there to serve ads over their content they 're trying a couple of different avenues but look I 've got an opinion that I think that 's changing and changing pretty fast I think the new generation are not ad watches because I won 't brought up an hour era where if you 're watching television well it watched ads well it 's it 's old Seth Seth Godin 's Industrial TV complex your hunt yeah very exactly well exactly what it is it 's mess produce mess advertise mess cell mass produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're now moving we 've moved into the winter the world of Nicias now without question and so I was just gonna say so that sort of with it you know I know that I get I get you know mid-roll pre-roll ads it unless it 's really engaging I 've got to tell you you 're not getting me back if you put an ad in the middle of a five minute YouTube video unless I 'm really really needing to watch it where that you know I 'm like guitar lesson and I 'm halfway through it and I have to say it but if it 's just a you know an interesting video or something that caught my attention and it gets ahead in the middle I 'm gone I don 't and look I think that that 's permeating across every generation and I think is unique to the Millennials or the next generation but unfortunately there 's no other alternative there 's no other model yeah and that 's where we 're trying to bring that into so when you say we that 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it 's not it 's not a rocket science business it 's really about bringing the two channels of video mediums with e-commerce so that impulse bringing it allowing that consumer to buy that product they like while they 're watching no pre-roll if you 're engaged with the content we provided in an unobtrusive way to allow for you to buy the food ingredients for the food recipe well you might actually be using a instant pot pressure cooker so we allow you to buy that cooker directly while you 're watching the content but a really unobtrusive we give the control over to the user there is an open and close feature so if you want to watch it without the e-commerce functionality or I 'll switch it off okay so it 's about giving back control to the to the users first and foremost but really helping I think brands achieving their what the outcome is sell products yeah you know you can advertise to your heart 's content but there 's no metrics to be able to match that to that person was inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements you know putting a desk together painting a wall etc yeah to connect that to they bought because I inspired them a point in time so that 's what we 're building that 's the technology but we 're also building an infrastructure now so it 's more than it 's a network we want to try and eliminate we 're never going to eliminate and goal really is about providing an ultimate way for advertisers to reach consumers to sell products right which is what everybody 's trying to do I think so yeah everyone is it is but it 's hard it 's really hard because it 's it 's such an ingrained business model in the digital world but I think there 's a couple of external pressures that are helping drive change so I want to talk about that and I want to talk about Peaks moto but will will will snap it there and then we 'll come back for part two great"

    "text": "and so here we are back for part two with the Simonet from society toes about to we were just talking about pics moto and you were telling us what pics moto does but i am interested in the the story about pics moto i know that you went to Boulder can you tell us what he 's doing there was a it was a really fascinating experience we we sort of got into the market with the product at our usual build measure learn if you 're not embarrassed by the first product you put in the market took too long it took us six weeks to build that first prototype got it in there did some testing and during that time we got on the radar of a accelerator program called burn town and Bolla yep and they asked us to apply you know I was unusual they were fairly early in their journey textiles is obviously the big one in Boulder yeah but that one here on the scene we went through the interview process and we got accepted which was interesting at the time where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not something they were really had on our radar screen but we couldn 't enter back yeah you know I 'd heard about tech stars and I 'd heard about accelerator program so I wanted to embrace myself and also watch and I could you know Bruton and based myself there and we went into the program I put it down almost it 's one of the best things I 've done in my corporate career it 's a little mini MBA yeah that 's what it is yeah intense hardcore 13 weeks day-in day-out putting your idea in your business model under stress yep which really you know from an entrepreneurial perspective that you should be doing all the time anyway you 're constantly stretch constantly stress testing the model bro yeah and and and that was the thing when it when what I loved about it was that in day to day outside of that environment you you you aspire to do that you aspired a continually road test and check and validate yep but doesn 't really happen like that most the time most people get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point this one was no it was every day yeah you got off a father clause yep and you had to tell them Julian Yeah right I can so and that was great it was very there was no another those eight other teams yeah and then it was all about demo day and we did a pitch in front of you know six hundred people of Boulder Theatre and then that was an incredible list so I mean I you know I went to Boulder and I met you guys at boomtown and actually did some at us Toby and Jose if you 're interested in boomtown check it out we 're on our YouTube page just search for boomtown and you see really interesting are they 're great they 're really good guys and they 're quite visionary is to do what are doing until a big risk and no cost stadium ball though because I want to immerse myself in the culture and the can you show you did yeah it 's gonna side pretty good screen pretty good bike riding pretty good bike running in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what you do that 's what you on that and look I loved it any DS it 's a it 's a very unique community there 's only you know I had the people the students to there 's a hundred thousand people it yeah in the population so take the students out thirty five thousand of them yeah that 's sixty five thousand so it 's tight it 's a really tight community but it really has got a great culture I was just gonna say so let 's just talk about that about community because I want to cover off you know the obviously the Sunshine Coast adhere you got here but you know you 've got some pretty interesting views on community and what makes ecosystem tick yeah it 's hot really it 's about hard that 's that 's what it 's about it 's about there 's a philosophy that they deploy other cookie first and it really is it 's hard to live because it does force you to just do something without any expectation of return whatsoever yeah and the meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can I help ya and they genuinely first say how can I help you I mean it yeah and if if you ask for their help they 'll follow up yep I 'll action it immediately without very any little expect I see a lot of people in Australia using hashtag give first I see the hashtag around it 's a bit disappointing for me to be honest okay I don 't because I think you know I get it I wants to espouse that they understand what that true meaning is yeah I can if I hadn 't lived it it would have been hard to live it right if I hadn 't have been immersed in the community and culture and had so many positive experiences with people who do live that as a mantra I don 't think I would have understood it yeah you think it 's official here there you are I think just it 's not it 's hard to put words it 's not superficial it 's just I don 't think that the emotion has really been tied to the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state of our ecosystem and our community here which is probably a little bit more less mature than what Boulder is oh well certainly I mean it 's we 're still we 're still immature we 're we 're taking baby steps yeah whereas boulders running marathons yeah you know so it 's it 's it 's a timing thing and I think it 's an educational thing and look I think it 's great that we still use the term because it needs to form part of a thriving community is this you know give first because that 's an emotional that 's an energy thing for me and I think that is what fuels a really vibrant community yeah so you obviously base yourself on the Sunshine Coast yeah and you run Peaks moto from from here so we 've got teams in in the Philippines teams and South American teams in the US okay and I base myself in the Sunshine Coast cuz I holidayed here as a kid and we spent a lot of time in Mooloolaba yeah then when I came back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where do I gonna wanna base myself don 't want to go to Sydney in there on a Melbourne and I 'm out I bought some property up here you know ten years ago right so well yeah when kids Sunshine Coast a crack and I 've heard really positive things about what was happening up here in terms of their startup community yeah and so I wanted to come check it out and want to deed all I was like I was super impressed I just could feel it was it felt a lot like boner yeah it really did it turned there wasn 't that big city mentality over running the the current of the activities it was very community I could the word just instantly grabbed me happy yeah and so I just decided why not yeah you know I can be really anywhere in the world that 's the beauty of a technology company you don 't have to be in any city anywhere so I travel quite regularly back to the US and I 'm about to go to the Philippines in November December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've we took a very considered approach again I suppose it was very different to a to maybe a lot of other startup journeys and how a lot of other startups approach it we took a very considered approach we didn 't raise a lot of money we didn 't go and say we 're gonna do five million bucks right out of the gate yeah maybe that 's the old accountant in me man you know the conservative you can take this boy out of the account well I mean I you know I suppose I get a little frustrated that we continue to wear this how much we 've raised as a badge of honor and we 're not really well its concerns me I 'm sure that the business models are you know based around drop of driving revenues but in good times it 's okay to raise capital us but you and I both been through that common period where people were throwing money at early-stage companies and then when it when when the hit the fan and everybody stopped handing out money and investment then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainable and and that 's my concern I think and that 's why we didn 't want to do we 've raised the amount of money that we needed to continue to get us to where we thought the market needed to be and the signals you know we just raised closed around six weeks ago yeah but again it wasn 't a big round you know when people ask me how much do you rise and said enough yeah yeah because for me it 's about that it 's about and we 're growing rapidly we 've not good now good and thousand videos in our library they 're all in our format grow and we 're building a marketplace around brands being able to access and tap that to sell their products okay so it 's about it 's the Czar model yes it 's our model basically where I 've got new videos coming into the marketplaces every day yep that in the recipe list there of 10 ingredients well there are 10 brands that might want to sell their products in that experience right so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketplace for brands looking to sell their products in recipe videos yep so we 're we 're on our journey with I think we 've taken that next step up you know we are global we 've got you know teams in the US yep here and and look it 's it 's an exciting time so just to wrap up because I mean we we might have to do part three yeah that 's okay I mean we can always you know throwing so into the edit suite and you know down to 15 seconds so the 15 seconds it makes any sense but I do want to I do want to talk to you about the the recent announcement irrationally the let 's do the submarine cable etc so um we 'll come back and do parts right"

    "text": "and here 's Lake else apart three the rocky series the rocky 10 yeah but there 's there 's some interesting stuff that we we do want to talk about and that is the recent announcement on the Sunshine Coast of the submarine cable and I know you 've got some some stuff so you know we 're not gonna basement so far they 've made a decision to stay and obviously connecting with the Sunshine Coast Council here and phenomenal team here there really are a driving force of you know the success of the industry he and they let me know about the submarine project and what I thought about that I was just blown away I was so excited that such a global project would be running out of Sunshine Coast I think it really is going to put Sunshine Coast in that business map rather than just a tourist destination yeah but having been in Boulder I was fortunate enough to one of my mentors during boomtown was Agathe and I 'm Scott Brown who started a accelerator program fund about cable apps the u.s. cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement of the submarine cable are gonna start a accelerator program out here they 're gonna bring that program down on the Sunshine Coast okay fantastic indeed based here and chose not to go to Sydney Melbourne or Brisbane it was Sunshine Coast right and why was it they decided to come to the Sunshine Coast well the submarine cable project was the major runner site but but when the guys came out here this is Bala yeah I was you know these guys live in Boulder and they 're like wow yeah this has the makings of a new Boulder yeah so they just loved again that the support they got the moment that connected him with the Sunshine Coast Council though very welcoming and understanding and very professional and there wasn 't a lot of red tape around it they really enjoyed that and I can tell you having dealt with cattle loves that which is a industry fund yeah there 's a lot of red tape those guys but so and so when you talk about their accelerator what 's their accelerating around is it it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the true word of acceleration for me I think sometimes can get a little bit lost you know you 've got your incubators which is an idea of getting turning an idea and to making sure that it 's market ready and then the acceleration is growing so that 's what happens here in this drone market but that 's fueled a lot by here 's five million bucks grow yep that 's the acceleration part yeah which sometimes you can accelerate in the wrong direction yeah or you can accelerate too fast yeah and and and the wheels fall off yeah and I think I 've seen I 've seen examples of where you know companies think they 've got market fit they 've been you know trying to find that market fit and then I think okay we 've got market fit now let 's go and pump the foot on the accelerator pump a heap of money into it and go and then sort of all of a sudden you burn in cash and you 're three or four months down the track and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again it 's not right or wrong it 's just a different way these guys approaching in a you know they don 't talk about how much money you raised it 's about getting you to your enterprise and they 've all contracts right but not just getting you to the contract it 's about working news through that the completion of the probe of the contract an actual revenue so these guys work very hard in the US where they 've obviously because it 's a cable labs owned entity they connect them into their partners their members and which is we 're gonna try and replicate that down here and it 's about walking them through so for example if you 've got a great bit of tech that you think he 's an enterprise-level will they 'll run a proof-of-concept and up ramp will be the stake holder as they walk you into the specific company that wants to run the proof-of-concept okay and I 'll manage it from end to end right so they 'll put the performance metrics they 'll do the meetings they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a success rather than let 's go and raise some more money yep so it 's exciting when they 're bringing two teams from the US two teams from Asia and two locally well and so what 's the time frame of that again 13 weeks I think that at this stage launching September next year those killer next year fantastic so it is exciting and look I think those you know that 's gonna the submarine produce gonna spark a lot of additional things like that yeah I think we are going to see a real bump in you know the business community and these sort of projects hitting that hitting the the sands he yeah and which is super exciting for the community ya know it 's fantastic so Simon it 's been a pleasure mate you know we can talk forever I think it 's exciting times for the Sunshine Coast there 's no doubt about that and I think the you know the the CableLabs and the announcement of the submarine cable but not only that I think just all the the other infrastructure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably centigrades form this whole whole region isn 't it 100% it 's very exciting and pressure mmm thanks babe good talking to you thanks"

    "text": "hello world its Lee Kelson coming to you live from the boarding office co-working space inboard museum in Mooloolaba on the Sunshine Coast and I 'm here on behalf of investor Sunshine Coast and I 've got with me Daniel MacKinnon from app Factory how are you Daniel I 'm great how are you I 'm good mate we 're just checking out this amazing an old surfer dude this is this is pretty impressive yeah it 's a great I love this place it 's um yeah we 've had a we 've had a few homes they 've all been good we 've sent when we moved to Sunshine Coast we 're at the Innovation Center for a while which was great then we had our own office for a little while before moving in here those other places are all great but this kind of feels like home to us especially me loving the beach and getting down the road to Malabar for a swim at lunchtime yeah it 's a pretty fantastic way to be it 's fantastic and so just before we talk about app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through what is this this is like a Museum of long boards and all sorts of different boards yeah so it 's run by a guy called Keith Griezmann from local from here on the coast and he 's an avid surfer and good collector obviously so we have a cafe downstairs which is just about to reopen and people are more than welcome to come in and have a look at the boards and walk around whenever they they want there 's a great collection it 's all split into the different eras in the decades and one of our wings is all the seventies boards and stuff so yeah if you 're interested in surfing at all come check it out well I can say that you know you you know you 're getting old when you can identify so a couple of little twenties out there I remember there was one of my first boards so yeah definitely if you 're in Molalla bar check out this place and it 's also a co-working facility as well yeah so there 's a number of different businesses here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know talk to each other and network and and it 's a really great place to be in a really great environment yeah and so you were just telling me off-camera that you originally from New Zealand yeah yeah yeah so I grew up in New Zealand but I did the last couple of years of school down in Brisbane and then I did my university degree in software engineering and computer science down at Griffith University before straight after University heading off to London has lots of big with maybe a year or two in mind and about nine years later made the trip back into Australia and into Sydney before so I spent now that seven or eight years in Sydney before heading up to here about six years ago right and the app Factory tell us about the air Factory yeah so that Factory was launched I was working as a you know software architect in you know big corporate gigs and about the same time that I was starting to get really sick of it they were also you know the the million dollar projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people moved towards a different way of doing things and you know more agile approach and it was around the same time that the mobile app world was really taking off at Factory started in 2009 around the same time that the App Store launched so we 've been doing this as long as anybody 's been doing this yeah and it really did start as a side project and just got to be heaps and heaps of fun and we got more involved and then it became you know a full-time full-time gig for what we were doing and since we really did start as a as a sort of a project house they would do traditional you know you come to us and we build your mobile applications but over the years especially the last two or three years we 've really evolved and we 're starting to what we 've been building our own projects so now we do about probably about half our workers on our own projects and half of our work is on his own client projects but we tend to focus in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really where my interest is especially in things like like health we do a lot of work with the Sunshine Coast Council as well as the ocean Gympie and some other councils with regards to water safety from waste water systems and and how they 're produced so we we like to use that technology to do those sorts of things yeah and so the decision to relocate to the Sunshine Coast where how did that come about well we were living in Sydney in Bondi at the time in a fairly small two-bedroom apartment yeah we had a through nearly three year old boy and we had another one on the way and it was really a decision point where we ran we can 't live in this unit anymore with the second one on the way we did live Bondi Sydney was getting a bit much in terms of the hecticness and the craziness of it but to be honest the main thing was we can 't afford to buy a big place near the beach that 's going to do it and I love the beach as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah and I was like I really want to live near the beach and so we actually came up here for a Christmas holiday with my wife 's parents and my wife 's in media she 's a journalist so she does quite a lot of television work right so the main driver was we think we need to be in Sydney or Melbourne for her work and while we were up here she got a bunch of calls for TV appearances and she said I can 't do it cuz I 'm on the Sunshine Coast and they said don 't worry just go down there and we 'll do a cross and it 'll be fine and we went oh that 's interesting so then we said um then we said let 's give it a year and that was six years ago I haven 't looked back fantastic and so the growth of the business in that six years what is that has there been a positive growth curve for you it 's been an up-and-down journey to be honest it 's been a you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive yeah what it 's really meant is that we 've really focused on the things that we want to do and that the things that we want to be building and we and we 've got rid of the the noise of just doing projects to get the money in the door obviously money in the doors really important yeah but it 's allowed us to because it 's you know it 's insightly unconventional place to try and grow business I guess hopefully it won 't be in the future but at the moment it was a bit of a risk yeah so it 's really enabled us to focus on what we wanted and what we wanted to build in those areas like I said before of that safety health and accessibility so we actually we actually um had to had to leave a few clients just because we wanted to focus on the things that we really wanted to do so we kept some of our great clients in the areas of of medical there 's a great Sunshine Coast based business got many mobile that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of work with the deaf and hearing-impaired out of a company down in Brisbane and with all the council stuff that I mentioned so it 's enabled us to really focus on what we wanted to do and not worry so much about fighting in the rat race yeah that makes sense I think you know my experience is is always a compromise when you start a new business that you you know you you you this work and things that do projects that you really want to do and then there 's the get the work through the door and yeah and and sort of just for the purpose of cash flow cash flows King right exactly um and there 's a bit of an element of CEA 's sort of feel like you sell your soul sometimes just to get the work through the door yeah there was a little bit of that I think it was more about living here and moving here and the point of doing it and if I found myself in the office twelve thirteen hours a day I was like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere if I 'm living here I need to be taking advantage of it yeah so that focus I was saying okay I want to get out for a surf or I want to go home and swim to pull with the kids where I want to do that was a real driver behind the change and that change was also about not just the type of work but the type of people who we wanted to work with yeah so everyone who we work with now from clients project partners staff contractors like they 're just a lovely bunch of people and it just makes life so much I think someone famously said business would be so much easier if it didn 't have staff and yeah yeah and so you know in terms of obviously you know Sunshine Coast affords people a fantastic lifestyle but you know I 'm seeing now you know there 's some serious infrastructure being put in the submarine cable government the announcement last week you know so how do you see that it 's an exciting time for the Sunshine Coast how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connectivity to the rest of the world and customers and export of your products and what you do I mean you know how does that work with living on the Sunshine Coast well I think that there 's a couple of things about that I mean we 're we 're obviously incredibly connected and and I probably wouldn 't have moved the business here if it really if I really had to be based somewhere physical I didn 't I didn 't expect that actually so much of my business would be locally based here which is which is was a very pleasing surprise but it really means that we work as a as a fairly distributed team and in different locations so having this lifestyle and being able to still work with you know the smartest people wherever they might be yeah is one of the advantages of it and in terms of the community and and you know you said recently there 's been a lot and I moved here six years ago but I also have spoken to many people have been here a lot longer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're moving towards a real digital driven economy yeah we 're moving there and it 's and and it 's always had a really good core group of people behind it sort of pushing it but it 's never looked like a reality and I feel like in the last 12 months it 's starting to really look like a reality and there 's you know what I like about this is that you know I think we can go I 'm you know love to be involved in the local community especially the technology community and things and you know the fact that you can go to a to it a really nerdy coding meet up at the new Perugian digital hub and there 's like a hundred people there yeah Sunshine Coast or that you go to the Silicon Coast meetup and there 's nothing there 's like 1,300 or people something like that yeah in that group and for a small community that 's a pretty impressive there 's a pretty impressive numbers and pretty impressive involvement and engagement yeah and so for people that want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best place to find you come and check out the surfboard is in every kind of check out the surfboard museum that 's that 's a must yeah we 're on that factory comm today you or you know look us up on on Twitter or leapin Leon like doing I 'm always I 'm always open the thing what we 're doing you know as I said we we are a bit quirky in terms of what we like to do we we 're not your traditional project house but what we love because what we 're good we 're quite technical and we love building really cool stuff what we love is people who are experts in their area or in their industry who have identified a need or if someone has a wonderful idea that they think it 's really great like like we 're more than willing to talk people through and form these partnerships and yeah and we 're about we 're about long-term partnerships and building things because we know what we do really really well yeah and you know we 're not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like so if we can pull in you know people with great ideas or you know the waste water project that we 're doing with the council is a classic example of someone in an industry that I would never have thought of who came in to see us and said look this is a problem there 's a problem with these systems in the country and we can solve it and I and we could bring our ideas and say this is our you know we know technology and this is how we think it can be applied to help your problem yeah and that 's you know I 've been a wonderful partnership that as I said is now in now and for local councils and growing Wow so that 's just one example of you know of working within the local community and getting on board but that 's what stuff that 's awesome Daniel be a pleasure mate we can keep talking keep those attention so yeah definitely if you 're in a little bar check out the the board factory and the well.they offices at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure yeah and check out the app factory comdata you keep watching for more from the entrepreneurial series on Sunshine Coast great thanks everybody cheese"

    "text": "hello world ously Kelson coming to you from the rainy Sunshine Coast of who Sheldon under here from the Ryan at the moment and I 'm here with the managing director of intake Chris Carver how are you Chris I 'm really well yourself I 'm well mate that 's good I thought I was I thought we were gonna have some beautiful sunshine today we need the rain to keep it nice and green and lush so Chris intake can you tell us about intake yeah so in tags a company built on the Sunshine Coast and we 've been around for about six years now and one of the things that we 're really wanting to do is help customers with their digital transformation journey and really help them take take the grasp of new technologies and be able to implement them into their business and really make a significant difference for them and so you just mentioned to me off-camera that you started life sort of as a major Telstra partner yes can you can you tell us a little bit about that journey how you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a business you know we started kind of as a legacy Telstra partner delivering key core services so you know just your normal internet and telephony and mobile services but over the last couple of years we 've really looked at how we can explore further with customers and really take them on kind of those cloud for strategies and give them access to world-class technologies here from the Sunshine Coast that other you know fortune 500 companies are using and great products and services out there that they can take advantage of right now and really change their business and make some really big gains and allow them to compete and be really relevant in the market today so I found a cloud computing company PRM cloud solutions some time ago back in the early 2000s and everyone was saying people were never going to move their data to the cloud have you seen that change I think you know you did it you 're an innovator and and and a really scary probably cutting edge then go back so it was it I was mad but yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think you know you look at the change you look at change in policy from government you look at even where you know major cloud players are placing their data now and making sure that it is in Australia so you know it meets all the specifications from the governments and all that type of thing the options are far greater now and the security of of those places are far better than holding it on Prem but also the access to those so the accesses is improved dramatically from what we had back in the early 2000s when you know you would have been running on quite slow links you know the speed of links has been rapidly increasing over the last few years to give access to that I think one of the advantages that comes with the cloud is the ability to easily integrate other applications that bring applications together and obviously using API is do you work what sort of applications do you work with to do integrations yeah that 's that 's mainly what our business is so we look at bringing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go canvas your office 365 's your Microsoft 365 and bringing those to really work together with other key systems at a customer perhaps they might have a key CRM where they might have a key database or something like that and making sure that those all linked together and so that the people on the road can be using a world-class application to easily input that information but then seamlessly drop that information into a finance system or wherever an ordering system or wherever it needs to go so that that is allowed a lot of people to also consume that on a different way so instead of having to go out and buy a big lot of software because you don 't know where you 're gonna head and what that could be in two years you 're able to gradually move with it and you 're able to take it as you need it and you know that as a service model has really changed how we consume dutter and how we use it so I mean I lived on the Sunshine Coast nearly 20 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away but kept it kept a keen eye on what 's happening here I said very very rapidly turning into us pretty significant technology hub and there 's a lots of activity around early-stage companies but particularly with the infrastructure the recent announcement of the submarine cable I mean for people that don 't understand what that impact is or what that means can you talk us through that yeah well have had the absolute pleasure of living on the Sunshine Coast for 32 years now and you know I 've seen it move from you know one set of traffic lights on Nicklin way to you know everything that we have today and there are some awesome there 's not a better time to be on the Sunshine Coast you know we 've got International Airport coming in got a health precinct that 's absolutely booming but then to add to that is really around that technology space so we 've got the state government the local government that are really encouraging that investment and so you 're getting a really great ecosystem of that startup type business that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money where their mouth isn 't saying hey we will open up opportunities to the rest of the world and that means you know things like the submarine cable that have opened that they 've now got the landing approved for and all that sort of thing and how we link that into the rest of the world is going to be a real one another game changer for the Sunshine Coast and what we 're at integ really about is about how we can take it from you know there 's a startup community but then we 're kind of hoping to be at that next layer where we 're in that you know plus 20 plus 30 employee realm we were able to give people a career into the ICT space and really help develop the younger talent on the Sunshine Coast and we 've been able to bring on a number of young people in our organization I mean really from a diversity point of view look at that as well and we 're really proud of what we 've been able to achieve in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ here now so we 've got 22 of us right now of which 50% female and they provide an ABS it 's been the best change to our business that we have done we 've really sought to do that over the last 18 months and that change has been incredible for our business and if you look at we 've actually gone strength to strength bringing on young young people that are full of energy willing to learn but also give us a really great diversity of thinking and yeah we 're very very proud of our team we just want a national partner award with Telstra last week all around customer excellence and delivery and it 's because of them they 're they 're brilliant that 's fantastic and so I just want to touch on that I mean we hear a lot of talk about startups and you know early-stage companies but really these small to medium businesses and and and some of the larger enterprises sort of 20 to 30 sized businesses I mean they need to be innovating they need to be embracing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well would you agree with that that you know we deal with those customers every single day working with them and that that space is really important because over the next few years if they don 't change there 's there 's a really big impact to that if they don 't change you know they they have a real chance of not being around because of the disruption that 's happening in every single industry that we look at and that that 's everything from agriculture to tourism to wherever you are you really need to look out and go how can I take advantage of this and actually build that and the great thing is you can do it from the Sunshine Coast you can do it from now no sir but you can definitely do it from the Sunshine Coast yeah and the Sunshine Coast is normally sunshine this is an anomaly right in that well I mean I live here and I 've traveled I 've had the opportunity to travel I love traveling but you know always come back here because it 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the International Airport and in and I mean I used to travel out of the Sunshine Coast as well so there 's you know good connections into the major capital cities and it 's pretty easy to get around from from get out of here but what when 's the International Airport gonna take place is how long is that far away is that yeah so it 's not far away at all in fact we we look after the Sunshine Coast Airport end-to-end we provide all of their ICT expectation and do all of their managed services for them and they 've been a great customer and you know as they as they look to expand you know we 're there every step of the way with them and we 're not too far away we 're talking you know 20 20 20 for the the kind of the runway to be ready the expansion of the terminal you know we 're only a couple of years away and spent some time with on the CEO Peter pallet last week and really looking at you know how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get flights to go north you know say the cans or the Makai or Townsville and that sort of thing as well because I think the more that we 're able to do there you know we just we just become more achievable to get to more people who can come here easily and so if people want to get in contact with Integra is the best place to find you if you what 's your website show us our website actually launching relaunching today and rebadging over the next day or two actually so it 's this WWN tag ENT AG calm and you can find us on there you can ring us anytime on one three thousand end tag excellent Chris it 's been a pleasure talking with you all the best and like stay watching because we 'll be coming to you over the next couple of days with more interviews from successful entrepreneurs and business startup is not only startups but obviously more established businesses like in tag it 's Lee Kelson and we 'll be back with more thanks man thank

more formats and up to 80% faster without compromising on design or the integrity of the content that one and so so guys can help you with that I was involved in a council export training workshop last year and we learned how to do 30-second pictures as part of that and it was incredibly helpful right okay so I just want to sort of break that down a little bit so when you talk about content and publishing content what sort of customers and and and you know just sort of expand on that a bit for us okay so it 's basically long format content it works best for it does work well for short format but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it can take quite a long time and so some of our customers are people like manufacturers who are using type of fire to create their big publishing sorry their instructional manuals we also have a lot of standards organizations that user so the International Organization for Standardization actually uses type of fight to produce all its standards its global standards and quite a lot of their member organizations use it as well to adopt those standards and to create their own we also have a lot of international organizations United Nations organizations use us to create their reports and a lot of textbook publishers scientific technical and medical publishers we 're very good for that because we can handle really complex content and we can help them automate a lot of their layout process so that if there are late changes to content they can update things at the source and then run it through typify again and it does all those tricky things like pagination and cross-referencing for them automatically so they don 't have to do that all again if there 's a late change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type if I was founded on the coast in 2001 type of I was actually the first company to go into the newly founded Innovation Center in 2002 at the University so we 're quite proud of that and yeah so we 've been going for 17 years now that 's amazing and you 've got customers like United Nations yeah we certainly do so we have quite a lot of United Nations organizations people like the International Telecommunication Union World Trade Organization World Health Organization we have the International Monetary Fund and there 's a bunch of others as well and and and you build all of that in in international markets all from from here in Maroochydore well yes so our CEO travels a lot so he 's our head sales guy as well and he travels all around the world knocking on doors and just getting to know people and most of typify business does come from word of mouth from other customers and how many people do you employ on the coast here on the coast we have seven and then we also have a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many but it 's slightly less six or seven in Europe and six or seven in the US and then we have a team of engineers and professional services staff in Sri Lanka as well Wow amazing so you get a global organization based out of Maroochydore that 's fantastic and so you obviously have a you have the marketing function and you mentioned that you originally from Tamworth can you tell us a little bit about your story how you arrived here good story so I grew up in Tamworth and I went to university at Bathurst and did journalism there and then after I finished uni I ended up in Sydney so I ended up in communications with a high school and then I went off and became a police radio and sure below operator for five years and as you do and then once that did my head in I ended up going back to marketing and ended up with the job at scouts Australia 's head office in Sydney and then after my husband and I were married in 2010 we decided that we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've been here since 2010 and it 's been fantastic right and you said you 'd never go back no I definitely would never go back I love it here and so what what is it about the you know obviously you 're operating a business globally but also the lifestyle of that Sunshine Coast affords yeah absolutely and I think that 's that 's something that 's really special and unique to the Sunshine Coast that you know we have the capability here to be able to run a global business and we can still just go down the beach on our lunch break if we want to it 's and you know we don 't have the traffic issues we all love it all of us in this office love it and a lot of us have come from other places and just loved being here and you know that I think exciting times that we 've been interviewing quite a few people over the last few days but there 's been reference to the new CBD and the new hospital and the International Airport so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2010 you would seem a fair bit of progress in that area very rapid pace of change yeah it 's it 's changed quite significantly since I 've moved to you so yeah interesting to see what will happen is over the next few years I think so and then the recent announcement of the submarine cable coming in obviously that 's going to make connectivity to the rest of the world open up as well and who knows what opportunities can come from that yeah definitely at the data transfer side of things we don 't really depend on that too much but what we 're really excited about is the the prospect of big tech companies coming to be here on the Sunshine Coast and that could provide real opportunities for us and and just you know great learning opportunities for us as well and we 're pretty excited about that it really inspires confidence in the growth of the tech sector here yeah fantastic well um amazing story and it 's fantastic to see a company like yours you know with the sort of client base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your marketing function what 's your sort of day-to-day like who do you target how do you how do you get new customers or bring on you put new customers okay so we have a sales team most of them are in market so we have a CEO who 's here in Australia but he travels around the world as well we have two business development managers in the US and one in the UK and we also have professional services staff who are our customer facing staff there in the US and the UK as well and so they are in Europe as well and so they are very much responsible for actually meeting with potential customers as well as our current customers because for us our our customer base our existing customer base is our best source of new business because if they 're happy with us they 're happy to talk about us with others and that 's that 's really important to us so having that that customer focus is incredibly important meanwhile the sales teams is knocking on doors talking to people they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian office it 's my job to help the marketing program retain an Australian flavour but also to localize it for those those local markets and so I look after the company website and I develop a lot of marketing materials for the team to use and I will localize those for those markets that they 're in while trying to retain that Australian voice excellent thanks for having chat with us today it 's a great story and all the best to typify in the future and enjoy the amazing lifestyle that the Sunshine Coast affords always do thank you very much"

    "text": "a heck festers basically when people come together talk about an idea they want to progress into something that looks like a bit of a solution it 's not complete or they also or if they or they look for an idea that 's already there and find some team members to come together and create a prototype of that solution they compete as teams against other teams and and really they pitched that at the end to the judges and they 'll assess which one they think is the best for each of the Cobras this is the third year that it 's been running and it seems to me to be getting better every year firstly we 've got an 11 year old child who came up with a marvelous idea to do with Docs and the and the collar that lights up during the evening so you can see you dog and then we 've got people that are traditionally in this space who 've coming up with some phenomenal ideas whether it 's the Internet of Things and the plant that effectively is artificial intelligence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's needs to the artistic solutions that have come up with war horizon festivals of the future and you have a couple of ladies who had this unbelievable idea about picking up their children from school and how they might use technology it doesn 't matter from what walk of life you come from by just connecting the dots with technology and people you suddenly can come up with some you know amazing benefits for our community I think that 's the beauty of hackfest it 's just a little bit of the overall ecosystem of creating innovation on the coast and supporting new businesses or existing businesses or people even thinking about wanting to get into this in stimulating that first product or a new change to a process so we also see it as an opportunity to allow people to know that we 've got a lot of data because in the new digital age that data is the thing that helps you create solutions if the oil or fuel or petrol we have a lot of data people aren 't aware of and so hackfest allows people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look look at all the data we have and council we 've got over 200 different data sets nationally there 's many more than that in on the state level and say what could you do with that data with some technologies and creative thinking and a marketing pitch we 've also been able to partner with vendors that we use to click through our live in their program so to get things like IOT smart sensors and data that you wouldn 't normally be able to get your hands on [Music] a lot of guys mentors and everything came up to me and helped me out with the video the hardware that gave me ideas as well on what to do at the day and everything also the food was really good [Applause] it 's a competition but it 's not first and foremost a competition it 's more about just building something cool and that 's good you have this wave of people who want to work for themselves working as a startup company working as a freelancer working as a consultant all of these people are actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a government or you as a council can given problems that you need solving then you can use this whole pool of people who who actually are looking for problems to solve to help you out that 's the way of doing innovation that 's that 's open innovation you want to create something for the future and you want to create something for the community but you 're gonna do it together with the community what 's this one I saw this sort of a real technical challenge in there of you know how do you actually keep all these devices in sync closely enough that you can get sort of a coordinated thing across a wide area and that 's sort of a fairly tricky problem too small so I just wanted to go in and see if I could sort of get that come up with a solution that worked we also want to award a special commendation to the art mural team because your idea was amazing this is a AR app which allows people to view murals not just the ones at our location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library so when they look with their camera at a mural they can see the art will come alive when I saw the AI and how that works and that was like that 's it that way you can create a library you can keep the artworks there you can see it come to live it become a complete immersive experience for the viewer not just that it becomes something so well known for the region so will also attract tourism we originally started off planning to utilize some of the Internet of Things devices that some of the hackfest sponsors have provided and the program sort of grew into effectively putting a post honorable face or a chat bot onto the data that we were collecting so the idea was to use Internet of Things technologies specifically some sensors and put those sensors inside the gym equipment in public parks so that we could pick up real-time dates on how that equipments being used right down to the level of individual machines and then be able to compare the usage of those machines from Park to park and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and better data on which machines are proving to be the most popular and then we can also Bluetooth enable those machines so they talk to people 's telephones mobile phones and get some interactivity going on with the people who use the machines so that they can share to them their workout regimes and and track which machines they 're using and and program their workout exercises the idea was to build an app or prototype an app that would then be able to ping the kids when you 're ready to pick them up and they could come out of school gate and meet you so that would save a lot of time and that means you get back to work or go and do whatever else that you need that you are to do so not everyone can understand a database or even dashboards to some extent not everyone 's a visual learner some people need to get information by a call-and-response or query being able to talk to somebody it 's exactly the same as why would you go through a checkout rather than going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human-like interaction personification of the task that they intend on accomplishing so we thought that 's probably the best way that we could come up with to pass on valuable information to people we 're really seeing now that just your normal mums and dads through eleven year old child can come up with solutions that potentially have global significance never mind just regional significance what this technology is doing is enabling the opportunities the ideas the potential solutions for regions it 's enabling more jobs more opportunity more innovation and that can only be good for this region"

    "text": "it 's been a really great experience just coming back here and staying here and setting up a show it 's actually quite surreal I was born on the codes around Bodrum North bhadram area I 've always done a bit of everything you know I 've I never really call myself a painter or a drawer even though I think a lot of the practice comes back to drawing and mark-making I 've always done you know a bit of video ceramics and you know kind of flirted with a lot of mediums but I think a lot of people probably know my drawing practice when I first did these ceramics I was calling them blobs or and then it turned to ghosts and then it turned to you know I was calling them all weird names I didn 't know what to actually title them like spirits and other people it 'll be like the third time they 've seen it and I 'll say well this is actually a face there is that effect you know and I kind of like that it kind of sits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could just be a blob or my thumb prints and that 's how you read it but some people will see a face you know I mean it 's like anything I kind of see faces in a lot of different things you know I in nature or just even in this the table floor here you know this is just they 're kind of everywhere and that 's where it kind of comes in with that that ghostly or the other presence or you know there 's things happening that we can 't control around us and and yeah it 's just as it is I wasn 't too precious with them I just kind of made them and you know channeled these kind of weird figures and indentations and finger marks that kind of make these portraits or faces within and on the actual vessel a lot of this practice that I 've been doing for the last five years I guess is all about the portrait as well so you 'll see moons or Suns or eyes that could be anything but you know I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format the gaze you know my perception so I guess a lot of those kind of motifs like the circles or the dots or peep holes or you know it all comes back to the gays basically yeah the idea of another or you know you can see yourself in these pieces that 's why the other one of the sculptures is sitting on a medal a mirror base you can kind of look into it it 's got another dimension the bronze work directly correlates with this group of work so that was just all the slip and the excess clay that was falling on the ground collected and then I had placed it in a bucket and then after about I think it was maybe eight months or maybe even longer I got all that dry clay three wetter and reworked her and then sat down and in I think like 15 minutes I just kind of molded that guy and he came out with a double head thing with the faces on the back as well I don 't do it like a religious thing but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and that came out so that was like just the slit and slop all the excess kinda like the shavings that was leftover like the history of those pieces and then it was originally it was like just a small clay sculpture and I wanted it to be just have a bit more reverence so I got a cast and then destroyed the actual original so that yeah that 's an edition of five but it 's yeah just a bit more precious but it 's it 's not if you know what I mean like so it plays on that duality again for me it all just kind of makes sense when I 'm doing it you know and I I guess for the audience to come in they sometimes they don 't pick it up but sometimes they 'll just you know subconsciously take these things on and hopefully it 'll make sense to them when they 're kind of walking around the space and seeing the correlation between a print and a ceramic piece and the ceramic piece and the wall drawing or the wall drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I wouldn 't call myself a hoarder but I am definitely a collector I collect a lot from markets or you know when I 'm traveling I buy a little drink it 's and things know sometimes directly you know for the work but oftentimes it 's just something that I find interesting or it relates some way to my ideas that I 'm doing and then I 'll just sit there in the studio and there 's things that have been sitting my studio for five years already and I know it 's going to come into the practice sometime but it 's not quite there yet but some of these found objects like the drum and you know this sarong and the cue balls and stuff like that they were just kind of laying around I didn 't really know what my practice was I was kind of just making you know what and it 's only lately I started thinking about ideas of time and labor and you know my history and perception and all those things were kind of correlating and like I said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end point I just kind of want to make in that process but think of those ideas so when you know the audience or the viewer looks at the work they have as much you know voice in what the outcome is as me as an artist you know I don 't really think I need to have an end product or end statement it 's just kind of you know it sits in the world and it 's just ready to be interpreted however it can be interpreted"

    "text": "and ten innovation as Paul mentioned and the reason that I 'm here apart from to welcome you is is to set a little bit of a scene before you get into the real real detail of the council offices and the reason I mentioned the economic development strategy is to explain to you as as businesspeople that we 're on a 20-year journey we 've been on the journey for over five years now but we 're talking about a 20-year journey of a plan a 20-year blueprint for reinvigorating this economy and for those who were here way way back in the day in the eighties nineties etc they know that there 's been some tough times and so that 's why this council together with the business community and others including the university put together this economic development strategy and there was a number of elements to that I won 't go through that all of them but essentially the bottom line was that we wanted to do our bit to help grow the economy and you hear you know that all of the time from from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real considered plan to grow the economy and so back in the day in 2013 when the plan first came up we said we wanted our economy was 13 billion dollars and we wanted to grow that to thirty three billion dollars in the in the following 20 years so by 2033 we wanted to have a thirty three billion dollar economy we also wanted to do a number of other things but just to have a think about it for the thirty thousand businesses here on the Sunshine Coast small businesses in the main growing that pie growing that economic pie creates opportunities for you and it wasn 't just a plan we 've invested you know many millions of dollars in delivering that plan and that 's to do with major infrastructure projects and you know we 've got the big the big shiny stuff you know the the new one ray project the solar farm the CBD multi-billion dollar CBD coming out of the ground but we 've also had some great investors here on the Sunshine Coast with the Quanah Town Center or down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of things happening here in the region and they 're underpinned by those major projects but also by the small businesses who have the confidence in the region to invest in this region you know create jobs create opportunities and what you 'll hear today from the various office offices is where those opportunities might lie in your relationship with Council but the reason I wanted to explain that sort of overarching context is to hopefully give you the confidence for you to continue to invest so if you get the opportunity with council you know that 's fantastic but if if that opportunity doesn 't present itself for whatever reason still wants you to understand that council is investing hundreds of millions of dollars of the coming years in important infrastructure to get this region regional economy humming along and the good news is that we had a report card done by KPMG just a few months ago that was released and it just gave us and that was our commitment to this region and to to you as business owners and what that report card showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track with those with those goals and so you know you 'll have seen in the economy that the unemployment rate has been reduced significantly to around about the 5% mark from up around when it was 10 percent youth unemployment has been reduced from 14 percent down to under 10 percent and household incomes are improving and so there 's there 's a lot of good news around now I 'm not standing here saying to you that it 's perfect but I 'm just saying that we 're well on the way in this 20 year journey to making a huge difference to the economy so the report card just on that one headline number which was going from 13 billion to 33 billion over 20 years we 're now sitting at over 17 billion in the economy and what were those extra three and a half billion dollars or there abouts that 's that 's running around the economy is the thing that is creating jobs and opportunities reducing unemployment rates and underpinning that business confidence that 's around and and hopefully you 'll have seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by you know by happenstance this is part of a significant and considered action by council to make sure that this economy creates the opportunities that all of you want with us today so can I encourage you over you know the coming years or whatever to keep an eye on what is happening in the region not just those major projects but all of the other initiatives that council are running with to help him improve the economy and and create those jobs and you will see over time that as business confidence grows there 'll be even more and more opportunities now I can 't stand up here and guarantee to you that just because we 've got a plan and because we 've got buy-in from a lot of the people here today that everything 's going to be all rosy because we can 't necessarily influence you know some of the global challenges that we 've got facing us and so whether it 's the trade wars or you know any of anything else that coming up I can 't stand up and say that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit to you is that over the next 15 years or so the remaining plan and I 'm sure there 'll be more to come Council will continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in in this region particularly in infrastructure we will be looking to our local businesses to take up a lot of the slack in in those opportunities and I think we 're currently sitting at about seventy five percent of our work goes to local local businesses something there abouts so it just shows you that we have a commitment to you that will continue to drive this economy as hard as we possibly can to get the opportunities that you 're looking for here today so on that note I 'll hand it over to the experts so they can talk you through the various presentations but I hope you get something out of the presentations I do know that last year there was a couple of businesses that attended and ended up getting some significant business with councils so there are lots of success stories out there hopefully over the coming years you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks very much and have a great day Cheers [Applause] thanks counsel Robinson where this this year the slide Oh calm if anyone wants to download that app on their phone now go to hashtag s be 18 you can ask questions through that we 'll put all the questions together at the end you can still ask questions throughout if you like but importantly for anyone streaming as well it 's an opportunity to ask questions if you couldn 't be here today but are still interested in what counsel has on offer and when you get in there you 'll see that it 's quite easy and I say that as a non tech person is actually is quite easy to get into and operate you can click a question to us or we can get you some information back to you within a reasonable time depending on what that information is counsel has recently embarked on a review of how it delivers its health and safety it will also have implications for how we contract with people the performing contracts for us and how they approach health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have today is going to be about health and safety I can 't stress enough how important it is to the council for its own employees and we will be passing that on and want you to engage with us in meeting us to achieve a very positive health and safety outcome for both the community the contractors and for Council so I 'll ask Adam White to come up here now he 's from a health health and safety team he 'll give us a presentation on what some of those changes are how they are impacted for procurement meaning that when you 're responding to a request for quote or to a tender what the value is for you and in understanding what it is that we 're after and to give some advice on what the best way to respond to those questions is so I asked Adam to come up now good morning as Paul says my I 'm from the health and safety zone my role within the team is to manage and continually improve their health and safety system so yeah I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender responsible and also introduced to the new health and safety website that council were recently launched so but before I get into it I I saw an important to share a bit of a personal experience to demonstrate not just what a serious incident the impact that it has on the injured worker but also the workers that are involved in that incident so some 22 years ago by I was an apprentice working for Honeywell second year apprentice at governor Phillip Taylor I was electrical instrument fitter and I was working with my tradesman who was an electrician and it was six o 'clock in the morning and and where he was at he was up on the ladder and replacing a damper motor and yeah I was at the bottom of the ladder holding the ladder and and he I just we we were a bit late that morning so he took a few shortcuts and decided not to isolate the power at that time he he was he got electrocuted and fell from the ladder and I I actually called him and he took his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago it did impact me fortunately there was a lifesaver on the floor who resuscitated him and he he and and he stayed alive until the paramedics got there and he was taken away on the way to the hospital he died three times and was brought back to life and he was kept in induced coma for two weeks following following the electrocution and yeah in return to work three months later but over those three months I being The Apprentice was a little bit skeptical about going back and doing my doing my work after saying what potentially could happen and during the investigation was revealed that he did have all these all these Safe Work method statements and all his documentation in order but due to the lateness in the morning he took a shortcut and decided not to isolate that circuit before before undertaking the and take the job or there to do so yeah it took me it took some time to get back for me to get back to work and I did consider not going back and finishing my apprenticeship but yeah Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today but did it did impact me significantly and they I encourage it don 't take shortcuts it 's not worth it to you or your workers firstly I 'm going to go through counsels tender the framework of counsels tender response form this is a health and safety component of the tender response form it 's broken up into a structure where initially we 're going to ask for those essential health and safety items which are your Jo policy and the incident procedure and forms now these are essential items without these items it would be very difficult for us to engage you as a we 're required to to see your commitment in your policy to ensuring the health and safety of the work you 're delivering and compliance with the legislation and B if there is an incident we need to know that you have the tools to adequately report that incident and make council aware of it the second part is the WHS implementation on past contracts this is very important to us this is this is something a bit different to what you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past before there 's asking for is asking for some evidence that you implemented your previous health and safety plan in section 2.2 you you provide evidence I eat you put your demonstrate capability and experience and you provide examples on three contracts we ask that you go back and have a look at one of those three contracts that you 've provided examples on and you provide evidence that you have a safety management plan and it was implemented so so we can see that you don 't just have the documentation but you actually use it the third part of the structure is the WHS intentions for this contract so if you this this is where we require you to show your intention so that you are aware of the risks associated with the activities that you 'll be delivering within the contract and also provide our provide documentation to show that you are able to deliver the works in a safe manner we 're talking this section about also your system now your safety management system should align with the amount of risk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale of your business so if you are a small business we do not expect you to have a huge comprehensive system we expect you to have a system that is suitable to manage the health and safety and well-being of your employers and ensure that you can deliver the work in a safe manner the last part of the structure is the business health and safe the business is Health and Safety history we 're interested to see if you 've had any notices in the past if you had any improvement notices prohibition notices font we 're more interested than the fine to see how you actually how you actually address them what you actually did to ensure that those those things that were report to your attention did not occur again we 're not so interested in the actual find we 're interested to see what you actually did to make sure that it doesn 't hurt again so that is that is the general structure of all of our response forms for the health and safety component regardless of whether it be construction goods and services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok the next the next part is we cancel have a new Health and Safety website this is a tool for all of our contractors and volunteers it 's a it 's a way that we 've tried to help you understand a your obligations they try to find try to try to provide you with some information about important stuff important health and safety items and see alert you about any up-and-coming or or safety matters that have been brought to our attention or the attention of workplace health and safety so firstly you 'll enter the health and safety site by the bottom left-hand corner there and the first page that that you 'll go to is the legislation which is it before it provides a link to the act to the regulations to the codes of practice and to the standards it also provides a brief overview as to what each of these what each of these forms of legislation and regulate what what they actually are so yeah please please go to that page and have a look at and make sure that you do understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an employer and to ensure the health and safety over your employees the second the second page which the incident notification requirements this is very important I think I think and I even struggled with it prior to Jordan workplace health and safety understanding at what point you need to alert workplace health and safety Queensland of an incident that 's happened in your workplace Council is interested to know every incident near-miss every even if it even if there was no no damage to property if it was something that needs to be that could have had thanked it could have had an effect on the health and safety of our employees or could have caused damage to property we 're interested now about it we will put things in place and we ask that you do as well to ensure that they do not occur again so at which point do you need to notify workplace health and safety Queensland this this page here will provide you a an overview of the different types of incidents accidents and also provide a link to workplace health and safety Queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve them the next page is compliance to Health and Safety safety standard so this is going to provide your link to to the standards and also define a council has some height and stance if you are currently in contract with Council you would have recently received a communique telling you that council have have increased the standard for the outdoor clothing standard to wear along all employees and contractors contracted by Council must wear long trousers on this page here we 're going to highlight our cotton standards but we 'll also provide you a link to the Australian standards as these are very important when you 're delivering your works the next page is a safety alert this page will take you there workplace health and safety Queensland and you can subscribe to receive safety alerts this these safety alerts come frequently every every couple of days or a week and it just keeps you into the loop and up to speed with what 's happening in the world of health and safety the next page is the induction you know if you 've if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your employees are already inducted have completed the safety induction that 's great but when you are engaged by council you are required or your employees are required who will be working on that contract to complete a safety induction prior to attending site this tool here will provide an online access to counsel 's safety induction so prior to attending site it 's important that the workers that are going to be delivering the work on the ground have completed this safety induction this safety induction is is part of the process and it it is very important that it be completed and I 've just just before I just before I finish up I think it 's important to let everyone know that counsel within the next 12 months will be will be audited by the regulator 's the the safety safety management system will be audited and it 's very important that that all of our contractors comply with the obligations when it comes to health and safety when delivering work for Council and at any point at the regulators or even the self councils workplace health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field and ask you to provide copies of the documentation you meant to be carrying with you when delivering the works I ask that you be cooperative towards the self the the workplace health and face advisers and if the regulator 's do approach you are you you be cooperative towards them as well because this is a very important audit that we 're about to embark on and counselors then put a lot of effort into preparing for it and a big part of our workforce is the contractors or either contractors and and we really rely on your heavily to do the right thing and deliver your you can 't your work your contracted works approach and make sure you do it in a safe manner thank you very much for listening to me today I 've got that thinks that Adam I 'll move on now to to Chris he 's the newly appointed manager project delivery he 's going to outline some of the bigger projects we have coming so this is where we 're moving in from telling you a bit about what we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what it is that we 're actually seeking to have done thanks Chris thanks Paul so welcome everyone I 've been I guess associated with this process for quite a number of years when I think back to the early days when we first came together as amalgamated counselors and I think it 's been a really good process for us to be able to build relationships over the years and try and achieve the outcomes that we 've set out to for the Sunshine Coast in I guess both designing and developing our region and then constructing those projects I guess you know this is another session where we get to update all of you on what we 've got going on for the year and sort of let you know what opportunity is going to be out there in a contracting sense but it 's also important to remember that even when we 're constructing works you know with our daily but people are we 're managing a design principally out of our office there 's still a lot of sub consultant or consultant components or subcontract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying on your expertise to help us complete those works as well so as Adam said we we 've tasked ourselves with our own safety improvement we 're on a safety improvement journey this year and I 'll talk a little bit about that at the end of the presentation as well so what does it look like for 1819 for project delivery and and the branch I manage we 've got three or four teams we 've got our civil projects team our urban projects team our rec projects team and I 'm lucky enough to have Peter here today and our capital planning and PMO team so the the top chart on the left-hand side gives you a bit of an idea of the dollar breakdowns that each of those teams manage and it lets you know the numbers of the projects and the value so in total we 've we 've got around 112 million dollars but I work out of I think a total of around 370 million for this year 's capital budget so we don 't have the whole the whole project load and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new runway the the new merch adorn city centre and a range of other large projects but it 's still a considerable volume of work and you can see the project numbers there at 425 and usually grow by the time we get to the end of the financial year once we see grants and councilors actually have some allocation funding that they put the projects as well so that number of 425 will often you know be up around 650 even 700 projects by the end of the year so there 's a lot of work there and I 'm not gonna stand here and profess that how about every one of those is just too much too much in the mix but it 's also a range of projects across a varying different program streams and the the pie chart there shows that whole range from the transportation the waste airdromes building facilities coastal projects the divisional allocations environmental parks and gardens quarrys storm water and land projects that we get involved with as a team and I guess the the table on the right there then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can see that the transportation project for the region is by far the biggest share of the pie but there 's also other big areas in wastes and parks and buildings as well so that 's a bit of a snapshot of what we 've got in front of us for the year and we and the the sort of dollars we 're talking about delivering as part of this year 's capital program this was a chart I showed last time and and what it tries to articulate is that on the Left we 've got our purchaser was that we do annually by value over the last two financial years the 1617 in the 1718 financial years and you can see we 've ranged them sort of everything below 250,000 to the 252 to a million in the orange to the above one millions in the gray colour and it 's been fairly consistent other than the big gray blob there that 's the solar farm a couple of years ago in the in the million-plus category in terms of orders by value but orders by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do under two hundred and fifty thousand dollars far outweigh those bigger projects I think what that that articulates is the amount of work we 've got in the smaller scale work where we 're dealing regularly with smaller value works where we 're trying to engage and harness the power of the private sector on the Sunshine Coast and try and get a lot of that work out to yourselves and various consultancies and subcontract or contract pieces so again I 'm expecting that 'll be a big year you know if you look at councils capital program again this year it did have a lower number in the 1140 last year but I would expect that 'll that 'll come back up and be sort of similar to the 1617 year as we run through 1819 so just jumping into a little bit of detail on the the projects by I guess our team areas this is the civil projects team and some of the the projects that we 'll have coming to market over the course of the year so running through them we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to go out and Q q1 q2 and that 's mainly construction works it 's one that we 've actually had designed so various probably concrete islands and things like that and and landscaping there 's the blahblah streetscape which we 're gonna do some detail designer and go into construction later in the year so about a million dollars there we are trying to package projects where we can in the next to the GP tees are two similar gross pollutant wrapped projects one at qalander and one in Maroochydore where we try and get the designs finished and get out for construction delivery in the first half of next year so they 're varied about a million we 've got some stormwater upgrades as the scheme we 're continuing to try and improve up in Mooloolaba as flood mitigation and so there 's a couple of parts of that the first part is an 800,000 component I believe there 's more coming very late year as well for another stage section of that we 've got Creekside Boulevard where we 're going to do some work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the hospital area there talapia caught a wetlands which is shaping outlet type structures for a wetland improvement and some fairly decent consultancy work in 1st Avenue and du port where we 've got some streetscape works I would see that that streetscape design consultancy going out and being managed through q1 to q3 with late late construction expected at the start of this financial year and utilizing the budget of next year as well in our recreation project space a number of projects already out to market or going out very shortly so we 've got the cotton tree holiday park amenities building out at the moment I think closes reasonably surely so that 's out in the market so the delivery of an upgraded amenities building inside the Holiday Park we 've got the North Shore sports car park and the yeah Edina sports car park we 've actually packaged those two together to try and make them more attractive pieces of work for contractors and hoping that they 'll be out late August so we can deliver them in an effective manner we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new facilities we 're building out a Meriden at the moment and an isaac more a little Isaac Moore Park at Kenilworth and other amenities building that we 're hoping to take the tender in later August in the what we call our urban project space we 've got the Nambour resource recovery center coming back into design in in q1 as a tender so a fairly decent building design there for the waste recycling facility with construction to follow later in q4 1819 and into the 1920 budget some of them quite a few of our projects are split funded across that financial year change and that 's as much about try to utilize sometimes the dryer part of the year but also the fact that you know we often do work around the Christmas break where everything down tools and and have the I suppose most of the construction going on in the in the centre in the middle part of the year the event center calendar is up for a major refurbishment so we 've got some supply and install tenders mainly there 's some mecalac stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the event center so that 's a fairly big-ticket one for us for the year the melilla bar foreshore intending to try and get out and do some stage construction on the moon of our foreshore which was a project master planned about three years ago now and we 're really trying to start to bite off chunks of that Mooloolaba area improvements we 've got some photos of the bridge that 's under construction of the moment which is all part of them a little of our place making plan we 've got a quad he can plant and equipment replacements so that 's across across their range of aquatic facilities the lots of heat pumps things like that we 've got a redevelopment going on I think a new pool being added to the EU our Aquatic Centre which we 'd get out to construction tender in q3 for around the million dollar mark continuing to work on the danboy Heritage tramway so looking to I think provided all goes well procure a tram and work on the construction and getting the old tramway back into action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in which we 're actually constructing ourselves but it 's one of those projects where we 're still needed to go to the market and look for liner materials and mecalac components that would actually be subcontract components of the larger piece of work there 's also a range of a sordid mecalac upgrades for our council buildings and assorted consultancy investigations across the board so smaller bits and pieces of work that we try and package where we can but various other other things going on throughout the year so this this slide has generally been up every every time but I think it 's important that we continue to sort of advise you of what services we we do have in-house or what what we can do for ourselves and what we still try and get from the external market so in terms of survey we still have our survey capacity but we have a mix of internal and external requirements for survey services we don 't have any geotechnical so it 's pretty much an area where we 're always out seeking work done we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you know we 're in the order of about fifty percent of the design comes out of our internal design offices and we go to market for about 50 percent of the program as well we don 't have capacity environmental structural and lighting and traffic signal design so they 're always ones that we go straight to market on and they may be components of a design that we 're we 're still managing but we need some some consultant components of in terms of civil construction we do have a day labor arm but I think there again only delivering about fifty percent of our annual civil package of work so we 've got a fairly large component that 's going to market landscape construction is alter market and you 've seen a work through a number of those ones that we 're out there with and we don 't have any capacity to deliver lighting and traffic signals work so one that we always pretty much go straight to market with so my branch manages some of our supplier arrangements so how we get out route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a number of probably consultancies and contractors on those panels where we can try and engage with pre or preferred suppliers or pre-qualified suppliers in a more direct manner those have got we 've got open space civil construction playground and exercise equipment so the first two are still live through until April next year and then have some extensions that we can award thereafter so they 're ones that we use often and the playground in a quick exercise equipment I think has just been done and will be through to October 2020 I think it 's fair to say the first two categories the landscape and the civil design construction ones we probably have struggled to get pricing back and we want to do some work over the next few months to try and understand from those people on those panels what might be the issues with getting return pricing you know is at the time of you are asking for pricing is that the way we 're asking just so that we can make them more useful to us and and perhaps more attractive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so in in regard to winning work with Council you know one of the key things is is relationship building we want to work with you we want to work with contractors and consultants who are like-minded with Council who know how we work and we know how you work so you know it 's an always an easier process we 're also always interested in looking at the methodology of how you would do something when you quote for us your track record and that I guess goes back to that relationship building our drivers are certainly the safety and we 're taking a good focus on safety the delivery certainty you know we do have kpi 's that ties to when we need to deliver these projects annually for the community and to achieve good value for counsel in its community as well we 're focused on local business still and we remain committed that way driven right from the top of where our organization and you know we 've got a really positive approach to I guess the projects we deliver for council and and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast and we 're here for the long term you know councils generally always are so just to finish off I guess just reinforcing some of the things that that Adam went through is that in project delivery sorry I 'll just go back on we have been quite focused on a safety journey over the past I guess nine months and maybe longer but we were fortunate enough to attract a really good external safety resource to the team with the guys about nine months ago and we 've been using his expertise to take us to help us on it on a safety journey and I guess what we 're trying to do that there is drive that right from the top top so we 've got a good resource we 've set some really good targets for ourselves and you know our safety officers to get out on sites do some proactive auditing we 've set KPIs for them so you can expect to see our project officers their inspectors their safety officers on site doing really meaningful audits we 've got I guess processes underway where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team approach so we see this is a journey not just us beating you over the head with a stick you know we want to work with you continue to improve that relationship and if if there 's ways that we can toolbox things to make improvements that 's certainly what we 're interested in doing we 've been holding our own internal safety training sessions and we 're focusing on high-risk activities to try and grow our level of understanding in the area so we 're doing our own training we 're trying to toolbox that wherever we can with contractors on site we 're also developing or have nearly developed a workplace health and safety specification which tries to really easily articulate what the basic requirements are on projects that we contract with you and that you know that it 's the stuff that 's in the codes of practice so if you know if a division representative was to turn up on site if there was an incident these would be the things that they would look at so just trying to bring them to front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that that 's what we 'll be looking for when we were auditing sites so thank you very much I 'll hand back over to Paul thanks Chris I 've got a presentation coming a bit later on relating directly to procurement and some of the changes that 's been made in that area but it 's important to note and following on from what Chris has said that we 're very interested in developing sort of quarterly lists and for getting out to the market with what we 've got coming in the past the systems that we 've had have very much been when we were ready to deliver it we 'd go to the market to say we 're ready now we 'd like to get an earlier engagement where we 've got at least some advice coming to the community excuse me about what work we have got coming so we 'll start to see that and develop a it 's already partially developed but improve on it during the course of this year and hopefully what you 've seen Chris then present then becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrisman presented largely on our capital works program council owns or the custodian of a couple of billion dollars worth of property all of which needs to be managed that leads us to wide Bryan 's here this now is more talking about our cyclic work that needs to be done today tomorrow when a contract ends it needs to be done the next day after as well so I 'll ask Brian to come up now and he 'll give you presentation on our property management morning all great see a great turn on again I just wanted a little bit different some stuff that Chris talks Boyd really does look at the asset management and part of Billy 's facilities as well and that 's more that the larger scale works that Sam you know there 's a full-on capital works program for what I 'm going to look at now is more to do with them are the day-to-day and our cyclical maintenance so we and in property management got two different two different areas of the other branch we 've got our land management unit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a building two facilities unit and which is a team that that I represent we look after councils administration buildings our workspaces our depots and all of the sporting facilities and venues that we have in terms of buildings and the facilities that they are there and our cultural community centers the likes of where we are today and all of our aquatic centers libraries Holiday Park so there 's a real variety of the buildings that we look after they 're all up we probably put 900 different assets that 's and we look after their so there 's a fair variety [Music] so I 'll just go through some of the projects some of the contracts that we have coming up and over the next six months and then we 'll look at some of the ones that are coming up and in the following year as well so just specific contracts so the guys are currently working on the sewage pump station maintenance contracts the public stander in the next couple of months twenty-one sewage pumping stations have some sump pump units and a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also looking at aquatic centers and unplan tree maintenance and the correlation is probably one of our largest areas of expenditure in terms of the maintenance that we do they 're like contract will be in a number of different areas so hydraulics and filtration to look at the actual and pumps and pulls itself mechanical services which more looking at the heating elements and other areas there and the on the command chemical dosing so that would come out in the next next couple of months and I cannot say that will be a significant contract for ourselves and one of our other larger contracts is security services and currently we are remodeling the way that we we look at our security and just trying to make sure that we get the the best result for Council that we can I 'm looking at some different models that are implemented with all the concerts and other other areas of government to see how best we can do that and so we look at this in a four portion area and so security monitoring and guards and patrols maintenance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collage of music and that type of thing okay and that that 's in preparation at the moment and you 'll see that coming through in the next couple of months and one that 's obviously we have some statutory maintenance that that we 've got to comply with so our Sheedy testing is something that is currently done on a six months in our databases and so contractor that hasn 't been a place before so again we 're working towards up you know in a contract it 'll be put in place and that 's a relatively low value but extremely significant importance so that 'll be calm nights public tender and in the not-too-distant future a couple of smaller ones so slashing care so we 're looking at basically some some groundwork sand and grass cutting and we have a couple areas that specific we so have some growing louder Holdings that are management area looking after in Minton so it 's looking after those and then the other area that 's of significant statistical and aerodrome and I 'm ensuring that that we keep that under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August and our waste delivery service so that will again be looking towards the end of this year and you 'll see that coming out that 's do you have water tanks and and bringing water service bringing out Tim potable water to different areas and servicing our remote remote areas that we have public toilets and that type of stuff and some contracts Senate we 're looking out for for the following year that will come through in from January or next year so plant and equipment service an equipment plant equipment so this is really a sort of a collective of areas that that don 't fit into a specific specific dollar area but are worth having in a contract icky and need that regular maintenance need some statutory compliance as well so you can read what there are fixed hoist lifting equipment roof access air compressors on some tiered ceilings so I can look for that one in the new year and doors and get systems so I can summer idea we put roller doors and shutters i 'm not type of stuff so that will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important and the way that we we 're working we 're increasing our building management system usage across council all of our major facilities are moving onto two building management systems so the control and the maintenance of that system is on this very significant to us and that 'll be a whole of raging contract that we 're in the development with and not without we 'll have a major effect on how we actually look after and maintain our building so we 're something that 's very high on our agenda timber decking and batten maintenance a relatively small contract that will come out at some stage next year and I just want to say thank you again everybody has stress the safety element we are very committed to the safety element and within property management our facility officers our art neurons on the ground regularly and they are taking a particular interest and and works that are going on they are actively involved in all of our with all of our contractors and they 're trying to implement their safety measures and basically practice as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll be they 'll talk to you they 'll reinforce and good good methods of work and so yeah please please embrace whenever you see them and I also like to say we 've got a team at the back if there are questions and there are a lot and usually a lot of questions that we receive after these type of presentations so please feel free to come and talk to the team afterwards and and ask us your queries it 's a great opportunity just to understand how I kinda livers a lot of the contracts that we do we 've obviously talked about some specific ones here but we have a major amount of contracts a significant amount of contracts that are currently in place well come up for renewal and then in the next couple of years and it 's just good you understand how those actually operate within Council okay thank you very much [Applause] thanks Brian following on from the last point that Brian made council for any contract above two hundred thousand dollars in value publishers who we have awarded the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd encourage you to use that as an opportunity for seeing who has been awarded the contracts and also seeing if the engagement of for example if it is a principal contractor would allow you the opportunity to make contact with that contractor to see if there 's any subcontracting opportunities available we have these twice a year and undoubtedly following from them we always get asked questions how can I get council to buy my ex item quite often my answer back for those is we don 't actually directly by the ex item that that often it 's through our engagement with a principal contractor and their subcontracting that gets those items incorporated into our works or into our work place so I highlight that for you to use these and the tender site as opportunities to identify suppliers to counsel that you might be able to supply goods and services to I will now ask for our next presenter who was Amanda to come up and have a presentation to you on our business development opportunities thanks Paul before I go in I just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people can you put your hand up if you actually currently work with council okay so that 's a good man great so I work within the business development team and what we have is we have a local business support program and within that that program there 's a couple of things so the first thing I 'm going to get you to do is all take out your phones and take a picture of that email address because you 're going to need it in a moment is that clear enough that that email address okay so it 's business development at Sunshine Coast QLD gov a you so while you 're all taking photos of that what our role is there 's a couple of components for that so what about one of our things that we do do is our one-on-one tailored support this is really popular this is where we come out to your business have a chat to you talk about some of the areas that you want to improve your business might be potentially relating to wanting to do business with counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we provide some of those connections and that opportunity for that business grow through those one-on-ones we also have a range of workshops and events and which also includes some online training and resources so Chris and both Brian have both spoken about some of the health and safety topics and some of the business management systems that we look at these are some of the two workshops that we offer so some some businesses come to us and say look I 'm really eager to work with counsel however I 'm not sure that I potentially have some of that capacity both of these workshops here are those capacity building workshops so they 're designed to be able to allow you to understand what councils looking for in terms of our systems our health and safety all of those kind of back-of-house stuff that we want to be able to ensure that businesses getting access to these so these are two really great workshops they do sell out they do happen throughout the year so that we are constantly doing them but we are very conscious that the processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be daunting so for those smaller businesses and that 's those mum and dad businesses and those any business out there this is available to anybody but these are some of the workshops that we all do so the one-day business management system is probably the most ideal one it goes through and talks to people about those back-of-house management systems the safety the environmental the methodology stuff that we can get so make sure you check those out we 've got information up the back in relation to all of those as well and the dates in how you book so the ICN gateway this is another opportunity for businesses so if you have haven 't registered I would encourage you to be able to register on this this provides information on projects and procurement opportunities that are happening around the area so you can put in your details what your business does and the services and the products that you have and keep an eye out for it you can actually set up you can set up some really great alerts notifications so that when these come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to do now that you all have taken down that email address and you 've taken a photo of that previous email address I 'll go back just in case so what I 'm going to do is invite everyone in the room to be able to send through their capability statements through this email address and if you are watching online as well turn through your your capability statements to that email address and I 'm going to hand-deliver them to parts of Council so if you are doing if you are offering a service and you want to I 'm going to make sure that these business these business areas and council get this so make sure you do that if you don 't have a capability statement you should but come and see me anyway and if you do want to connect with us some of that one-on-one support afterwards just come and see me will be up the back but thank you very much [Applause] Thank You Vera oh now move on to go through some of the ways in which counsel actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually end up with a contract to engage hopefully the people in this room and through our various procurement processes just to be clear counsel has I think it 's already been said by the councillor Robinson before but for this year we have budget of eight hundred and sixty four million of that three hundred and seventy million will be fair capital works project projects sorry the largest portion of that of course is the runway currently being delivered up at the Sunshine Coast Airport last year for the year of our available procurement spend two hundred and twenty-one million of it a little over and a little under seventy five percent of it was expended with those considered local or local suppliers to this area that 's a figure that we 're reasonably happy with but always looking for other opportunities to engage with our locals meeting us with understanding of work Health and Safety understanding what work we 've got coming and when and then responding to our procurement processes puts you in the best position also puts us in the best position to get the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last 12 months has undertaken internally a change in its procurement process that doesn 't mean we 're moving away from tender and requesting quotes that will always be central to what we are doing but we moved from one section of the regulation that dictates how we can contract to another internally that was a significant change externally there are some changes which I 'll go through now previously for small value contracts those being below 15,000 dollars we would invite only needed to invite one quote that figure has now been increased to 25,000 that 's not to say that we will only involve quote but those smaller pieces of work particularly on our capital side allows us to do some engaging at a relatively fast pace or faster pace than what we have in the past also acknowledging now in the in selecting someone to do those smaller pieces of work we need to understand the market and to ensure that the price that we get is a good price and you can just about guarantee that we 're only going to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver for us so it will be the history and your engagement with counsel that represents good opportunities to deliver one in the past develop some credibility that we can keep recorded and then move forward with options in the future above 25,000 and up to 250,000 it used to be a figure of 200 but now it 's up to 250,000 we 'll invite three quotes and that 's a minimum of three quotes above 250 up to a million this is the newest introduction we 're going to look it in as the baseline option is inviting five quotes we also have a local preference policy which I 'll get to in a second and explain to you how we will direct those opportunities to bid for work to locals but I 'll just stick with what the basic stats are now above 1 million dollars we will still be doing open tenders those open tenders will be advertised through the council alert service and on our Q 10 on the Q tender website which is the framework which is the forum through which we 've done our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissions for tenders so that 's a little bit of change in what was the business of usual for us we also now have consolidated what previously was a fairly clunky way of forming supply arrangements we used to have a number of forms of supply arrangements and a number of ways to do them we 've consolidated that now into having supply arrangements that we will advertise for tender formed the list and we also have the opportunity now to refresh those arrangements in the past under the legislation the we did have to work with if it wasn 't working well the supply arrangement basically had to start from scratch and do it again and what that meant is if the list was getting shorter and short of those we could provide some smaller list will be capable ones we 're getting more work and we weren 't having that variety particularly for the locals so we 've introduced now the ability to refresh an arrangement what the refresh means is for those that are performing on the arrangement you will stay on it and don 't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the market and say we 're going to increase the size of this supply arrangement those who are on it don 't need to apply those who want to be on it can do and then we 're only going to do that once or twice hopefully at the max before we start again with after a couple of years so that everyone then gets a fresh and equal opportunity to get onto the new formation of it how we will do that is generally through an invitation or a tender there the two basic forums or through a supply arrangement which would be just the invitation to respond that requires us to issue specification something that you can quote on something that you can look at and say council wants that it comes with plans comes with whatever is relevant to it all in order to you be art to be able to complete the request for quote response form or the tender response form and that 's the offer the point at which you make an offer to council to do the work that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list within their tender aurora 's quote response forms the evaluation criteria I won 't guarantee that that will be it will never be anything more than that unless we specifically say it will and it occasionally could be less than that than the list up there but we will be looking at price capability and experience methodology broken down into some of those subsets there as well contribution to the local economy and then we 've also introduced a social benefit engagement and indigenous engagement opportunities that all go through a bit further in a second but they are our criteria prior to releasing a tender or request for quote we make a decision internally on what the weighting should be for those and then we go to the market with those the reason that we don 't have a fixed set that of weightings that I can give to you is because they will change depending on the level of risk the the amount of money we 've got to invest in the opportunity what we know about the market and its capability so that we make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a procurement activity to to identify what is the best outcome so that that means that price won 't always be the primary factor we while we want to get value for money value for money isn 't always the cheapest one and it 's not uncommon for us at all in fact it 's reasonably regular that it 's not the cheapest price that wins the work I tell you that because you need to invest equally in responding to each of those criteria one of while we 're doing reasonably well with their engagement of local providers engagement with local suppliers one of the failings from local suppliers is they get to the part of the response form that says are you a local and tell us how you are and we end up with a one-line response that says I 'm a local and that 's it that is very very difficult to assess against you 're competing locals as well as identifying that it is only one of the criteria for being awarded a piece of work so when you come to that opportunity it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to exist as a local organization you will get awarded some marks for merely saying I 'm a local but if you take the time to explain that you 're a local who employs this many people who subcontracts other locals so that we can see that the money that we invest with you will be reinvested to other locals so that we end up with the supply chain going through our local area you will be far more positively evaluated then meal saying I 'm a local so I would encourage everyone to take that opportunity to invest the time and not just ticking the box or saying that one-liner but tell us how it is that you exist and what contribution you actually make to being a local provider I 've pretty much stolen my own slide by what I walk along with before so I 'll cover I 'll move on from that one but the response form is where it 's won and lost you respond to the criteria on the previous slide there quite clearly or I think they 're quite clearly headed each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us your capability experience tell us how you will deliver the work through the methodology and that is your opportunity to get to the top of the list in case we 're not shortlisting or if we ask you at least thing to get to the top of the list so that the next round after the shortlisting comes back to you for an interview or for further and more detailed information for those of you who are like you know we 've had a local preference in procurement guideline for quite some time we 've this year introduced an indigenous procurement guideline and a social benefit procurement guideline the latter two won 't present in every single contract that we do we will make decisions before releasing the tender or quote to decide whether we can or whether we want you to consider subcontracting or whether we want to engage directly with providers from both of those groups nonetheless even if it is not there it will be positively regarded by council in evaluating it if within the local preference response which will almost always be there that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous groups or engagement with social benefit providers that that can go into your local preference response as well sometimes you might actually see that we have decided that we directly want to quarantine a piece of off to the side to become completed by one of those groups in which case that will be abundantly clear within the response forms merely if you haven 't done that before it doesn 't mean that it 's over for you what it does is encourages you to take the opportunity in the time that the quote is out or to offer to be able to do what should you be awarded the work you can go and engage with those groups as well supply arrangements as I said before they 've been consolidated into just one term now their supplier Arrangements we have to then have a two sub categories those that are priced and those that are without price depending on which one of those it is will identify how we go about asking for the price we will in one instance be asking you for how many hours do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price is for the other it will be a price this piece of work that lasts dot point there 's we established him for two to four years the two to four really was problematic for us sometimes in the past with suppliers arrangements not working so it have a supply range of people either wouldn 't be available on a number of occasions meaning that while are on the rate arrangement we weren 't getting any benefit from it there 's a host of other reasons why some of them weren 't overly functional and but now that refreshing concept that I spoke of before offers us and you an opportunity if you can if you can reply to one get on to arrangement and continually engage with us as I think was Chris mentioned before a supplier easement doesn 't work for us if you 're on it but you 're not bidding for the work that we invite you to there 's some people sort of get on there to want to do work but they end up too busy at various times we will be monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and for council in how it operates so if you for example do get an invite you are on a supply arrangement or even if you just get a quote in invited to respond to a quote not from a supply arrangement if there 's a reason you can 't do the work then just let us know that and by that I mean send back a short email saying I 'm unavailable this time for whatever the reasons are quite often when they 're when some of them haven 't worked well at all it 's big we just don 't hear a response at all don 't know whether it is you didn 't get it you 're on holidays at the time too busy it would be beneficial to both of us if we understood why people weren 't responding and if you could let us know a reason why you wouldn 't we would appreciate we have 29 supplier arrangements at the moment they cover a host of capital related activities as well as service related activities we have those published on our website too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that are on them so again if there 's any who want to have a look at the list of the supply arrangements and the companies on them if you see that there 's subcontracting opportunities feel free it made contact with those on the list excuse me part of a performance library that we 've been working on is in making decisions about who we should involve particularly for quotes or gonna actually invariably for quotes we 've been putting together KPIs that go into the tender and the request for quotes assessing you against them and then maintaining a library of performance which helps us inform the next time we might need that piece of work who we could go in and invite so we would encourage you to engage with us towards the back in the contract and sometimes for longer term contracts it will be periodically through throughout the contract to discuss meeting the KPIs that you will know about because they 'll be in the request when it first comes out so that both parties can understand how the performance is being assessed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do everyone takes the box if you 're struggling with something you can let us know if there 's something that 's not working from our side of the fence for you then that 's another opportunity for let to let us know and we will see what we can do about that either possibly not within the performance of that contract if it 's already been set but for thinking on how we should approach the similar contract or the next time that it 's awarded our local preference this was has been advertised before but because the thresholds that we previously used have changed the way that or the number of quotes that will invite has changed also so it you can see from there 0 to 25,000 wherever possible and almost without exception will invite locals to perform that work 25 to 250 will invite three quotes and at least two of them but preferably three of them so this is an internal discipline that we have you have to use at least two locals we actually have to if there 's some reason you don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it and there 's been a couple of occasions where we couldn 't just find the marker it was a fairly unique markets and they just didn 't exist on the coast where it 's been approved to otherwise that would be you could count on one hand the number of times that between 25 and and 200 now 250 during a year when we haven 't met that at least 2 locals and more often than not 3 the next one is infighting the 5 quotes for that 252 million that will be at least three and again preferably 5 but there 's a commitment to advised at least 3 locals to bid for amongst five for that type of work for the written tenders above a million they will be open to whoever chooses to reply them they 'll be as open as they always have been so that would be apply from wherever you are but there will be the 15% waiting then or minimum of 15 committed to the local content I won 't go over there the local content speech that I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work to respond to the tender making full value of the fact you are a local and then for significant contracting plans we 're now required to do them in the new area that we 've moved to they 'll be largely for contracts worth 5 million dollars most be in fact I 've probably suspect they will all be offered by tender or potentially off supply arrangements and we will have the same 15 percent local waiting there as well Chris has already spoken to you about building relationships we want to take the opportunity to speak with those who want to engage with counsel and provide work but we also provide this in other forums to what to give you the opportunity to speak with each other to develop those supply chains that are good for your businesses collectively then where it 's supply to counsel engage with us and then also that obviously serves the community as well we always have this slide up here councils still despite moving to the new structure that we 're going to have some prob 'ly obligations that up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow that 's a matter of business for yourselves we have the sound contracting principles that that wall that principle based that means they 're not overly prescriptive the some guidance on how we are to maintain a quality and transparency throughout our tender processes there are quote processes have got even developing a tender or quote to be released and then how we engage with the contractor thereafter fairness and C are the two key cornerstones of that and it 's something that will sometimes cause us to have to say to you we can or can 't talk to you on a particular issue or if it 's during a tender process for example we get asked one question by someone well if it 's a piece of information that hasn 't been made available in the information we 've released we 'll let you know beforehand if we answer this question we have to release the question and the answer to every one unless and there is an exception of this there is a very specific question related to how you deliver it in that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that is an example of where maintaining that fairness and openness we give everyone the same amount of information with which to develop their response if it is something we haven 't provided we want to give it to everyone so what you might have asked one question with that question any this will go out to everyone I 've been asked over the last couple of years about their ability in the past to be placed on some of our contractors we 've developed a new framework over the last 12 months we traditionally have people saying which contractors general just say it should be 2,300 contract value that doesn 't necessarily work for council on our side of the fence to say that the contract amount should be tied to little liability but we have an hour an internal framework that has us making decisions about what the limits should be and that limit being reasonable having regard to the word resource associated with it and we will be engaging with that throughout the course you know where that presents itself in the documents as we was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of liability for new performing a piece of work for us repeat the other opportunities I think that they 've lights have been identified by others already here but we will be using service to advertise both opportunities with us the Queensland Government computing the website has not only what this council does by some other councils and work required by just about every state government department that there is so that 's not materially not register to that I would encourage you to be similarly it 's not up on the list there it should what local by on there or peat services they are an organisation wholly owned by the Local Government Association of Queensland they provide a number of supply arrangements for use across the state by local governments if you just if you just search local by roll I hope the slides update at least about 24 hours after this presentation and I 'll get the link put on there for doing videos with council workshops and next one is on the 31st of August it will be an animal registering at 4 will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific workshop is about is pulling out our tender forms putting it in front of everyone and discussing the mr. pizer particularly for some smaller or new businesses about what councils thought processes that are in coming to how we 're quite open tender and it 's a pull the document apart talk about this and provide some hopefully these define explanations for how we go about tendering the quota for anyone who hasn 't done work for council before or who has but still wants to improve their opportunities for doing it I 've recommended as a good workshop to see you guys prepare enough and even might actually also help with responses to points of tendering with other opportunities in general I mean every word spoken about the business gateway so I won 't go on about that and in pursuit about indigenous engagement we 're also looking to engage further encourage you to engage with the black business one doing business with counsel locomotive Amanda 's covered those two the second point there therefore the point is if you want some feedback will either on what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response was like when you didn 't get to work on it you 're unsuccessful then feel free to contact us if we will arrange to meet with you and provide that we generally do it in a stage play so if you ask us for something we can give you some written advice but if you want to skip straight on to engagement sit down we 're not going to sit down and tell you why on the party one of the heads of that is that evaluate give you feedback on where we thought there were opportunities for you to improve your submission and so for example if the health and safety response wasn 't at a level that your competitors we might agree with explaining that they had a better one we might be able to you where yours didn 't have the quality that there has that there 's has simplistically we often get contact from someone saying or some successful why didn 't you and they and we went to the methodology part of the response and they said we 'll provide this equal rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback on if you want a piece of work we can we 'll have to invest time in committing to that work we understand that it takes time so we 're not constructing these 10 years of quotes to merely say tell us everything we are structuring them so that the information that you give us is valuable bleak considered in making a decision about age that is brought us to the end of the mr. presentations so floors open we can give any of the presenters back up to answer any questions that you may have and when that 's done that doesn 't mean your question and engagement times over feel free to visit any corner of the room with relevant to any of the disciplines that are here today so thank you for coming but is there any questions ok thanks if you do have any feel free to come up and grab us afterwards we 'll go to the area that you think might be relevant to the question that you have thank you very much for coming we 'll look to do another one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the year 's work that we have I hope it 's been beneficial to you if you 've got any feedback for us on ways we can do them feel free to either tell me now or let slide oh no thank you [Applause]"

    "text": "[Music] welcome to finance finance can be defined as the science of money management it 's a measure of a business performance and business owners can analyze their finance to respond to the business challenges so what does that mean it means it as a business owner you could look at the historical performance of your business in order to prioritize the change and resources needed to improve you might ask how will I do this well finance is an important component of business because business needs to make a profit in order to continue and most importantly it needs to manage its cash flow your financial statements are tools to help you do this so understanding what they 're telling you is as important as recording the transactions itself let 's start with a few basic financial concept the first is a time value of money the time value of money TVM is a concept that money is available at the present time is worth more than the identical sum in the future because of its potential earning capacity this core principle in finance believes that money provided today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sooner it is received next we have opportunity costs the opportunity cost of capital is the incremental return on an investment that a business forgoes when it elects to use funds for another project so rather than investing that cash into a marketable security the opportunity cost of capital is a difference between the return on both those projects expected risk and return this is what you can expect to get in return from taking that risk the rule of thumb is that the greater the risk the higher the rate of return so what a yield of an investment is higher than average you can expect that it has more risk of non-payment one of the core principles of finance is the accounting equation assets equal liabilities plus owner 's equity what that means is that all business asses were required either by borrowing or using your own investment this equation is basically your balance sheet and what your balance sheet shows is your level of leverage or equity why is it important because if you were to close up business tomorrow what would you be left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your business as a core principle of financial management let 's start with a few financial functions budgeting and planning record-keeping financial management management reporting analytics and decision making communication let 's start with business planning finances don 't simply happen you have to plan to make it happen planning starts with a budget your budget forecasts how much you 're likely to earn and how much it will cost you to earn that amount budgets are essentially approximations and usually based on historical data so in preparing a budget you 'd usually look at the previous year to determine your budget budgets are optimistic yet conservative knowing budgets for a loss if the business end of the financial year with a loss the budget would look at a way to decrease spending while keeping earning at a constant level in other words manage expenses things you need to consider when drafting a budget you 'd need to look at your historical performance the sale cycle the risks that are known capital reserves and growth now for record-keeping business owners need to make informed decisions the ability to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financial transactions is critical and keeping up-to-date records allow owners to make informed decisions remember time is money this can be easily achieved by using an accounting software such as my OBE Xero or QuickBooks when the record-keeping is completed it feeds into several financial reports and each report serves a purpose these reports are used to manage your business finance we have a cash flow forecasts raise cash flow to predict how cash flows to the business and to manage cash as a scarce resource you 've probably heard of the expression cash is king or queen well without it there is no business it is the number one reason for business failures in fact if there 's no cash in the business the business is forced to close because in Australia it 's illegal to operate a business while insolvent insolvency is defined as the inability to meet one 's financial obligations when they are due another important task is to compare financial reports over several periods you might look at it from

make decisions and how you use the resources to manage your expense remember we spoke about the accounting equation that is your balance sheet it indicates a balance between equity what you owe and debt what you owe the rule of thumb is to grow equity because your business is an asset so the more equity you have the greater asset value you have in the business next we have the working capital cycle the working capital cycle or WCC the amount of time it takes for the net current assets and the current liabilities to convert to cash the longer the cycle the longer the business is tying up

statements ratio analysis is used to evaluate various aspects of the company 's operating and financial performance such as its efficiency level of liquidity profitability and solvency an example of an efficiency ratio is the asset turnover ratio which is calculated by dividing sales by total assets ratios can be quite complex especially if you 're not accustomed to working with your profit and loss and your balance sheets so we 'll do more on ratio analysis in a workshop on the 12th of July these analytical tools help business owners make decisions one goal to a financial analysis is communicating the results and using it to inform your business strategy what you can see is the integration of all the key concepts that help business improve business performance I hope you can see

    "text": "good evening ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to this evening for a really important and exciting Friday 3 live event for March and a panel discussion considering the question what is the role of a regional gallery and I think this is a really timely discussion especially here on the Sunshine Coast with councils first strategic arts plan which is going to address the needs of the region the region 's diverse and growing creative community for the coming decades I 'd like to acknowledge that this gathering is being held on Aboriginal land and I recognize the strength resilience and capacity of the Gubbi Gubbi kabhi kabhi people and pay respect to their elders past present and emerging a very special welcome tonight to transport the arts and heritage portfolio councillor Rick Babur Oski Murray Piggott president friends regional gallery Calandra Inc and committee members and our guest speakers which I 'm going to introduce with a bit of a bio so you know their credentials and I think it 's worth acknowledging that these are all very busy people in their own fields and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go into in some detail so firstly at the left is Tracy Cooper Lavery Tracy is gallery director at home of the Arts on the Gold Coast formerly the Gold Coast City Art Gallery and Tracy 's worked in the regional art museum sector for more than 20 years including his director of Rockhampton art gallery where she was really responsible for transforming the gallery 's profile on a local state and national level and she was also president of the public galleries Queensland from 2014 to 2016 and continues to serve on the board and Tracy 's curated numerous exhibitions in her own right on Australian and international art and was really instrumental in I guess the emergence of Bendigo as a destination gallery for fashion exhibitions including the Golden Age of Couture Paris and London 1947 to 1957 which travelled from the Victoria and Albert Museum and Cecil Beaton portraits from the National Gallery in London and her projects that Rockhampton art gallery included the national touring exhibition which action came to this gallery cream for decades of Australian art which really drew on rock Hamptons rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very short space time thanks to a very entrepreneurial mayor and a very generous Australia Council but we can talk about that later and are one of my favorites the Prince Michael 's over us which is a really extraordinary exhibition by an extraordinary artist and the development of Queensland 's richest arts prize the Gold Award and so Tracy 's currently focused on leading the development of a new purpose-built Art Museum on the Gold Coast which is set to open in early 2021 and when completed the gallery will be the largest public gallery outside a capital city in Australia so that 's that 's really exciting and we look forward to hearing about some of that through tonight 's conversation we also a very fortunate to have Peter Hudson with us who many of you will know as an artist of significance standing on the coast and beyond and and I didn 't know this until the other day but Peter you exhibited we 've exhibited here in um a number of times but you were exhibited in the first exhibition a Calandra Regional Gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when sandy then she just called Matt one day and said what I like to be the inaugural exhibition so it 's a good choice and you 've also exhibited here a number of times since including most recently last year as part of our collection exhibition review and and that said you also exhibit regularly interstate you have representation in Sydney and you 've also exhibited in a number of exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra so really glad to have a fabulous Sunshine Coast based artist as part of tonight 's important conversation and finally Claire Sonja 's who some of you may also know Claire and Claire 's worked in private and public galleries for approximately 20 years and Claire was the director of the Moreton Bay Regional Council art gallery Network which encompasses the purpose-built Caboolture a regional art gallery the wonderful Red Cliff Art Gallery and Pine Rivers gallery which is a really important community space and Claire is currently the CEO of artisan crafts Queensland which is imminently moving into very very flash new digs and Claire 's also the co-chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being vice chair of public galleries Queensland so please give me a join me in a round of applause for our speakers so before before we dive into it I 've just found a really interesting helpful quote for this conversation from Esther and it ëletís who is the director of the National Association of visual artists and was formerly the director of Regional Arts Victoria Esther is actually very helpfully for us just written an article on about what is the role of regional galleries for broadsheet journal across Australia regional galleries are leading important conversations on gallery practice taking active roles in ethics and the politics of the local taking active roles in the arm and articulating a strongly grounded artistic leadership more than simply the custodians of guarded collections regional galleries succeed or struggle on the strength of their ambition for fostering the Australian culture from their own unique standpoint increasingly international in their outlook regional galleries seek to balance local artistic development with global artistic movements working from a confident connection to country and a sense of place so while you let that sink in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of a regional gallery and I 'm good I 'm just going to start from the left so Tracy well look I think that regional galleries are absolutely imperative to communities I will give you the example I probably used to start off with was last weekend I was in Muscle Brooke judging the 45th annual Muscle Brooke prize which I have to say if any if there are artists in the room here it 's a 70,000 prize and the main prize the main prize is fifty eighty thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars I was I mean it was astounding and and it would just just brought back to me cuz I mean as you said I mean I 'm I 'm working in a larger regional gallery or what will become a larger regional gallery but I 've worked in smaller regional galleries as well and and muscle Brook is not a big gallery but again you know I was just astounded to see the works in that collection and how they 've developed this wonderful kind of story for their region and they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean they 've got they 've got a seventy thousand dollar prize in this in this fabulous spot they had a you know but they had a band and and you know everybody was dressed to the hilt and and there was probably you know 150 200 people turned up and I just thought this is what it 's actually about this is this is for me what regional galleries are about they bring people together you get to talk about art you get to be challenged by things you get to see artists that you wouldn 't normally see in your region as well as as well as you know tempering that with artists you know artists from the region so you 've got this great opportunity if you 're a local artists to have your work you know beside you know a nationally recognized artist and you know it just it 's it 's a great it 's a great creative way to to build that community I 'm sorry and one of the one of the things I think that 's really important about ArtPrize is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a really valuable platform for regional artists and I didn 't necessarily think about this until was actually the photographer documenting our ArtPrize last year and he said there 's a lot of regional artists in this exhibition and it was only then that I stepped back and thought you 're right and so prizes we buy in regional galleries are a great way for local artists but also artists who don 't necessarily live in metropolitan centers like I know last year we had a finalist olenka mr. Locke whose work I was not aware of and I 've just found out she 's won the climber prize this year which is another significant Art Prize in Tasmania so you know in those prizes are driven by those regional galleries is the muzzle Book Prize acquisitive yes so that 's a that 's a key way for there so a great example was I got a got a very brief tour of their their storage area and they 've got a Fred Williams in their collection that came through the ArtPrize like must be 30 years ago it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a muscle and how fabulous for the paper I made sure I said that in my in my speech as the giant keep your hands on that great yeah Peter as an artist who has has shown quite regularly in this gallery and others within the region but really probably shows outside of the region for the most part what do you and then someone who 's made work and exhibited in other regional parts of Australia what do you think the role of regional gap I can I speak as an artist and that 's why I think they 're um for me personally like like you mentioned not I had the inaugural show that when this gallery was open and that was I think what it is is it 's the confidence that if you because most most artists I know insecure and and you don 't really know it 's such a subjective business that you don 't know you don 't even know if you 're going any good you know you just you know so that point of contact or being a ref marker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an exhibition and showing a body of work to your community yes exactly right and if it 's as opposed to a commercial gallery if it 's if you 've been asked to show in a regional gallery then it just has that little bit and has more of a kudos as the right yeah I 'm not sure what the right word has been cultural waves yeah it 's really it 's really nice sort of analogy in that we had a current exhibition by lathe McGregor opened last week in life it 's quite well-known around Australia as an artist but he 's actually from the Sunshine Coast and grew up on in Bodrum and so we had the only last week and his whole family were here and I and he said that was really important for him and that he lived in Melbourne for many years and now lives in New South Wales so to have the opportunity to show his work to his family yeah and you peers as well because one of the things that I have learned very quickly moving to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how geographically large but how dispersed the artistic community is on the coast so you most of the time you 're making work in isolation in a bubble yeah and so an exhibition in a regional gallery gives you that opportunity to connect with your peers and and you Tracy was talking about their prizes and you 're a previous winner of the Sunshine Coast Art Prize I should you know I should add but it 's just the fact that we have in our in it in our backyard we have a significant ArtPrize which is and it 's it 's now but there 's a 10 years more 12 of years old here that 's that 's some fabulous thing and again is the primary way that the art collection is growing yes apart from the generosity of donation yeah so for us it 's doubly significant yeah in that it 's a it 's a project which raises the profile of the gallery and makes us visible yeah and also in terms of being able to grow a collection Clara I 'm gonna talk about something a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a trend to put galleries and libraries together in local council quite a lot there 's a difference between a library and a gallery is quite transactional so you have repeat visitation built into a library you go you borrow books you have to go back and return an art gallery is a different kettle of fish so I always say it sounds a little bit naff but I always say that we 're in the business of creating transformative experiences and that transformation can happen here it can happen here or can happen in your guts and I think that offering those transformative experiences to communities are so important they start conversations they spark passion in young people they remind people they take people back and for me that 's what keeps me going that 's what I 'm passionate about creating those transformative experiences and I had so many Moreton Bay I was oversaw three guard galleries and one of the last exhibitions we did was love more than a four-letter word at culture regional art gallery and in our engagement space we created a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people could pick up and potentially throw we made them out of cardboard and it was write a love message to someone that you loved and one day a gentleman came in and it was ten minutes before closing and now volunteer just let him know that you know God will be closing in a few minutes and this would have been a gentleman in his late 50s and he was frantically riding away on this little card and he tied it to the to the fence that we had erected around the wall and the next day I went in and I read his card and it was a note to his deceased mother to tell her how much he loved her and that he 'd never had the opportunity to publicly express that and this was the first time this exhibition had allowed him to do that and I was so moved I thought that 's why I do it those transformative experiences that we democratically all have the right to have yeah that 's a really powerful example of what what at what those transformative experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise an interesting point in that you said you managed three galleries and obviously Moreton Bay like the Sunshine Coast is a geographically very large area but also in terms of its population is very multicultural is very diverse and so I mean could you talk about perhaps some of the challenges around programming for an audience yeah like that we found that people who lived in Mount Nebo didn 't come down to Kabul to necessarily already cliff so we had pockets of three former Shire councils that had been amalgamated you know the story up here and whilst it was an amalgamated council people are very local you know they stick to their hood and if you 're on the peninsula you go to you go to Red Cliff you might go to Pine Rivers but certainly are the love that the Mount Tamborine people and that glorious people I very rarely saw them in Red Cliff but I saw them at Pine Rivers art gallery so we were looking at these three spaces and every community has its culture every community has its sort of demographic mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research obviously we did a show called vine your wine your coconut water at culture and that was after 12 months worth of community engagement with the Pacifica and summer community interception by the follow alia to Folly intersection with bay and then exhibiting at alongside this coconut water we did some order to a lady and what we found was it 's actually little things that can connect people so one of the things we did in that show both shows was to make everything trilingual so our didactic text was in maltese some on and english and it when we had the exhibition it fell during Waitangi day so we had a Waitangi Day celebration in the gallery and which is a really significant thing so and I was talking to one of the Maori elders and he said oh it 's so nice to go into a gallery even though I 've been living here for long time so don 't ask go into a gallery and to read all about this exhibition in Maori I just felt like I was welcome and I 'm absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all kept coming and I think that was really strategic if you need to use that word again though it sounds a bit clinical was that you time that exhibition to coincide with the Asia Pacific triennial and DOMA and worked with an external curator a Pacific curator five of the artists in coconut water were in the apt and there is a really significant Australian artists with Pacific heritage and they were showing alongside community members who didn 't see themselves as artists in the exhibition that was right next door the pride the sense of place was really really you know amazing and palpable and exciting to be to be part of yeah Tracey you 've worked in some of the biggest regional galleries or even you 've made them he 's gonna call her the last word in regional galleries but you did work at Bendigo yeah which really is I guess the goal standard so for galleries and and and has made a name on these large blockbuster shows particularly focused on fashion and then you went from Bendigo to rockhampton where you did really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little long-winded way of talking about some of the differences between those contexts in from Victoria to Queensland but also I guess trying to make that point that each Regional Gallery is unique and it 's it 's a it 's a product of its context yeah yes you 're right so it was it was a little bit of a culture shock going from I mean I was from Queensland originally and I 'd spent 11 years in Bendigo and then was very happy to come home and I knew nothing about Rockhampton I mean I 'm a bit of a queensland country girl at heart and I 've moved around a lot when I was a kid but Rockhampton was always that place you drove through to get somewhere else and so when I knew that that position came up I was I was actually very interested because I didn 't know anything about it but I did know what I did know was that that I 'd heard that it had a great collection but nobody ever got to see it and it was this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing collection but who knew and so so I went I went for the position and was very fortunate to get the role and within the first week I went into the store and and started pulling out racks and it was like Christmas it was just you ready to talk a little bit about how extraordinary that yes the circumstances in which that collection came together yeah so I mean you know as you would probably know as well as if you set up from the Gold Coast so I have a very colorful mare at the moment Rockhampton also had a colorful mare in the day a guy by the name of Rex Pilbeam or sexy Rexy as he was known and he I mean may still be was you know one of the longest running mares in Australia I think I 'm not even Queensland 's like 30 years or something he was the mayor of Rockhampton and you know look everybody I found that everybody had a story about right good and bad but he certainly he certainly built Rockhampton as a city you know from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrage which meant that the water that the water was saved from you know the salt water kind of coming up the river and you know a whole range of things but also you had this kind of foresight to think if I 'm building if I 'm building this this town it needs to have culture as well so it was very very adamant that you know one day there would be a theater one day there 'd be an art gallery but to start the gallery he had to build the collection and at the same time so we 're talking 1970s mid 1970s the Australia Council was a new relatively newly founded organization as part of the federal government and they had started a program of contemporary I can 't remember the name the proper name of the program but it was academically they would give money to regional galleries to buy Contemporary Art so it had to be living notice yes it was matched funding so whatever you could whatever you could raise locally the Australia Council would match it but it had to be living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Rex had sort of heard about this and thought on that and so went like literally went oh he 's so you put it he put it I mean obviously the other thing as well you know he was very colorful but he was also smart in and strategic in that he knew that he didn 't know about art but he knew people that did he was the doer but he knew people that could help bring it all together so I used to joke it sounds like a really bad pub joke but it was the mayor the architect the gallery director and the priest and I look into a pub yeah yeah for these four guys walk into a point anyway and so that was that became the acquisition you know the art committee for four rocky and they they literally went door-to-door raised raised money you know whether it was under pressure or not love it they that they managed to put together so this is like I said this is like 1974 they raised about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars locally and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that to be matched and in the end that they they they had raised so much money they they really didn 't know what they were getting with Rex that that for that two years all of the money in that program went to rockhampton nobody else got any money so Rockhampton had half a million dollars in the 1970s to go shopping and so they went on this art bender to Melbourne and Sydney with with you know connections so the priest I should say I should put that in context so the priest was had had come from Melbourne was an artist but actually had connections to all of those modernist painters at the time so Albert Tucker lived in pew Fred Williams John Brack and and some of the state gallery directors and and use that to get that entree into into that world and so Rockhampton ended up with this this incredible collection of works by these artists but because they had that connection to those people it wasn 't sort of the third-rate mm you know crap it was the it was the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in total I think the collections worth around I don 't know 20 million dollars in total but the work that came through that that project is worth close to ten million dollars so there 's a couple of million dollar paintings in that acquired within the space essentially I have a couple of diseases it was extraordinary then and you know that in the naughties going and look look going through these racks going oh my god there 's a jump rack there 's a Fred Williams there 's a Brussels dry star there 's Tim Russell trust us Jesse why is nobody seeing this and and that 's that 's at the very long-winded it was really important to understand that process and that you know it ultimately led to the development of cream yeah during exhibition which went not just around Queensland it went in to stay yeah well yeah so yeah and again so the for me the purpose of that exhibition was you know I I was kind of in the in the store kind of squealing to myself and thinking I how do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there and get people you know understanding what is actually here and so you know I talked to different talk to the counselors and I talked to our board and it was that I suppose that familiarity with the work there was a little bit of a kind of oh yeah yeah so for me to actually send it out and to other places and then have that response back from other regional galleries and other communities saying holy hell worried what is this and it generated an excitement at the time I was working at the Queen 's an art gallery in the touring exhibitions role and I was like we need to step up because this show is all that any any of the regional galleries could talk about because of the four side of one you know one very visionary man yeah yeah I am funny and and it was great too as well because it meant that so many other like again like if talking about the roles of regional galleries it was another opportunity to give commit other communities access to works that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also I think to an underappreciated at resource once everyone around the touring schedule had said oh this is a great show this is a great collection this is a great collection what was the response within the community in Rocky well our mayor and counselors were kind of yeah but this amazing collection and and from that I mean you know Rockhampton now is it 's looking like it 's getting a new building that will you know front and center will be that collection so I mean I 've left feeling very excited just been announced in recent weeks and we do have a car we do have a slide with a couple of artist impressions and that 's quite a significant investment yeah from from Rockhampton I guess building on that yes and and that too I mean that was the other thing as well I mean that to a you know that the works were seen with by over a hundred thousand people which you know again in Rockhampton initially would not have had that that no access so and so in terms of you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that collection and it 's not just about caring for it it 's about making it accessible and making it accessible to as wide an audience as possible Peter I want to ask you as an artist based on the coast for how many how many years I think I 've lived in Malone for about 35 years 35 years and so this gallery is about 17 or 18 years old I guess what was it like for an artist based in a region like this without him without a regional gallery without it without a context for your work well it 's funny you mentioned the rocky I saw I went through there I can 't remember what it was but just to demonstrate the educational value of something like that foreign artist I may be going in there I saw Gil Jamison for the first time and Lawrence stores before I met got to know Lori later on but I saw his work so for to have that as a know it was like a um you know it was the best art college educating them and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was um living around here for me it was I came to this area as a jeweler and but I 've been to collagen to our colleagues but I did design an illustration but in my last year was at art college in Brisbane two artists came up from Melbourne as as teachers and one of them was Nick Mott Sarkis on a knife you know nick fabulous jawsman yeah edible work very underrated oh definitely yeah he 's a fantastic artist but he and he 's from Bob Mercer who ended up a long time yeah at Griffith yeah so um when I was finishing I was getting ready to go to work in an advertising agency or um as an illustrator but when I got to know Nick and I and that was in my last year and again it was like going into that gallery when I saw Nick 's work that 's that 's kind of I knew then I was like wait not wasting my time because illustration is and designer such fabulous some aspects of making paintings but it was it was I I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and so that 's and the same with Lauren stores when when I met him up here so Angie became quite close to Lourdes yeah when he was living up here he was to go it was a real did you have to seek him out I mean it always again it 's this thing if there are are these connections and networks yeah yeah but they 're sort of less obvious I think than in a metropolitan city where you have openings every week and you know there 's a there 's a sort of a you during the galleries and people know each other I mean it to me it seems as someone who 's not an artist but who is I guess involved in that world it seems like you have to work that much harder as an artist in a regional location yeah well I think honestly driven and they 're always yeah you 've got to make circling and you know you 've got to feed the beast I think so you I with the Lauren store thing or I just happened to stumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw he 's worked and I 'll realize that it was showing at Phillip Bacon 's so I went in and saw the work and then I realized that he lived about five minutes from my place and then I took the initiative to call him because I think someone told me that he was a very nice guy and and so one day I just plucked up the courage and call him and I just sound like I 'm well I 'm a local artist yeah and he immediately said well why don 't you come up one day so and that 's where that relationship started by going there to visit him and talk and he kind of he didn 't take me under his wing or anything like that or he wasn 't a teacher but it was his friendship and he 's encouragement more than anything I remember I showed him a painting one day and he said to me he was probably lying he said to me I wish I 'd painted that and it 's pretty hot right well I mean yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you where you feel like you and and so Lawrence already had an established reputation oh yeah by the time he was yeah living up here and someone who obviously benefited from that from a relationship with with him and I 'm sure many other artists did you and then too so then a Regional Gallery was was built by the city of Calandra yes through the support of and sort of advocate advocate of the friends and and fundraising initiatives and so then you get asked to make or to be the first exhibition in this gallery what was so I guess I 'm asking what was it like so compared to before there was a regional gallery so the two after there being original gallery did you notice a discernible shift both in terms of your own practice and opportunities but also just for the I guess for visual artists more broadly on the coast definitely that was definitely a change from like I said before it 's it 's about confidence I think and that 's the main thing just someone you know in a in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep going and I think that 's one of the I mean regional galleries play many roles but one of the key key functions is to support ya and incubate local culture yes and particularly to support the presentation of contemporary practitioners yeah because there aren 't that many spaces to for artists apart from commercial galleries and there aren 't that many of them and for artists to take risk and Claire I guess when I first got to know you or make you you were working at Moreton Bay and making really interesting exhibitions particularly with a certain sort of generation of contemporary Queensland artists and no one was really doing that certainly not in close proximity to Brisbane and I always thought that was a curious themes you know why isn 't anyone else doing this but he was doing it real estate is king yeah I mean let 's talk about our selection people are isolated in Brisbane yeah there are no shared Studios everyone 's in their shared out the back sweating it out so it 's not dissimilar to being an artist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queensland if you extrapolate that to the whole state again isolation so what is going to break that isolation it 's bringing people together it 's community it 's having an incubator or a hub when we open Kabul Chara I was driving the sort of the vision and with a really brave team of you know curators and gallery support staff we basically dedicated the first five years of Caboolture to southeast Queensland artists southeast Queensland we went from Bundaberg down to the northern you said a we through we through that a little bit wired so as a result of that we were able to do some really powerful curated somatic group shows we 're also able to show mid-career artists oh my god forgotten artists mid-career artists someone whose 45 someone who 's 53 someone whose god forbid 60 hours so if you opportunity Russell your opportunities and to to do these solo shows that are really important they 're important for a cohesive understanding of someone 's practice they 're important for those practitioners they 're important for our cultural heritage as well so you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room brochure a sheet and I would diligently sent it off to State Library for um you know legal deposit like there is no way the show is happening and that no one will know that it happened it 's important that that document that record of annexation which might last its the app six or eight weeks it 's the archive of our cultural history as well so and you also raise a really important point I think in terms of you said your remit was quite broad geographically because it 's not just about local local showing local practice it 's although that 's a key very much yeah it 's also about providing a context for those artists a benchmark you know and introducing other developments in practice and exposing not just local artists about local audience well there 's audiences artists and and I know it 's an overt used term capacity building but it 's also arts administrators living in the regions so there are whole armies of people throughout Queensland who are learning how to condition report who are learning how to hang a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are learning how to care for collections and with that shared knowledge it feeds out into the community so of course it 's a win-win it 's a win-win when you have an artist who 's had maybe a couple of shows lives locally and you can show them how to like work really beautifully or you can give them some pointers about framing or you can you know guide them with regards to perhaps writing an artist statement you know there 's a lot of that that happens in regional cut doesn 't happen at stake galleries building is either another really important part of regional galleries and it 's it 's something that you know we 've really tried to do with our Maroochydore library program for those artists who maybe haven 't exhibited as a solo artist before who 've maybe only appeared in a group show to work with them and to produce or to select a body of a coherent body of work to craft an artist statement to light the work to do the labels you know there 's a lot of professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers is really important in world as well because you can 't have artists without house workers and those and those people who get that experience might go on to start an artist from space or you know start their own gallery or go on to run a major national institution there 's a whole history of regional arts workers who begin in regional galleries is gonna say Nick MIT 's which is a great example of that who 's just been announced as the director of the National Gallery started at Newcastle ah that 's right good boy from the Hunter Valley that 's right so these these spaces vary in scale and in size and and focus they 're all trying to be a lot of things to a lot of different audiences and you will get things wrong yeah yeah I was well I think one of the things that I 've found that you know at different times in my career talking to curators that and people that work in state galleries and National Gallery 's is that regional galleries get the opportunity I think to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite as much focus the spotlights not as yeah that 's right and so as you said you know at not saying that by taking a risky getting it wrong but you have I think you have the you have more freedom and and more freedom and ability to test things and and I think that that 's a really great thing that regional galleries can do so if you are an artist and you want to try something new or you 've been working on a project and you know if you 've got the opportunity for you know five to six weeks to have it on display in the in the local gallery I think you know you never gonna get that opportunity you got to wait five years at least to get something in commercial galleries yeah that 's right usually don 't want to show the experimental work they want to sell though they want to show the work that 's gonna sell yeah I mean and I mean this showed by lace yeah but I mean this show by lace is a great example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show like this say at the Queen 's an art gallery I mean he 's good he 's good on a long list of artists that would be vying for that opportunity but you know he 's got this fantastic opportunity here and and also I think because you 've got that shorter you know as much as we all try and kind of plan ahead it is still a much shorter leading lead-in time so this shows started we started talking about the show when lathe was a finalist in the Sunshine Coast Art Prize 2016 yeah so 18 months yeah yeah but you know still long enough to include new works and the thing I really love about the show is the wall drawing which he completed with two visual arts students from Sunshine Coast TAFE sorry lathe did his first diploma at kilala TAFE so it was really nice to see these very green but enthusiastic kids and in life was a bit scared he said they 're not saying anything and then he actually went out to the university to do a workshop with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only afterwards talking to Megan Williams from the University gallery that the teacher had said no that they 're loving it they 're just they 're absorbing everything so this you know I think there are these networks and it 's not just regional galleries and I 'd like to make that point right now that you know there are there 's a whole network it 's an it 's an ecology that 's another word people hate but I really like it because it 's true so you have university galleries you have commercial galleries and you know we 're fortunate to have to have some because there 's not a lot of opportunities for artists to show in in a region this this being and and with a high high number of artists all vying for those opportunities so it it makes you work that much harder Peter is there something not something what could regional galleries do better from your from from your perspective as an as an artist who 's engaged quite a bit with with the regional gallery and other other galleries well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my favorite things to do as an artist plein air painting trips and for me they 've become I sort of see them now as that 's kind of the traditional thing to do and when if you live in Australia you know people talk about the light and and the weather and all that it really is the Garden of Eden if you 're a plein air painter that most of the country is an incredible subject to and your work is very much about the environment and inspired by the natural well well yeah it is it 's that 's everything is a landscape everything I do is the taproot of of everything I do is in the landscape and it always has you know you know from a child I 've always enjoyed it so it 's what I was gonna say home is is I want us to find your plein air trail [Laughter] take it one step further I think it 's often a lot of women ask me about and women if you look at our women artists like Lo and Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful Emily can worry women I think are the natural landscape painters so I think and it 's it 's harder for them to make those trips because it 's not as it 's easier for a man to go well I dare say you know women aren 't given those opportunities as as often as has many given them I think that 's a that 's probably a and and there is a gender disparity yeah across the sector we have the fabulous guerrilla girls merchandise on display in the gallery store and their whole practice has been about drawing or making visible these this discrepancy but I do think to go back to your point about plein air I think we live I mean I I think that galleries should and do reflect the unique qualities of their region the Sunshine Coast is a fabulously diverse ecology environment flora and fauna that 's why many artists choose to move here to live here or inspired to make work by here for example I think a real opportunity is residences I think and how many artists would love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok Misha I couldn 't agree more seven years at Moreton Bay Regional Council and I think every six months I bring up the amazing opportunities it would be for us to have a an apartment and a studio to run our artist presidencies Bundaberg do it really well Bundaberg have their artists in residence program they can bring people from overseas they can bring people up from Sydney Melbourne they can house them cost them nothing they 've got a studio they 've got a space they 've got fabulous shows that you know come out of those residences and there is this beautiful engagement between the visiting artists and the community of artists there I think around Queensland generally that is a lost opportunity for most regions I 'd say in terms of drawing on what is unique and I think that the environment exactly is is definitely is definitely it or a key a key part of that but it also expands your international connections to in doing that if you 're able to host someone well and then it 's that idea of information and skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region potentially developing a partnership relationship I think that 's a great opportunity to start talking about the new Gold Coast art gallery do you want to just give some context I guess to the effort the development of this you 've come in at a particular point but what that calorie is and and what it is for that community I guess and how it 's come to to be envisaged in terms of that community responding to what the Gold Coast needs okay so all there 's a few there 's a feud everything so I suppose probably two to answer that part of the question first I think that moving forward and into the future the role of well the role of art generally is is it 's a much more experience or role people want to not just look at it they want to be it they want to they know they want to make it they want to take the the photo of it they want to post images of what they 've done the experience they 've had they also want to touch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely the hands-on side of things or having that kind of experience is so deep now in in where we 're going with with galleries I think and that 's something that we 're very much looking at for the Gold Coast 's for the new building I mean one of the things that we 're doing you know we 're kind of testing things at the moment with with our community because we 've got this piddly little space that is up halved because we didn 't have any collection storage area so one of our exhibition spaces actually been closed and turned into a store that 's another story but because we felt that we were providing less opportunity for exhibitions we thought how are we going to continue to take our community and our audience and our artists on the journey with us to you know going from a 200 220 square metre space to a six and a half thousand square metre space plus on top of the building taking visual art out into the precinct so very much not only about having the building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone from that to that sort programming performance interact yeah everyone every so so I mean one of the things that that we 're very much looking at as we said we 've got a new name where home of the Arts which is pretty big cool but but very much because because we were an Arts Center so we very much we 're trying to break down the the the kind of perceived silos of theater cinema gallery which is where art is heading I mean those distinctions are becoming increasingly yes so we 're looking at a much more holistic way of programming across the whole precinct so at this stage you know galleries do tend to work quite you know work further in advance then then say a theater might so so we 've had opportunities over the last eighteen months two years to have an exit have a have a an exhibition project that then has scaffold around it of you know whether it 's artists doing workshops or doing Commission 's to working with like the good examples probably the the signs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a street art exhibition it was actually just from a private collection but that gave us the kind of I suppose that the nut to then build the rest of a program around it so we had you know we had skate video workshops where we had local skaters like not on-site but but outside of our space you know working with nationally recognized filmography to to film their skating which we then showed in the gallery we had we had ssin yeah we had an art auction as well an online art auction of local art like local street artists work we had you know we worked with a number of local artists to produce different workshops we had an artist who created a rap for a car and we had we had a couple of big events where we had where we combined music dance like it was it was a really great way to kind of build that community that that isn 't just about what happens in the gallery I 've probably gone off on a bit of a tangent but I guess what people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is changing what people expect it 's quite different now and so these previous models especially in terms of infrastructure I know long ago well they had no relative relevant but not working yep yeah and it 's using it 's using what you 've got in a different way I guess which is a really nice sort of correlation to the work the building work that we 've just undertaken here at the gallery with with very generous support from Council to repurpose our existing office space into a into a multi-purpose workshop space which we 've previously lacked and programming is a really important way to not just a build audience but to engage the audience with what 's on in the gallery Tracy you 've just got rid of a bunch of yours yeah I know even after I 've just said how great muscles Brooke price yes I have look at this stage there are a number the the Gold Coast has a little bit of ArtPrize fatigue I would say we 've had yeah we 've had it we have a photography prize that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had the Gold Coast Art Prize we have other annual exhibitions that aren 't necessarily prizes but but take up quite a lot of exhibition space throughout the year so one of the things that I mean I I have to say though that the Gold Coast is in a fortunate position that we are unlike a lot of regional galleries at the moment where there is actually a lot of money being poured into what we what we 're doing so even even in terms of acquisitions I have a very ridiculously healthy acquisition budget for a regional gallery at the moment so because of that as Hamish said I mean it 's across Australia most galleries develop their collections through prizes because that 's that 's how you get the money together and that 's how the Gold Coast was for a number of years but we 're in a position now where to acquire works for the collection we don 't need to go through a prize and so for me I 'm now looking at ways so we can we can buy the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support artists so so we 're now looking for me at what I think is is other meaningful ways that we can support artists so we 're working on lots of different commissions where we work with either a a name artist who 's mentored with a local artist or we give opportunities to local artists to create new work they get they get an artist fee they get their materials they get the support from us as well as you know a marketing team and things like that so so for me we 're we 're probably rather than a rather that rather than through an Art Prize giving opportunity smaller opportunities to a number of artists we 're giving more bigger opportunities to a more concentrated pool and we might and look we will have time for questions shortly but I 'll just say Tracy has that I mean in terms of having more control and allows you to instead of you know without prizes you don 't know what you 're going to get that gives you some direction control in terms of the whole shift towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned or acquire it probably will in the future I mean we 're into space first yeah we 're still I mean we 're working towards that end goal of well starting point I guess of 2021 and we have started talking to a number of artists okay there 's a local there 's an artist who 's based on the Gold Coast who we 've started conversations with about a major commission for the new building that will be one of the first things you see when you walk and walk in the door so for me to see a local artist work as a feature as soon as you walk in the door I think is really important so yeah so it will it we 're moving towards that model but we 're still kind of we 're in this transition kind of zone which is exciting and clear but before we open it up to questions I just want to talk about your shift from Moreton Bay to our design which for those of you who don 't know is I guess craft the peak peak body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home as well I really wanted to answer that question because really great because we 're not an archival organization we 're curatorial we have no collection so it 's all about experience it 's all about having a really powerful exhibition supported by great programming and access and communication of what we 're doing to answer your question Rick I think they 're also for regional galleries there needs to be really good online access to what your organization is doing I think that we don 't do a good enough job I think flying and it 's do a great thing they have webinars and they have all this sort of stuff that you can access at any time online but I think regional galleries could certainly improve the websites and the the the professional development support as well as which regional galleries do but in terms of how you make that visible Fine Arts is a wonderful organization but it 's set up to do absolutely set up for being accessible but you 're right in terms of how you can sell that exactly thinking about on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've found that people are mad for using their hands we started implementing making workshops a couple of years ago we have a woman Carol Russell who runs a spoon carving work shop which sells out six months ahead we cannot we cannot keep up with the demand of people wanting to learn how to weave wanting to connect to those legacy skills but they want the context of contemporary life and design embedded in that so maybe that 's that 's the connect it 's connecting with that you know the legacy skill but and we 've what it means that we 've certainly found that making workshops do extremely well in our and you know what again one of the reasons for the the obvious need for a dedicated space in in which to offer that but tonight was not a night such as that tonight 's been a night of talking and I hope I hope people have you know found something interesting or found something to connect to I will open it up to questions now so so rocky again was was in a in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed with a spurt of you know very rigorous purchasing and then and then and then there was this sort of you know that then there was this spread that not a lot happened and in the time just before I arrived at Rockhampton there being an incredibly generous benefactor who 'd passed away and left the gallery a substantial amount of money for a prize hadn 't put any kind of conditions around the prize but that money had to the gallery could determine was that so so again looking at what we had rather than rather than going along the lines of just an open prize you know that that would just be selecting every year I thought these guys put a lot of effort into what they chose so we should do the same thing so what we did was we developed our acquisition the acquisition policy needed to be rewritten and we developed an invitation award that meant that we could because it was because was fiftieth it 's a 50,000 prize so it 's a substantial amount of money and so the idea was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our collection that are going to complement you know these other great artists from last century and now where our legacy will be will be a similar thing so working with the most significant contemporary oh yes yes so so and and it 's been a great it 's been a great thing for Rockhampton in that that you know there 's some very important contemporary works that have now entered that collection which wouldn 't have wouldn 't we didn 't have an acquisition because the gallery had what what I think is really important about that is that the gallery had the authority to direct or shape that prize in relation to the collection that was already there there 's a connection there you want to build a collection of significant contemporary work to compliment the significant modernist works in your collection we might move to another question now can I can I talk to that can it um we had no money craft Queensland is lost it 's Australia Council funding a couple of years ago as part of the 65% of small-to-medium who lost their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been 381 Brunswick for 20 years in an arts Queensland building paying them rent we pay a quarter of our funded money back in rent we 're moving to a new location that is entirely funded via a private partnership the capital build and subsidized rent for the next seven years only reason we 're doing it it 's because we 're building relationships we 're talking with property developers and other companies who are supporting us to do that why because they can see value so again in a regional in exactly a bit like what you know what happened in in Rocky it 's about building those partnerships in your community being strategic about it so if we look at autism what what are we look at you know we 're all about harnessing creative and commercial opportunities for craftspeople designers and makers and people who cross over there a lot of visual artists who are jewelers and painters and crossover whatnot but it 's also about the conversations that we have in our sector about sustainability they 're about ethics you know the ethical sourcing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky in this last 12 months because I 've only been there for 18 months so this has been from go two ways twelve months been very very fast has been talking to you know some private partners and saying okay well so this precinct we 're moving into the RNA precinct through the support of lend-lease but not just them all of the companies there in the street are supporting us the buckin group our economy Jensen Bauer 's ridges so what we have is we 're talking about home so I know you guys are home of the Arts all of our communication is about home and it 's about moving home what does that mean it 's connecting your roots knowing your neighbors Queenslander supporting Queenslanders so then again you can see how that feeds into if you support others and you 're supporting or not but that gets reinvested into programs that support living makers in the same way that we have to think about sustainability of our organization more so perhaps than in a regional gallery artists are doing and craftspeople and designers are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way that a jeweler might have an Etsy shop won 't have a website might have bricks and mortar stockists a bit everywhere we have to think as you said in exactly the same way and I this minute your question is that enough at the moment I 'm the only full-time staff member at craft Queensland you have to look after yourself you can do what you can do I will so the other really important thing about artisan and something that contributes to your your funny income is that you sell yourself of Queensland makers and again that 's another really important platform for for makers to showcase their work in the peak Queensland body and gallery we might we might wrap it up now"

time out of your busy days to come and attend this forum it 's a great opportunity for us to share with you and what we 're doing in Council and just a bit of housekeeping first emergency exit so to the back both sides and the emergency assembly area is to the right of the building in the carpark the amenities if you don 't already know or down the hallway and to the left and there on your right-hand side in that corridor I 'd also like to welcome the people watching online and we 're streaming this today so welcome to you guys as well I 'd like to firstly welcome councillor Robinson to welcome and introduce this forum and councillor Robinson is the portfolio councillor for our economic development and innovation Thank You councillor good morning everybody and happy New Year to everybody for our 2018 hopefully it 's going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in council and firstly I 'd like to just acknowledge the traditional owners of the land in which we meet today the Kabhi Kabhie First Nations people and acknowledge their elders past present and emerging before I get started I might just ask the room hands up who wants to find more work in 2018 newBeauty 100% well done look there 's some really exciting things that are happening here in council and i just wanted to cover off on a couple of those things before we get into their presentations from the rest of the staff but hopefully as you 've wandered in you you 've noticed that around the room we 've just got a lot of council representation here every single one of those people are here to help you they 're here to help you to understand the system the process which is what this presentation is all about but also to connect with people so you 're actually talking to a real person not just some forum online and you 're actually understanding the business of council to help you find more work in 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor has said in recent times and hopefully a lot of it has resonated with you some a mark jeomsun has talked about that this region has about ten billion dollars worth of work in the pipeline over the next 20 or so years and we have a strategy through our regional economic development strategy and through major projects to really create a really exciting and professional hub here on the Sunshine Coast and a lot of it is predicated on the work that everybody in this room is doing but there 's a couple of fundamental building blocks in this last financial year council spent about 337 million dollars in its procurement process alone and about 240 million of that went to local contractors so even though I will be covering off very briefly on some of the major projects please understand that this is the basis of a trickle-down effect that hopefully will ensure that everybody in this room gets an opportunity if you haven 't already taken it to find work here on the Sunshine Coast or to expand your business you know whatever your aspirations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those big projects the first one is the Sunshine Coast Airport and I you know many others but I 'll just pick a couple the Sunshine Coast Airport so we 're talking about roughly a 350 million dollar project it will bring in over the life of the project about four billion dollars to our economy it will create I think somewhere around about seven or eight hundred jobs as we go through that process but you can imagine that the the sort of the flow-on effects of that Airport runway to so many businesses that rely on aviation and air transport for their business so certainly keep that in mind and council will be making some announcements in the next few weeks about the further progress of that project let 's talk about the ruchi CBD again a multi-billion dollar project over the next 10 20 years and it will create again a fantastic hub for this region but there are so many exciting things in that project it 's going to be the smile city in the region it 's going to create thousands and thousands of jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capital city of this region for many decades to come and you 'll see through again the tendering process etc many opportunities coming through that project one project that has received a little bit of information news in the past is the subsea cable the international broadband subsea cable and again because I 'm here for such a short time I can 't go into detail but please understand that if the Sunshine Coast is successful and we will be I believe we if we 're successful in landing this cable here on the Sunshine Coast it will ensure that we have direct connectivity to the rest of the world in the fastest speed that you can possibly imagine it 'd certainly be the fastest here in in all of Australia and it will connect your businesses directly to the rest of the world if you choose and further to that it will create a technology hub here on the Sunshine Coast that will be second to none it will attract all of those entities that really rely on fast broadband speed and the direct connection to the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project and again you 'll hear further announcements down the track we 've also got some of the well the largest residential development in Australia currently down at Ora and just up the road from that it 's harmony so we 're talking about Ora 50,000 people again you know multi-billion dollar project and it will create so many jobs and opportunities for our local contractors and supplies and the like and the same of the Harmony around about a three billion dollar project so ladies and gentlemen there are some very exciting projects that are in a pipeline that is going to last ten plus years and I 'm hoping that everybody in this room is really excited about the future and the opportunities and you know all I want you to do for the rest of the day is listen to the speakers find out where those opportunities fit for you make sure you talk to everybody in this room from Council who are here to help you and really get stuck into what will be a terrific 2018 thanks very much and have a great conference Cheers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying a new way to get some questions and feedbacks so throughout the presentations if you have any questions you can go online at slider calm and use the access code on the serene which is SCC SB m and we 'll ask those questions at the end of the forum to a panel so as councillor Robinson just alluded to we our vision is to be the most sustainable region healthy smart and creative and from a balanced budget of 722 million we have a 237 million of that in capital works projects and the spend as council also de salud to was 240 million last year and 71 percent of that going to local suppliers for the financial year to date we 're at about seventy three percent of the spend for this financial year and so that 's increasing this year again I 'd like to introduce Matt Matt is from our health and safety team he 's a health and safety adviser he 's going to give a presentation today on health and safety in the workplace thanks Matt morning everyone my name 's Matt Christie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been with Council since October last year so a relatively new starter at Council my background is private industry I 've worked for the likes of the John Holland 's Murphy pipe and civils worked on Santos Yugi says mainly in Thailand gas rail transmission and civil works so I 've come into council with a set of expectations and have been a guess enticed to come to council because I believe that we are a changing organization and we 're definitely rivaling those big tearing companies our safety our safety is definitely on the improve we are definitely on the way to a very safe environment for all our workers and and supplies and contractors and everyone on so I 'd say before I start into the general presentation here I just like to read a quote this is this is a quote by Paul O 'Neill in 2012 Hills al cowers CEO this this smart this short quote was delivered by him when the company was in financial difficulties back in 2012 and this was given to the start to the shareholders of the company so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at our workplace safety figures if we bring our injury rates down it won 't be because of cheerleading or the nonsense you sometimes hear from other CEOs it will be because the individuals at this company have agreed to become part of something important they 've devoted themselves to creating a habit of excellence safety will be an indicator that we 're making progress in changing our habits across the entire institution that 's how we should be judged so wide if accompanies in financial trouble why do they talk borders if like come out and talk about safety okay safety affects all aspects of your businesses and a house safety offers a common goal to all persons making up the whole of the company safety provides disciplined approached that everyone can take part in in any company good safety performance indicates companies have created a hub of habit of excellence in whatever they 're doing so no longer is safety a bolt-on to your systems in two hours it 's integrated into everything we do from design construction sorry design procurement and construction the council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve in safety we 'll try that way okay so just an overview of the type of work at Sunshine Coast Council we do rivals and tier 1 companies out there our budget the advantages of the big guys out there they might have two or three projects in Queensland that they 're working on whereas we 've got hundreds so we 're spread everywhere we 're very dynamic the types of construction projects at Council the council completes every year wide and varied so we 've got we 've got a lot of things that we 've exposed to our other companies may not be so things like working over water exposure to traffic and all roads working in the public domain which is a big one out there you know the general ones like working at height user hazardous materials electrical requirements and hazards on at all our facilities I 'm different in every case pretty much plant and machinery interaction with people and the public so most of our projects do involve high-risk work this has got to be managed as per legislative requirements and the codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally cumple companies through to the multinationals we work with a range of contractors and suppliers both small and local through those national and international presence HR is important as each other so we we are very clear on that we don 't think big guys are more important than the little guys obviously with we want to work with everyone that doesn 't matter size or status okay with those points in mind how do we can how do we consistently approach safety during tender time a request for quote all that sort of thing when we 've got such differing safety systems out there we endeavor to provide detailed project documentation so contractors can understand the scope of work very clearly before you submit anything sunshine class council has a procurement system which requests standard responses and documentation from all tenders so not one is disadvantaged against another we have the same set of questions you guys need to answer safety documentation and Safe Work methodologies is very important there are key consideration during tender assessment how are you going to execute the job safely okay that methodology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract is awarded will work you will work with you sorry and provide that oversight on-site through collaborative site inspections audits and senior management will also be out on your sites having a look at how you 're operating the most important thing here for me is if you guys say you 're going to do something then you do it okay and our job as counsel and client will be to come out and make sure that you guys are if you 're struggling with something we 're more than happy to help you along that job isn 't with a big stick is to help you guys perform to your optimum and within your system so you guys are compliant we are having a review of the project procurement system this year this will increase Sunshine Coast counsel 's understanding of your capabilities prior to arriving on site we 're going to be asking a lot more really detailed questions there 's a lot of work being done in that space at the moment and we 'll definitely keep you in the loop about what that documentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally I just like to touch on our seven safety essentials these seven station essentials have been recently introduced as a reminder for all persons undertaking what worked for Council to think about what 's important and and provide some simple ways to say safety out there on site I won 't read through them you 'll get this documentation as you tend a job so just have a read through it it 's something that the council is passionate about you 'll see it on all their vehicles there 's been a lot of Bowen and council and we recommend that you know you understand them and work within those bounds of these seven safety essentials as I said before just as on closing the safety guy as a council are here to assist you we 're more than happy to answer any questions you guys have we 're not here to be a barrier to you guys executing your works coming from private that 's just not how business works we need to get you guys over the line to help you say any questions please come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need phone numbers fine I 'll give you my phone number or good and I very much appreciate your time and look forward to working with you thank you [Applause] thanks Matt I 'm just gonna pop back a couple of slides for anyone who missed the Q&A information there so that 's the website slide Oh calm and the code to go with it if you 'd like to ask some questions alright thanks for that and I 'd now like to introduce Matt sorry Chris Chris Sturges who is our manager of project delivery at the moment our acting manager and Chris is going to come and talk to us today about some of the exciting things we 've got on the forefront in our capital works program morning everyone fantastic to be with you again this year probably been a year I wasn 't here doing presentations last year but the did the year before so great to see a lot of people in the room again as Alissa said I 'm the current acting manager for the project Delivery Unit so today what we wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to try and build relationships for us to tell you what we 've got going on over the next short period six months and 12 months as we enter into a new financial year we get a whole range of new projects mid-year to kick off again and explain to you and try and convey that understanding of what we 're looking for in a contract and here you can get work for Council so just to give you the context with the project Delivery Unit we have three main project teams our civil project team and recreation sports and Parks project team and our what we call our urban project team so the values on the on the presentation up there are the annual delivery volumes you know you know dollar cents so the civil teams at 40 million reckon sports projects 22 and urban 33 acquiring to about 95 million dollars that we delivered this year so as Alissa said a total basis councils got around that 240 million dollar mark project delivery certainly has a large share of that but not all of it and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset management team who deliver some of our large road resurfacing programs and another program so I 'd certainly make sure you talk to those other areas because they 're definitely doing large pieces of the capital works program for the year every year Council adopts a new capital works program it 's adopted in program streams so everything from waste programs aerodrums building facilities transportation stormwater it 's a whole range of programs that are broken then into sub programs so that we can really identify each project and each projects budget and scope one of the the key pieces of work that we have been doing over the last couple of years is what 's called our advanced design program so we 've been really focused on trying to get our projects designed advanced in advance of our construction delivery year so what you 'll find is we 've really been out there particularly trying to work with the consultants and budgeting funds for that design and approvals phase because that there 's a lot of work in that there 's a lot of you know quite often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff we 've got to get through these days that mean that we 've really got got to get those designs on the Shelf a year before we 're about to launch into construction so we 're shovel ready and we give ourselves the best opportunity of procuring those contracts and and doing that work in the financial year that the projects budgeted for so if anyone needs and I know they 've seen some familiar faces in the room from our consultant industry contacts with our design partners in Council and we do have a dedicated design and placemaking branch that I can certainly give you contact names who have been out there trying to procure some of that advanced design work for next year 's program and and the in the following years program so what that does for us is it also allows us some more procurement flexibility so that when we have that range of projects designed in advance we can then make some smarter decisions about how we go to market with that whether we want to go to quote go to tender we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same locality so that we can try and get some value for our AO rate dollar in our community as well this slide was basically trying to represent where we 've spent a lot of money over the last financial year in this financial year in terms of the the range of procurement value so that on your left the table really shows the value of the purchase orders that are coming out through the project delivery area and we see that in on the blue line we 've basically got the 0 to 250,000 section of work and then I think 250,000 to a million and the gray being over a million and we do have a spike last year which is from projects like our solar farm which has just been successfully delivered but we do have in that order of sort of 25 million dollars where the work that 's going out in that zero to 250,000 range so on your right you can see that by number and the overwhelming category there is that 1600 odd purchase orders in that 0 to 250,000 range so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we said we 've got the local business focus so there is opportunities for for smaller and local businesses to definitely win work and that that graph definitely indicates where the volume of work is we 've got as I said before the the 3 project team areas the civil team here and just to give you a bit of a flavor of what 's coming up over the next few months we 've got some projects across the board mini Andina we 're continuing some streetscape works that 'll go to market we 've got some stormwater upgrades in torille drives which is stormwater and roadworks we 've got some bridge renewal work at chambers and over Chambers Island Bridge some fairly specialist DNC contract work there we 've got some advanced design work in the blow-by-blow streetscape work and again that 's in that theory of trying to get work designed before construction years we 've got some pedestrian crossing facilities into Montville we 'll go out to market and a gross pollutant trap in Calandra that 's based off a program of training improve our water quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a few projects coming to market there we 've got them a little bar spit coastal pathway boardwalk which is a pretty big one for council over the next two years I think the figure there we 're seeing is a million dollars but the actual project when you look at next year 's budget is I think about another million again so quite a significant upgrade there the bedroom Lions Park Elizabeth Daniels Park public amenities so a renewal there the budget Village Park car park and if anyone 's having to do with the budget village park and the new structure that went in there just before Christmas and was open for the carols this is extra car parking up in that region we 've got some Kenilworth amenities and this drops into that category I was talking about before where we 've got a couple of amenities blocks where we package together to try and create some value and to try and I guess make it easier for a contractor to go out there and hopefully build two sets of amenities rather than one and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus and a flavour at Council of trying to to deal with our renewal issues as a priority so that we keep our assets at a service level that the community expects you know in projects area we 've got some major upgrades coming in the calendar event center over the next couple of years so you can see six million dollars there that 'll go out in a variety of DNC packages we 've got the Malabar bikeway bridge for those of you are familiar with the separated sock weight cycle way down at Brisbane Road my little bar a bridge that links that over into the river Esplanade and onto the mula bar foreshore we 've got community center coming at BER Inga down in the new Calandra South Area the sippy Creek Depot car park coming up we 've got various Aquatic Center projects so again projects where we package work together for renewal and upgrades in our kwatak senator we 've got the Nambour heritage tram project which were working through design and would hope to be able to take to market for various civil components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center design tender which would be a fairly big tender and design for council assorted mecalac upgrades and council buildings which again packages of work and and some consultancy investigations so more than happy to try and connect anyone who 's interested in some of that work to the appropriate people in council I think as councillor Robinson mentioned before we 're really at council pushing into the smart city space and working with partners like the Caloundra South Area the Mirchi door new CBD project to try and get the Smart City connections into there and that 's everything from the optic fiber through to smart lighting through to smart irrigation Wi-Fi all of that sort of stuff so we 're really hoping to sort of really build that into a great deal of the projects we do but we 're focused on on those couple of areas for a start and we 'll be out seeking quotes to help us get that that in the ground just to I think this is nothing new we 've shown this slide for the last couple of years but it it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about that we definitely do have a mixed range of services that we have have to go external for to support us in council we do have some survey capacity but we do look for survey work in the private industry from the external market we don 't have any geotechnical but we do have civil and landscape design teams which probably do about 50% of our work and we get 50 percent done externally all of our environmental structural design lighting and traffic design are all external so we always get that externally from council we do have a day labor arm for our civil construction represented by a civil asset management team down the back and we sort of have about 50 of our civil program that 's delivered internally and externally but I must say even with our internal delivery there 's a huge range of subcontracted work that goes out by that as well and it 's worth talking to our civil asset people and making sure that you 're tuned into that subcontract work coming through them all of our landscape construction work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise or capacity and we go to the external market for that work we have a number of panels that we manage and we we lean on basically the landscape construction civil construction playground equipment panels are areas of work where we know we always are seeking services so we have those pre-qualified panels so that we know who our our go-to-market is on the coast to try and engage with them but we do try and renew them and and you know it 's important for us to get to know you and to see whether really when an opportunity arises if you 're not on those panels that we can try and build a relationship and start to work with you and get you on those panels in the future so I guess in summary it 's you know the theme really for the today again is is and why we want to work with you is get to know you better you know there 's a lot of relationship building going on where you know we 'd like to know how you work you know I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the expectations and sometimes that 's only built up by repeat work as matt said we 're very interested in the methodology methodologies that you guys have proposed to deliver you know that we want to know when you 've quoted for some work you 've thought about how you 're going to manage the project you know we we 're you know in such a tourist area here on the coast we 've got high public impact and you know that you 've thought about how you 're managing pedestrians around construction sites through through that and that we 've you know got safe outcomes throughout that whole process that you 've got a good track record with council you know that we trust and depend on you and you know what we are about we know what about our drivers as matt said is we 're on a safety and a proactive safety improvement journey and that 's really important to us and we want to know that we 're working with companies who share that that vision and goal as well we do want to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our procurement process to ensure that we do properly wait and and work with our local suppliers wherever we can and really just keeping that positive attitude and establishing those long-term dependable relationships that 's what we were all about so thank you very much I 'll hand over to back to Alissa appreciate your time [Applause] Thanks that Chris so I 'd now like to introduce Greg Greg 's from our property management branch and

to help us set up with some questions so arm yeah walk and come and see sail away thanks for your time [Applause] thanks Greg and we are now going to have a man to come and present Amanda 's from our economic development branch and she 's going to talk about ways that we can enhance opportunities and skills of businesses and the great work economic development of doing in this space for all but local businesses and other businesses thanks Amanda good morning my name is Amanda gory and part of my role is to work with the small businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them grow and develop councils really committed to growing their small businesses on the Sunshine Coast so they 've introduced what we call the Business Development Program there 's a couple of different portions to this we provide them one on one tailored support this is where we can come out to the business chat with you guys identify if you have any challenges or if there 's any areas that want you want to grow or attract new markets we come and sit down with you guys and provide tailored support and connect you with other parts of council and different tools and resources that are available we provide your information on grants and mentoring and different programs that are available to businesses we link you with workshops and events events like this this is one of our vents but we also have an educational and business development type of events that we do also we 've developed a range of resources to assist businesses during circum set so comes during certain circumstances got it including disaster preparedness so we do get hit by cyclones and severe weather here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have focused on is assisting businesses develop through those times so we do have some of the workshops if you wanted to take a photo of this we will be able to provide you with this information also one of the ones that we do have available coming up this Monday is our business marketing this is an opportunity for you guys to come and sit through a workshop with us that 's going to be talking about collaborative marketing and how you can work with other parts of businesses in your area or or businesses that are of in similar services to you the one day business management systems workshop this is a workshop that we provide businesses to be able to assist them with the support processes that they need in place when tendering for some of those larger contracts that we have going the doing business with Council this is something that if any of you are wanting to any of the businesses in this audience are wanting to work with Council this is something that you should definitely be attending this is an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have two dates up here so if you wanted to take note we 've got a one on the 16th of February and one on the 9th of March the one on the 9th of March is actually going to be a webinar so you can do that this is an hour and a half workshop broken down for you to be able to understand fully a procurement processes but also what we look for in certain sections of our methodology what to include in some parts of the forms we also have access and I 've got some of this information up the back so sorry up the back if you wanted to grab some information is the business gateway this is really a great platform for small businesses to be able to connect with some of the larger procurement opportunities and projects available throughout the region but also for the larger businesses that are in the room to be able to connect with some subcontractors available this is a great tool to be able to register and it 's we 've got some information up the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all righty so we 've heard now some great things about the work that 's coming up and some opportunities that are available for those in the room and other businesses that are online watching so now I 'm going to talk about the how-to so I 'm the acting manager at the moment of business development and that incorporates both the procurement and contracting units and I 'm going to talk about contracting with Council so how does it happen we mostly engage in our contracts in two ways and they are written tenders and therefore contracts over 200,000 for the most part we also do quoting and you 'll see or you 've probably been invited for or if you haven 't we have a request for quote process and and that 's what we do to request quotes under the value of 200,000 and generally for contracts that are over the value of 15,000 with our tenders we advertise these in the paper and we also advertise them through our tender alert service and on cue tenders they 're open for a period of three weeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we mark and score the tenders we receive and make an assessment on who 's going to win that work we go to the market and the market responds to the with offers to that work that we 've put out the request for quote process is very similar and the difference being that we elect who we 're going to invite for those quotes generally it 's a minimum of three businesses who are capable of writing the services that were after we have it open for a reasonable amount of time to allow those businesses to properly formulate a response for us and again we mark that against predetermined evaluation criteria we 'll invite documents with will invite offers with some documentation and they 'll either be called an invitation to tender or a request for quote with those documents you 'll find one of the most important pieces is a specification or the scope of works that we 're asking to be delivered so this will outline the goods or services all the works have drawings everything you should need to know to understand what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll also have the terms and conditions of the contract that we 're going to enter into with the supplier and it 'll also have what we call tender process terms all the rules around how we 're going to do this process with you in our tender we 'll also have a tender or a request for quote response form this is where you put your information in to give your offer so the evaluation criteria this is that presently we have six evaluation criteria we have price capability and experience methodology health and safety environment sustainability and the contribution to the local economy these criteria aren 't evenly weighted and that 's important to note and they 're different for every type of thing we do so we apportion that criteria based on what it is we 're actually asking the market for so it will not be the same from one type of goods and services to a construction job so the tender will quote response form this is where it 's won and lost guys this is where you provide your offer for the goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specification or what it is we 're asking for you answer a schedule of questions which include basic information about your business and also very clearly articulate how it is you 're going to deliver the services or the method by which you 're going to deliver those services and that 's the methodology in capability experience outline why your business is capable of doing the works that were after what 's your experience in this field and how have you delivered this before be clear and succinct 50 to 100 pages of brochures aren 't going to help us assess your tender or quote provide meaningful information in that about how you 're going to deliver it and make it specific to what counsel is asking for contribution to the local economy this is always an interesting one and this is where we come to having a look at both our local spend and how we 're contributing or how the businesses are going to contribute to the local economy Council aims to encourage the development growth and sustainability of the local economy and we do this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the local economy including things like how you support employment opportunities on the Sunshine Coast what do you do in that space what social contributions you make to for example vulnerable groups indigenous community council also has a reconciliation action plan and its supports indigenous supplier diversity economic independence is one of the building blocks of a good economy and we value linking our Aboriginal Torres Strait island businesses with the private sector and with government supply chains the black business finder and we 'll have links to this further in the slides is an initiative of the of the ICM which is the industry capability network and is the directory for Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and in that directory you can limit it down to the Sunshine Coast region or any region in Queensland so you 've heard a little bit talk from Chris about supplier arrangements there we have counsel have a number of a supplier arrangements we have two types of supplier arrangements some a register of pre-qualified suppliers and some are preferred supplier arrangements counsel can only create these lists or preferred supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on one of those lists and you want to get on one of those lists you have to tender when we next put one of those out to market we can only create some of those arrangements for two years but we generally between two and four years those arrangements will span form however this even though we have a number of supplier arrangements they don 't cover all the services that counsel requires so to give you a snapshot of that at the moment we have about 28 supplier arrangements which both types of arrangements 18 of these relate to just goods and services 7 relate to construction work or similar work design work and 3 of them relate to fleet equipment leasing or hire services so we don 't have supplier arrangements for every type of good or service we require and if we have specific jobs that don 't meet what we 've asked for in those arrangements we won 't use them and we 'll go to market to request quotes but generally these will cover our run-of-the-mill goods and services or works that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use two platforms at the moment queue tenders which is the queensland government tender site so you 'll not only get opportunities from this council but from other councils in Queensland from the state government and those things if you haven 't registered for that service you should do so requesting quotes you 'll receive that specifically directed to your business and it will be through the open windows a tendering portal where you can electronically respond in a very similar manner to queue tender to the quotes that you 've been asked to quote on also as part of our contracts is our contract performance management framework and this is about making our contracts work work well for council work well for the businesses we 're contracting with these will have things like key performance indicators when we 're going to have performance reviews and also feedback it 's a two-way street feedback for you and feedback for us you may have heard of their local preference in procurement council have a guideline that talks about how we 're going to support local businesses and our procurement activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what we must do for contracts between certain values so we 're we 're going out to quote for a contract between zero and 15,000 we only required to seek one quote doesn 't mean we only seek one just means we only require two and will we have to seek this close of this quote only from local or a deemed local business for 15 to 100,000 we have to request three quotes and a minimum of two of these must be from local or damn local businesses we also evaluate that question around local economy I talked about earlier and 15 percent attributed to that so 15 percent of your score goes to how well you answer that question between 100 and 200 we have to request a minimum of one local from one local supplier or deemed local supplier and a written tender over 200 thousand dollars we 're going to the open market so whoever wishes to apply can do so however will still be evaluating that 15 percent for the contribution to the local economy and I can tell you that traditionally local businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there what you do for your local community put in there the things that you support and the locals you employ whether you support traineeships or apprenticeships on the Sunshine Coast if you 're an outside of region business how you 're going to contribute to the local coast with local Sunshine Coast economy what you 're going to do in this space if you 're awarded a contract it 's really important to help us actually assess how you 're going to contribute to the local economy so having a local office here isn 't going to be enough it 's really demonstrating what it is you 're going to do here and building relationships Chris Chris touched on this in hence um building relationships is really important for us and we need to build those relationships with you and we do so this happens through exchanging information through being engaged in these forums maintaining an open dialogue with industries about what it is we 're doing what we 've got up-and-coming giving and receiving feedback about how we 're putting things to market are we giving you enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also through the contract performance framework we like to provide opportunities to work with Council and other organizations and that 's the ICN gateway those major projects that have been talked about today and trying to link businesses with those contracts also providing the training and workshops that Amanda touched on however even though we like to build our relationships there 's times when we can only communicate with you in a certain way and this is around our probity framework so when we 're in a process in a tender or a quote process we were pretty restrained as to what kind of communications we can have with the businesses who are competing for that work and the reason for this is we 're trying to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity and that it 's transparent and fair we like we have to treat all businesses equally during that process so anyone who asks questions during a tender or quote process that question is going to be answered not only to you but everyone else who 's either registered and interest in or is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain an equal playing field and to make sure everyone 's in the same position but it doesn 't need to inhibit us having a good business relationship it just means at certain points in time we can only communicate with you in a certain way so other opportunities we 've got that Amanda talked earlier about a couple of those they 're doing business with counsel and business management workshops and there 's a slide that 's not in here that will be available when these slides are released it has a link to both the tender alert service the Queensland Government tender alert service the Sunshine Coast business gateway ICM a gateway local by arrangements Council uses some other state government and local by arrangements for certain works but it 's fairly limited and that 's it for me thank you very much and we 'll have some question-and-answer opportunity now so thank you very much to everybody that has submitted some questions we 've got some top questions that have come through that I 'll let probably these guys answer so one of the questions that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does counsel support in preference any organizations seeking ice iso accreditation iso critic accreditation is one of the questions we ask you now tend to respond some quiet response form so are you are so accredited and so we certainly do evaluate that when we 're evaluating tender and quiet responses however if you 're not iso accredited it doesn 't restrict your ability to answer that question because it 's more encompassing that than that and about your quality management framework one of the questions here is will the presentations being made available online yes they will be the open sent out shortly that will be available and that will be sent out to everybody that has registered for the event Chris I believe this is a question for you is the projected and current works programs available online on the website or in a supplier portal for suppliers to see in advance the answer is Council publishes its annual capital works program but I 'm not sure if it 's every line or whether it 's a summary at a higher level so might be something we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly available online this is probably another question for Alyssa do the project of the reproach or both of you guys the project delivery projects under two hundred thousand dollars get advertised via queue tenders or other channels of providing those works and also through the supplier arrangements that Chris alluded to in his slides so there are a number of supplier engines we have the cover open space civil design landscape construction a whole range of things so finding out about those arrangements and when they expire and putting you you had in the ring next time they come around is a good opportunity also when forming those relationships with our project delivery team as Chris talked about to get your name out there to get you invited for quotes Thank You Alyssa the pest control which I believe is Greg the pest control is a whole of region smaller businesses submission for portions of that contract as well they 're the major questions that have come through guys from behalf of all of us I really want to thank you all for coming out we do realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnout thank you very much for coming along we really want to help support the businesses in the Sunshine Coast to be able to reach our objectives and goals but also to be able to support you guys increase your employment but also you know grow your businesses I encourage you all to take time to be able to network with the teams build those reports and connect with our team thank you very much [Applause]"

thoughts of what we thought about the program itself and how its impacted us and you know the changes that we 've made both in the community and within ourselves and yeah it 's been a great opportunity make friends so looking to share hi I 'm Alexia satara I am 13 years old and I go to Immanuel Lutheran College my name is George Stevens I 'm 15 years old and I got him ready to do state high school my name is Evan I 'm 13 years old and I go to Montessori International College I 'm 17 I live in Mount colon and I 've lived on the Sunshine Coast for eight years I first moved here back in grade four it 's been a wild ride what I like most about living on the Sunshine Coast is that it 's always really sunny and it has great weather and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family best part about the coast I reckon is definitely the people I 've loved him since I 've come here and I can 't get enough of just hanging out and talking and learning from others and you know sharing time with others it 's great I enjoy the beach lifestyle I love the climate and I 've lived here my whole life so I 've got lots of friends here and stuff my plans for the next five years are to finish school and then once I finished school I 'll probably do a bit of traveling graduate school you know this year hopefully get a good ok I 'm really praying I want to go into physics and mathematics course either here in Queensland and stay with the family and the friends or move to Melbourne and try and get the best study I can probably go to Monash I want to keep myself involved in music leadership and advocacy in the community joining the Queensland Conservatorium and also doing more leadership programs that can develop my skills further I plan on graduating from high school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field I joined this back up engage program because it is a great opportunity to meet with people and discuss issues that we feel are affecting youth I think it 's an amazing opportunity for me to come in and work with council members on a regular basis have meetings hear their plans and give my say what I think would be good for the community not just opposing things and saying I don 't believe this is good I don 't agree with that but give recommendations give plans give a voice to youth I joined this week have an engaged program to make a difference and to be a part of a group where I can share my ideas I thought it would be a great opportunity to have a say within my community I want to see in the action plan more opportunities for all young people to have their say and more volunteering opportunities I 'd like to see a lot of emphasis in the action plan on engagement for youth things like getting out and finding a job or being more active in their school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or advocacy and I like to see opportunities for youth to engage with each other and really build their skills as communicators their soft skills and also just make more friends speak up and engage has really given me a voice in the community and I feel like I can share my ideas more and my perspective on things as a young person I feel like I have a voice in the community I have a lot of opportunity to say what I want through school leadership or volunteering or speaking competitions or programs but I feel like the voice is quite a hollow one we don 't get to act on that much there 's not a lot of influence taken from it and people don 't really they hear the opinion of youth but they don 't act on it and it 's you know a well heard voice but not a well acted on one well before I joined the Speak Up engage I didn 't feel as if I had such a big voice in the community but now that I 've joined Speak Up engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned many skills such as leadership public speaking and being a part of a team the speak up engage program has definitely helped me develop my skills in leadership and has given me more confidence to make friends and say what I feel dissipation in the speak up engaged program has given me an amazing opportunity to develop my own personal skills things like communication leader team-building and it 's been great to just mesh with people that I can understand in people who I just don 't understand at all so that I can learn from them and you know build myself as a human being the thing I 'm enjoying most about being a part of the Speak Up engage program is being able to help draft the youth action plan and then presenting it to the mayor councillors and CEO it 's a really great opportunity and we learn lots of stuff about leadership and all of the qualities that I am into and I 've made some really great friends as awesome people that have such optimistic minds I feel it 's a great opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions that are made around it I would definitely recommend the program in fact I already have a couple of friends at school it 's a great opportunity to get into the council get into local government and you know have your voice heard rather than just spreading it around I would recommend Speak Up engaged to young people because I think it is a great opportunity for young people to come together and discuss issues affecting youth I 've definitely got a better understanding of what council has done for the Sunshine Coast and in the community to help with activities and everything to just improve our life here I didn 't know much about council before I came to shake up an edge it was pretty there 's this anonymous sort of body that work in the background but since I 've come here it 's it 's been enlightening to really understand that they have so many action plans moving at once and they have so many roles within the community to build it up and make it a better place I have learned how to really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of personalities on a project I 've learnt lots of being part of the program but I 've mostly learnt about confidence and all of my leadership skills that I 've now developed I 've learnt about how large council 's role is within the community and how the Sunshine Coast depends on all the tasks they perform speak up engage has taught me a lot about withdrawing my own voice and sitting back and listening to those of others because not only youth but all people are incredibly diverse and my rather our field of view has just been massively broadened by all the voices and people that I 've heard speak on their beliefs on issues let 's pick up engage and it 's been amazing I think it 's important for counsel to deliver programs like Speak Up engage because it really gives an insight into what counsel does and how much work goes into everything it 's important because well you know we 're the future of the Sunshine Coast I think programs like speak up engage your imperative for the council to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that often from youth people are often heralded how disengaged they are and how inactive they are in the community so it 's amazing to see the council working to you know what will you have to say the best part of Speak Up engage was the shadowing and mentoring day that I did at council chambers with the manager of marketing Lynn Saunders I learned about all the responsibilities of councils communication branch such as marketing graphic design and social media the best part of this week on engage program was making new friendships and having my say about the community I live in for me was meeting all of my new friends and all of the learning and workshops that we did and just developing my confidence the best part of Speak Up engage program from the beginning has always been the opportunities we have to give our voice as youth not as feedback not as you know an individual proposition it 's more of what we actually have to say on issues and what solutions we can offer it 's it 's been really influential and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing ideas one thing I 'll take away from the program is believing that I can make a difference in the world the one thing I 'll take away from the program is a passion for public policy active leadership in the community not just like in your school or an uni it 's getting involved in things like local council governments and all that amazing stuff that actually makes change and solves problems I believe young people on the coast should sign up for this program because it 's a great opportunity to make friendships with like-minded people on the coast all young people should sign up for speak up engage because it is a truly an amazing experience and it gives you the opportunity to have your say you also gain so many new skills from it which will help in future work live that young people should sign up for this program in the future because it really gives them a chance to learn and improve their skills meet new people and have lots of fun thanks pick up engage is a program that all young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to give you a voice within the council and within you know the actual community of the Sunshine Coast and not only that it 's an amazing opportunity to build yourself as a person and as someone who can create change it gives you leadership skills communication skills teamwork skills and you make great friends there 's no reason why not why you shouldn 't join [Music]"

you know just talking about this program back in March and we 're already right at the end of July isn 't the years going fast so tonight we 're talking customer satisfaction systems which really is applicable to most businesses most businesses have customers and most businesses want them to be satisfied so we think if this is your first webinar with us or whether this is your tenth one with us a big huge welcome glad you 've found the time and even if you 're watching this is a recording down the track we don 't mind that at all key is that you 're getting information and even better hopefully doing something with it this webinar tonight is part of the Sunshine Coast councils amazing little app program which is aimed at people like you smaller medium businesses here on the Sunshine Coast we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBN where available which is rolling out across the region but most importantly not just getting faster internet but actually using that faster internet to do cool stuff that makes your business make more money and save time there 's so many digital tools out there it 's really hard to find the time to research them and know what 's any good so that 's why we 're putting it all together in this easy format just jump on for an hour learn about stuff we pull an expert so I 'll introduce you to our experts for tonight in just a moment and hopefully get some really great information to drive your business for no matter what stage of business you 're at if this is your first webinar my name is Yvette Adams I run a company here on the coast called the creative collective and I 've also put a training organisation called the training collective my company successfully tenders and ones the contract with the Sunshine Coast Council and I happen to be the chairman of the council task forces to the knowledge and professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community and really great that the council got behind it ended doing something apart from being a business owner I 'm a mum I do everything online because it has to around kids so a lot of it on my mobile and I love on the real geek finding out about new online systems and I love finding businesses that are creating cool stuff not just consuming digital tools so really excited tonight to introduce you to Steve Lawrence to has shorter hair there than he actually done in person so I just thought you don 't mind Steve or grabs a picture off the internet of you standing in this a boardroom but welcome on tonight 's webinar are you doing your best pleasure to be great great to have you see would you mind telling the audience a little bit about yourself and I guess most importantly of all the the connections a customer satisfaction system yes certainly so in 2006 I opened up a service office business called noosa bordering obviously up and loser and it was to traditional service offices in about three years into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market research work and through the Neuse accountant in Sunshine Coast counsel doing surveys business surveys which was great for a few years about two years ago I realized the surveys that we were doing were quite intense for the client or for the business the person doing the survey and started looking around for a simple way to get quick and easy feedback there wasn 't much out there software wise and chance interaction with a developer at noosa boardroom led to us coming up with an idea for a very simple customer feedback system which is called in sampled and I look forward talking it a bit about it 's not that 's awesome Savior so love you detects Shannon a few our local businesses maybe even filled in the it 's called early isn 't it business confidence survey and it still goes today doesn 't it it so we do we 've been doing that 's one of our sort of products Sunshine Coast and Gympie Moreton Bay Ipswich and will such a lot of in-depth business-to-business survey so phone surveys online paper-based focus groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrating on quick and easy feedback and sample now I just had a meeting today with Sunshine Coast Council we 're doing their market research for the horizon Arts Festival which starts up next month that 's quite an index you know phone on-site survey with iPads that the full sort of the full breadth of it but in sampled is included in that as one of the tools to get feedback from the punters yeah awesome amber will like quick and easy everything recipe business advice and definitely customer satisfaction so just to paint the picture of where I guess this sits and regards everything our last week we did another topic which is customer experience systems but these two are pretty closely linked so as we talked about last week in case you weren 't on it Gartner defines customer experience management as a practice of designing and reacting to customer interactions to meet their expectations and let 's face it customer expectations keep getting higher they want quicker response times they want a better service things are more transparent companies are more accountable I mean look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as your last ride or your life poster people can give you a bad review and it 's kind of all downhill from there so if that 's something you 're interested in the check the webinar recording out is available live chat online phone system CRM which is some of the customer experience systems we discussed that can really elevate the experience that your customers are having with your business and helping your response times and helping personalize the experience and bunches of other stuff so tonight 's topics all customer satisfaction so there 's a description on the screen there Seve but what your how do you explain customer satisfactions people when they ask you what is cut an assessment the question you 've pretty much covered it there is a quite quite a good answer I guess it 's no when I started doing the market research and then feedback and satisfaction I was expecting to see a lot more negative responses but customer satisfaction I found out is pretty much always positive it 's rarely you get the bad the bad ones it 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a big list here of the reasons why you should be doing it so going from no engagement improving your product services and asking your customer now engaging after sailing spent all this time and money marketing developing your products and services getting the client to purchase and some most businesses just stop there when you should be continuing after the sale asking the customers where you satisfied with the service or product and then using that feedback to develop further and improve the engagement with the client absolutely so let 's flip over to slide 7 now this is a recap because we did cover it last week so I guess we can flip it a little bit last week we talked about the customer lifecycle and if you 've rightfully pointed out just not now Steve you need to measure the customer satisfaction not just once but it 's different portal and life cycle so last week I encouraged you and also in the workshop if you attended that recently I encourage you to map out your customer lifecycle so I see it will be different ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a service if you sell online if there 's a bricks and mortar store but love you detects and if you have gone to them at home work that is pretty important but then a lot of companies measures its satisfaction at the very end of the journey but what should thoughts on that Steve I mean is there a recipe for how often ishes measurers work which point for any words of advice around that yeah they 'll get out this a lot and a dependent on I guess the actual type of product or service you 're selling using as an example some of our clients like Mortgage Choice for example you know you 're getting a loan for a house which is a once or twice in a lifetime purchase for most people you ask at the end of the sale there but if you go to a hairdresser for example you 'll be wanting to ask every single time hell with the Hecker and so depends on the product and service you 're providing is how often you ask yeah absolutely so moving on we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover different stuff so if you are Zohar does probably be the same as a workshop it 's not I did a bunch of research and we 've got seeds within lean on him tonight but to look at some ways to measure customer satisfaction and I guess they bound or done some research on what is the latest and greatest way I use a lot of us think customer satisfaction and they think of a survey at the end like a long kind of email survey but now this enact surveys if post ever surveys is si si si customer satisfaction scores Nikolas Promoter scores and bunches of others we 're going to go into each of those in more detail so we 'll just skip over that slide from there so an expose please pop up all the time these days don 't they see you have much to do with them yes definitely a new sub or drink as you get to the website during business hours would be a pop up cannot for sure asking got any questions how 's it going for the thing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grabbing someone while they 're there and asking them how has the experience and the website going or if you 're in a shopping basket knows making sure everything is going smooth through there and having the ability to ask questions and help the client through the process of whatever they 're doing on your website yeah cool and I mean let 's face it when we talk in the industry ayman we talk about mobile first so a lot of people spend a lot of time on mobiles and popping up things while they 're doing an experience on an app or on a social network or somewhere where they already are means you get in front of them and you can actually capture some feedback so do think about whether any surveying you 're doing now or might go in the future and whether you can do it by mobile bar an app or something along those lines so enact surveys this one on screen is flock apps calm don 't know considers that one see no money around yeah I 'm according to this and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison and you can see how a company compares the rest of the world and it auto could use survey options and it 's got all sorts of you know templates and things so it can just sort of fast-track the process if you 're new to surveys that could be kind of helpful let 's move on to post service survey tips and if you are a service based business and maybe whether you do a survey or not so you tell us about service both surveys and what you can share with the audience what they should know they 're looking at doing me yeah so there 's a number of different methods and once again I 'll guess your touch not a bit later is like how much time do you ask your client to give feedback once again expose it depends on the service or product that you 're selling but you want to I guess ask a whole bunch of questions about how was the product in service for us that how with the communication how were the staff involved asking both qualitative and quantitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much tells you what they think high rating obviously good low rating something 's going wrong but then asking as we do it in Sanford for example you know the first screen is a 1 to 10 rating depending on what the score is so we 'll either go if it 's a low score what was wrong with the service if it 's a great score or last thanks why don 't you like about it but once again rating I guess is an easy way just to quickly to get some feedback and then asking more in-depth questions depending on the rating yeah awesome I like that point that last point of having a rating score because it takes the pressure off and it really is a good way that sort of yet do more quantitative isn 't it take that in there on that I mean an element one of our KPI is always response rates everything we do in market research or satisfaction surveys or feedback is you know you want to get a high response rate so making it easy for the person doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on more on post service surveys here 's another example of those user likes comm so and website chat features custom to your brand and check features that look like major social media features so we talked about live chat last week but this is a very accustomed satisfaction side of things as well so that might be a system you could look at the tracks and metrics on where you can improve so you can arrange a staff response within the site by language function that 's got quite a few functions so as all we throw you a bunch of tools and they will definitely be talking about his stuff you want to support local and we 'll share that later and you can evaluate which ones might be for you so then needs these long email surveys I guess these are the traditional ones really hey yeah kind of it grants car and everyone is doing this yeah so would you say in trend see where they go and we 're all living away from them or what do you see the industry being it yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for anyone to cut up a poll or a survey the issue is of course that everyone started doing it and it was survey overload that seemed to have died down a bit because businesses realized that it was too intent on the on the client-side but having said that they 're also very important so we when we do our market research we will use a long email survey as part as one tool yes and identifying the topic all the good clients within the organization that will most likely respond and then asking questions I guess around that are going to improve the experience for the client with that business so asking good clients long email surveys is often very useful because they 're the ones who have been dealing with you for a while you can ask questions that most people would think would be irrelevant like you know how how good is the voice is acquiesce how was the ordering system is easy to book or buy or why your why your services and products so they 're very useful but as you say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comes out of those long surveys is very useful and if someone 's taken the time to do it you know they 've got something important to say or suggestions or feedback so the data is always very good so when we say a low response rate see I used to hear a set into clients that I really would love an update that if you were getting response rate to a long email survey style of say twenty to thirty percent of people you were hoping to survey that was a pretty good result what would you say results that 's fantastic a response rate for a long survey wouldn 't 10% is then generally to go anywhere 5 or 10% for a long email survey if it 's just blasted out there with the shorter type of feedback surveys we know we get anywhere 50 percent response rates if it 's all over in 30 seconds and it 's just 2 or 3 screens and it 's very quick but once again that 's a rating you get limited data whereas the long email surveys give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good ok and I haven 't got it in here but I think it 's worth touching on while we have you as well people are more likely to fill in something longer if they 're incentivized right so would you recommend incentivizing and what could have been sentence work to get people to actually complete and get it on straight up we have had mixed mixed success with incentives know the old you complete the survey when an iPad or a trip somewhere I think it was good for a while but I 've stopped using them my business no recommend clients don 't using if someone 's got something to say does that once again I guess it 's unique to each business and if you really got something worthwhile to give away and have a go I mean test it see what happens but I think that sort of thing is sort of died off a little bit and I don 't reminds use of anymore okay really good feedback there so um this example is good old Google Forms if you haven 't heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about them a lot in this program but they 're great for small businesses because they 're free they 're pretty intuitive to you and they link into other Google stuff if you go that way so if you didn 't know people has Google Forms that you can run a survey on if you wanted to cool thing is it has multiple choice checkboxes etc and it all feeds them to a spreadsheet so pretty easy to get up and running and you can customize it with your logo your colors into great YouTube videos like you can say hey event from the creative collective we 're wanting feedback all that kind of stuff so that 's a good option for long email surveys as an example as well um the limitations there I 'm sure you 're sitting there thinking no Steve isn 't there so would you say Google Forms is a good starting point or a drafting point before you look at more sophisticated software maybe like yours yeah for sure design of this survey is very important having your logo on there and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get survey there are all bad fonts all over the place so if you want your client to get some feedback and spend some time and oh they want to see that you spent some time making a look good I guess yeah it 's going to look pretty original in lines out where people don 't want to touch it and so then we see if a teeth customer satisfaction scores we are surpassing the right percent section on a sliding scale is extremely direct way to get feedback and it doesn 't offer specific comments it 's a great way to get an overview so would you gives us its own bracket or does this really fit within the long-form surveys or do break it down like this when you discuss customer service sections it once again you can hit the nail on the head there it 's a quick and easy way to find out someone 's happy or not and it can lead to further in-depth conversation so making sure I mean I always make sure that we know who 's given the rating whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if they do get a national one or two at least you 've got the opportunity to get in touch them and ask what went wrong or why did you give us that low score and on the flipside if they give you constantly good ratings now what are we doing right now tell us why you 're like oh so much so it 's quite simple but quite powerful cool so here 's another one check market that 's what we mean like just five areas and you 're either very satisfied I 'm satisfied neutral satisfied or very satisfied and there 's nothing worse as there is access and responding for survey going there 's not one of the options I want but I love those particular ones as an example because you usually fit into one of those brackets don 't you very nice and simple yeah so next I 'll check market you can export them into Microsoft tools if you 're more of a Microsoft person is templates that tracks your improve calculating I 'll give some of those features are pretty standard but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like this has become less sort of a real marketers I guess best back pocket tool to being really quite mainstream now wouldn 't you say so yeah I to be honest four years ago that had an ID to look it up what is NBS mean because I met with a big corporate client and they say well we must have the MPS oh god what that mean and researched it if you use a lot it does help I guess as once again another important another tool to look at the overall satisfaction I find that only the bigger corporate clients are still using it and generally small business people don 't know what that promoter score names still it 's definitely a big corporate tool because there are there 's manuals and it 's whole system 's out there I 've seen it firsthand big corporates the MPS system is through the entire organization managing staff satisfaction client satisfaction interaction between departments and that sort of thing so it 's not just a client score it 's a score used across the whole organization and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overview I suppose of how you 're doing and there 's a little formula involved with MPs whether you 're a detractor or advocate or neutral yeah MPs schools have you 've heard it for the first times night now when you hear it again it will pop up again for sure you 'll know what it is so promoters or io io can track at the net promoter score you can forward feedback to your team automatically repeat it this could be really good for employee surveys we do one with our team we 've grown our team doubled it in recent times what team across New Castle sunshine close they 've been based in Sunshine Coast glad to know what sentiment is a team or culture of the team is a Newcastle whether they 're happy or whether they 're problems brewing so we yeah recently afforded that and we I would love to order that just goes out every three months rather me go oh gosh it 's been six months I really should do it again so that could be a good solution for that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors um let 's move on to another customer if it 's called C it is so unique several customers asked to rent how much effort it took to resolve the issue so this be an example like support tickets and things like that C correct I 'm just obvi honest I 'm just getting into this CES cool we had a request couple months ago about it so we 're trying to integrate it into our in same product the yes spot-on it 's sort of add the request came from a call center trying to measure how hard it was to get the information out of the call center and so once again that the lower the score the better as you say there it 's good at predicting customer baby yes that 's very much so and another tool another way of measuring satisfaction yeah so we also is a example do have a support ticket system so because we have so many hosting and domain clients people do have email issues with like so down to skip their logins all sorts of things happen and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we will resolve the ticket and then the system that comes in built with that particular system automatically says have better size where you were set and it helps us to monitor the number of tickets which about them are responding promptly with us people were happy with how they were resolved in can point that needs fixing right we have too many email issues or the particular staff member doesn 't seem to resolve them or doesn 't seem to resolve them quick enough so yeah we definitely use that but I did not have names now I do here 's one as well we 're tricks comms that does that and at micro surveys probably some other support ticket systems like Zendesk and the big ones will probably have depth and I would imagine so check those out as well and the one other kind I thought with mentioning social media monitoring which is a space I do know lots about see if you play with this as part of your business was not much I 'm asked a bit know but I 'm aware of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say happen so would this would be drawing on you a bit more and a couple of slides so we 're not really touching on digital marketing per se and this particular program because as I said it starts all about productivity and profitability but sentiment and whether your company is with a customer satisfied on social media is pretty important to monitor these days because if someone gives you a really bad review on Facebook it reflects really badly or on Google or interpret visor or Yelp or something like that if your restaurant so could I give them monitor food saying what and whether the sentiment we call it in social media as positive negative or neutral really interesting case study Queensland Rail I met with those guys back in 2012 this going back a while but when they started the overall sentiment was pretty bad up so negatives people were talking about the training for dirty at simple on time it was later you know all that kind of stuff so the PR team job was to turn that negative sentiment on social to neutral or positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually engaging with people and I guess doing a little bit like Queensland Police Service sooo having a sense of humor giving people the deal straight engaging with people and they mention it all the way to see that it actually had been effective so yeah can have an immediate impact on your business people can decide as a prospect whether they want to work with you want to inquire despite kicking out what 's going on and your social and what are people said and it 's become easy through applications that allow you to search and do things with that so I thought what have all the tools are not because there 's lots of them and I could do a whole session on this really easily but they 're good one to recommend I probably say check out mention calm because it 's free so you 've got to pick up what words you want to monitor so I might want to monitor my company name like the creative collective maybe my personal name maybe staff members name maybe any trademark products or services I have gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere else so you have got a common name of a company or person that is going to be hard but better to know and go through some of the rubbish check out Wow sums excellent really great about us or really bad then not know at all it 's also got an influencer area so if you want to identify who 's big and talking about that stuff all the time like customer satisfaction you could go in there and find that out so check that out and have a play with it 's pretty cool um Google Alert Google Calm so I you or even just slash alert I call it poor man 's media monitoring because it 's also free and you can put queries and then and every time that gets mentioned on Google like maybe there 's a review on a consumer website or something like that it would pick that up so I guess it 's not so much social media but almost like Google ranking monitoring so that such as the ones to know as well so at this point I 'd love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texan if you do or if you don 't and if you do use them which systems in you will share them we 'll see if we know them and share them with the rest observe tip one that 's line or on the recording so they can check them out as well so next up I had some systems to check out and see if I wonder I imagine me being in the face if you 're familiar with these and what your thoughts are we love it on a feedbacks if you think they rubbish tell us they 're rubbish you know nicely so I must admit I two or three years ago I researched so many different systems had so many free trials trying to find exactly what I 'm currently doing within sampled and it 's been a while since I 've checked out the competitors so it asked nicely the new one to me so I 'm having a look right now as you talk so this one I heard about because I do some work with some crowd out of Sydney April business blueprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it and they 're using it with an app staged created it 's called Brennan I might have told you guys about it it 's a free business advisor actually download it and then you can watch advice from different people so they because we 're building this new platform heavy investment artificial intelligence they really want to know what people think so they use this tool and I 've definitely seen this tool for purpose lots of other ones it integrates with your CRM so you might be able to see that event is a customer or is inquired twice about your business and she was really happy last time she talked to you for whatever or even a help desk so we like integratable things which I 've mentioned lots of times and sex ones that you can check out without server Kate seeds come across that one Nolan has not I 'm sorry okay okay we 're going to hear all about yours and you 're going to really talk it up in a minute I haven 't used this one either but it had lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it most of all was against that integrations with things like confusion soft and HubSpot Google Analytics and MailChimp which are some systems that I know some of you guys are using so check it out Survey Monkey I know you 'll know about because it 's been around for ages donkey 's not monkey and I still use it in the business and it has its advantages for sure I mean it 's gotten better and better over the years and so those in-depth surveys it 's a great product yeah but it does cost and I guess is it helpful to you to even do a little bit of an intro to your tool and how it may be vary from Survey Monkey our Survey Monkey gives you so many different options analytics it 's really good for the biggest biggest survey so sure and our product is very simple and has a nice little dashboard at the back of it as the more around feedback we 've made decision not to use the word survey anywhere in our product it 's all about feedback and capturing testimonials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out which I 'll talk about in a minute cool that way um this one is also a bit of a I don 't know it 's been it the kids that 's been around the block lots of times and I mean Survey Monkey I 've been using something like 2006 hold a d 'Orsay very similar and it 's good because it 's like you 're saying simple but you know just quick polls on different things got a wordpress built in support if you wanted to run polls on your website and hit a wordpress site you can add content from YouTube or Google or Google Maps so that 's kind of cool and they 've developed a tool pretty well over the years as well so check that one out if you want to run a poll as opposed to Survey um will that get better section C places that one at all I was looking at it recently getting closer to what we 're doing it 's a mixture I guess with both systems a survey then satisfaction I 'll let you talk about more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not really well other than it does come up a fair bit and that the thing that got my attention with it as the Facebook integration I just love integrations I love when things work together and then you can start to picture shopping lists based on someone 's like making the recipe right you could go and buy that ingredient down there in that ingredients do they actually go together even if they 're wonderful ingredients so I like bringing things together in the technology world that go together and make a beautiful recipe that everyone loves through life last tool I 've got for you before we going to see tonight as surveygizmo that 's also been around a while had any contact with that one so yes I 'll use surveygizmo so surveygizmo hold a D and seven monkey or the three that I guess we use most in our market research business depending on the application is in what what purpose is it for but Sir I guess mode is definitely one and and I recommend a good price point to compare to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's another prompt to use any of the software if so which one if you don 't any of those that we 've outlined so far ones you 're thinking actually that could be quite good I could definitely see myself needing to do that or maybe you 'll need going to needs gone to the features page end or pricing page or even more in depth of each of those tool and evaluate whether they 're right for you but before you do make sure you check out and sample so so you give us a rundown on what you do and is it helpful if I pull up the website and kind of run through it while you talk about it yeah on the chat on the right hand side there 's he Rob 's join the conversation Rob is my partner in the business he developer he 's got a link there to a working demo that we had done to rip code the mechanic shops around Australia that guy does a demo yeah oh sorry in the right hand side he Rob 's the we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing is rot in the chat on the right hand side they are seen Rob join the conversations got a demo that you can do it from there so company name ah so you want me to fill this in in yeah I presume people online will be doing this tools they want to try it out absolutely no I feel free to follow me guys if you want to like try acne kick like me so the way we work we can get a email after the sale it 's all automated can be a text message or an email this is a Ellen Claire this was for a sort of market rate am sorry I like a hospitality type business so their demo so we are very broad questions and ask for rating if you go back to the previous screen edge in previous you 're unclean see joking obviously so basically if you were happy with the service if you just want to give them the nine or a ten nari vet to everything so instead of Auto and it 's nice that staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gave good ratings we asked thanks for the good ratings would you like to leave the short testimonial if you want to hit previous sorry before you start writing a nice testimonial if you want to put like a one for the cleanliness I just just kicked in for everything else and just do a one for the cleanliness the extreme will prompt you asking why you weren 't happy with the cleanliness so we asked broad questions trying to get as much information out as the client as possible and if it 's good ratings we ask for testimonial which thing is automatically published to the website the click of a button if you give a bad ratings it 'll ask why you weren 't happy with the friendliness of the staff for example and it gives an opportunity for the business owner who will get a text message or an email immediately stand and that buttons submit is hidden to what we call create a recovery moment so someone 's gone wrong with the staff there the business owner will get a text message saying you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as net text message an email so the business owner can really get on the phone say hey mr. Joe Bloggs thanks for the feedback we noticed you 're unhappy with the staff and you mind telling us why so before they can golf and social media will start going on about how bad things were you 've got the opportunity to pick up the phone and sort of they admit every single survey or feedback form should always have this screen do you have any general comments or suggestions this is where nice people will dump their thoughts or ideas so very important to ask do you have any general comments or suggestions and that 's it next screen is survey for the end of the feedback I should say so I think some people shy away from the feedback but is a negative feedback offers a golden opportunity to identify problems in your business and fix them right absolutely we want to keep that customer and again you spend all that time and money capturing the con now you 've got them something might have gone wrong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone wasn 't particularly nice at the counter at reception or one of the cleaners wasn 't nice and you 've got the opportunity to create a recovery moment and get that client back with a coming offer you a free trip next time or something like that flipside as I said at the start of this is most people give very positive feedback it 's rare to get bad feedback so we just when we set this up we assumed it would be getting bad feedback but it 's been your complete opposites it 's all good feedback which then creates the opportunity to get a testimonial and once again if you get a nice testimonial get a text or an email message saying someone 's just be nice to your company here 's the good feedback you literally click a button and then it goes up on to your website so it creates a engagement with the client it helps testimonials and in the rare occasions you get the bad feedback business owner has the opportunity to to find out why and the feedback that we get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you get this testimonial because it 's small business as hard as you know when you get a good feedback and the testimonials it genuinely feels good and makes you feel good about your business you can then pass that testimony on to the staff members in the business in the organization se12 is great that 's our dashboard you 're looking at there 's a static picture that gives you a dashboard of the in sampled feedback system within there you can benchmark so if you 've got multiple stores or offices and you can see which ones are doing burden the other ones saying with staff you can filter by start to see which staff are performing well if you 've got multiple staff you have different products you can sorted by different products and services so it 's a in depth as you want to be but once again your gets back to just asking the client after the service all of the product sale how do we do and going from there so 44 dollars a month I bet there 's some you know strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low end mid-range or high end for what you 're doing you never worry about the standard could it stop and feedback and once again you know we discovered two or three years ago that was nothing out there of course now there 's not stuff out there similar to us we sort of been approaching the bigger corporate clients but now we 're sort of in serious soon we 'll be introducing it to the small business owner and we had a few clients now Lucy van lines is a classic example there are removalist company in moussa who all about engaging with the clients and it 's you know 244 dollars a month they 're getting amazing value out of asking to see that yeah it 's not a lot really if you consider that you know even if one person silver than a month we identified a problem and you can fix it how many thousands could that save you and keeping that customer or getting other customers that you didn 't even know where I 'm happy right and the price for catching us testimonials you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimonials going up with dates of last week and not two years ago and constantly updated it 's very powerful so just just know how yeah automated is it like what does this integrate with so let 's say I offer a website development how would I get that out to my clients to complete a survey after there 's number different ways the smaller business people I guess we 'll talk today there 's just a simple data entry we literally put the email address in and a name of the person and hit submit and where it goes we 've created api 's for some other bigger companies like Fuji Xerox for example it started using us so it 's all integrated tier CRMs we can do it any way you want but I guess the smaller business owners the upload of a CSV file or a just simply entering an email first name we 're hitting send yeah so I really love the idea of testimonials and I noticed this thing up here google reviews how does it solicit those so that 's something we 've discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing and not a lot of businesses are taking advantage of it so still using Aaron sampled but on the last Thank You stream if it 's a positive review a positive story positive positive feedback it 's all tens and nines little pop-up screen comes up and says would you like to leave a Google review as well and most people logged into Google these days so yes in a way that screens immediately there with the 5-star rating you can set one to five and leave the review and that 's become quite effective so using in sample to get to find out how the client sort of the service if it 's positive they 'll be prompted for a Google review at the end really good idea so yeah exactly what they said for sure more Google reviews will give you better rankings on Google that is a effect and so the Facebook reviews actually also so they can hook into your Google my business listing so that the digital marketing discussion again not really covered in this program but with tips on this topic in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yeah talk to see from example let him know that you 're some believe that program you heard about it through this and I 'm sure he or something we 'll be more than happy to hear from you do you prefer phone or email or anything in particular see all the details are there phone email times always the best yeah fantastic so your homework this week is if you 're not already using for some some measure customer satisfaction look at the systems outline tonight or it may be through this journey you 'll find others if you do anything others will benefit please pop them in the Facebook groups so that everyone 's aware of them and but basically evaluate their suitability to your business as I said at the start of the session I plant things a business that wouldn 't need it wouldn 't have customers and wouldn 't need to measure their satisfaction at some point is that fair enough to faces yep if you 're not asking us for so you know once again you 're missing out on an opportunity yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems of discussion with your team or other business advisors depends how big your team is and exactly what stage of business you 're at but you know there might be a system in place but no one 's actually doing it I know for a while we would like that today we hear our strategic planning and I said guys I really want to push getting more approval reviews face book review and asking for more feedback we 're doing great work but we 're just not asking for it so now everyone knows and we 're reminders of hopefully start happening but something like seize till it definitely helps that um so question time we 've got Steve online for a good ten minutes more I 'm sure it 'd be more than happy to answer your questions I 'll just flick over to the fixture to see if any have come true looks like some temp listed just seemed have a website you all know it now and Steve gave it to you Leslie I think see my google do but nothing came up so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our customers are thinking at each stage of interaction with them but they don 't particularly want to be bothered by us over this it 's not important to them at what point the question does our request will need to feedback negatively impact on their business highly judges and adapt to this that 's a good question see what how much is too much yeah once again if it 's during the process and once again depending on the industry and what you 're selling I think just asking them even even just picking up the phone how 's it going especially if you 're got it out extended sort of sales process depending what you 're selling keeping it simple during the process now is everything on track so using something similar to what we 've got or even just a very quick email and getting customer feedback doesn 't have to be through software it can be simple as picking up the phone and recording how 's it going and and then at the end of it because when you get a bit more in depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example and some of our sales are quite large especially when it comes to office space and extended times and I 'm asking all the time how 's it going is everything okay and then every six months or every 12 months hitting them with it with the reasonable size survey looking for improvements and ways to make the service better so at what point does it become negative feedback I guess when if you 're asking too often and people stop responding you know you 're asking too often yeah so I guess you got a probably almost experiment because every industry would be different right so work out if your audience are going to respond to a Google review or a survey monkey or an example or not ask nicely or you know different customers probably more access in different ways I mean a long-term customer may be is it fair to say Steve we 've had some loyalty probably more likely to further a long review a long survey and the customers pretty new probably going to want to keep short yep good point absolutely once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment this is 10 next time move on with 7 or below what 's what 's not quite right so keeping it simple and then if you find an issue that 's when you start asking questions so it was a great question from Steve and I see what you only got before now I just clicked because what you 're saying six bit and I was looking on the website on sound board and you meant on the actual webinar platform so hi Rob thanks for joining us tonight from exampled and they 've given you a good and sampled feedback tool which has got that effectuating MPs core positive negative suggestions feedback testimonials a whole lot built and then which is awesome so not a lot of other questions coming through so I presume we must have done a good job but I will judge if we 've done a good job but you guys are going to go and do your homework and get some systems into place some would be better than none but like we 've just been talking about evaluate what sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really valuable to know that you know understand 15 or 10 percent good this is 20 to 30 is high and anything above is amazing I remember sending out a survey for a client wants of them getting upset with makes only 50% responded nice are you kidding that is really good to spawn straight like you should be really happy with us I always ask myself but I do this when I know the worst surveys are from the government and they come on and it 's 15 pages and it just goes on and on and on ask yourself would you be bothered doing this and if the answer is no need to don 't do it yourself some people weirdly actually write something in surveys there 's not many of those weird people in this field but there are some out there and just another side note if you are one of those weird people who like filling in surveys you can actually get paid to fill in surveys online I think that read surveys through quantitative tool I think Google surveys pays an amount to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears to us or test the product as well so there 's that side of it as well so there is literally product for Google surveys as well cool I 'll just give you guys a quick rundown on level up and then we 'll wrap up tonight so you 've jumped on a free webinar we 're very happy to have you and if you 're listening to the recording equally so if you were to do the full program it 's not too late because you get access to mentors and huge value in that it really established knowledgeable people something that we have had which I mentioned last week is they look so amazing I get to go and see them I think they 'd be intimidating I think they 'd be too technical I feel silly asking them questions please don 't was really done there 's people who are great with you whatever level you 're at whatever stage of business no question and silly question the value is that you can sit down with them we 'll do a Skype chat we 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with to implement or decide on or whatever so huge value there but you only get them if you sign up to the full program which is only 295 the other part that you don 't get in this dual program is a Facebook group so the moment you become a member you get pushed over to finds a group and joins that and if you have doing enjoyed tonight there are more sessions coming up I 'm going to cross out these ones we 've got two more the next one 70 is really good first of all this got Andrew from our team taking it Andrews been with us for a long time he 's going to run through all the systems we haven 't had time for in the other lessons the 3 's jam-packed lesson we 're going to talk about learning management systems project management systems bunches of other stuff basically just throw a whole lot more tools at you tools that we use or a tried and tested or have good rating and that sort of cut above the noise and save your Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and analytics and dashboards so I love that you see the new Rob has got that dashboard tool I would love to have something like that on my screen showing how our customer satisfaction is going yes they 're calling back it 's real-time and it 's very useful yeah there 's a big trend towards them and there are tools are going to introduce you to them that help you create your own dashboards you work out what metrics are important to your

    "text": "[Music] many residents unawares they have a fox in their area until their poultry are attacked this night the chickens were attacked and I was actually sitting on the back deck at home and I 'd put the kettle on for a cup of tea and chickens were about and about was getting ready to put them away and I thought I 'll kettles boiled I 'll go fill it up by the time I did that yeah one of them got attacked and and it was gone so it was pretty pretty quick and and sudden and followed it down and saw the chicken sort of being carried off down towards the back of the dam and thought yeah no that 's that 's time to you know adjust the times that we 're letting them out and maybe revisit the structure of the chicken coop and make it a bit safer and whatnot in that so I think when we contacted Council and started getting some advice securing your poultry and a fox proof enclosure is the best way to prevent fox attacks there are some simple steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually hunt at night so at a minimum poultry should be secured in a fox proof enclosure from late afternoon until morning foxes are excellent climbers so it 's really important that your chicken house has a good roof if you don 't have a roof the alternative is good high walls I need to be at least 1.8 meters high and outward overhang of at least 450 millimetres at the top of the fence will deter climbing an electric wire will also deter climbing foxes are very good at digging if your chicken house doesn 't have a floor it 's important to have very good footings the footings should be at least 400 millimetres deep the alternative is to have an apron that runs out by at least 400 millimetres the Fox will come along and dig at the corner move back a bit dig again and then hopefully give it away foxes can chew through wire so it 's important that your wire is at least one millimeter thick this is a good setup and that there 's fine mesh down low to keep rats and mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out foxes are canning now look for a weak point in your ticking enclosure so you 've got to make sure your solid and strong and there 's no other weak points in the construction a floating pontoon is a great way to protect ducks and geese key aim with trying to prevent future attacks and whatnot was to for us to a sleep easy at night wake up in the morning and know that we 're going to be confronted with the same thing that we went to bed with and not a not a mess so you know speaking with dad because dad did a lot of the building on on the chicken coop and just puttering around was really to have something that was an enclosed structure it was a couple of key things we wanted we wanted to use up some of the products and things that were just floating around the do kitchen around the property so we didn 't want to go out and buy a lot of new things we wanted to recycle some bits and pieces make sure that it was fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and foxes and things couldn 't get in through the top make sure there was a really good solid structure you know good corner posts and whatnot and it also to have that concrete footing in that concrete edge around the base of it so that nothing could really dig in you know because there 's been you 'll get rats and boxes and all sorts of things that want to get in there and eat the treats and and everything it 's right you know I can put them away over enough to noon when they 've been out and having a little bit of a roam around and I can lock the door and then yeah go to bed and sleep easy and put the kettle on and not have to worry about things so yeah and the advice from the council has been fantastic council provides a service to assist residents to fox proof their poultry please contact council if you would like assistance or help to keep your poultry safe [Music] you"

funded program aimed aimed at helping small and medium businesses connect to the Indian we 're available and fully utilize digital tools innovation principles and business solutions to enable them to improve the productivity profitability and ability to compete nationally and internationally where desired and so Eva um who is supposed to do the intro and hopefully will be able to join us later for the later part of this webinar was born and raised in New Zealand and traveled from most of her 20s and eventually wound up on the Sunshine Coast in 2004 she is two children aged 10 and 13 I 'm sure she will tell you a bit more about them I mean she started six businesses sold to and currently running sleep she 's been asked to speak by Google and and get on online show I 'm about young and entrepreneurs and she 's the chair of knowledge and professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directors and Sunshine Coast committee illness control LEDs myself I 'm originally from Germany and that moved to Australia in 2004 has been in digital advertising since 2009 and a Google certified partner since 2012 and all my work in digital advertising and head involved analyzing data and doing lots of reporting I moved to the sunny coast in 2012 and since then I 've worked in over 200 Adwords and Facebook accounts managing expense from as little as five hundred dollars a month and some of some of our clients as a twenty thousand dollar month budget and what we 've been working on working with local climates or dentists and to national and international companies and at the moment and managing around 1.8 million spend every year and I 've also been part of the winning team as part of the local and national data bank which is an international hackathon that brings more than 1,800 people together to innovate collaborate and apply that creative skill to open government data and I 'll be talking about that a little bit more um later down in the webinar all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously we 'll start basic what is data and why dad are like why do we need data data format and what format do we find data in put some data sources how can we tap into them and what tools are available to to work with that and which will commute to visualize data now looking at data and now I know data analytics and we 'll also be covering and open data all right so let 's just let 's jump right in there and as I 'm talking about this bag will like it will keeping it fairly I 'm feeling basic just introducing and quite a few concepts and if you feel familiar with data so all this stuff is you probably know or could em and expand them but we 'll just try to keep it relevant for everyone so what is data so at the most basic level it 's basically just values that are being recorded and they could be in spreadsheets and data in books and eBooks itself data get lots of i 'm data on websites obviously statistics and bank statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is data but data only becomes insightful after its being and assets been analyzed so and it 's not enough to just analyze it it 's only useful if you actually do something with the inside and that you gain so I think role know about the open data and Internet and Facebook and what they do with the data so I will be talking about that I 'm a little bit more what format and so I think the most the most basic form that most people interact with data is in existing ads so for example if you 're running a business if you have a website and you would be familiar with Google Analytics Facebook and if you 're running Facebook ads or just looking to get eight book stats and that 's it 's data right there if you are using any accounting system 0mm why you 'll need um obviously your bank app I don 't know Commonwealth Bank IMG whatever it is that you 're using and there 's obviously data like the amounts the money 's being transferred all that data CRM see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all that is data and we 'll talk about ensembles um what kind of data we 've got in there a bit later and but it also comes in in other formats so for example in spreadsheet so excel sheet CSV files and SQL and format xml format text format word document mp3 jxo donna can be in lots of different formats and what we have to do this what we 're trying to do its business owners and find the data and figure out ways to visualize it and use it so y1 is not as useful and by itself it 's useless like quite easy to get data overload and it 's only useful to you if you 're able to apply it so some of the ways that you can apply it is for decision making let 's say you 're running a business and um works getting a bit you 're getting a lot of work lots of clients are coming in um you need to hire a new a new staff or someone to help help with the workload um if you get good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be making what your expenses will be you can figure out if it 's a if it makes sense to hire someone or if you just have to stretch yourself a little bit at benchmarking so I 'm I 'm a Google partners as I 've mentioned before and every quarter and Google called me and we 'll run through and similar agencies and how my agency compares to em similar agencies and across Australia and and obviously there 's area so we do better in other areas where we need to improve but they were basically comparing ourselves to and other businesses in our industry and can figure out if we 're doing a good job we need to do more work or where where we land forecasting um especially like in when it comes to finance that I 'll I 'll mention a few ads and down the road where you can do some good forecasting based on your existing and income and income expenses and as tracked by your accounting software such as zero my upper some of those and obviously if you can forecast for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much how much money is coming in how much money is coming out when you expect payment to come through when you came in to come out if you can if you know what was coming you can obviously plan for that planning so with any project management like I think we 're all familiar with some of that and water whole maps we can just be it hit tasks in your projects and you figure out how long it 'll take you to get a project done and then monitoring so a lot of the work that we do for our clients with digital advertising I will have to make sure that we 're monitoring performance the one or we 're spending they were not understanding that the money that we 're spending gets the right return by hitting the right and the right KPIs for our clients and the only way that we can do this is obviously by looking at data and I 'm interpreting it correctly so what some data sources relevant to business we 've talked about the bank statement obviously a profit loss statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of zero or MYOB or whatever else it is that you 're using your CRM and so for example if I 'm people go on your website they fill out a complex form that should go straight into your CRM and then you want to follow up on those leads and if there 's potential for to win them as a client you want to create an opportunity and once you close what opportunity or once you get that opportunity sent them a proposal and proposal gets closed the link is turned in decline door contact you create some tasks to follow-up the client and then you can see how long did it take you to close and that opportunity you get some interesting reports that you can deal with your serum if you 've got good data in there obviously project management so anything any tasks that you need to do any a project that you 're working on and that I 'm a good data source that can tell you a lot about gray arise in your business email um mostly like I 'm a medium so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing for using MailChimp or active campaigner and whatever it is that you 're using obviously you can track how many emails get sent how many emails were received open clicks and what did people do after they click and win on your website and that 's been where the website traffic comes in so if you can link your MailChimp to your Google Analytics and then seen analytics in MailChimp you see I don 't know ten percent of the people clicked on your email went to your website what did they do that they contact you that they purchase a product um if they convert any and any other goal so that some and like a very good data source to look at to know and what 's going on on your website and how your business is doing on the web and advertising spent and results so if you are spending and what you 're running Google and its Facebook games obviously defects and lots and lots of data points to look at um and with all that I can book will come a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and data points are important so you can in Google Analytics there 's thousands of different reports that we can look at and but if you have um some basic ones set up that you check regularly and that can be they can be really beneficial I 'm saving AdWords Facebook like at least making sure that the spenders on track and the conversion soundtrack an incoming phone call so um with voice over IP and different and call tracking software 's and it 's quite easy to tract a and to track holes into visually display them so how many calls are coming in how many calls that we answered and how many calls go to the nail book app today and mailbox that 's sort of the thing and it 's quite especially if you have a number of staff that should be answering your phones and you see that half your phones are not getting answered and we know that there 's something that needs to be investigated any competitive information is a bit later we 'll talk about open data and there 's number of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry as a whole and then the last one is an ROI so basically what some data points that you can set for yourself we can 't rank like how effective your businesses or I will hope how well your business is doing all right so we 've got all those different data points and we want to make them visible so we will not see them we just don 't want to look at and Excel sheets or a spreadsheet we will now ideally see some nice graph some some some metrics that make sense and yeah so there 's a number of different tools that can be used from the right-hand side you 'll see and that 's an example from a Google Analytics on standard report and but there 's most tools like zero Google Analytics Android space building reports that you can send to yourself but personally I really like it to make those data points together so have a dashboard of a record it shows gives you an overview of what 's going on in Adwords what 's going on in Facebook what 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my phone calls my project management software all that sort of stuff if we can pull that together and display it in a nice way and that makes sense and gives us some insight and that 's really what we 're trying to I 'm trying to achieve and um I think a lot of that stuff has a number of these things or anything I mentioned in previous webinars and so if you haven 't seen them I 'm going to revisit them more some of them just I 'm sure there 'll be a link and once we 're done in there and we can obviously be and we re watched that previous webinars as well all right so KPIs what are they and defining yours so if you don 't know what an KPIs key performance indicator which is a measurable value that demonstrates how effective how effectively the company is achieving key business objectives organizations use KPIs to evaluate their business their success at reaching targets selecting the right KPI for the pendulum game industry the stage of business goal in which part of the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table here with some sample and KPIs I 'll just start on the left and work my way across so on the Left I 'm just talking about some financial KPIs obviously income how much money is coming in cost of sale for every every sale that we make every new client that we pick up what what does it cost us to to service the client to deliver that and the item and what 's a gross profit what our expenses what 's a net profit and I think sort of a standard and calculation that business owners do is income minus expenses equals profit and but I think I get maybe if you rethink it income minus your profit leaves you expenses and if you can figure out how you take the profit and then run the business but the expenses that I left just fully a better way to look at gather their finances I am marketing KPI so I 'm on your website for example you would have maybe a contact form inquiry a quote form and how many of those are getting sell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site and filling out a form if you have a database and actively working on building a database what 's good size how fastest is growing how many new leads or contact are you adding to your database how much money are you spending on your marketing or advertising and from those different channels so you do TV ads radio ads newspaper and Google Facebook and how much money is spending on each channel and what 's the cost relate and then even going further down what 's the cost per per sale from from those different channels and then website traffic if you 're running an online store and or a physical store um how many transactions are you doing per day per week per month and what 's an average transaction value in the average cost per order and what 's the most popular product this month was the best performing salesperson and what 's the the cost per sale to the marketing hospital is there 's all kind of things that you can track and employee should be tracking if you 're selling around going to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many support tickets are coming through and how much time does it take to resolve them what 's the set of section levels are those an billable and non-billable hours is recurring issues what are they how can you them what can you do to get on top of them but if you don 't know that there is recurring issues in the edgiest a fatass troubleshooting and obviously that makes it quite difficult so that 's just some some KPIs and for you to start thinking about and what you wanna do is decide on what some of the KPIs are you 're going to capture that data and in whatever system works best for you display the data and make decisions based on on that data so you 've got a little bit of homework for you and which you can then do once once we 're done with with this webinar I 'm next few days and just have a think what some KPIs what what kpi 's might be relevant to your business this might may involve a discussion with your team or other business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's something that you really need to know and which are things that are nice to know I 'm for example a few years ago I was approached by a business they were going to hire us to run their Google X for them they already for a few years running their own end and when I sit down with them we look at their marketing budget and then trying to figure out what like how much it cost them to generate a sale on so it turns out it costs them about 40 to generate a lead then he ten leads to generate a sale so four hundred dollars to generate a sale but they 're they 're turned the average turnover per sale was only four hundred dollars so for every four hundred dollars that they 've spent and they would get a sale and it would cost them to basically break even but they 've never looked at their numbers and so once we had those numbers in place we can then look at can we get cheaper leads can we remember the conversion rate can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you don 't have those numbers it might look good on the income statement that money 's coming in but it 's quite important to have the right KPIs and work with them as a as you grow your business all right so I 'm just going to jump into some sample reports here so a lot of them are real data some are some sample data but I thought it might be interesting to look at some of them and you if you 're we probably see a lot of these reports already did in there so this is just a Google Analytics DanceSport one of my favorite reports is the source medium view in under the acquisition and tasks so basically that breaks down where the traffic to a website is coming from so in this case it 's got Google organic Google CPC which is Adwords direct traffic that tells me how many sessions come from those different mediums and what 's the bounce rate and what do people do in my side so they on average that six pages per session spending more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate which is important for for this one one point one nine percent ninety four transaction so and then here we 've got the revenue track so we can then know how much revenue was generated and buying each individual or so um that 's a report that I really I usually start with the file you gone with Google Analytics account for a new a new website new client and that 's where I started get them and get started another one is my goals so obviously we 've thought through what what we are wanting to track in this case and the client and wants to track and search location to find where they can purchase a certain item I also we 're tracking that here we 're also tracking contact us forms and subscrip them submissions and click the calls generated emails generated in warranty registrations and so again negative if you have a website what 's what sort of your purpose and what sort of data do not track then you 'll you 'll have to set that up and somehow get that information into in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're spending if you 're running any any MS and you want to know what campaigns it is that you 're running how much money are you spending and what what 's your conversion conversion rate your cost per click all that sort of stuff and then obviously will bury two different platforms here so I 'm always a fan of bringing and bringing things together so for a lot of our clients will create and reports that look something like this we 've got advertising spins we 've got number of conversions clicks impressions total conversion value and how many people click on it and they books button how many people call how many emails and like that 's obviously pretty tasty for twenty thousand dollars that we expend it generated over one hundred and so the more money we can spend I am the better Facebook similar like and gives me heaps of data but I can just I like to pull it out into small digestible numbers that make sense and in our case like you on my report once a month but I think and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you freak out if I 'm managing it I look at it and couple times a week but you don 't you don 't want to every day just keep looking at it but you need to make sure that your trends are going on the right direction um and so one of the tools that I that I started using and it 's quite easy to set up it 's called size so it 's an a dashboard and act that allows you pulling data from different on platforms and then display them so in this case I 've pulled in the data from Google Adwords and so it 's got our cost up here cause impressions clicks and conversions don 't need get some Google Analytics data and so we take you to many sessions how many users even how many conversions and what the conversion conversion rate is on that page and then up here I 've pulled in some data from zero so it 's basically just all of this is displaying my income for the last thirty days and my expenses and basically the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it and refreshes time automatically and so you can look at it like your last seven days a last 30 days I mean see what 's been going on I 'm in on your different platforms and some other options that you can do this you can pull in data from your Facebook end so what do you spend your your clicks and your conversions and Facebook pages how many people have you reached and how many people engaged have you been growing the line or you clicks YouTube if you 're running if you get some videos on YouTube that you 're promoting or that you 're using your website or in marketing material and you can pull that in quite easily and you can use a push API or Google spreadsheet to pull in calls from different and public and the number of course being generated from from different numbers and depending on what am i from you 're using and so I 'm what I 've done with some of these like we 've set them up for clients so they have um maybe six seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so just in one quick low-key you get an overview way a business and what your business was doing for the last thirty days and can be quite and tempting to check it twenty or thirty times a day but um [Music] and but that some yeah I think it 's good to have something like that that you can check maybe a couple times a week another give you a gives you a snapshot and so the name of that was I 'm site I 'm now just then type it in here just got a question what this was called and I 'll mention it later again we custom out some links to that and I yeah I 'm moving on so this is I 'm a snapshot taken from my CRM so the left hand side I have my income broken down my business into a number of areas I 'm tracking and thing with my expenses so I know where my money is coming from and where my mind is going and then below this like I 've taken it out it just didn 't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and expected expenses for this month and that in the coming month and as well as expected profit so it just gives me three numbers and I can see when my businesses right now am I making am I losing money this month I am I making money and and what a snicks month look like based on my recurring revenue and potential sit at the pipeline then again suicides in the top left corner that 's that 's the logo if you look up at website this is just them taken from their substantial what 's taken from their website just so you can see what what is possible what kind of and how you can display data so obviously you revenue can be an expenditure can be this very different needs by by non for example and balance sheets which you can scroll around revenue goal I 'm for year today and budget breakdown if you 're doing lots of sales like you have it so you get different plans that you 're selling you can do a breakdown of which product or services and people mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of that rhythm most of revenue and from your CRM if you have a sales funnel so how many people visit your website people become leads how many people become customers and repeat customers so it gives you a breakdown of of your funnel there and then another tool so basically when I first started two years ago I started using size which you just looked at and so this this next one is called quit folio and five is basically plug and play just you open an account you create you create your account and you connect some data sources and you display data and it basically limited to you two there there 's a few little things that you can tweak in which can display this place differently but if you want to commercial data or do some some advanced reporting move to collect folio and since and then I 've actually moved up moved onto zobo reports because I 'm I 'm using Zoho CRM is Mari is my CRM so that I 'm just worked out by the way but quit folio is a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II can take data from Adwords and Facebook and and this makes mix them together like how much money you spend across both platforms in one graph you could take open data like if you wanted to you could and display the temperature in Queensland and look at the sales that you generated I don 't know if you 're selling ice cream that might be useful but generally and most of those advanced and feels it 's not really useful for especially when you 're starting out but it 's I 'm just mentioning it because it 's there and it can be really good um here 's a was a sample dashboard for yourself theme so if you get different people working for you and they have a photo of calls that they need to make products they need to sell I mean that 's all tracked in a CRM you could I 'm going to display the data in a dashboard like this and now I 'm way of people at or if if you do project management you 've got a number of project managers you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many hours they 're logging how many open tasks they have overdue tasks and all that good stuff I mean it just goes back to the KPIs um what what do we want to track what are we trying to achieve and then how do we get that island displayed visual all right so another sales dashboard sometime let 's set up include folio so it 's quite similar to some of the other ones that we looked at um but I mean yeah there 's a lot of different ways I can display your data but what it really comes down to is making sure that these get and that initial data that is set up in there we can that we can work with I 'm activity so I 'm look again this is a sample and from clipped olio but I 'm using one in my own business where after I 'm open I 'm open tasks per ampere employee so I know um who has how many tasks how many hours how many clients do they have how many hours to have do I have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone that has tasks up with you and they 've been overdue for quite a while and then obviously I know that I need to I need to do something about that but again this is total activities closed activities this month field one open activity so just them set up by by operations all right um again another revenue dashboard so I 'm this one I think I like the sales for the last thirteen month just shows you some ups and downs there and but obviously if you can start looking at that and then start forecasting it and they 'll be super powerful at each get it current revenue for q4 so it is obviously a old old dashboard and I 'm an expected revenue q4 if you if you know if you 're hitting your marks or missing them because it 'll be a good incentive to to keep them and keep pushing pushing in I guess okay so some issues I think that 's all so I 'll just keep going so I 'm some of the dashboard and reporting tools but that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think if you have a website everyone should put Google Analytics on their website so you just I think you need to know what 's going on on your website I 'm sighs calm um if you 're getting started if you 've got this today running people ads Facebook ads or you doing anything on Facebook you 've got a website I may be a CRM maybe zero look at slides and you can sign up for free and create four and four which is it 's what it 's called well then you have to pay but I think it 's only 20 bucks amongst you can create unlimited dashboard so you could have dashboard for yourself dashboard for your team um it 's it 's really powerful um and it 's very simple so there 's a lot of things that you can do with it and I think it 's it 's one of the easiest ways to get started um in recent years Google Data studio has been released and enables just them available to some talk to premier Google Analytics accounts now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really great to work with data that you have in Google property so for example and AdWords analytics any data that you can push into Google sheets so if you can make a lot of platforms have options to an export or think data to a Google sheet so you could use a beer or and super metrics or something like that and push that on a Google sheet and once you 've got that on a Google sheet Google Data studio is pretty pretty epic to create reports and dashboards with um it 's big you need to know a little bit more what you 're doing like need to be more familiar with with Excel and um some of those things but I 'm it 's free and definitely worth to check out click volume and as I mentioned um it 's a very powerful way to to access data and it allows you to am into api 's can pull data into portfolio and then massage the data in their platform and display it in whichever way you like but it 's a fairly advanced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example to import data from Adwords and Facebook and like some of the main platforms but it 's still it 's pretty steep learning curve but if you 're into if you down a geek unless definitely one to check out and the whole report so if Justin I 'm just a maybe five six months ago I moved to zobo and I 'm using the whole desk Zoho CRM and so a report so it integrates pretty well with my CRM and I allow me to import data from zero and data from Adwords and Facebook so um for my my my own business I use the reports that again it 's um maybe not quite a steep learning curve as quid foliar but I think it only makes sense if you 're using the horrea CRM so if you use OSU CRM definitely check out the whole report I 'm otherwise I might main recommendation will be sighs all right and the last two are called dry run and slowed app so they 're basically am zero integrations and I think they work with em I opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically what they do is they take your data from zero so your invoices paid invoices to extend this like your reconciled a line items all that sort of stuff and for starters just displaced in my face so zero does some of that but not quite as good but where those two actually shyness is in forecasting so based on your existing expenses in the existing income you can set for example some expenses or in invoices to recurring and if you will probably like it took me when I think I sign up with dry run it took me maybe two hours I 'm to get that set up in it it gave me forecast for the next twelve months of my business how my business is going to do based on and some scenarios that I 've created so the first one that you obviously created is this is where where things aren 't and then you could have an ideal forecast and that worst-case scenario for transfer use some declines or whatever and it basically just make some changes you duplicate what you 've set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in next quarter next twelve months so um it 's um I think they also like 3040 bucks a month so it 's not cheap and but depending on where you 're at and what station in your business that could be a really good investment to make all right so um with with all the data point there especially if you 're and if you 're implementing a lot of that stuff yourself if you 're using a CRM like you want to make sure that you 've got clean data basically and have been crap out so if you let 's say on your website you Google Analytics is not implemented correctly and what I see a lot of times is that people have two or three instances of Google Analytics and stuff so basically the data correct and reports incorrectly so you want to make sure and if implemented correctly and in your and see in your accounting software and make sure that your invoice is updated at your am account and your line items are written filed then in your CRM that 's where most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove duplicate so I 've put it in there twice because if you 've got am 50 News and lead to 15 potentials in your pipeline but half of them are duplicates if it doesn 't tell you anything so you need to make sure that your data is clean same with opportunity and potentials and you wanna make sure you update them you don 't want to leave opportunities open for 12 months um if in reality they are already closed lost so you want to make sure that you you do that thing with tasks if it 's in your CRM or in project management and if you get 500 open tasks it doesn 't tell you anything and if most of them are always doing most of them uh not even relevant so and it 's just important to go through and clean up your data clean up your project management tools your CRM in everything that you the key to to generate it and business Dunham 's you want to stick to learn so it 's quite tricky yes um you want to pull a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named differently so one might be Edwards and Edwards um I don 't know um Edwards project the other one might be called and digital advertising Edwards and another one might be called digital ads and Edwards so it doesn 't allow you to pull appropriate reports we need to make sure that you name things I 'm I 'm cohesively and then lastly with close tabs like you wanna remove any unnecessary tasks if you 're if you 're reporting on that and as well as um close them close opportunities close projects all that stuff that shouldn 't be there it just needs to at the right standard and then just a word on data security so obviously we 're all concerned with our data I want to make sure that we use good passwords so what I might seem a lot happen is like using the same password for every and for every I 'm platform so if someone I 'm looking to be a gmail account or into your email accountant and find all the other platforms that you have access to and then can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily never had any issues with any of my accounts getting hacked but something that I do is I use a password tool and so one password would be one option or laptop which basically allows you to to have high security passwords and save them and save them your computer and you want to make sure that you know who has access to your data so for example here at Stanford there 's access to your CRM or your accounting tool you bookkeeper or whatever and India staffing is gone you switch onto bookkeeper and we just want to make sure that those are being removed and like you stay on top of that I think that 's the main thing that you or the via small business owners need to worry about I think most when it comes to get hacked because of weak passwords or you see there 's always something some HP okay or whatever I don 't think it 's something that we need to be too worried about if she has some decent passwords but definitely are important to it to think about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section your open data so open data is data that anyone can access use or share and when big companies are government release non personal data is enabled small businesses citizens and medical researchers to develop resources which make crucial improvement to their communities some of us worry about health papers being made open some confused commercial and personal data or mix our big data with open data so next slide explains different types of data and it 's huges so basically on the left hand side we 've got closed data on the right hand side we 've got open data there 's different stages in betweens so close data would be for example employment contract policies self reports any internal stuff that you only have access to like your crm and then on the right hand side you 've got stuff is open to anyone so fast timetable you can go to website and download a whole bunch of information i 'm obviously that 's open and in this different levels in between so names access which is explicitly explicitly assigned by contract like driving licenses so for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a medical research for medical researchers a researchers has access to a pool data but only by authentication public access that has licenses that limit its use for example Twitter feed so we can access Twitter feeds Facebook feeds all kinds of stuff and that it 's all public but can be close but it 's a bit in between them and and a lot of open data is government data that is anonymized that has been made available I just like so point boom and as I said earlier BAM participated in a gas tax and where the government makes available and certain names on appoint which you can go to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and and just download a whole bunch of of datasets and select open available data and so in this case I 've just went on there and had a look at and postcode four five six zero so it 's where I live in blood languages and part of NAMBLA so tells me how many people live there but and the breakdown is female median age and how many families and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income meaning monthly mortgage repayments median weekly rent average motor vehicle per dwelling and if you can keep scrolling down it gives you um a lot of a lot of data points from the different censuses so this is 2016 synthesis and twenty LSA seven and two thousand one and then I think um I think that 's the main ones that are available at this stage so basically you could and look at some of the data pointed em across 10 15 years and compare them per postcode or you can compare postcodes to different post codes and you can display them in this I 'm just on the website or you can download them in a different data files and then do I 'm funky stuff with them I 'm another one which I don 't know claim was interested in this but its domestic sales of Australian wine over a number of years and domestic sales of wine and brandy by winemakers so that is publicly available if you 're interested in that but also I think a data set about an alcohol consumption by postcode so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some funny things to look at in there as well and this other platforms that and make data available and one of them is participant but um you do need but most of their and data sets you do need a paid and subscription but I just looked at Facebook 's annual revenue so that 's available for free so it shows you how how much space how much money Facebook 's making and how they 've been growing over the last a few years but on the right hand side you could download that as Excel now I 'll put it in the clip folio if you wanted to do something with that but obviously that 's just a one-off data set so it 's not an API that gives you and live data forward and then and the Sunshine Coast Council also has a website where they hit some and some data available just and relevant to the Sunshine Coast so I might just clicked on community and into a Wi-Fi access point sheet and charges registered animals and all kinds of data sets that are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just M Google open data Sunshine Coast you should you should find access to them as we skated questions and yeah so I think we 'll get them open it up only bit if you use and this in yet questions that have been coming through with them feel free to and popping some questions and more time see if you can enter any of those all right so well so if you have any questions and please feel free to just type them in and we still got about another maybe five five minutes for questions and while and you guys think of your questions I 'll just them go back a couple steps and maybe talk a little bit about the open data and because as business owners and you might be able to find some information that is relevant I may be in the census you could find information about and investment going into certain post codes or certain areas you could find an information about and whole and in industries like what they 're the revenue or the expenses around that sort of stuff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeing what 's what 's out there and how you can use some of it data that is freely available and for your business so yeah yes oh thanks see to lintel both sides there will be something I 'll sign up for so definitely I recommend anyone to give that a go um because it 's as I said it takes in half an hour you can have a dashboard that pulls the information that you probably should be looking at regularly but don 't look at I 'm often enough so if anything if you take anything away go slice calm and and get let it go I think I 'll be highly beneficial for you all right a bit so just um are you able to take over to walk us through the level up program in what what else is coming in for the upcoming workshop and and anything else that we haven 't stored no okay all right so and technical difficulties so I 'll just and keep keep going through

    "text": "hi guys and welcome to tonight 's webinar we try to McNew and try to just do some sound clips live before we got started at 30 and unfortunately that was less successful that we 've done a another quick one starting just a couple minutes late and can you believe it women are 11 this is a really cool webinar because as you know we 've been covering lots and lots of different sessions and topics over the last 11 weeks now but this session is really all about lots of other online systems and I mean we could literally run this program for years and keep introducing you to new online systems and we literally discover new ones every day ourselves which we love but I guess what we 're wanting to leave with you tonight is and there 's these other things and other things and there 's really almost been a line tool online tool for just about anything you want to do in business these days so we 're really just trying to inspire your continued exploration of cool online tools and introduce you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll tell you why we use them and what we love about them Andrew as you 're looking through the slides today I 'll get you to click on these and then I 'll introduce you so if you happen to be on this webinar for the first time or watching this recording and you 've never watched one of these before we are delivering this program on behalf of Sunshine Coast Council called deliver that program that this webinar is a part of so the whole principle is that no matter where you 're starting from and business start from ground zero start from level 5 just go up just take on some knowledge about ways you can save money ways you can save time using online tools and of course you can only do that if you 've got faster and snips and that faster internet is rolling out through the Sunshine Coast right now right into 2018 and we don 't just want to sometime close to get fast internet we want businesses to actually use it and use it to their advantage so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews um you all know me if you 've been on one of these webinars before my name is Yvette Adams I am facilitating this webinar tonight and my company the creative collective and training to make one the contract from counsels to develop and deliver programs if I haven 't met you before I 'm from New Zealand I travelled a lot in my 20s I built businesses in Y 30 and now I 'm yes the next racket which makes them feel really old and I have two kids and I run my businesses around them I 've started six services sold I run free now I do lots of cool things with the local community and feel like I have a good sense of it and I love giving back and giving as much value as I can to other small businesses medium businesses or businesses I love business who are wanting to make their businesses better because if you do it 's good for everybody moving on Andrew and we 'll get you to introduce yourself I 'll do a quick quick prelude we 've known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn 't around it and it 's a pleasure to work with he has locked the websites with us helps us in school systems and these days he does a favorite of training for us as well on a bunch of topics but that 's only the start Andrew welcome tonight well thank you very much yeah I 'm a bit a bit iffy about talking about myself but yeah look I grew up in outback Queensland I went to university in the sicinius TV and the electronic engineering and information technology the engineering module math and was really really boring but the information technology are what the people from and bucks we 're focused I guess the last 20 years or more online systems building websites programming a bit of a jack-of-all-trades for alarm yeah I feel like this is my for tell you what we 're talking about tonight we have lots of systems and processes which I really really love so they make my life so much easier I 'm so I 'm hoping I can check them acknowledge look-alikes Mac would you like me to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the program to a degree that I I guess I 'm yeah I 've already said this but these all the topics we 've already covered and you 'll notice most of them are on one particular topic so this is the first well some of there 's more than one topics that they 've had a scene this really once isn 't apart from there 's all this other stuff so that towel is fits in and then we 're going to wrap it up next week with an R 12 which it 's not on next week sort of workshop next week and the week after our grand finale webinar that 'll be all about data and how to make sensible with such as plug them together and get a dashboard together for your business so you can actually like like driving a car now fast you 're going and if it 's a harsh or cold or what it 's doing created vegetables for your business and know how it 's going as well which is really cool stuff as well so that 's are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recap is the customer lifecycle and I imagine you guys are probably taught this class but this is a really amazing on diagram it may not be artistically amazing but it has been really really great information on boy I 'm about taking our you know your potential customers or elite how to generate leads out of them convert them one second for advancer into the project area which is what we 're going to start about tonight and then pop the initial project there you know when you 're filling the website whether you 're selling here a car wash it it doesn 't really matter what that customer comes in the door and entered into your business they enter into the system most of you delivering the product or services that we provide for them so everything you 've probably seen this before so we 're going to spend too much time on it we 're going to move into some on topic but if you yet you haven 't had a recent look at this certainly we 're having a been having an in-depth look and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking in terms of each of our piece or icon Andrew can I just add to that that homework for the last couple of weeks is actually being to draw one of these up to your business and do that either of them on a program like Gliffy or the big set of butcher paper or with a big whiteboard if you 've got access one windows really big windows or glass sliding doors also worked really well we use one of those in our office for the whiteboard and you can rub it off so we 've looked at it from different perspectives because we looked at it about how you can work out where your customers might be satisfied or dissatisfied that was one week we looked at last week where you can work out what feedback you 're getting from customers at different points of the customer journey so I guess this week we 're really looking at it from do we need a system to improve the customer experience which would make the customer experience better or is there a way we could put a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and the sort of flow that they go through they literally are as I said systems for just about everything and the cool thing is we almost always tell you about systems that work with other systems not always it 's in which ones you decide to put together but that 's an ideal sort of scenario because some that are under same ecosystem I use that word a lot but just means the same family so that they all work together nicely the other thing I think most of the people are in the program at the moment other micro businesses or you know quite quite small businesses of one or two or three people and two to you some of these systems that were going to speak about and that we have been speaking about for the last month of they um they allow basically handing off some of the heavy listen to to a system that will allow you to repeat you know that repeat the process of making the sale or providing the service or the product is done to the customer so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our holdings are going to size riding there so these are some more online systems that haven 't been covered in the program yet they 're probably too small to do a webinar or web indelibly so there may be quite a large topic we get it 's pretty much just introduce them to Mike touch on what they are how to use them and give you some examples of provided with these systems and I want you to I talk and and to ramble and tell stories about um the system that I use myself but ever think about how you may these kind of systems imua in business that 's what we 're trying to do tomorrow introduce link systems to you and get me thinking along the lines of how could this happen to stuff how can a Bassano business say you know it 's not all about your what once you really get results online once you 're constructing from being intimate which like you guys are actually only just sort myself in the last month I 'm very much enjoying it it 's changed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work from home by Attlee the system this very really exciting so the first thing we 're going to talk about to my project management systems and we 're going to read all that to you but a project management system essentially the system that allows you to manage a project or I guess a series of tasks um but you know allow you to achieve an outcome so from a other that I 'm working in iti build websites my very vital job I 'm building a website for a customer um you know even though it 's a very creative discipline you can make some amazing with websites there are a certain number of tasks that you have to do for every single customer obviously there 's the exploration and then the chat with the customer at the start and find out exactly what they want to hear but then exactly what they wanna see but then we can you know then there are those tasks that we need to follow so we need to install visual analytics we need to make sure that beyond the website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks but we need to tick off every single time but we provide one of these websites to is possible if the rhetoric medicine system will allow you to create tasks it will allow you to assign those times to a person who 's responsible for that but you can also schedule set you know time and budget constraints what happened because resource allocation collaboration very communication within 15 members and four so again in the industry that I 'm in and I 'm working with the PLC 's we are a collective of you know people from all over the shop who are work on projects together and so we 're not always in the same room so using a plaintiff management system allows us to make sure that the project is finished as humanly possible without you know any little past slips through the cracks so we make sure everything stays off and what everything 's assigned to a person at the start and then by the ones between six off so I just internet so Andrew like when I started also in business I definitely didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and I know some of you are quiet small businesses maybe just yourself or just one other or maybe you 're using a couple of contractors so that 's well and good so some of these things we teach you you might not leave now but you might down the track so try and anticipate your needs and I just want you know that business practice and business if you 're managing any kind of project and it really does help you streamline things because you will get to a point where you 're getting that many emails and that many phone calls and managing that many projects or that many people these just many moving parts if you 're in a project-based sort of business that it becomes very difficult so project management systems for me just totally streamline everything I like that I don 't have to go check the emails about that project we train all our clients to send us messages through the system so I 'll jump in it or allocate time jump into that project and do stuff on that and I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client and us where they 've said yes I approve that print job to go to print for instance what here 's the information that you need we want you to approve it license we say here 's a draft or whatever so it kind of goes both ways hold everyone accountable someone you can put milestones in and bunches more but Andrew will explain for that yeah and that 's the thing so I mean like is that I 've cited a number of small businesses over the years and right at the start is just you know I 'm providing that personal level of service every customer that comes through the door but that 's that business grows you know you can 't keep overbold two BFFs please you know seems like you slip through the cracks oh those are system advices to manage everything that you 've got going on in your business on it becomes really really helpful now this is a project management system can often include a customer resource management system which talked about the errands in the part where all your emails would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way they are you know mobile all communications between the customer for the program management system adds to that is really the list of tasks and jobs so that in that scenario to complete a project so um we go you go to the text chain for a minute or so these are throwing the weaknesses that you have what a project management systems suite on your business or design one currently news one keep it looking over this we 're going to UM we 're going to show you some examples surely all rattle off a few names and as I was going through them earlier ah I 'm surprised that actually how many of yous with excessive agencies over the years um James it would suit that not using had new sales forces plus the Salesforce my understanding is it 's more of a CRM at my some project management features but it would probably fit more into the CRM bracket so when we talks about online what does it always put the customer experience systems we record beddin so yeah have a look at that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well alright take a look at some examples here so the first one is for teamwork and this is what we knew at the creative collective so there are you can see there are three elements the team wants to see my project see much chat and team like this they see my project is the project 's is the credit management system and every in every website that we that 's created as a project in z1 and they 're all communications with the client goes through there so you know me like to the day that we begin building their website we need to make sure that they sent you all the content essentially similar juries that sort of thing they 've given us the okay they paid for the processor everything that we need before we start a project can be rattled off inside too much so we know read those and even you know the contractors and other people who may run the project manager whether it be you know cat or is actual or even know um they would be doing all that client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those the bills begins and you know technologies like myself stepping and take control from there we can look back at the communications and make sure that that are the things on you know embracing you know where or the almond solving if you want to use through with anything like you can create projects and set costume and mountains around the top it integrates the email so all the communications which declined automatically subscribing to their stories and success that and the thing that I find very useful is file management that as an email arrives as an attachment will there be an image or worth documenting some content in there that automatically gets put into the file area so that if I 'm very looking for you know the image to go in front page of the website I don 't have to wade through all the emails just play straight into surprising and go from there they also Ambrose time tracking them and going um I 'm not the government we are in the building side of things um work to USA with me even what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that happens in there we have a third system for lack so what plants re-enter and the key key word are sizing billing I Vegas and billing and time tracking see my hands it 's fine we can do I 'm definitely fine we don 't use it for that though and filling we don 't use it Basecamp sort of had something a bit more integrated yeah and another bit of backstory we started on base camp but we made the decision to move to teamwork and teamwork really went out with the strategies versus basically completely copy base camp and all its features and make some better ones so pretty much we lose little things that bugs us about base camp in work did but base camp starts cooking a lot of stuff so if you want a system that 's going to work with other stuff in some ways base camp set up but we kind of went with features yeah both the like legions there work for his face has initially and been very nice into another one for workflowmax which we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar these two programs there is a bit of a price difference such as based chances of flaxseed out or unlimited uses an empty ma it can get a bit expensive depending on how many projects we manage so again let 's look at we will we will be pointing out to you freeze that you can jump on a console to play with in your environment I mean we really encourage you to a project management system seems to become something that will help with your business um stop using one jumping and have a good look anything so you know if you can discipline me talk to you that I know when I started using it making it is best practice early need to teach myself to be this what it 's easy tasted what result a stick with it it 'll really change the way you do business so another people example via our asana and work for a Mac so what I like is the one that I mentioned on the other agency LS or start of this place Cantonese into work so an act on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so does everything work in a team motion based can do as far as project management but it 's also equally some of those bouncy around sales for each type of tool so on waste management putting tools in grossing time so does integrating zero as well so that 's a good one but again a bit more over at this marble any senses exercised to base 10 but asana is a good one to if you 're just starting out the project management systemic you can jump in with the free version and set up simple projects to to manage it 's really nice really clean flexible and visual and dragging dropping it 's just yes quite a simple rudimentary version of a one of a project management system but then once we then on Venus lattes amenities at some of the executed say yes a good one should definitely have a look at if he 's just showing off in the world of Frederick engine system a couple more JIRA and active collab now JIRA software there is actually it began life second as a software development tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the development of software so people are testing software they can say arguing in this area of the program I found a bit of a bug and then the developers to controller that we create that rousing custom bug fixes so that 's where I began life it does now um things of now house project management tool goes into it but again I could get some primarily designed for software development captive one on active flooring is very about management and team collaboration tools it does mean time tracking invoicing as well they just say I get the another bit of the options is to take a look at under a couple more go home I think we 've talked about very high in the past in the realms of CRM so like um teamwork it has it has a CRM has a project 19 system at home two other different elements that I think even happen on my list manager so these are various sort of a you know an umbrella of I did when I was looking for a project monitoring system and comes in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I decided probably looking to me that that it is our syllabus client isolate thousands of customers and values it exceedingly well so very very powerful but for me as a little one-man operational for the article and Trello is I wanted a good screening it has a true inversion you can jump in and create tops and I actually do strawberries to keep track of some other capabilities myself size creative projects in there and going to set the talents but the time frames and of surveillance and do the jokes for me so lots of options there are they all other said girls in fairly similar things mainly subtle difference ladies but as I said is the whole idea of were trying to explain to everyone tonight is them there are system we deeds if software and places to try and do some of the heavy lifting for these for up a small business owners there are communities do everything manually organizes and because of the edges case timing infant area business differences between working till 11 but every life trying to control the posse so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent you from dropping the ball in any way and really the systematizing ability these projects aspects of your business also thanks all the project management system guys feel free to drop questions that Andrew will of course take questions at the end I 'm Andrew with just the Timeship we 're eight so Scion yes I 'm can slide again oh yeah look at that was this those programs are probably the things that I had the most success about because they 're quite diverse and and quite powerful the other systems related would be working at now or it gets a bit more linear a bit not too much all the same but that leaves what we 'll be doing tonight or from now on is just introducing the topic synonyms is a nice example that you 'll be able to go on on has a bit of a look in your own time so a learning management system is essentially like a program that allow you to teach people online so this is another great system learning the creative collective 50 companies attorneys Alexis there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and then you pay your fee as a student you sign up and and choose which presents that you want to learn all over social media or whether it is how to the website Android press that 's one thing and so what we are launched learning management systems for allow you to do is keep track of your students see where they 're up to we 've actually set pretty likely this for me lessons where you have to finish what someone before you get to what to do and some of them even automatically automatically mark them so one of the scenes left arms but the creators are not sure so if these training courses still being one of the things that used to do is once you do a lesson you get a multiple-choice question at the end and if you don 't get it right then you have to you know you have to read the lesson again and keep that bar set of get across before we should ensure that you mind selecting from that lesson obviously I can move on to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tests manually our learning management system I will allow you to I 've just throw things and run almost as a business in itself so does anyone need to learning management system eight it was a as a business owner or as a student and would you be using you know it would be something that your particular business I would be interested um Andrew they haven 't quite keeps abandoned that Jackie 's asked what is the cost for a LMS and like any online it 's kinda how long the second string really isn 't it yeah look there are there are free versions there are plugins for people 's well press website and then there are actually so some high-end thing so let 's dive in I 'll keep an eye on those questions or we 'll go into some examples so the ones I like she talked about here our Moodle which is AME flow I left UNIX still free its software that you download and install a lot like if you were setting up the WordPress website we basically install Moodle on your hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that is I had a lot better recently but it used to be an open source project so I assume that it still is so and it is well supported a lot of even sound government organizations being that sourcing use needles so that they 're really powerful and really Rock before the program stem say is the one WCS with the training collective say that 's the one that will allow you to you know set of courses within the course yourself lessons within the lessons and we have little cruise and what you need to do is get those prisons right or each inspecting annually and a decent pathways to you know in order to get to the next lesson say separately give on and if you have a significant other a knowledge base that you can make it sell online so it seems like so that pretty much any of your specialties if you you know a specialist in your business we can create lessons online them and store them to other people who won 't get come in doc you see this displays skill so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanna much to talk about if you haven 't checked it out before remember that some have some really really important lessons so so professional development and even international business and you said and how you usually will have you they have a use all the competitive management systems that we 've talked about in the past um so it 's very so are amazing weapons any other hyper specialist can create lessons and get them on TV so in the analysis to them so there 's a few other ones if you ever worked at several ie they operated lessons them and sell them on but my I guess my tip of the night Linda I think is is fifty dollars or there abouts per month only she won fair and in flying barefoot for Antibes in Queens and I have a go here 's from the contractors if you go to the state library 's website you can actually run web designer to the State Library see their access to balloon big ups are completely succeed so it 's a service it would say either obviously don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it brings our funnies and listen buddy that you like to to take on yourself okay actually guess that 's a crazy that 's a neat little trick I learned or you know or two ago and I 've seen teacher myself also performing something I 'm Andru just to add little experiences of it along the way with these and I mean you get right into the tech side and I guess I got into the marketing of them and how I 'd put it together stuff a learning I 'd love to share is that there is a few but in setting up online training and if you 've got all the skills in fantastic but just getting it installed effectively you might need the help of a text to do it so maybe get them to set it up get them to do a dummy lesson or two and then you might be able to add the content that pipes pretty easy but getting it set up and really mapping it out is important because if you get too far down the track that doesn 't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fix also we did find sensei a little buggy so we moved away from that we 're now using teachable so that 's just an interesting thing a lot of the industry when I last really good as Alvin for this was still on about Moodle I personally didn 't like it which is just an indication that you know it really does depend on your personal preference one of you might like strive BMWs the other like to dry Valdez you had the choice it really doesn 't matter if it 's all nice cars so yeah Moodle is still very popular but when I tried it I didn 't really like it I lose out of New Zealand it tags into zeros quite nicely and it looked to be quite a robust system so I 've never gone there Kalen LMS was out of San Fran and quite popular while I was over there and Linda actually got bought out by LinkedIn I don 't know she knew that Andrew but um LinkedIn doing a lot of stuff with it now and if you 're on LinkedIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome yeah i really like moodle myself but i think it 's yeah it 's more for those you know quite large organisations and they probably end up hiring like you know a professional moodle person which will be interesting to have a little resume but yeah not much opportunity that 's oh yeah i 'm investing those into them yeah really depends what content you 're playing with as well because an online course can actually be a series of videos which pretty easy to cut or if there is a screenshots if you 're showing how to do something on the screen or you can write a bunch of it or you can do podcast it really are a lot of options of putting the stuff together so probably map out what content you have what content you 're going to create and then work out what the best solution is and how it will display you know a lot of them have trial accounts so can play and then work out which way you want to go and yeah of course check out how much they cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a set of more than open source stuff it 's an annual fee kind of thing but it 's the thing you want to do updates and things like that you might also need to make an allowance in your budget for some tech support to keep it maintained and upstate yes however you enjoy okay so here are some yes just some screenshots about some of the features within a nominal system so essentially you know you need the ability to allow a student to enroll into your course or you can offer a free or paid courses and once they found out those then get to choose a number lessons that they am so like a alluded to you have to sit down slug through you know an essay of lessons a lot of lessons in things I 've noticed are just people you know speaking into a webcam and running through some screenshots a lot like Bill doing right now so yeah you know like I said if you 've got that knowledge that you know that people want to get hands on the semester great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those one of those lessons on once you get your lesson you can get a quiz and that can be a prerequisite moving up to the next lesson or it can simply just see you see how well do you do Evette and myself and the team has to create sources do a lot of work with Google on there I get professional development program is based around Google Adwords and then marketing as well as the analytics kind of stuff and I 'm gonna tell at the moment when I switch between MultiChoice questions as University or difficult between see the ones they really try and trick you want you to make sure that you money deceptively you know get onto the ball get a parking parking marks for the surveys qualifications they will have to manage up there and then finally little then LMS you can do some reporting so who registered how many people just looking through it how many actually finished or how many in a sort of quick pathways you can even check how they want on their quizzes nothing they really well-designed programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then earlier iteration of this that created the training courses website on was very much filled with sensuality but yeah as we built onto it I think we 're going to be plugging it with early days for that plugging I think it 's lovely so we thought about now but aren 't there we go she needs on teeth to the teachable perfect alright so we have a bit of occasionally um simply what I think diverse pretty much emergencies are what we 're talking about here we are the training collectives what only elephants fact that we do workshops and one-on-one consult and that sort of thing it also has online process that you can find licenses you can sign up you pay for your course and then once you log in you get access to to those buttons you need to say me exam a person can add lessons to that and once you get to the end on you get your little song star and go with the knowledge that you pay for oh yeah just to add to that yeah we were finding things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes as we are the self-managed because our space moves really fast and we want to keep our training up-to-date and so we moved to teachable we didn 't have a church help us get a little bit set up it 's got really cool features its user interface is really nice and easy and to be honest I didn 't even have a lot to do with that project one of our not as experienced staff that 's gotten their accession and we 've had a lot of signups and people were giving us great feedback and yeah it 's also got other things that work and was it like certificate things and you can make people pay on the subscription monthly or annual and or just buy something one-off so yeah it just looks nicer as well I think at the end of the day so that might be a consideration too because if people are going to study online it kind of has to look nice yeah I have to work obviously I like the experience and I mean we keep coming back to this experience for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be because in others I 'm any little bug any little problem and they 're less likely to number one come back and spend more money on wonder to talk to your friends about you so it sounds like moving away from simply and into teachable has really ticked all the boxes for what we needed to do this will affect yeah absolutely we 've learning that who don 't you think limit now you should we stay on it so it be afraid to the pen even if you put a bit of work into it sometimes the best solution is just around the corner absolutely all right so the next little element of the bar is a support ticket system so I guess mostly morally neutral a support ticket system in the past whether it be my rotten feeding these are two industries it would be you know web page or directly with your internet service providers and the one along those lines providing you an online service if you have any drawings essentially you open a ticket and then the exact if it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get a number and then that ticket has to get trakula way through to a resolution so most support ticket system integrates purely in wealth completely integrate weeks with emails and then we are whenever one of your customers certain email in again a notification next year the right thing you know gives your ticket number I hate how you can see we 're up to mixer ticket and someone will be contacting usually a lot of bigger companies that have been outsourcing their you know supports to description so you know it 's an industry and itself providing support for it especially as we start to use more and more complicated services online even some of the project management systems that we 've seen before we go to the website you know someone or one of those were many products and say hey if you got any questions or having any problems particularly onto it with you so and it serves a number of ultimately ticketing systems are a means of to support and help you deal with any issues or incidents in your organization so again we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customers on your website we can already do that so if at any stage we drop the ball or if there 's any kind of issue that we don 't need to know about we need to make it back for them to contact us and we need to make them feel loved and arms you know and important and ads on my what we 're going to you know sort of are those quick as possible so that 's what a support system support ticket system will help you do so is everyone currently using a support ticket system or even if you make good or bad experiences regarding using something up it 's a 44 system and just as we 've discussed it you know it is a support ticket system something that one possibly help your business nothing coming in your Android one correctly least one else and they 're just thinking about it but I think you 're right I think most businesses would would have submitted a support ticket system I know some people find them really impersonal and people get frustrated that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time in place just like you wouldn 't even always find someone lets out there at a hospital because it just wouldn 't be the right time keep thing can be really good option important ticket systems are a way for you to have your issues seen and prioritize like triage really with the highest level SAS placing or place them when you claim in the queue depending on the nature of the issue so it 's kind of fear like that and I know I 've certainly use them when trying to resolve stuff I use some tips as one recently when trying to resolve some speeding to change a flight and it was really quite good Melissa panic a note we do not have one does anyone think that maybe just before them and even if you listen to the recording give that some consideration as to whether you may need one and again maybe not now but just know that they exist and what they are and maybe get one later if you scale up and you need that or even if you 're a working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that they get one one of these one of the things we talked about in the workshop a few weeks ago mother is talking about automation is connecting these different systems or working automation is and I 'm going off on a tangent here but I 'll make it very short what an automation eventually something triggered some action that happens automatically so automatic actions based on the trigger and what the trigger might be is someone filling out a form saying hey only some support so sometimes you run you especially for against in my industry I 'm talking about one person if you have an issue you can you know fill out a form and say hey I need some assistance here and that 's the actions that action create the support ticket but quite often ability pull down menu or a checkbox to say you know is this urgent or as if priority is this request and what I talked about on the run shop is if you choose or we think that you 're supposed to get up so that if we choose ten disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were then making the appropriate person so they can jump on on back ticket immediately so again it 's like as though it 's all about making sure in that customer feels loved and looked after I mean to be the issue instead one since the problems may be urgent which in a didn 't always effect but again it 's open see onto our to how you deal with your customer and seeing whether a support ticketing system is appropriate we can 't you know so small businesses kind of the difference from for our today um so you know maybe as a for to specific system would be one way of them you know allowing your customers to contact you at my college journey searching personally buttons other I can personally am not sure so this is time to like them yeah I guess look at the time of the places like this you know you can 't already been to the phone so we need to make sure that you can be contacted outside is very valid if you are handling issues what a support ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach for all those points together so that it 's more than one person has to work on like ticket on they can see all the previous conversations rather is you know having to see see a bunch of people so yeah you know if I could add Andrew is a support system to some degree it 's almost like a really large to-do list as well and if you 're running a large operation and you 've got different people feeding and things that make doing or clients that are asking yourself it becomes bubbling it 's not possible all of them and you don 't want to drop any ball so it 's like you know getting them all into one place all of our team someone inquires about everything they need help for creating support tickets in the system and then we have different people we can assign them to so they are dealt with quite a bit person in the quickest manner and also that someone else can check as someone went on holiday all that second acting was an action so we can ensure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we didn 't do that I 'm not sure that you could have a sustainable business when you 're getting into the bigger numbers by just keeping on hiring people who answer phones or send emails that it would definitely not be the most efficient way to handle a lot of inquiry and no requests for support I appreciate the personal touch that people won 't not feel that that 's personal but you can 't achieve the personal touch I would argue through just the way you respond and give them messages and give constant updates and communication as well it 's not different to an email in that way but it 's the way of managing the volume of them yeah well you know someone answers the phone and if they can 't help the person on the floor all they say is I 'm going to assign this task to one of our tech guys and I 'll get back to you as quick as I can so they simply create a support ticket and then whoever 's next available gets to pick up that particular work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's definitely better than our question management I would suggest haha we 'd look like a bloody what do you call them is only 7 mm that 's not all right so here are some yes support ticket systems to check out received oh hello again team wise death is we the support ticket system 14 months which reduces the creative forces probably the two big ones are the ones that are most komoti with so send us and first so their online system you don 't sign up I think the payment or what you entertain depends on the CEO so the flow of tickets a number of sixties that but it also is that these systems allow you your fiscal and people are comfortable asking for support about exactly the same thing you can actually select any dialogues for answering these questions a lot like anthem answering the phone all the time has a you know feel I guess every time you wring out tells you or autism you know you 're asking for help this modem they haven 't tried turning it off and on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know as you 're answering so monks I support ticket they may actually provide you this skin well here here are some similar answers that we added or you can predefined responses to certain questions it saves you a lot of time rather than having to rewrite that email because I guess that I have to say canned response so it 's essentially a pre-written you slice to someone 's request for for a certain type of assistance well I haven 't don 't know too much about PI actor or hopes plus you know there 's one to that um help scout I I 've just heard of both of those and the industry use and because I 'm a bit of a geek when I do support ticket system I usually click around and you can click on their Lincoln and see what they 're using so I have noticed that quite a few other bigger players I 'm not thinking of any examples right now but definitely so use those so yeah I played in this probably the biggest industry leader or you change work yes because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teamwork and fresh this is probably the most popular going home obviously to get a plain as I hope because of some the other to a sort of stand-alone product but you do see them and the deaf ears and things as well which we talked about a webinar eight on the automation so you know that might be a consideration to okay I 'm looking at the system but what does it what was that makes it for something else I want it 's connected yeah you 're breaking up a little bit but so let me run with that yeah fresh yes I actually used when we were using base camp I think those two things talked well together and yeah then that I find a lot of the big you know American companies have a addenda unsupportive existences that 's yeah what they 're all they all seem to be used by us and will be their friends in the guards to end them when you decide the time has come to attach informatica Pacific system let me take a look at a lot of these programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning management systems they often offer a free trial are making a difference are getting itself a project or answer for us integrating email just so you can test it out see how it all works and is armed people to go before you actually have to open your wallet so that definitely seems the way very again from personal experience when I was looking for a customer resource management systems I think they tried through the four readings before I decided on which one to use on so yeah it makes so a big difference to actually use it rather than to try them on compare them side-by-side that I haven 't seen in action yeah what is it a me yeah I 'm engine one of those I cooked in one of those images in it try to open the website um so yeah again features of a support system essentially like I said when an email comes in a creative ticket you then can assign the ticket you can actually make sure the ticket entered in that a timely manner so it can be escalated if someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office that you know slides is always this conversation seem so when we dribble doctor the customizing acted in two days three ladies context on and after the scene with Altima but the other important message of others contracting are that everything that resolved and certain satisfaction always in response to your assistance in both areas so yeah really really powerful aspects to that to see how our customer subsections are helping well areas let management personnel fixations in that satisfaction during that time time basically mimics eyesight so that we can they 're having results about that that 's a quick a try believe I think this is a lot of manual work busy and we talk about is the online booking systems so some of these you know general hotel and examine overall restaurants there are only booking systems can do is actually you can focus the console and you can eight we can integrate with your available in calendar so if someone says large family to stability for opening to come the valley you can actually allow your customers to booking for a certain amount of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obviously for hotel um but yeah mind-body I think more of a gym slash yoga slash health booking system will vary a bit what sent yeah the mind body one that 's a lot is well on the site yeah exactly massage it comes up with it when we do website some people come to us and have already established that and they want to integrate it so it can be as simple as a book now and it goes off to your mind body system that you pay a monthly fee for and then yes you can put in your availability in terms of you as a therapist or multiple therapists and nameless to services and cost and they can even book online itself question display have we go to these platforms for booking firm music client booking phone call meeting I think a system for something like that kind of a bookings I see how you get confused but something like that I would just do like Kellen Lee so cala en d ly or I use one called funny name doodles calm and that integrates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see your available time you have to be very diligent managing risky time it 's going to share that out but they made ripples the time that suits them you my friends in detail and done and so it 's sort of a self-service and saved on people one being a TA which is clinical yeah and what I 've used in the past is called time trees yeah country song and that yet again integration calendar so yes we have to make sure that you become result to be but what if what it actually allows you to do is block out certain times to pay again available from one to three Monday to Friday they 're they 're being session times they 'll allow for statistical thing so you have to open up your whole ponder are using step certain times so again depending on the business that you have them or our businesses are completely different but there are systems to allow customers to booking rather than you having to fear the friends to make that happen so we 've got a bit of a conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be in those days oh yeah do you want to go to that yeah sure so I was just really impressed with these sides I mean if you live on the Sunshine Coast you 've probably heard about this place can head up to a three-month waiting list so forget showing a few things what right it 's got an amazing location it 's what amazing food they other bits do I agree or where we 're all symmetric genetics in the whole pepper amazing so anyway I went on their website to make a reservation knowing yes do it in advance I just summer said it with select result over that 's interesting because these sizes established enough to probably create your own booking system and their own website the website is not to do that and what I think is a good move by them and using Yelp is y 'all so huge in America it 's bigger and Brisbane and Australia and I 've actually met people who work for you it 's not as deep into this in America people don 't always know Yelp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be benefitting from international gifts knowing Yelp and perhaps something on their restaurant they 've got fantastic reviews on their and the whole system of booking was so easy so I 've no doubt that you 'll probably take the Commission a lot of booking systems do but for them to get constant bookings and these books out three months in advance so to show that it 's a pretty good system so yeah that 's some passage from ending up yeah I remember I 've actually done a Thai cooking class there okay yeah tell me that I could provide lunch next oh I love it um we do have a couple of other systems look at I one of those timesheet systems they only have a bunch of contractors working for you you need to allow them to track their time so that you can see how long not even contractors can be direct employees because after working our project you want to make sure that I 'm getting a return on investment you don 't want people spending 20 hours to finish a project or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time and within the create effective supports if if there are well actually pretty much within the entire industry the book tickets can be the distinct whole the money sink holes or for your businesses can be people spending time answering support and helping helping their customers metaliteracy issues or that can be really difficult to long to build from the time so kidding track or the amount of time I want to work on each project is in the business these projects of these systems are really good for that the one I see material targets we use us for movies the workflowmax on our project management system just a little browser extensions where when you sit down start liking something to take the bottom of start owning it and when you can leave if you have to go up and stretch away your leg will in turn so make itself coffee or even after the circle you press those things then you can find the time again each different some project that you 're working on so sometimes where I 've done a lot of ugly timesheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little one about that okay and because sighs I know there are some times I space companies well and if you actually do it timesheets or online timesheets and rank very well on Google so positioning very nationally and I say nationally as opposed to internationally with the name Ozzie but yeah it looks really good I haven 't used them we use one called minute doc and I didn 't even put that on the screen but it was about a hundred bucks us and months and we actually just got rid of it because the one thing about time sheets I would say is it 's one thing to have them another to get faster Silverman so you really have to have a pretty good project rollout to plan not just set it up and give them training but actually we had someone monitoring who 's actually completing them and again if you 're a small business or even just by yourself you might even want to get timesheets just a thing where you try and go think of it like a log book but you feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you need to do why don 't worry your time is actually going and get one of these things is on the 30 day trial do it for a week do it for months or whatever and you 'll soon have a really good idea of where your climbers going and you can start to maybe you know subcontract get some systems in place that save you time or even higher than people if you 're in a position to do that yeah look if you 're a one-man operation harvest the websites get harvest come on that 's completely free for one person but it 's only allows you to set up two projects so on that that 's great if you 're working on two projects but if you want to keep track of your entire day you know phone calls and emails and that something yeah that that was like but maybe for downloading and checking out how it worked and or or even just keeping your time learning the time on a single project so you can see how long that seen how long you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my assistant I guess like well we talked about with the automation before if someone wants to exploit a ticket you can hook into an SMS with 17 to notify me quicker than in a vendor kind of an email so SMS is it used to be you know you can end up getting quite expensive but these three systems you know babies against like chicken follicles of the five sent SMS one salmon bottom right-hand corner but first is one of the things one of these the data x1 and message media is from various Islam yeah message media has been around for a while and I feel like I 've probably got more runs on the boards than anybody else but I mean people do ask me when I mentioned this technology as it takes old now like because there is so much other stuff probably depends on the industry you 're in and even more importantly what customers use dealing with and how do they like to receive information a lot of you will probably have experience with patients yourself as incentives or with a doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you Andrew but they 're often the things that make me go that 's right so I 'm really glad they text me for those things and it helped makes me wonder maybe we should be texting people to say don 't forget you 've got Facebook Ads training tomorrow or don 't forget your website the days on or something like it 's just another touch point and there 's some other people who really do run their businesses on their phones because their mobile yet they do it all the long slow hard way I told my trainer who was always organizing group outdoor fitness and it was messaging people one by one by one and forgetting people and if you 're lucky you see them create a group just go online at night man and want to make this stuff and you know put all your names in once and you 're done and lisas eyes free why didn 't keep all that the possibilities basically so Gary searching here I 've acquired using less and less essential for maybe four continents yeah I get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned that I get it from you know a hairdresser or I get it from the doctor 's surgery that 's everything chiropractor or they all left their listen message which is great I am I was playing with one of these programs the other night one of my wife is watching The Bachelor and I sent her a message from it actually so from The Bachelor and it said hey thanks for watching you know xoxo and she sort of looked up she knew exactly what helo was messing with her at the time say I didn 't get away with that one alright one last is to my eligibility before it 's basically member management system so if you have a membership site where you need to keep track of members burning up for whatever it is for example I have a you know a tipping proposition for the murder Gd and the motorbike racing where people get in and they assisted but the free membership site people can sign up and then they get access you can use membership sites too so lesson we can easily should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean there are sites for example United a I have to climb up to get the latest driver for my printer on accounts anther log into this and say you know those are a big database of all they 're all people use printing so this is just a bit of a comparison table of notion slicing reviews for a vast variety of different things a is a quick example of some of them to have a look at what they do and surprise so one of these one of these options there 's content gripping and what that is is you might sign up for a membership smart and questioning one ago of the month or ten dollars a month or whatever be but it 's going to find in downloads all the content they can cancel straight away so what comes in 15 years is you know once a week or once a month a new lesson becomes available you can also restrict digital downloads and yet we can subscriptions value may be paid on a per month or comparative basis all right so we have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of different systems or a lot of different programs so if any one of them have set a light bulb above your head in regards to how to work and feel business definitely go check out some of the options that with that and then have a bit of area and evaluation and see if you can it 's going to fit with what you 're trying to achieve because everything that we 've been talking about here is supposed to make your life easier you know it when you 're using it for the first time you 're like this seems like more work than what our work seamlessly but the more familiar you become with it and the more you start to rely the more time is going to save you so Weber yes some really really helpful programs and can really turn a small business or Primus or business the negative direction or from the seamstick setting all right so after all of that you have the option opportunity to ask me some questions to the obstacle and for a little bit and I am Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions or anything is chat about that one straight off it 's like I 've been saving it burn is there any fraud that Cabos episode security with user access levels across the price but those the collaborative softies Internet chat on internet chat tomorrow internal form si si and also integrated perspective document management system so yeah I mean that don 't sound like you are like a project management system essentially mostly those ones we talk about our cloud-based you log in each member of the team logged in versus your email and password and from that they can communicate we create the project that case that your business is working one and then find those soft numbers to the project very relevant to them so within there they can collaborate you can set up your wiki and SATs and forums and that sort of thing so you 'll find there are like you know public and private chat so you know within a project you can create a dialogue that everyone can see or you can director as you know I am notes to one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gaining public and private chats and then we 'd also yet so the documentation especially around processes you can say here are the steps for completing the projects you know ABC XYZ and one of the awesome things about these coordination systems is you can create the very or project to to assist in setting up the next projects very are rather than adding all the top every single time very well everything or website we build for example you know it begins like this we need to get all these things from the client before you get started once we achieve them here 's the time frame here the tops and we make money to assign those cause you just duplicate the what the project and then start customizing to this particular project that you 're working on so yet have a look at those project management systems are asana was one of the pleadings and like I 'm just a bit concerned because I think we missing agencies mentioned across separate sites I think if she might even be then you might need to clarify the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she does it like I 'm just wondering if it 's like a different medical practices or something like that and I 'm also actually thinking I wonder if Google Sites would suture because you can chat in that you can set up if IQ you can it 's protected document management you have to check exactly how protected and whether it 's compliant depending on the industry cloud-based I 'm pretty sure Google 's pretty secure and it 's got user access levels too sure but a few of those too just wondering whether we 're getting the exact picture I should give you simple presses one but very ugly UI hmm yes it was I was so impressed mastered using that it 's such an amazing tool but um yet definitely take a look the bottom line is if you haven 't used this before as well but like I was saying there are a couple of project management systems that are completely free to start using so our Trello and that 's on all of those who have a bit of a look I probably like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right any other questions sighs and Andrew would you even be open to ask questions pop up over the next week or so in the hangout with the training Flexer online community to respond to them I 'll just tag you in if they come up yeah it 'll be much appreciated a gym pitch is going to look at Google Sites wanting a corporate intranets solution so gin we have covered one single customer what was that called you whatever chronolog memory here good cover a lesson where we talked about intranet and know I know it was number seven online for symptom procedures how to look when we talked about Google Sites and other options like that stuff the exhibition straight but yes I think we should wind it up in the interest of time Andrew and yeah just quickly tell you that if you are doing the full program you paid between on five and you still can and get access everything you can book a session with a mentor and Andrew would be happy to meet with you we pay him you don 't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the phone or site or if it works out in person and he can give you advice one-on-one you can tell them all about your situation what questions you 've got both reserved for diagram would only had a very small percentage of people happen into the service and I have to admit on the betterment because it 's to me it 's most valuable part of the program like getting knowledge and then actually getting help to implement it that 's how you actually get stuff done so please please please don 't look back and I should have done that and think that I 've got to get organized and have my life perfect before I go see them no not at all so with them with an absolute mess and scribbles and notes and really no idea what you 're doing and that 's what they 're there for they 'll help sort you out really and then we 've got the Facebook group so if you are a member of the program you also get access to that I know some of you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't forget you can suck our questions like I said it 's about this week 's topic ol tag Andrew and he will do what it can to talk you out sometimes other members even you guys amongst yourselves can say like one of you did I use you Jim it 's a mess central which is one we haven 't included and we want to hear from you and once you know a good and then share your experiences of doing free trials of you know integrating things together tell us when you 're pulling your hair out and live in the clock at night trying to do this stuff and we 'll do what we can to provide you with support as well also huge value and we 've got one more webinar I 've set you wrong next week is webinar twelve and then we 've got workshop for after that we have just recently confirmed we 're going to do a workshop for tradie and that 's going to happen at the end of August so look at the detail on the website for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would like to know in two hours nice short quick one about cool apps you can get that Kentucky run a trade based business we 'd love to see you there and then we 're going to do one in Malini which is going to be kind of more focused for the hotel restaurant

    "text": "good evening everyone and welcome to tonight 's webinar for the level up program provided you by the Sunshine Coast Council if you Adam Perron tonight we 're talking customer experience systems if this is your first webinar live or recording that you 're watching after the session let me tell you really quickly what the level up program is as I said it 's funded by Sunshine Coast Council was aimed at you the small and medium businesses here on the Sunshine Coast we want to help you get connected to the NBN or faster internet where it 's available and really start using the tools that can change your business dramatically no matter what stage you 're at even if you 're at the start even if you 're learning about tools on this program you can 't see yourself using now but you might in the future we hope we 're giving you the tools that you can know what 's out there and to sort of know how to guide your business through the maze that can be technology by doing that generally you will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money you will save more time and who doesn 't want that myself used for me if you 've listened to previous webinars but in case this is your first live station or your first with enough and I recording and I do see some new names on there tonight so welcome to those of you who are new to joining us my name is Yvette Adams and you can hear the Kiwi accent it doesn 't leave I 'm a traveler my left in life 20 to go overseas or travel for seven years my first destination was Bali which has stayed and about three months even picked up into the lingo and just last week I went back there so that was a real treat having massages and enjoying the culture and the food and so on a really good digital detox I had in much-needed mid-year and I 'm a mum of two kids aged 10 and 13 I 've started six businesses now I 've sold two I ran three I get to all sorts of things like feats of Google I 've been Silicon Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm also the chair of the knowledge and professional services task force for Sunshine Coast Council and the Australian Institute of Company Directors I 'm actually doing my company 's reckless course very soon so I won 't be the teacher then I 'll be studying anyway a bit of that 's enough about me tonight we 're talking all about customer experience so what now we 're talking about well Gardiner is a big sort of I guess consulting organization and they 're pretty big in the IT space and they project futures and things and they have a pretty good knack of explaining to people concepts so what they describes customer experience management as well they call it CEM is the practice of designing and reacting to customer interactions to meet or exceeds their expectations and then increase customer satisfaction which we 'll be talking about in next week 's session as well so this increases loyalty advocacy basically you can get repeat business you get happier customers they 'll then refer it makes any business you know a better business and it 's applicable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminology should be familiar around this customer experience is they do call it UX which is user experience when it comes to website and I 've also heard an emerging to be cool to see X so if you hear people bandying about UX or CX now you know what they are CX is customer experience as well we 're exactly calls it CEM so I just told you when we have customers we kind of want to move them around the customer lifecycle and again this graph should apply to most businesses all of you will have prospects there people who are inquiring about your business or looking at your website they 're curious to know who you are what you do and whether your product or your service or your event or whatever it is you 're offering is for them once they 've done that they then might sort of shop they might walk into your store they 're not just heard about you I will call up about you or they might come to your website or something like that they might come to website multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 've heard interesting business coaches sometimes say we don 't call our customers customers we call them all clients which is fine but in this definition here and we all look at things in different ways a customer 's probably someone who 's bought something from you once one time but we all know that if someone buys something from you more than once they are really becoming a client there are a nice loyal happy customer hopefully and hopefully after that they 're going to start advocating they 're going to say these guys are so great I had such a good experience with them you have to go see them so just today I 'm really into what are called pokeballs today see oke they 're basically like macrobiotic food it 's all raw food real food yummy food vegetarian food and a little bit of everything and it 's colorful and it looks nice and it 's very healthy I 'm still in my detox so I did an Instagram picture of that I then tagged him the company the cafe I was at and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retweeted that will be posted on Instagram so I guess they 've picked up that I was advocating they 've got me from just yesterday having my first bowl and looking at whether they 're suitable it 's actually going in their stores actually buying one gets you going back again today so you can see how far I 've gone round the wheel with this cafe and I was actually advocating for them on Instagram today they 've picked that up and run with it so good on them for monitoring their social media so well and then the next step in the journey would be for them to perhaps reach out and go look we know you really like our pokeball we 'd like you to actually be a partner promote them how about you sell them in your store we heard you 've got a cafe as well or something like that so yes today 's it 's very it 's actually a really good example of getting around the customer lifecycle so want you to think about what sort of business you have because some businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding dresses ideally you don 't have too many repeat customers funnily enough that 's just given the nature of it but if you could get referrals or advocates from those same people buying that one-off wedding dress then that would still be valuable to your business so give that some thought and process that diagram there which I understand you did cover a few attended workshops three as well so how we get them around that wheel which is the end goal because the more further around there guys are more valuable they become as a customer is basically through a better customer experience and that 's what we 're talking about tonight so you 've got to be really clear with your business what your brand promise so one exercise I do do with people or more marketing front as say to them you know if people talked about your businesses if it was a person or an object how do you want them to describe it and what would that person promise to be or what sort of experience today expect in some typical kind of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed things like that so there 's a little tips for like maybe if you 're jotting down notes and really engaging in this particular thing this is a recording think about who your brand is what do you want it to represent what are its values what its brand promises and what are the sorts of words you want me to a think of when they think of your brand and ideally you 'll move away from some of those quite generic words I 've just given to really things that define you and make you different to others next you need as how you 're going to deliver on that brand promise and those values through the customer experience management so and then you 'll basically win the heart the mind so a business must be customer centric once upon a time when it came to business and I guess marketing we used to see the business and we 'd say we know what people want they all want this type of hamburger but now we 're saying or look at McDonald 's in fact what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and you can design it with a you know it 's really fun and the roast will it call it a chicken breast and camembert and all sorts of fancy stuff so that is becoming a custom centric business it 's no longer saying this is what we think you need adapting the customers what they want and then amending so in order to survive and grow you has to be customer centric now all these businesses that keep doing what we 've always done and going we know best we know what sort of car you want to drive and not doing any customer feedback loop I really at a big disadvantage and may not survive and then technology can help you to look at that which will find out about next week but it can also help you deliver a better experience subject to what type of business you are I 'm going to introduce you to systems tonight which again are pretty generic and I think should be pretty overall of interest I 'm just going to check in there 's no kick issues for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so using customer experience systems you can actually start to work smarter not harder so some of these things can take a bit to set up but in the long run they should save you a lot of time and they can build an enormous amount of value in your business so consider how using technology could help to improve your customer experience such as how 's my customers find it easier to communicate with you of course you 've got to communicate with people to do a sale and some shape or form whether it 's email or web form of phone and walking for how you 're going to make that happen make it easier for them to buy from you that they 've got the right information and they feel comfortable they trust you how do I get a good service whether it 's you serving them or someone else from your team how do they find information about your organization how do they get their questions answered so consider the commercial costs and time with lost customers or disgruntled customers of not putting some focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there 's a lot of things to do in business and there absolutely is and if you 're going on board another thing she wants me to think about and focus on but this is really important so I 'm afraid to say if you don 't have this doesn 't matter if you make the best food in town you 're not going to have a business for very long number eight slide eight this I love that poster on the right is from a company called startup vitamins you can get really cool motivational posters I 've actually ordered some to my team and the most dangerous phrase you can say in business as that yellow closest is on the screen is we 've always done it this way therefore I know it 's dangerous because you 're never actually focusing on how the customers needs are changing I mean customers have access for clients whatever you want to call them for so much information now they can research you they can get a cheaper price they can you know challenge you on what you even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thing you sell isn 't better than you know so you 've got to step up so the process of improving the customer experience was first analyzing how customers currently journey through your business what the experience said likely have here today with what you 've gotten place technology-wise resource-wise service wise all of it how do you communicate what sort of response time you record phone calls what sort of email responses you have and so on and I want you to be honest on that there 's no point don 't know yet we always respond in four hours when really you don 't and really haven 't even asked your team and a-15 was to be honest would actually be more like two days or something like that next up you need to seek the feedback from staff and customers so it 's one thing for you to go I think we can do this to improve our customer experience there 's lots of good ideas from that webinar I was on but if you 're going to be customer centric you 've actually got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had a count manager meeting today we have it every two weeks and I ask them what are the customers saying what sort of packages so they need what are they liking what don 't they like because they 're the ones on the front line I 'm not always the one talking to the customers and the bigger your business grows the more apart you are from the customer experience so if you want to manage it well you 've got to keep means in place to keep an eye on that thirdly you want to design the ideal customer experience by being customer-centric so designed from outside and so that from analyzing and getting that feedback now you can redesign how you would ideally want it to be you can then collaborate so go this is what I think it should be be open and honest to staff and try it out maybe it 's not going to work and maybe you have to revise it personalize it we 're possible there 's a massive move towards personalization everything from going into your hotel and I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now but this is how far some hotels are taking it you can go in and you can already have indicated to them or their network I like this kind of music let 's say I like chill-out stuff so that when you will finish your favorite chili out Cafe Del Mar whatever you 're into not only that they can say are we see you like firm bed so they make sure we 've got the firm bed we know you like extra cows they 've got extra towels we know you like the smell of coconut online so they 've got that and I mean so they should in a way you pay a lot to stay in these places but this is all so where you can get an advantage over others if you do feel like a small business that can 't compete with the bigger size personalizing experience is absolutely a way to go and technology can help you do that by helping to collect data on what is people like and then making sure you use that data to improve the customer experience implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to implement new technologies that I 'm about to share so make sure you implement it right a big common problem I see businesses goes go oh cool that 's the CRM system I 'll go sign up for that everyone because they RM please use it they actually give training they don 't do spot checks and everyone 's doing it the same everyone starts doing it actively all sorts of issues arise some don 't use it all you 're paying a subscription and it 's complete waste of money so you know implementation is pretty darn important so review it and then tweak it until it is working well and if you get into these slides I 'll be very honest about some of the journeys we 've had as a company was designing improving our customer experience and getting custom experience systems into place so next up when you map your customer journey just to be clear on that I don 't know if you can see this but I can certainly get you the slide and you 're going to get two slides from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider what is it first up the ways people can hear about my business so on this example website they can hear about me from events from offline marketing from word of mouth from media from online marketing or my website feel free to steal those the fuels are exactly the same but maybe yours is a Walken or you know other means I 'm not sure so there 's the potential customer and then what are the things that they can do if they hear about you with your business currently so remember got to make out a current one and then redesign it where do we want to do this doing this exercise on a whiteboard it 's first is a really good idea you don 't have access to a whiteboard just a big bit of butcher paper go to office work for something like that those ones that are brown and roll out a really cool because you can just roll them roll a roll and just keep sort of drawing on them so here 's the example this one if the person inquires they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the webform they could contact us by phone or email or they could request work to be done quite immediately which be unlikely with us but and again this might vary for you so these are just suggestions then what happens so when I do this for client for the workshop sort of mode and I tell you what doing this for the mentor would be a really valuable use of your time keep asking yourself as you do it yourself or what your mentor will probably do is say okay and then what happens and then what happens and when you like we 've put that there but we should be doing this put a little dot around it is what I do to identify an opportunity and how the customer journey could be improved so I 'm not going to go into each of these points that I 've gone through and I 've sort of said well all the yellow but is sort of the lead phase the orange is the conversion phase and the green is project work and then we have referral repeat business so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not suit you if your product based on one business etc and there 'll be many more you 're a manufacturer there 's many more of different industries but it 's all I 'm trying to teach you right now is the principles now here 's a pretty cool tool you could look at if you want to design it online and all you don 't have a whiteboard if you just like to be very digital I 'll introduce you to another tool this is called Gliffy there I think you can get a few free so I 'll just go to Mike Murphy and you can see I 've done some organizational charts here but here 's a flow chart is basically what we 've just been doing so I can click on that and again I 'm not going to give you a full rundown on Gliffy but just aside this is a tool you could do your customer journey on so I could you know it 's a little square there yeah that must be on this can 't use it for a while bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head so I can draw a square things want to work possible I got too much open up right yeah here we go I 'm making it look hard that 's actually very easy so you could say you know Sloane and quarry and then start doing this up now if doing this seems like the most boring job in the world or usually scary because you just could not possibly have time or whatever then maybe pay someone or again maybe do this with your mentor so you know you can have web forms the reason means that someone 's would end up contacting me so what 's cool about this system is it 's all online so you could show them as it is and then together with a consultant or a web sorry a mentor and princess and you can also color code and all the rest of it so check out fluffy so drawer needs or whiteboard or good old butcher paper moving on tools you could use to improve your customer experience so some of these things we 've actually already covered so in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chat I believe that was in perhaps lesson 3 communicating online we also looked at canned response email I think we looked at that and listen to so refer to that video conferencing up in the top left we looked at that in less than four so we also talked about real-time messaging and how that can get some improvement so phones using a PBX system is another custom experience system but I have to mention some of these again because they 're all part of a custom experience and they 're all potentially alternatives to good old phones that old email all the good old same stuff that could help you improve your customer experience and chat box is yet another one as well I haven 't got a lot on chat box because they are cutting edge and but I will mention the check box are here and they 're not coming I don 't know if you 've ever been on chip sales website maybe I look over there they just give you a live demo of check box so as some of you might know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight coming up and I needed to move it so it was through Chapter I jumped on the Jets our website when I was well enough in fact my sister may have done this for me and I would really see that there was a live chat also it seems it 's actually a chatbot not a real person and some things that they 've programmed in with all the answers already so that you can get help easier without with less resources from them so big companies are doing this stuff so I 'm just going to go down and see if I can find the help area loading quite slow put some locks open travel agents this is table where did I find it last summer super easy so that seriesin know it 's just changing the language oh Dehradun special this is what I did was only a month or two ago okay so ask Jeff so see Jeff looks like a flighty and I 'm going to ask her to chat so I 'll show you what I did I want to check this again hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you other questions what can I help you with so I 'll put can 't fly due to illness so what she 's going to do she 's pre-programmed to a couple of key words and this so are you looking for I have a medicalization I 'm feeling unwell should I fly I need to cancel my booking I need to change my booking so in this case I went I need to change my booking and then she 's got other solutions so this is all black boxes all automatics some people call it artificial intelligence because they 'll pre-programmed in so they actually have created computer systems that can think for themselves so if they see and some things they haven 't seen before rendering other results it was actually company even on the Sunshine Coast doing this Sandra x8 in CRH so that 's a company you could look at if you were interested in the Box papers pretty cutting-edge and so I won 't go into it too much probably a little bit too results with some businesses but certainly you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn 't think of a better example than the jet so I want to show you so a CRM I 've mentioned that a few times through the program and few people pulled me up and rightfully so and see what does a CRM but to remind you a client relationship management system is a CRM I don 't know if you 've ever been and for bank and you might have just wanted to open a new account or I don 't know increase your visa or something like that not very often you actually go into things these days is it but you if you have gone into a bank or even if you call them up they have a very good CRM they have all the records with you and they will often say oh if it we see you have treble and Charles very house insurance with us which and then they note that you 'd say you don 't have life insurance and we 'll use it as a sales opportunity so when you 're a small business and you don 't have that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I started out remembering everyone 's name remembering what you done with them but they does get a point and if you do want to grow and you do want to you know make some money and make a difference and perhaps five people one day that you will need a CRM so it 's actually best to put this in place clearly on to keep a record of your clients and the interactions because if you want help at any stage even if you 're just having a busy month or you 're a little bit sick you enough and what 's it 'll like I am these save your bacon they really do there 's a record of you know here 's you bet she 's had a website built she 's done some social media there 's an opportunities do SEO she indicated she 'd like to do some training at some point you can pull that up when she called in and lock that there so in short customer relationship management system as it says on the screen is what companies used to manage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything every phone call every walk and every email and that might sound like a lot of extra work but actually they 're not too bad some you can set up that every time we send an email to that person it just records something so it 's not actually another step so I 've had this happen where I had to scale by business from a one-person business to a 12-person business and I 've got chamber Newcastle as well so a CRM and having it online means I can say you know what I 'm going to hand these clients over to you and rather than sitting down with a cup of tea and saying this is what you need to know about them I can just say everything is lost in the CRM and they can pick up off the last email and go hi I 'm tomorrow I 'm the new Account Manager I 'm going to be looking at you now I can see here you 've spoke to Yvette last of June we spoke to about these things how about we move this along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome ok I think most companies need them actually but out of all the systems we usually the system that businesses don 't have they might have all sorts of words being but they don 't have a Ceram and it 's crazy because it 's really important so why different businesses might use the Arians let me paint it too in a few different colors a retail hospitality business might want to sell em to improve their customer service to remain competitive so can you imagine if someone comes to restaurant actually recorded an interesting thing and it might sound like overkill but what their favorite wine is and what sort of thing they ordered and what party they came with and if they start coming regularly to go event will it be the Shiraz again or to say will you be note you often like chicken dishes I 'd like to make somewhere of a new chicken dish that we 've got House officials do I feel as the customer with that level of personalization theorems can do that for you by seeing that someone frequents you often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such invite them to official Christmas function send them a voucher on their birthday and so on I notice that one of the local surf clubs does that every single birthday and it 's simply using a system that long samsara a business owner retiring is going to find these sterian pretty valuable that middle slot because I have recently bought another company and unfortunately in that case it wasn 't a theorem now we did get a bit of a handover and she had some notes but had she had every interaction logged in the CRM it would have been a lot more valuable and useful to me and help me provide a more continual service to those clients so a few any of you have designs on one day selling your company and selling it for a lot of money start a CRM now keep good notes and every time you 're like are kind of doing it reminds Death Note it makes the company more valuable and then a startup really should record it because as I said it 's more about scaling so when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone and just a pipe climber to help me and to be able to say look up such-and-such in the CRM you 'll see my notes it 's so much faster than pulling that out of your phone and off your email and mobilizing something through them which then becomes really hard to actually get help because you 've got to do so much work to give them the work to get to get help with that make sense so I love you to Texan do you currently have a CRM and if so which system comes out to share some systems we like so I 'm curious to know before I tell you about the full system maybe you already know about them let 's see what you have to say no one texted yet just seeing what 's coming through just say no system if you don 't have a system okay here we go nothing official Dean scissors just sitting up top spot that 's a pretty heavy-duty kind of one but it 's quite good melissa has been slightly at the moment that hasn 't said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so all manual data entry yeah but if they want to save time on that so first up I want to take you through the world of CRM which are going to help you improve your customer experience so to start the ones on the screen are pretty much ones from the Google environment so a lot of you have heard me say I personally really like Google I 've chosen to hang out in that environment I 'm not saying you have to I 'm just saying here some solutions if that 's what you choose to do we used to use Street comms we actually heard about it at a Google conference we were loving it we loved that it actually simplifies as Dilton to your Gmail so rather than go off to a separate CRM you can do everything from your Gmail such a quite email based in the way in the AIDS prospective and current customers it 's a really good solution in their Jack their prices up to 40 US per user and we felt that was a bit much so we went shopping funnily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Google 's numbers they are number one CRM as well so I guess these guys kind of complete they 're actually more expensive but they have more features so today we 're using cross the works and we 're loving it sorts of features we love our that it integrates with zero so if you talk to someone and then you say yep they want to quote we 'll set up some triggers that once we move them to be quoted section it creates a contact file of zero so that saves on some data entry it does have that feature where if you send an email to them at drop the file notes until their file without having to manually do that and a bunch of other cool stuff so pretty good ones have a look at it now if you 're in the Microsoft world and you anticipate staying there leaving some good solutions so Dynamics 365 is when I know counselor moving to and even big organizations like the council often have lots of sort of pseudo CRM is going on you know people have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else can access them and there 's no sort of you know efficiency and retrieving those and things so dynamics 365 is a good solution if you want terraeum and you want to say in the Microsoft environment also worth noting that they brought out last December only about six months ago Outlook customer manager I can 't say I 've used it because I don 't use Outlook but for either of these Microsoft products as you know we 've got some new customers and webinars to and should probably be more than happy to answer questions and the Facebook group for the live lock program if you 're doing the full program you get access to that next up is and slightly on CRM options and I know one of you mentioned that you already use it it 's a good cheap solution it 's got lots of great integrations which is what I 'm always looking for so in this example doesn 't matter whether you 're a Google person or as Microsoft service and it integrates Sox and project management stuff within it too so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's relevant to them and it 's not a feature that you can put in a context email address and provide us that 's what they use for social media it 'll pull up their social media profile related to that address so that can be really handy where it goes you might have seen online that it said I was in Bali recently and so next time you talk to me in prospective customer I see just get from Valerie how was your holiday submit to put that little nice personal touch on it again got reports from an app some of you if you are on the road doing sales often you might want to get a CRM that has that feature or if you 've got team out on the road and you want them to be selling and keeping good records not coming back to the office and typing them all up they could be doing that on one of these apps it has a mobile solution which Muslims do now this one sounds for no serán presentation would be complete without mentioning Salesforce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theorem they 've been in this game for a long time I first looked at them about 2008 and at the time my impressions were pretty cool but to overcome my team wouldn 't use it it didn 't have a nice interface and it costs too much money for me at that stage my business now they 've sort of gone from being quite enterprise and perceived as expenses to having some SME or small to medium enterprise solutions so they start at 28 a month so is it something to break the bank and that solution is called desk you can get a free trial set to use go check it out pike drive is another one that 's quite popular we looked at it quite seriously it works in was a lot of stuff so that was attractive starts at 10 the user per month so that 's attractive really easy user interface I put a mate and real estate on the bold close to uses this to keep track of all his leagues and he loves it and he hits access to food once this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule to streak to prosper work so we 'll use them and I rode them quite intimately this one like some of the others allows you to customize the look and feel so you can put your company logo up your company colors that feels like you 're on something that you own again it pulls in social media profiles you can tag your contacts with whatever custom fields make sense to your business and it 's also got integration with lots of other software 's that we 'll be mentioning through this program like zero and smale jump and so on so what I really like is that I can pull up a client file on that one and go so much my name is Susan spent with me over what time frame and when did their life still go out and it 's only 12 a month us as well which is pretty good I mean US Dollars do hurt for any subscription when the dollars high against the Aussie which it is at the moment but it 's not always the case okay Zoho CRM I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll mention it again they do have a CRM as well you 'd probably only go this way if you really were going to go in boots or and all 2-0 perhaps what I know was one that dimensions I haven 't got that in slide deck collective literally go all night showing you example after example I just picked the collection that I 'm quite familiar with that I know work well that I think are suitable for small to medium businesses that suit the visible environment or the Microsoft environment and it come at a low price point which is what usually small businesses are looking for I 'm up foot is good it started off super expensive we became a partner of them in 2008 but no about 1,500 a month back then I could coming to Australia about 2 or 3 years ago they thought their prices down dramatically Dean maybe share if you haven 't already what a two months is going to set you back for that theorem but it 's got lots of other amazing features as well as for right moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing with me with the technical difficulties but let 's look at what is live chat so this can help with custom experience and what we were fighting as a company is that people expecting shorter and shorter response times they 'll send an email didn 't get back to them in two hours or four hours they 're barking mad and sometimes you 're literally in meetings or on some other proposal or scheduled work so it 's really hard to get back to them and you do your best where where thought sort of 24 hours was pretty good response time we realized oh we 've got an offer something better that 's what the customers want so we 've now implemented live chat I 'm going to show you some options for live chat I presume you all know what I mean but different to that chat what I showed you eat earlier because it does require someone to manage the live chat system to turn it on like they would switch on the phones of the morning and to basically check it so some people go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what 's the cost of the people you 're losing and how much admin and why are you so busy because you 're responding to emails and phone calls or supply and possibly this might minimize them get them there when they 're hot in fact the deal and make it a yay or a nay as whether they 're going to continue on the customer journey with them and in terms of being responsive and helpful and whatever brand values you want to have live chat can really help but here 's a bunch of live chat systems you could check out in the interest of time I 've just done one slide on that we are currently using Tokio it 's kind of fun you can see when zebra online what country and what page they 're on and start up a conversation so it probably really freaks them out because I 'm going on there hey it looks like you 're on a website page we 're in the market for a new website and some people engage in some pop straight and it freaks them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra leg room for service so there 's a bunch you can check out live persons been around a long time it 's probably one of the more advanced ones but all of these essentially are for small to medium businesses and typical features of Live Chat is a screenshot of our talk to live chat from the back end you can go on our website see it from the front and you can customize what that looks like but as I said you can see the location of them what page on your website they 're on you can prepare canned responses so if you 've got someone from your team who to know the answers to everything safer ask that website 's just in unless if they ask about something else to skin them that and you can customize it and this reporting so how many people did you speak with what was their level of interest look quite good for evaluating with a live chat is a good process is benefit thing because even if it 's free it 's costing you obviously in your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you don 't do you think live chat would be a good idea for your business probably depends a bit on whether you 've got a website and whether you 've got high traffic volume but even if it 's low even if a hundred people going to website if you pretty much have a job that involves sitting on a computer and now I 'm in someone talk to you if you by yourself I 'm you might really appreciate that interaction I 'm not sure the platform I 'm coming into your shop so up to you I 'll just switch over they have a going without signs and visual so what you guys have to say well gosh if it 'll lit me totally working out of you I should not have done that okay back to that okay I 'm on a free basic package until I know how much more I know now needs differently to me but haven 't implemented yet must do okay very good moving on and thanks for sticking with me sore about on time next up let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what the phone of course I offer a good experience on phone but what do they ring do they ring a landline so much do you pay for that who looks after that do you answer it do you have someone answer it for you in your office or do you outsource the answering of it or do you even use online technology like VoIP voice over Internet Protocol which can make it really cheap do you do caller profiling you know whether it 's a new lead or a current proof prospect and we should answer based on it is to record the calls for quality and insurance services which you often hear people say when you call their company and does it display local phone numbers even if you 're not in that area to make you look more national or international so all these things are possible via phones and technology again it depends how far you want to take it some systems even as it says can track keyword seek among Google AdWords and when they click on that and come through you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicked on your ad and then they called you that 's pretty cool isn 't it that is totally possible so yes we do use an online call system our experience was that we had one landline then we had people in Newcastle when you were extending us in how are we going to do it we 've got some telecommunications professionals and they tried to sell us these elaborate expensive systems they gave us some feel about how great they were and then headed for the price I forget what it was was in thousands and we said we just don 't do that this is crazy we 're a small business so we went and looked at these online ones and they pretty much take that technology that comes in this hardware and you have it online so our front line person and Newcastle she opens up a computer and she does answer the phone but it 's coming by the computer so everything is long and I love that she can have a conversation with someone an entire conversation about what they want and informed me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background and this is what they said and it 's really good to when you know client saying she 's their t-shirts they 've sort of stuff so what we chose to use was called tracking metrics overall it 's pretty cool our favorite feature is that search thing so people search say dog grooming it 's a unique number the cool ring through your business and then we can track exactly how it performed and that 's only good if you 're going to do Google Adwords and want to take it all the way this is what it looks like from the back end so you can see who called and whether it came through Google paid or YouTube or something else and all sorts of details so it gives you the ability to record assign messages it integrates with our CRM prosper work so literally if a new lead calls em on our phone it would get pushed across the works and then one of our account managers would pull them back the fact we can see the source is awesome so we 're having a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain sailing we are looking at maybe moving to one of those other systems then call tracking metrics so it 's what 'm principle it 's just a bit buggy we 're finding all of a sudden so do you can we use any online phone software if so which system and why and if you don 't use it could you look into this what it suits your business is another question in the interest of time I 'm going to keep going and I 'll come back and revisit that text chat when we do questions because we 've just got a couple more slides out of all this customer experience stuff I wanted you to know that there are jobs out there to the stuff so most of you are in your own businesses but again just in terms of the seeing technology it 's where things are going data is being collected on customers people are needed to analyze that data people are needed to implement lis systems people needed to train people in these systems and literally now jobs on seeker asking for people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Sunshine Coast company Food Matters you may or may not know it so that saying they want someone with desk which is the Salesforce solution and what someone with live chat they want someone with ringcentral which is one of those online postings and social media and websites so they are doing they 're using those systems and they specify and you 've got to know how to do those and you know you 're going to manage their agents and all that kind of stuff so isn 't that interesting another interesting local case study I pulled out for you as UE so a lot of people here on the Sunshine Coast know that there are really successful company but the very fact that their brand value they 're called gooey and the fact that I 'm sure you 've seen in the advertising we get you as it has up there says to me that they are a customer centric business which works in their favor the scaling very quickly and with much success they 're going from something like 1,500 staff to 3,000 staff here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on now their way of handling customer experience is very custom one you can go on their website and as you can see here to put interface so it 's not working cool so they 've really thought about that customer journey and then they 've made it very black and white and then what they want you to do though and how they want you to interact they 've made them green so you can do call we can start a quote for you from quite by phones but either way they 're getting in to do one of those things so what I know about this team is they don 't actually use any of these systems that I just introduced you to as far as I know they actually hire a team of text and they build that stuff from the ground up specifically for their business which is also a really cool option if you 've got a big budget and a big company but the other thing I think is really good about what they 're doing is they 're very transparent so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can discuss share and tell what your feedback was and they actually a very transparent with 53,000 comments in the last 12 months maintaining a 94% satisfaction level because of a good customer experience is an actual good on them so final bit of homework if you 're not already using systems to manage no experience research some of the systems outlined tonight they might be the specific systems or they might just be the principle like live chat doesn 't matter if you don 't use one that 's on the screen that I provided go and use what if you want try it up do a trial it doesn 't matter it just doesn 't work out you go it 's not for you give it a go so try them out and evaluate the suitability and that may involve a discussion with your team or other business advisors or the mentors you 're going to have to consider things like your budget and even if there is a time or a money thing though don 't forget what improve customer experience to be the customer retention some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't sort of put a double on that in a way all right I 'm open to questions now but I just want to make the comment we always um leave off reminding you about the lidless program and that you can access mentors and private Facebook group and that that would have some feedback that with the mentors some of you feel intimidated by them because you look at their profiles we go wow that 's just so amazing why would they want to put someone like me and what I even understand them so I talk to someone like them I want to encourage you to forget that we have picked them because they are able to not talk Tech and you were allowed to say sorry I don 't understand you if at any time they do and most of them are gracious and they will say sorry sorry to do that here let me try to explain it another way so again don 't try and get stuff sorted and then go see them if you 're not getting around doing this stuff go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the program and you know get them to help you design a customer journey or talk about what other systems your business could be using we 'll talk about how to bring them together we had a woman got new names you might even be online tonight she went and sat down with one I need lots to do systems and some of the challenges she was facing because he she wanted to do it but she had people within the organization who were pretty resistant to change so he kind of talked you through how to went through that so please do use them do comment and question and the private Facebook group this program is not going to go forever webinar nine we 've only got three more left so you really must start hooking into these mentors they have actually ran me some of them and said why aren 't I getting more mental sessions like that I don 't know I keep telling people to use you I 'm going to remind them again I said on the next webinar so that 's my plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me type them in the text area okay Melissa says no fine system thing then could you go back to a list of cool systems I can deem I will get these slides up in their arms what you call it the online resources portal for this program so you can access them as you 're part of the program at any time Melissa says no live chat that due to a small team is unlikely for us but we 're fairly quick on Facebook message well that 's a really good point too we did cover Facebook message under level 3 communication alternatives there 's lots of movement towards that Facebook keeps rolling out more and more stuff in Facebook messages so absolutely that 's a way to improve the customer experience and I would say that you really should be making sure you 're answering those because people expect it Melissa speed depending on call volumes get me or one of my team members or these thinking speaking think on our feet virtual and Administrative Service to professionally answer your calls respond to emails etc and to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she city relations of virtual assistants so she 's saying she would like to help you so Melissa feel free to do a little shout out in the Facebook group if you 're doing the full program and you should to get the full value from this and maybe people will catch you up we just used to have a call center now we have some ones that we have answer our phones and health but for a time that was really valuable just so we could get our work done and get messages through and look at the volume and work out the nature and keep streamlining the business Liz have sent to doing some of those yeah systems so thank you Liz you noted them down obviously good on you good student Melissa said how do we contact them have one but isn 't always available do you mean for a virtual assistant Melissa looks like you guys are chatting mostly what system you think you 're moving to instead of call tracking metrics don 't know actually kept my business partners been doing the research on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the things can it obviously keep you guys up to date with one Facebook group so happy to Joe said tried to contact a mentor but unfortunately they were too busy to assist that 's good feedback Joe they do have the prerogative if they 're going to a particularly busy catch to say that they are too busy however I 've literally got other mental so I haven 't heard from anyone let me help that particular mentor was much black so you could try him I don 't know which mentor it was you were reaching out to please do let us know by dropping us an email so we can reach out to let men to remake sure there 's a lot available for the duration of this program and because they need to be removed or anything like that Melissa C 's would love to mentor on the VA I asked how to contact level up mentor okay so to contact the level up mentor you need to be doing the full level up program which I 'll show you how to do in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got that assigns to the online resources portal and there 's a page about requesting a mentor you basically fill in the form and they get sent that and then together you 're a range of times do that on phone or in person if you wanted to be a mentor if I 'm misunderstanding that so on the mental page and submit and sidelight for their mentor we do have a bit of a mandate from counsel however to choose those that are digital champions sort of been recognized by Queensland Government 's being pretty savvy did you leave the good thing means they 're vested in a way but that 's why I also emphasize don 't be intimidated they 're still really down to earth really friendly people who can help you with this program and just making a business or digital which is what this is all about alright I 'm going to flip back to the slides and just quickly run through cake and join the program if you want to and my why you might want to why it 's not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentors as I 've said most people would cost 200 bucks 300 bucks at times go see for an hour you join the program for tu-95 you can go see them not just once but multiple times so you 'd be mad not to if you join the program you also get access to our Facebook group who 's over 500 people who have done our training many of the live lap program people in there you can ask questions you can connect with others you can collaborate you can offer your services it 's not a big advertising fest but if it 's relevant like this week we are talking phone systems and custom experience if you 're a virtual assistant go for it go and promote your session there so our next webinar is next week it 's on customer satisfaction systems we 've got a great local business to set up a whole startup around that and he 'll be taking the session and then two more after that and once you believe with watch for all the webinars there 's also one more workshop coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the live life program website that 's the link on the events page super easy so we just told last week that one there and we 're now moving into the next one which is customer experience and satisfaction system sorry it 's custom experience in here it 's what it says on the screen 15th of August 9th or 30 would love to see there again register there is a cost if you 're not doing the program of 75 you are doing the program you

webinars across a range of different topics as part of this program if this is your first time to attend one of our webinars for the program the little up program is an initiative by Sunshine Coast Council heavily subsidized by them and helping small and medium businesses connect where possible to the NBN which is coming to the Sunshine Coast or where possible to upgrade faster internet so that you can use some of the amazing online technology and digital tools available to businesses so throughout this program we cover various different areas of the digital wealth with the idea being that wherever you are in your business journey from a digital perspective that you can move up a level learn something new and hopefully and ultimately improve productivity profitability and efficiency within your business so this is me my name is Katrina left I am a partner in the creative collective our company was successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop and facilitate this program Sunshine Coast businesses my background I had very humble beginnings in our company as a intern way back in about 2007 these days I 'm actually a partner in the organization and we operate on a national basis in the creative space specializing in digital marketing I 've got a graphic wine background but I very much diversified my degree across communication and marketing subjects these days I work in our business mainly from an Operations perspective and I very much take a lead on the financial and accounting side of the business as well also worthwhile to mention that I worked in the accounting industry for a number of years as a marketing manager so I know this content very well as well I 'm in very good company tonight with Melanie Jacobson who is the owner of Sunshine Coast accounting firm mjj accounting and business solutions Mel is a total gun at what she does she has been a business owner from a very young age and has definitely got some great credentials under her belt including a number of different positions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year in 2008 for the Sunshine Coast business Women 's Network and calendar a business Person of the Year in 2009 so over to you Melanie to fill in the gaps and introduce yourself to our audience nice hi everyone I 'm Melanie I 've been accountants for 17 years and my passion is working with small business owners to understand their numbers and to help them take the pain out of bookkeeping and financial stress so that 's why I 'm quite passionate about the topic we have tonight so if you have any questions through the time just feel free to ask absolutely so we 'll be keeping an eye on the chat throughout the webinar tonight guys guys and girls should say what we 'll do if anything 's relevant at the time you know I mean chat through your questions as they arrived we don 't answer them throughout the presentation there will be question time at the end to make sure that they are all covered if you 've got any technical issues this evening in terms of sound issues or we drop out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do our best to rectify it I do have a backup recording going as well as if we do have any issues with this recording we can of course fix it up for the online the online version so over to I guess the topic of online accounting and payroll so tonight guys you 're going to learn about you know the different online accounting and payroll options available out there you know we 'll give you some tips in terms of what to look for when selecting a system we 'll look at options for online payroll roll and some of the benefits also of doing your online coding or online invoicing online and some of the cool things and features that you can do with that such as Auto reminders integrations etc so lots of cool stuff to cover tonight this really is an introduction to the subject some of you will know parts of the content hopefully learn something new and our webinars continue over the the next couple of months we will delve deeper into some of the things that will touch on this evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting really it 's been around for a number of years but the last five years is when it 's really taken off and it 's using rather than the old days where you had your mild QuickBooks on your desktop and one person access it or a couple of people in the firm access was meant to send it to an accountant or someone outside the office you had to do it back off and then no one could work on it whilst you were doing it we now have online systems where you can have people from all over the world accessing your data when you give them permission which means that from an accountants point of view we can give you real-time information rather than just basing our information on historic data because we are waiting for information to come to the office and if you 've got a question you can phone us and someone can help you on the spot so online accounting it 's the big value in it is it 's real-time reporting for business so you can see exactly where you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has enabled at ease of reporting so there 's so many things which we 'll go through tonight such as Bank feeds and tracking expenses all those sort of things which I 've done which are time-saving for you as a small business owner to be able to produce your own financials for smaller businesses now they don 't need to help us a bookkeeper as much they can just get help once before too rather than having someone in every month business systems are based as user friendly that people with no accounting experience can use them to the be quit yeah absolutely and you touched on the fact that you can give various different people access and permissions such as your accountant or if you do have a bookkeeper or accountant you can assign an access to your online accounting platform and you know control what information they can access in there through permissions etc so if you needed to give team members or colleagues certain access to certain financial generally you 're able to do so so put more control in your hands as a as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we consider online accounting system what are some of the benefits you know that most of your clients you know these are important factors and when they come to you and say you know set me up with an online accounting system the biggest dish the biggest benefit they see is that they can access it 7 from anywhere they are so if I travel I travel a lot each year and no matter where I am I can see exactly what my business is doing because I can log on as long as I have internet the other thing is the admin time they say if there are so many new features in there that just makes it easier for them to keep up to date and the ability to get assistance like if they need to ask their book people a question or the accountants they 're not trying to explain what they 're seeing on their screen we can log in and we can both be looking at the same screen at the same time also there are so many features in there with rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a staff member helping you that you can cut those errors down by creating the rules and that which will one cut down the time that they need to do things that are also ensure that things are done the same way every time which is really big from my point of view in the time that you have to spend with an accountant to fix things up if it 's done the same time and then also you know you 're getting more accurate reporting yeah and all your things everything with the plugins that you can get so a plug-in is other programs that will talk to your zero it means that you can have the one program but your CRM your customer relationships system might talk to it and that so you 've not got the double-entry which we 've seen in the past where if you 're using something like mild and then you 've got a another system that doesn 't feed in so you 've got three or four different databases of your client information now a lot of the systems all fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set things up which is a huge saving for you yeah absolutely from my perspective as a business owner and using online accounting credit and wellness efficiencies in our business through things such as billing reminders so unlike old paper invoices where that you know if you hand write an invoice and you give it to your customer or your client let 's say if you were an electrician and you had a call out for example by issuing an online invoice you can also set reminders so that if they invoices on pay you know an automatic follow-up email is sent up to seven days 14 days one month thirty days you know whatever it may be that 's been one massive time-saving excuse me aspect in our business the other aspect which you touched on and I 'm sure we 're going to in more detail is the kind of rules we can create for transactions that are automatically feeding into your accounting software so rather than having to you know every time manually code it to a chart of accounts and match it to an invoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can anticipate you know what invoice see some income on your bank statement is going to be assigned to move based on matching so the amount or the client name so things like that that just create enormous efficiencies in your business and you know I think as a business owner you know makes this really valuable exercise so text chat and we 'd love to hear if you 're currently using an online accounting system in your business if so which system to use let us know if you have any you know bumpers with that is there any particular limitations that you found in it perhaps week instead of three rounds my views for those at the end likewise let us know what you love about them or if they 've created any you know really enormous efficiencies and your business we 'd love to know so like anything there 's you know obviously pros and cons to moving to an online accounting system take us through some of these smells from your perspective the best downside are moving to online accounting I found is security kept concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more online I don 't find that this bigger question whereas five years ago majority of people wouldn 't move online because of that and the companies that are offering this quite stripped with where they have the data and how they do the backups and that so that you don 't lose your information internet connections that can be an issue I know there 's programs such as my own where you can use either in the cloud or on your desktop so that program has sort of counteracted that issue for people whereas others haven 't so it is something to be mindful if you do have internet issues but I know that a lot of clients are going to NBN and that once they 're often going they are finding it 's better to use with the online systems staff change it 's just about teaching them it 's like any change of any system people are fearful of the unknown but most the majority of people I 've had that have change systems wouldn 't be back and I 've had a lot of clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just been blown away with how easy it is and they do an actual really good job with it the bank fees is probably the biggest winner and majority of programs actually use it and this just cuts down the issues that we 've had in the past or how many of you online tonight are business owners who use desktop but the trying to reconcile a bank account if you 've got thousands of transactions in a month and you can miss three or four transactions sometimes can be really difficult so it 's just touch that issue down but there is a fee for the program which people who 've been on desktop programs before that haven 't had payroll involved haven 't had to probably paid a fee every month for their systems because they haven 't got the upgrade but the benefit of the subscription is you know that your software is always up backed up and it 's also speech the program 's always up today the big upside as we talked about they ask that you are there 's a backup because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the only downside to going online is if you don 't do it properly like you have to spend the time and set the system up right if you don 't spend the time in setting it up right it 's going to be like your online systems it 's not going to give you the information you need so that 's where if you use the systems right and you start off small and then keep adding features on such as coding where it automatically closes things that then will cut down the human error so the more you can use what the systems are designed for the less human errors that can come into it which just saves your time in the end and it also means that if you 're not doing your own financial reports you can [Music] be confident in what 's actually happening absolutely because just a reminder from webinar 5 last week we covered up a little bit about bank feeds but just to recap on that we 've got the information on screen here if you weren 't on webinar 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 'd like to watch that one 's back so it was basically on online online banking we covered off things like bank feeds and across facilities and transact line quantum sales type stuff but basically Bank feeds that you automatically import account transactions into Xero and what 's really cool about these is some of those things we touched on so no rules in place you know the programs can be quite intuitive too much you know income or expenses to invoices or purchases within your online accounting software and things like that plus just this sheer convenience of you know those things speeds automatically learning in your accounting system on a daily basis as opposed to you know having to download and import statements and things like that which can be really problematic right now yes yeah and it just stops good data entry because people don 't realize how long it takes to enter all the information manually and you 'll find that majority of the programs online will have the direct feed I know that QuickBooks Online by of online and 0 or 3 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have different thank you count different ways to do it but if you look at the help menu or talk to your accountant or bookkeeper they can assist you with how to get it working so one thing to remember though that we see as accountants is a lot of people think that then they don 't have to do a bank reconciliation these are still coming I could say if something goes wrong with the bank fee your bank may not be reconciled or if there 's a coding error there 's lots of things that can go wrong systems do need to do a bank reconciliation every month just to make sure that your feeds are working correctly so we do see a lot of clients to think that they can skip that step sent on that so they get themselves into a little bit of a pickle yeah early so I think when we presented last week you know 0 for example which is one of the options we 'll look at in a couple of slides time but you know there was over 70 banks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with my online I believe there was over a hundred and so this is a massive area you know most exercise banks credit unions or sort of even payment gateways like the way or paste a PayPal will generally have a feed through to online accounting programs is what we 've found so if you 're not sure if you 're already using an online accounting program you can go to the health of those programs sort of see what banks see are available with that platform so we 're going to touch here on also follow-up of invoices and you know the the impact that is can have in your business from a cash flow perspective what you 're what 's your take on this Mel I think it 's fabulous because it makes it very easy I 've got clients that then hundreds of invoices a month because they might have lots of small amounts that are due they 're being able to automatically with a few tips send out a reminder it 's fabulous it 's still so just one thing to bear in mind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven 't paid and it 's getting to the second or third remind I 'll pick the phone up I know in my business that because often there 's a problem and people just forget to tell you so if you ring them it will help but this will help with the first two because a lot of times people just forget about it and they get the first reminder and they 're like okay I forgot about that let 's just get on to it and making it as easy as possible for people to pay and be reminded is the easiest way to do it absolutely so one online accounting platform that we 're going to be looking at in a little bit more detail tonight you know zeros my knowledge of Xero know is that they entered the de market and you know made really a massive impact as a disruptor because they sort of launched in as one of the first sort of online accounting systems is that correct yeah very started in New Zealand and New Zealand were a lot quicker adaptive than us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably the fastest growing at the moment so I am noticing the other programs and that are starting to catch up but zeros just it 's got so many user friendly features there 's two types of zero so there 's a zero that you can all get online which is where you 've got your payroll and your invoicing but as accountants we also have a cash product for those clients who you might be doing Excel spreadsheets at the moment and don 't need to invoice you just need to be able to record your income and expenses so those products started ten twenty dollars a month so they 're quite user friendly to just get started online and often clients will start on that and then as their business grew so I 'll go up to the next level of 0 but 0 has got lots of different features in it and if it 's set up right it can help you immensely with your business and it 's really user friendly we use Xero in our business and previously when I operated a franchise I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small business and a lot of my own bookkeeping etcetera and what I found they were incredibly user-friendly to use you know intuitive was sort of them you know with a little bit of mouse it was easy to sort of find my way around and know how to use it and you know as our business is growing over the years Zero 's been able to grow with us what one feature that I love about Xero is the information effort that integrates with so many different third-party systems with no website so that online orders can you know be you know you 've deposited into your zero account integrations with time tracking systems such as minute dot one that we touched on a couple of webinars back which is pretty cool so to sort you know if you 're a service based business sealing for time and you can integrate it with you know support tracking systems and things like that the reporting is fabulous as well yes okay next one sorry I think there 's a bit of a delay with my slide transition here but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at is my online and I know that I see Christine you 're using my Obon one and Maya they took a little longer to get their system in the cloud working well but it 's great now it 's got it working it 's the biggest benefit of mile over zero is that you can work on it on your desktop so you can take it out of the cloud and work on it and then put it back in the cloud so I know for a few clients that have internet issues they often Judy the biggest thing with all these systems is to talk to a bookkeeper or your accountant if you 're not sure as to which distance suits your business because I know for some of my clients my of the better system because you it 's got better infantry I prefer the inventory system in mail it 's got the new reliable online has bank feeds it has the help with decoding and all those sort of things that zero has it 's got the superannuation that you can do as well and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of features than that so that 's our it 's important that you talk to someone to go okay what best suits me mum some accountants will only recommend certain products but other accountants like myself are worth within the clients accounting system there 's only one or two that I wouldn 't work with but the online systems they 're all really good because I 've just noticed that link is run on the bottom of the screen so we 'll make sure that fixed up before we distribute slides and of course the fearful program participant there 'll be a list of all the resources that will be in portal as well including it also of just notice to Christine as mentioned that you can also take backups with mild as well and that she says she 's also said student stream is great yes super streams brilliant for both packages yes it just cuts down the arrow yep and just a quick question from Joe Joe has asked he says assume zero is IFRS compliance I think it is Joe a lot of that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure if your accountants giving you set up zero for you that I 've given you access to create those reports and the report bugs ok next one says that there is not one you see a watch around there it 's a great product it 's user friendly it 's very similar to the other products it 's probably it 's not what I 've used extensively with clients just because my Oban zero in the small business market seem to be a lot more prominent but it 's definitely one to check out if your accountants recommending it it 's slightly cheaper for things and it 's I know a lot of Chrisman accountants use this program whereas I haven 't seen as many Coast accountants using the program but it has the bank feed so it looks after all things that mortal medium businesses would need and including the GSG reporting oh all right wave this is one I 'm not so familiar with take us through this yeah so way that 's a good program so if you 're registered for GST this is not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and I often use it with clients too they 're just starting out in their business or they 're doing a hobby business and we do it with some of our not-for-profit that are smaller not-for-profit groups because it 's not it 's not it really handle the GST but it 's a great program to get started on and to give it a goal of doing the online accounting and yeah it 's very easy to use it 's user friendly you bank account feeds into it and it 's a free product so I also use it a lot to clients um and I know my staff do as well if you 're doing your personal budget we you want to see where the money from your personal bank accounts are going this is a free product so it 's great to try a new free props on your personal bank accounts and just check where where 's money going and what am i spending it on and they 've got some great reports here we can have a look at what you sent so all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question in terms of how you write QuickBooks as an online system as well Melissa for some of that off app QuickBooks Online it 's not too bad its cost effective to be honest this is a system I know it 's used quite extensively in America but the system 's got lots of really cool reporting features in it especially if you want to report different profit and losses per like job profit and muscles like if you 're looking at say for example I 've got a client who has a farming business and they have cattle and pigs and sheeps and we report profit and losses on each one separately and this handles it really well you can do it on my band 0 as well very easily but they 've been using this product and they 've been loving the data and that they can get out in the information and for someone who 's not ready like 0 and miles it 's 50 a month which for a very small bit for small business that can be a lot to start with this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better and better as more people are getting on board we 'll probably cover this off in a bit more detail shortly but all the cunning packages do they have the payroll option or to some other another 0 our main systems I use payroll on is the QuickBooks the miles and the 0 most people will use my oven 0 who 's like Christine said it 's that superstream will click super that 's really good in those programs but yeah they 're the three leading programs and the solution would have one as well I don 't haven 't used em for payroll ok cool guys just something that I 'll throw in the mix to think that as well that and I 'm euros not the only one to offer it that some of these other ones or as well but with zeros for our business we 've also been able to set up some custom reports through traffic filters so you know we can track revenue by staff members but we also have you know different ways that we track income and expenses and cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can you know run a report and see you know what income we 're driving from web development as opposed to you know social media marketing for example so if there 's a particular report that you in your business thing well I would love to be able to report on this or I 'd love know you know what my what my sales people are invoicing or whatever it may be whatever it is people on a crap talk to your accountant and as part of your due diligence for working out what online system you should be on and communicate those things from the very beginning so that they can sort of find the most appropriate system to suit your needs yep perfect and it 's just got a question here with the systems allowing you to run multiple small businesses through them each no systems are set up so that if you register you have set up separate files to separate businesses especially if one is registered for GST and one is registered for GST because they won 't know which transactions are for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for GST you might go for ways or something which is a free program whereas for the one that 's registered suggests here you might choose to use something such as a quickbooks online or a my herb or a zero file where it can track the GST and also help you with your and fast reporting if you survey books is just it 's mainly for a similar two ways I haven 't had a lot of people use this one this one 's probably got more features that integrate into it which is like people use it but people tend to stick to the main system but there is one that is cost-effective of small businesses starting up yeah well and just a quick question no one has specifically asked it but just in case anyone is wondering so I guess that you know part of my role as the facilitator is to you know think of things that might be people may want to know but you know do all of these options now have the options for bank feeds or is that only with the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ways you can import your bank statements so that one definitely does so how I 'm not sure about the food does I 've just had Christine asked about record so that 's one not to get confused with if you 've been around for a long time so wreck on used to have a license to run QuickBooks here in Australia how I understand it and then there was QuickBooks in America so there 's two different QuickBooks type products online one 's a wreck on which is the old QuickBooks and it 's exactly like miles and those sort of things that 's probably been my preferred program when we were desktop was QuickBooks or the rack on QuickBooks just because if you 're looking to do reporting it has the most user-friendly to drill down as an accountant and before we got all these online systems it was the easiest for clients to pick up and wreak on one that you 've asked a question about I 'm not I think that might be your starting which is more used by individuals I 'm not 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such so we 'd have to have a look at that one for you but I think that might be a starting record module which is your old sole trader record which would be probably similar to your wave Enzo and your zero ledger reporting program but I can 't guarantee that sorry and we 'll find that up for you and and get that feeling for that one yeah okay Gigi sorry fresh books is one it doesn 't have you GST and your bass reporting but it does have the interface for your invoicing and reports and all those sort of things it was actually one of the first one it was one of the early online systems that they had and you have to remember that in Australia where quite early adapters to adopters to online accounting like if you go to America their online is probably about ten percent of businesses whereas here it 's actually 40 or 50 percent well I mean I just I mean it 's probably a little bit ignorant on me but I sort of assumed that you know we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very surprising to hear that the adoption rate in America is actually so low fresh books is one that we actually so I mentioned that we as business use Xero and for a long time we used fresh thoughts for our online coding and online invoicing because of the automated reminders and follow up and what we loved about fresh books early on was that we could issue an online quote and it could be digitally accepted so you know the client acts this is the quote and they hit the accept button on screen and it 's basically you know digitally encoded that they accepted the time and days and who buy it cetera and so we used to integrate fresh books with Xero and so all of our transactions would automatically feed into Xero for accounting purposes we actually killed fresh books off about two years ago because zero sort of you know we 've been doing improvements etc you know and ticked all our boxes everything we then loved about fresh books people do from from zero but sorry to interrupt their mellow just sort of know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us through I guess where these visits in the market anyway it fits more for your small businesses and because it doesn 't have necessarily the bus and the ATO requirements it 's more for people that aren 't registered for GST the biggest advice I would give to people online tonight it 's to talk to accountants talk to your accountant or your bookkeeper or other people you know in business as to what systems they 're using for the fact that if you 've got a question or an issue with something it 's easier if someone else has been doing it as well we can help you because there 's so many programs out there and they all have different benefits and pros and cons according to your business and it 's hard tonight to go without knowing what everyone 's business is like as to which one will suit you but also if you want to work with a certain accountant some accountants only work on certain products some are open to all products I didn 't know there 's some accountants out there that still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sort of things more adaptable to different products now because we don 't have the fees to page and have all the products as previously we have to buy all the licenses to use the products but these products can save you time but you just need to get the right one for your business especially if you have inventory or you have lots of debtors or you want to measure certain things in certain reports it 's important you get the right products that will suit you then oh so this is a case study here local business Mullaney cheese tell us about these guys after these guys looked at all the different products and I looked at quick and rec on my of online and zero with their bookkeepers to look at okay which program was actually the best for them and to them it was my above the best for them so they stuck with my old and went to my online and it meant that they now can do their bookkeeping wherever they 're based if they don 't have to be at the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look at the file while they 're working on the file and they don 't have to stop while the accountants because of something and I don 't know about anyone else if you 've had the issue which I 'm sure Christine has had where someone sent for backup and you 've loaded the wrong one so then you 've been working on the wrong file so that 's all done away with now because they 're using my of online and everybody can access it at the same time and just on that phone I remember when I worked with the marketing manager for an accounting firm you know when clients have to supply them my own files in them massive filed you know zips I end up you know anywhere from two users to 80 megabytes so that you 'd be to email and you know clients would literally have to put them on a USB stick or you know a CD but in those days and use the CD one we knew but you know to actually physically take them in and hand it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file and work with it you know or use like you know large file sending programs and things like that so you know if those days are gone with online accounting yeah definitely and it could take like an old days it could take a week to get a client working by the time a CD came and then if something happened to the CD in the mail or they backed it up incorrectly then we 'd have to wait for another CD to be sent whereas now if you 've got a question I can just log on and quickly answer your questions without you having to wait to send stuff or I can because I have access to my clients series and QuickBooks anions I can log on if I think something 's happening and then give you a call and go hey I notice you 've got lots of debtors at the moment what 's happening is everything all right or I noticed you 're behind the people keeping do you need some help which means that we 're talking real time so that if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing tax planning so it means I can look and see if people have got a big bottom and go you know what we do need to have a look at something here so it just makes it user friendly very cool so guys just a little bit more work here if you 're not already using online accounting you know a little bit of research from webinar into you know which one might be suitable for you chat to your accountant what you 're a bit of a you know wishlist on what you would like your accounting program to do an ideal world what you know what we 're just I always use the term what would save your life you know you could just automate it or you know make that a really fast process you know what would it do for you in your business if you could shave off you know ten hours a week or ppm or you know what is that you know tasks when it comes to counting that you just love doing and you know put together a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it on your accountant to do some due diligence for you and make some recommendations as to an online accounting system and we 'd love to hear what they come back with and or what you come up with in your research if you 're on the Facebook groups at the full program to print and certainly let 's get the discussion going in there yeah and most people I 'd most of my clients save at least 10 to 20% of their time once they 're using the online systems correctly and if they get them set up correctly some are more so it 's worthwhile your time so I always like to bring this back to a cost factor as well that when you 're considering a program for 50 dollars a month and you know sort of cringing at taking on an extra expenses as small business what is your time worth if you freed up 10 hours per week is that you know 10 hours a week or even if it was 10 hours a month is that time worth more to you in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you might incur that 50 expense but you saving money in those efficiencies so I 'm certainly weigh that out when you consider the cost as well so online payroll let 's get into to this side of things because there 's probably lots of cool little things that people can do online right and that they may not have known about when it comes to payroll yeah and all the programs have like main players will have a payroll feature in their program and the biggest benefit of this is such it means that it cuts down on the typing errors so people doing manual books like then they go to type it into the accounting system so if you put a 959 instead of 95 well then you 've entered it wrong which then means when you type it into your online banking system you might type it wrong again so it cuts down those errors because that can be one of the issues in your business but no one wants to under pay or over pay their staff so making sure it 's correct especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things it 's really important and also it 's cutting down the time if you 've got ten employees writing ten payments which at the 30th of June is not fun whereas with the online systems and make them suggest okay well you can automate all of this so that then you know that the group certificate you 're giving out match what you actually paid once you 've done all the reconciliation and it 's easy for your accountant to give you a hand the guys with you know obviously loves to cater this content wherever possible to all of you who have made an effort to join us tonight so let us know in the chat how we currently managing your payroll so that we can apply this information to you where possible are you doing it in-house are you using a payroll service perhaps you 're not currently processing any payroll or have you know other other challenges in this area let us know okay so next online payrolls typically includes a range of different services take us through these mill so the main benefits of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right okay so the main benefits of what I touched on before is that ease of processing the other big thing is with a lot of these systems is it means that you 're not stuck like in the old days when they had some of the online some of the desktop system it meant that if you lost the staff members actually if you had a significant payroll system it was hard to find another person who could use that system to then take over really easily so that 's one thing that I find with these online systems more people can use it which means you 've got more options as an employer as to who you 're hiring or what bookkeepers you 're taking on to do what in your systems they can track all your holiday leads a lot of them can have a portal whether staff can enter their timesheet enter their leave request but cut down your ties and happen to do things also it cuts down the human error so if you 're using your payroll correctly where you 're entering it online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on last week was your ABA file which you can then upload to your bank to pay your employees it means that you 're not doing that data entry is that 's the biggest thing for me is the data entry is where people make the errors which can be the issue because it 's quite easy to try 459 or a 95 so that 's where a lot of people I don 't actually use it so I had a client only 18 months ago where I was there and I was mortified when they told me they still did they had 30 staff and they still paid them all by cash put it through the payroll system but yeah they still counted out everyone 's pay so their savings was significant much since we went to online payments and it meant that my job was easier at the end of you to do the pepper group certificates or the pay-as-you-go summaries because it was all reconciled what that actually paid was actually what went to the bank where our clients I have that manually enter it often will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff get confused and it also shuts down for as I 've had clients in the past where they would go and pay I had one significant case where the people was actually paying some person over time to herself whereas if we would have had the ABA and all that set up which wasn 't available back then that would have been to be done that should be done now can you explain a little bit more about what ABA is for those that may not know what you 're talking about there yeah sure sorry an ABA file is one where it 's a type of file that you export from your payroll system and then you import it into your online banking so some banks require to register to use the system but most of them just accept them now so it 's just a file that you 'll save to your desktop and then you import it and what it does is it just takes all the employees names their bank account details and how much you want to pay them and to what bank account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it all and then it 'll just produce it as sort of one transaction for you through your payroll systems which means then you see that one transaction comes so when you reconcile in your payroll it 's easier to reconcile through your bank account rather than having 30 separate lines for each employee all right so what about the cost involved in online payroll a lot of the systems now are including it in there cause I know 0 that 's probably one of its downfalls is if it does get more expensive the more employees you have whereas some of the others have more flat range it 's just looking and that 's where I come back to talking to your accountant as to how many staff you 've got and what you plan to do in the future because the program you have today might not be the best for what you 're fighting to do in five years time if you 're planning to triple in size so that 's or it 's sitting down with your accountant working out what you actually need and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got lots of different lines and that different programs might be better for you so it 's just working out if I know I 've got some people that have FCG and salary sacrifice and so many different things that sometimes some products are better than others to handle work yeah I mean all all these systems you know there 's a time and a place for them and these this content these webinars is about providing you with you know an objective view as to all the option on the market so that you 're a little bit more informed when you when you go out and do your own research so you know understanding what your key requirements are I 'm communicating them to your accountant or your poor people will help you identify which is the best one for you I 'm Joe I noticed you 're actually in the process of establishing your new business they let us know on chat there and you 've mentioned that you 're leaning toward zero or my op so probably key considerations you you know whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting what your needs may be in the coming coming years as well biggest tip out review people as well is to get your accountant or your bookkeeper to set your payroll up correctly from the start especially if you 've got staff that are salary sacrificing and those sort of things with the terminology and the help can get confusing at times so if you get it set up right from the start it makes it really easy and I know with what fact sheets the clients when they want to add add new employees so you can do it yourself after we do the initial but if we set it up correctly at start you 'll know that it 's feeding directly into your profit and loss and your balance sheet know sort of things so yeah it 's just it 's well it 's like money well spent absolutely and it looks like Christine you 're making that advice as well and she said on the chat that setup is an investment absolutely right so some account systems combine payroll and offer some of the features that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the the different features that we can see on screen and it probably is a good lead-in to our next slide on add-ons of your online accounting system yeah so you 've got flexible pay calendars so that that 's like so I 've got a client a moment who 's a financial planner so for them they do three pay runs in a month so they have the admin staff that get a fortnightly that 's got one staff member that gets paid on the first of the month and then they 've got their financial advisors that gets paid once a month so that 's the flexibility of these systems that they 'll allow us to do three different pay runs and it will only have the staff members that are involved in those pay run show up which help us with our management not to miss anyone but also after see in them multiple pay rates so if you 've got staff especially in the hospitality industry where they have their different rates it 's quite easy for people to then work out what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that built-in timesheet I know quite a few clients use that and they find it really easily especially with the retail industry where they 've got lots of young staff members who have different hours every week that makes it easy when they come to do their payroll employee leads well that 's a definite yes especially with Fair Work at the moment you need to make sure that you are accurately reporting it and all these systems will give your staff members of Haislip which is one of the requirements that you should do as an employer so that 's important detailed payroll reports that the reports that we used to reconcile things so that quite important if something goes wrong or there 's a mistake or someone questions something we can use the reports to actually pull out the information or if you 're having trouble with something reconciling the CDP us is the account and all your people to pick up where the mistake went and superstream I think we 're going to talk about a little bit later and now I 'm going to sleep yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points on here we 've we 've kind of touched on throughout the webinar but I 'm going to jump over here to check the add-on section of your accounting system some more online payroll system and other options so this is a screenshot from zero I 'm just going to exit my presentation mode and show you very quickly on my screen no zero add-on hope flavor I 'm something right here we just long as it sounds on Marketplace ml let me my it might be marketplaces and supplies so you can just do a simple google like this for whatever system you 're using even if it 's mail and see what sort of atoms are available and so you can come down here and you can search by function or your business type as well and you can also do a search up here as well so if you were looking for a dedicated time tracking type add-on you can search for time tracking and look for that up function and it will show you all the different ones available you 've got review as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that kind of thing so do check that out with the online system that you 're using and sometimes it 's surprising sometimes is a really cool add-on that you didn 't even know about so sometimes it 's just handy to actually have a bit of a browse through these and though well I didn 't even think that that could be a thing about that to be so useful to me and my business you know it 's amazing the time that you can save for some of those and a lot of them will feed into the top three m-my of your zero and your QuickBooks Online I 'm not sure with some things I think a lot of them are starting to feed into there but I know they 're feeding to the others so it 's just looking for what what you need I think the key at the moment is just asking people if you 've got something that you 're doing manually or something that you 'd like to speed up it 's just finding if there 's a cost-effective solution out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a little bit more about these because these are you know a bit of a game changer in the face of online and counting right when it comes to just making life a whole lot easier yeah so from first July last year you have to use a superstream product to pay your super to be compliant as an employee as an employer if you had employees other than the business owners involved but some people do the product a lot better than others so a lot of you might be using products with your super providers like some super and those sort of people if you 're on zero or viable look at that super products because for me I use zero for my personal business account and click see five means that I click one button it picks up all the staff super for that period that means to be paged I get a code to my phone I checked the coding and it 's that then then take some money from my bank account and sends it to the nine different super funds plus it sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shippers for and how its coded whether it 's salary sacrifice for its employer contributions whereas previously I had clients that would have its I had nine employees it could take them an hour to do the super by the time they wrote all the checks or went online and paid them sent the forms either email or fax to the different super funds the other benefit now is I 've actually got a report then that I can pull from zero to show the date I paid my super which means it 's the tax office ever questions whether I paid my super long time it 's there in black and white especially if you 're a director of a company or in a trust these are things that you 're personally liable that if you don 't pay your staff super in your page ago you can personally be liable for that not paid on time incorrectly and it 's probably the area I see the most audit from the tax office is employees who let the tax office know that you haven 't paid their super so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that it just will make your business life so much easier absolutely okay so that 's basically the end of the presentation tonight guys losing lots of questions coming to on chat throughout the webinar but if you 've got any other questions we 've got a couple of minutes before we wrap up I am going to just give you a quick run through some of the other things coming up with the level up program so while I do that feel free to

know company procedures online system we have Dropbox Google Drive Google Sites etc so it 's basically about how you can sort of take you know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into online systems for staff so that was pretty cool one level eight is one of my personal favorite topics which is on automations and how you can get some of your different different business applications speaking to each other which is really cool I love this stuff it 's another way to find amazing efficiencies in your business by you know just getting multiple programs communicating together and thinking data which is really really cool level nine we look at some centaur Rams and PBX phone systems etc level 10 is more about customer satisfaction creating online survey tools and more level 11 we move more into online learning management system so that won 't be relevant to everyone but if you 're you know a service based business or someone that tried to see your time axis alternate cetera you know you

long period of time from not so big issues to absolutely most tragic of circumstances the more you talk about it the more you open yourself up to learning and education from other people 's journeys and it actually does help everyone it 's okay to talk about natural welfare and to ask for help [Music] in 1995 I moved up here and I knew this lovely man called Philip and we ended up getting married and having two lovely children and we had a great life simple life but you know it was beautiful so I just thought we were going to grow old together and on Father 's Day eight years ago I found him collapsed in the bathroom and I midnight returning of his life-support and I look it was just such a great shop and he was clinically dead from an aneurysm then I became a single mum widows with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean had everything lost through hurricane we 've lost absolutely everything canned it was a couple of years before we even got to rebuild again and we lost our jobs we lost everything and so it was a very tough I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was in university back in my early 20s I was living a pretty hectic lifestyle at the time I was trying to you know burn the candle at both ends had an overloaded study was working 30 to 40 hours a week and also managed to fit in quite a healthy social life at the time to closer years ago I was diagnosed with mild depression applying a relationship broken I 'm not surprised there for your common story for a guy doing that shortly after that I ended up being diagnosed with prostate cancer so a bit of a double whammy and that got me thinking about where I was heading and there were some pretty dark days and then I have a family member who has suffered from post-traumatic stress for nearly three decades I started to have physical symptoms I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were becoming numb my extremities were losing sensation and so that actually started to worry me even more I 've been through a couple of bounces serious bouts of anxiety depression in the past and got through them and I think I 'm fine a normal type person I went to a really dark place quite quickly and I didn 't I really got to I didn 't really have that set for I really want to wake up in the morning and I didn 't really care that much there are so many side effects physical side effects from mental health that the longer you 'd leave it like the worse those side effects are I 'd wake up in the morning middle of the night three o 'clock in the morning and heart rate moves up and um I 'd be hot and I 'd be sweaty and I 'd be numb and I just thought well I 'm going to die it wasn 't till only a couple of years ago I actually had one of these attacks at work the couples are my work colleagues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor said you just had a panic attack seen any it rippled throughout every part 7 yeah it 's pretty hard to go to work some days here this could go to work in those last years I lost our three good friends to suicide and they didn 't reach out at all I was at the point where I was considering taking my life and a couple of things happened at that point and I realized what this is it 's not the answer once I realized that it was probably the easiest thing to do with cigar mask the garcy kill I did see the doctor and and then went and spoke with a psychologist just so I could learn more about the condition or the the anxiety and how I could manage it through exercise and having a heightened understanding of what it meant help is there it 's available when you can get you get so much better so quickly but you won 't while ever your bottle things up inside and thanks seek help and help is there definitely seek help really important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love your close to is suffering go to the doctor and EAP is an amazing opportunity free for Styles like our amazing self and your family to actually go and talk to people help is out there and and people love and care about you and they want you to be enjoying your life and they want you to be well and I think that we talk more about it if we share our stories more you know you take away that feeling of isolation and loneliness that people can feel when they experience a mental illness the sorting psychologist had some help and not that long I 'm feeling good again on top of the world anxiety or depression is completely normal it 's a disease no different to diabetes it 's no different to many other things out there I know for myself if to feel good I need to exercise I exercise daily and bike sizing daily it keeps me physically fit gives me physically well I was put on some medication and and it settled it down and look at the rarity now that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come through it in the end it was talking to friends and I think for me it was exercise definitely exercise like walking along the beach it doesn 't matter walk take the dog for a walk she got a dog she got a puppy so that was one of her ways of getting rid of the isolation and having her own little beautiful puppy to look after I released an E or a come away of coming back was triathlons so I 've grabbed that by the throat I 'm just like everyone else go to good times bad times nothing special than going it happens this program is called fresh mind and I 've been thinking about that last week or two what that actually means to me and for me the fresh is it 's if you 're going through tough times then take this opportunity and get a fresh start good mental health provides a sense of well-being confidence and self-esteem it allows us to fully enjoy and appreciate other people day-to-day life and make the most of our wonderful Sunshine Coast lifestyle when we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach our potential and deal with life 's challenges however sometimes life can be hard the day-to-day pressures such as our finances supporting our family and the work stressors can take their toll both physically and mentally part of the change that councils fresh minds program is trying to affect its having open conversations about mental health the second part is educating ourselves on how to spot the signs of mental illness in ourselves and in each other and knowing how to respond appropriately doing this will go some way to creating a workplace and wider community that is compassionate and considerate of those experiencing mental health concerns so let 's work together let 's support each other and let 's keep our health in mind you [Music] [Music]"

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome to tonight 's webinar we 're up to webinar for or level 4 on the amazing level up program a digital upskilling program offered to you by Sunshine Coast Council

them very aware of it so I won 't keep you long but some of you might have just seen this webinar somewhere and thought that it 's quite good I 'll jump on that and if that 's the case want to @ @ @ @

to compete on a national or international level affects what you want to do so we 're very excited to bring this to you tonight my name is Yvette Adams for those of you I haven 't met before I won 't talk to you too much about myself because there are other BIOS asthma and other sessions but the accent you hearing the Kiwi one I 've seen in business a long time started six businesses and sold to does my first acquisition of a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running three businesses so the creative collective is a digital marketing company here on the Sunshine Coast training collective digital skills training organization also based here on the Sunshine Coast both of those companies are doing business all over Australia and internationally though and we 're proud to be Sunshine Coast businesses with lots of team here and a wood tub comm which is an online business Awards portal that you can find business awards to enter so my company successfully tended to develop and deliver this program we 're always very open to feedback first-time program like this has been put together but we hope that this format webinars short one hour and whether you 're listening is live tonight or watching the recording thereafter hopefully find that one hour to learn and find out some new cool tools and ways of doing things that you can apply to your business and move forwards so I 'd now like to introduce you to Ben and I find there 's a people at points on the screen I won 't read those out because you 're all more than capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight thank you vets thanks for having me my problem so I couldn 't think of a better person on the coast to ask to be our topic expert on the session than you because you absolutely live and breathe video stuff don 't you absolutely it 's what we do every day in the business but also what I 'm really passionate about and one of the things I 'm particularly passionate about is educating others about how to use video effectively so yeah good fit Thanks thanks for inviting me no worries going to a free and know you 're a busy guy and how long have you been in this video thankful I could say all my life I 've been passionate about video since my my dad basically had a an old VHS video camera from when we were very young but to skip ahead a few years um I started the business about eight years ago and since then from a base of video production working with everything from weddings through to small businesses producing video content we now really specialize in online video and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the short history thank you yeah there 's many years convinced in most instances many experiences and the other thing probably worthy of note which are I 've actually left off here but I know we definitely put it in the outgoing marketing about tonight 's session you 're also a digital champion for Queensland government which is why we also sought you with more than worthy recipient of this tell us about that and maybe anything you 've been doing it since you 've become a digital champion yeah sure so the digital champions program is I 'm one of quite a few on the Sunshine Coast actually of being recognized now which is a really great thing for the Sunshine Coast really says a lot about the ecosystem we haven 't up here but effectively the program is all about helping or championing people who are focused on helping businesses become more digitally savvy and that 's something obviously we do for profit in the business but it 's also something that I 'm have been over the last couple of years really consciously doing well you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I run monthly webinars myself on online video strategy and they 're free to attend run regular face-to-face workshops as well and also about to launch a podcast focused on storytelling for business so that 's some you know fits into digital skills as well so you know that that 's the kind of thing I 'm doing with creating content to hopefully educate people right so I 'm sure you 'll let everyone know if they 're keen on finding out more about what you do and how they can do more learning and video if they feel that this is a good fit to their business or let them know of some options later tonight weren 't we absolutely yes cool so I referred to the content I get the boost good question that I asked is why video so I went and grabbed some stats about video but I mean these stats are pretty hard to keep up with aren 't they then can you read a lot others that blow your mind even though you work in the space all the time look it changes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's a digital consumer and particularly on social media will see more and more video pretty much every time they log on so in that social media space in particular the stats are mind-blowing something like on YouTube alone there is something like four years worth of content uploaded every on youtube so i mean that 's just overwhelming for most business people but I think that there 's pros and cons to that and I think they even though these stats on the screen are overwhelming what that says to me is that video is where we need to be playing in business we can 't ignore it and it 's something that if we that if we do ignore then it 's potentially the peril of growing our business and staying up with what 's going on in the world today because I guess we could say well there 's that much video going up why would I bother creating video I 'm just going to be a tiny pebble in a sea of huge amounts of information but there are a lot of compelling reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so let 's look at those so I mean producing video has become a lot easier and I think those two pictures really do tell paint a thousand words um you 've written pro or con though what makes you say that Ben so I think this is at the real crux of what we can talk about tonight and hopefully by the end of this webinar you 'll see video as a as a pro for your business but potentially the idea that video has become easy to produce can be seen as a negative like you said it 's overwhelming the ease of production of content so the fact that you 've got a high quality video camera in your pocket basically in your smartphone means that there 's so much more content out there than there ever was before so it is hard to stand out and super many business owners they end up going with the head-in-the-sand approaches it 's all too hard how can I create content that 's going to actually make a you know make a dent in my business I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that it 's almost an avalanche of average content and where you need to as a business when you 're considering using video where you need to be playing is not by just adding to that avalanche of average content instead to look at creating quality content or strategic content or clever content or personal content and using that to make a difference in your business yeah absolutely so I think in the context of this program just to remind you video becomes a really viable option to produce it whether it 's by your phone or via other channels and like been saying to definitely give it some thought the advent of faster internet so before we just couldn 't consume video I 'm sure we all remember the buffering days and some places still experience that but more and more we are able to produce video and consume video a lot easier to currently yeah absolutely everything 's easier these days and I think what we need to do is just to be clever about it not just create video for the sake of video and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that for most businesses if you have a look at the left of this table here unfortunately most businesses are still looking at video from a tactical standpoint rather than a strategic standpoint and that 's that what I call a forum approach which is video for video sake and that that 's saying basically they go through this thought process of number one we need to do a video so maybe they attend a workshop like this or a webinar and they go yep we need to do a video ok so what do we make a video about and then they make video or they pay someone to make it and then they work out what to do with it afterwards so you 're approaching it in that order you 're coming at it from yo for videos sake which isn 't the most effective the way that I encourage people to think about videos from the strategic approach which is looking at video as a solution not just a product so instead the thought process should be we need to improve what in our business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more awareness of our brand we need more people to hear about us or maybe we you know need to improve conversions through our websites and make more sales or maybe we just need to get more people talking about us online through our social media channels what what do we need to improve in our business and what 's the best way to do that is the next question that you asked if the answer to that question is video then you define the creative and technical approach to make that happen and then finally with all of that in mind you plan for the distribution and what metrics you 're going to measure to determine success okay so too many businesses are looking at just making a video speaking it somewhere and Counting how many views they got and if you don 't understand why you 're doing that in your business then you 're effectively not creating content that 's going to move the needle for you you 're not going to get a return on investment and potentially it 's going to be a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm not going to go too much further in that in this webinar but just because you 've got the tools and high-speed Internet enables people to consume it better it doesn 't mean that you just need to just create content for the sake of creating content think about your business first really good points you 've raised there then and really good things to get people thinking in terms of strategy instead of tactical both income this slider really illustrate to people how video can solve problems the problems that you 're mentioning you know what do you want to sell because I think initial people do think of it as possibly just the promotional marketing side of things that video can do a whole lot more than that net business cañete absolutely videos is a lot more than just advertising people often think about video from a more traditional senses you know video advertising like TV commercials or or documentaries or something like that now that 's certainly part of a potential use for video within your business but there 's so much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can empower more productivity and profit in your business and some of the things that you see on the screen now that we 're going to dive into a bit later in the webinar around using video tools to help communicate more effectively with your team or your clients to build relationships and trust with your market to tell stories to train staff content marketing through video it 's kind of endless but that 's where that strategy comes in into play if you can think about what it is that you need to achieve in your business what needle do you need to move then you can understand what tool you need to use to make that happen because we 're actually doing video now whether you guys realize that or not yes this is live and we 're streaming by webinar but that is a video technology and this will the common recording that you can watch so just as we are doing this right now you too could be creating sharing your knowledge on whatever area you 're an expert on and or creating staff training I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about that a bit more but not going to do that task and that their unexplained to new staff and new contractors as they come and go it 's really nice guys they go watch that video and then ask me questions you do that in your business again so we 're doing it 's something that we 're planning on doing a lot more of as my business grows and expand we have the issue of staff onboarding whereby it can 't be me every time that sits down and talks our new staff member through how we do things in the business so we 've we 've got a plan in place of recording basically screen captures of opted tasks that we do on online platforms and doing that just as a training tool and then it 's just our store dinner basically a a wiki or a little website for internally for our team and once it 's done it 's done right it doesn 't have to be a long piece even three minutes just to explain a concepts or perhaps do so we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to now text chat in as how does your business currently use video in your business do you use it at all or just thinking about it or are you maybe creating the odd thing on a camera on a video on phone or are you actually doing it to something more strategic like staff training and so on so text chat in so we can get an idea of where your Latin we can interact so moving on I love Ben that you made my slides much more interactive than I was clever enough to do so just so you all know that thing on the right stick some plumbing I didn 't do that then edit that but this is I guess an option to create news video that you do a lot of in your business don 't you absolutely the core of what we do at innovate media is create strategic video content for our clients and you know being clever about how you use that content but also what you 're aiming to achieve with that content is where you can really make a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten full of slides some of the ways not all of them but some of the ways you can possibly consider using video more effectively in your business and as you vet pointed out on the screen there and we 'll talk a little bit more about gifts later but gifts something that are much more popular and more cleverly and widely used to teach social media and in blog posts these days so gifts are those little looping moving images that you see which are kind of like a cross between a video and a still image and I mean on these two examples I guess it looks like the owners or principals of those companies are humanizing the brand as we suggest which is great but if the very thought of that puts fear and your soul which I know it does to some people don 't forget you can also get live staff on your team who might be happy to be show phoning or clients or contractors or suppliers who might be more than happy to talk positively about your brand and create content as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that I 'm really passionate about and something that really does make content more engaging the idea behind telling stories whether it be the stories behind your brand or the people behind your brand your staff your clients those experiences that those clients have with your brand whether that be a real formal storytelling approach or whether that be just more sharing you know short little stories that happen throughout the day as people engage with your with your business day-to-day it humanizes a brand and allows people to connect on a much more emotional level because at the end of the day people don 't buy what you do they buy they buy why you do it and there 's a great TED talk by a guy called simon Sinek which some of you may have come across which is worth looking into to dive into that concept further but if you 're going to start anywhere with video and this is video primarily for for brand awareness or building awareness of your brand start by telling stories and I 'll just leave it there something else for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a few things to cover and time was wise and we 're having fun on them so next up I think this is as I mentioned the other thing that a lot of people think of and that 's creating promotional videos or ad campaign so I don 't know and you might like to text them if some of you online tonight are doing Facebook ads and I 'm not just talking boosting clothes I 'm talking using Facebook business manager and you know mobilizing actual video campaigns and so on or any kind of ad campaigns but did you know that you can upload videos and run video ads on Facebook you can run them on YouTube as well so there 's a couple of examples on the screen that our company has run some really great success in fact I would dare say that video gets some of our biggest successes in terms of cost per view and just sheer reach do you find the same when you 're working with video content and ad with your clients in the video is as I said before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an explosion in particularly in social media platforms over the last six to twelve months there are preferences in Facebook and Instagram in Google to video content so they actually show it to more people organically without you paying to promote it but as you vets mention they 're using video ad creatives as part of your say Facebook ad campaigns or YouTube ads is another really effective way to get your message out there very very quickly and the thing is people want to watch video people don 't want to watch ads but people do want to watch video in many cases yeah and they don 't need to be long and there 's all sorts of ways to create them so on this next slide here is one kind of video you can do you might have seen ads like this yourself and on me pretty cool I wonder what 's involved in creating those so I put a few tools on there that I was aware of I know you 've added one video scribe to Ben of all these tools that will create these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that 's better for certain situations that you can recommend to the audience well go Animoto at the top of the list areas is a great tool for not just explainer videos but for social video content or content using social media without needing to use a professional video producer it 's a very easy tool to use yourself there is some cost involved there like paid plans basically powtoon the second one there is much more focused on creating animated explainer videos similar to you know the little walking glazy across the screen there that kind of animated explainer is great for explaining more processes or specifics of a service or product not so much about telling stories but it 's a great tool to use if you are looking to create content and experiment with using video there are some questions and comments coming up on the side and we 're absolutely going to get to questions at the end but um Stephens just mention it 's great that it 's easy to create poor content and I think that 's a very important point to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you haven 't got the strategy right you don 't understand why using that content even having these tools available to you sometimes isn 't really enough where it can be a bit of a distraction I think it 's much better to focus on knowing why you 're creating video and experimenting with tools like this to create video and try and get your message out there but don 't just create content because you can don 't just contribute to the avalanche of average yeah I mean it 's a good point that the person online has contributed but I mean yeah I 'm a little bit clever but I remember I want to check these explainer videos out and I win on powtoon and it literally took me about half an hour to create a three-minute piece which I was quite happy with and which explained the concept for one of my businesses so even as a wrap sort of creative board you could use them and I like using them as well for complex products when it 's something industrial how something works its technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't they yeah absolutely like I think that 's where explainer videos that particular form of video is particularly useful as explaining a concept in a very easy and visual way and if you can 't explain your concepts yourself or you just not a good storyteller then you shouldn 't go to services of someone like Ben to simplify it and really pull it out of you so on this next slide I 'm clever Ben 's once again done a bit of a gift and he 's pulled in against the crowd cast look and feel so some of you if you weren 't aware you can totally listen to these webinars on tablet or phone or desktop so you 've got all the options available to you whether it 's watching it live or watching the recording but you know making web not just something that you know companies like mine that might have got contracted by council can do it used to be expensive to access the software and we started in the webinar game back in 2010 I think it was and they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts on webinars and then see if you 've got experience with these if you just mentioned you 've got either the lunchtime webinars then we 've started on WebEx found that very corporate and clunky back in the day though I think they 've innovated since we moved to GoToWebinar it is about 100 a month for a hundred users so that can be a bit on the high side if you 're not using it regularly and if you 're not charging for webinars to recruit that for a small business and we switch to crowdcast which is the platform we 're using for this very session now it 's about 60 or 70 us a month so it is a good cost saving it 's really intuitive and easy to use and it 's got some nice integration great support and they do keep updating bits and pieces like the ability for instance to livestream to Facebook or YouTube knowledge I think is a really nice feature and I 've not used webinar Jim but I do know a lot of other small businesses that use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your thoughts on all this technology got any favourites or experiences to impart with the audience yeah look like anything there 's multiple options and you know you 've got to try and choose the right tool for your particular needs um now GoToWebinar as you mentioned before I 've had some experience with but it can be crossed cost-prohibitive for a lot of businesses so and sometimes particularly if you 're starting out with webinars probably not the right platform to use webinar jam and every webinar are two that I 've used quite extensively webinar jam and every webinar are created by the same company and basically the difference is that every webinar enables you to create a webinar once and just run it on autopilot so if you 're a coach or or a leader in whatever niche area you 're an expert in and you you have a workshop that you can run as a webinar and then just have it run as a perpetual webinar and where people can register anytime and it doesn 't require you actually be on the webinar and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ webinar gems the same sort of things crowdcast basically but it uses the YouTube live engine so it 's kind of backed by YouTube 's video engines which is kind of cool and I 've that 's what that 's what I use and run many successful webinars through that howlings about 400 us a year so there 's still a cost involved in that but it 's a great tool so so yeah as it says on the screen here you could use this to communicate to prospects to clients and believe in to your team sometimes when you get a few people on some kind of video conference platform like Skype it 's not always that stable for 64 or 12 people or you know if you 're getting up to the 50 people just for net capacity so women are platforms can be good to turn to in those moments here 's another option for using video content how about email marketing as well so both the screenshots here are two different email communications I 've got in recent time one on the left is for Brin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of great business content and I actually have a show on it so called young entrepreneurs where I tend to bunches of young entrepreneurs are in really cool stuff and what 's awesome is often satsangs in pictures and once they 've been on my show so there seems to use a sort of a feeder ground and but what 's also exciting and with mentioning Sunshine Coast councils moved into video in a big way so if you haven 't already subscribed you should do so on their business news update you can sign up for that on their website and they give a little clips of everything from rising business confidence to what the counselors are up to to really call local stories as well so video content and the email marketing Ben do you have much demand from that from your clients or see it as a sort of growing opportunity so usually growing opportunity and underutilized people get a lot of emails a lot of email newsletters or a term that I usually really dislike is the idea of an e-blast which some people refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some information we want to share with people that 's blasted out to them is not really in mind good marketing but email newsletters or using your email database to provide valuable information to your target market or to your client base or to your potential client base is really powerful and because people are so busy these days and I don 't have time to read including video within your emails as one of I think a great way to get people to actually click on that on that email to open it and then to take the next the next step of actually reading or engaging with the content in this case with video watching the content is a pro tip you 've got on the screen there which I 've thrown in there as if you do include video within your email because people are more likely to and I think the stats actually 2.8 times more likely to open or click on an email with the word video in your subject line so it actually increases the likelihood that your emails will be read obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provides some valuable information that people want to hear or see but including just simply that usually we use those square brackets in the word video at the beginning of a engaging subject line and we 've done some tests ourselves and it 's true we get much better open rates when we 've got that word video there that 's a great process then I 'll be stealing that ones love it and I think another point to add is them some people can 't read the average literacy level in Australia is quite shockingly low I believe it 's at about 11 years old and if you are targeting your younger audiences they choose not to read those much rather consume video content having grown up in the social era so there things to take into consideration as well next up options to create video content there live streaming live sees them I think this is one of the most exciting and I think biggest growth areas out of all the options would you agree with that Ben absolutely and as you can see there pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to be growing and changing all the time there 's been some great questions on the side there that to do is live and we 'll get to specific questions at the end as well and be able to get through as many as we can but you know the thing is that these social platforms are starting to realize the power of video more than starting they have realized the power of video and they 're making the most of it and when it comes to live video the ability for someone in business to simply open up their smartphone app and go live to their audience or to their network is really powerful but again with a strategy in place don 't press that go live button unless you know what it is that you 're hoping to communicate to people and what you want them to do after hearing from that or hearing from you in that way so Facebook live whether it be Instagram live YouTube live or periscope which is effectively now Twitter live it 's incorporated directly into the Twitter app and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream and Ustream so we don 't have time to go into all of those individually but my best tip there is to consider how you can use live in your business not as a way of creating formal marketing but simply as a way of a sneak peek behind the scenes or just allowing people to get to know like and trust you and who you are and who your people are within your business on a much more personal level people are on these social platforms for personal interaction with their friends families and brands they trust so if you 're going to use live which I do encourage you to think about how you 're going to allow people to connect on a human level with you through your live streams yeah really good points there and interesting backstory in the space isn 't know if you know the story probably dudes and meerkat was one of the early ones to market it 's not even on the list anymore it sort of dropped off because these other juggernauts have released similar products but they were created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business negotiations didn 't go that well and Twitter actually said buggier then we create narrowing next week 's periscope came out again but sorry before yeah absolutely and the reason why I deleted that one about meerkat is because I read an article just this week to say they 're no longer supporting the program so meerkat is gone Wow well there you go this is really up-to-date content and the other things I would add is that we 've started off doing live stream and Ustream and something 's would actually contract us because it was such a new technology and they wanted people to you know offer that to them but we kind of don 't offer that anymore because I feel that well I think there is a time and a place for it but there are so many options for people to do it themselves and we 've chosen to specialize in other areas but I can say Ben it 's such a good opportunity just sort of start thinking a little differently and go Freight well a lot faster internet now I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just livestream that out everyone else so even showing the associations you get or the information you get access to i 'm packaging your latest shipment that 's just gotten of all your product so people feel like well I 'm getting the first look at this and I don 't know about you guys but I must be a bit of a sticky beat because every time I get a little notification saying such-and-such has gone live I 'm super tempted to click on it and I sometimes guiltily do how about you Ben do you don 't have a little sticky wicket who 's doing what live yeah for me it really does depend on who is going live and I think that I 'm also very quick to turn off if there 's clearly no purpose to that purpose person going live so I have certainly been excited and clicked on a live stream from someone that I that I followed or that I friend or a brand that I like them but if I then see that it 's someone just holding up a phone streaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're walking through an area it 's not engaging to me so I 'm very quickly to not unless there 's something exciting happening within that space so yeah I think you know you can you can go you can go well with live streaming with a purpose but if you don 't have a purpose behind pressing that go live button and I think that you can turn people off as well so just I guess a word of warning but certainly not any words of discouragement we 're a warning till the parents out there to did you know you 're teenagers who have access to some of these tools like Instagram and Facebook and snapchat may well be going live they may work well we 're going mobile things you don 't really want them to go live on which they might regret going live on so have a little chat to them after this webinar at some opportune time and ultimately going live and think about it and maybe ask you before they do whether they do or not something but welcome to the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a little bit of a crossover between webinar and videoconferencing so the way I look at videoconferencing is it tends to be less people than say a webinar could be a hundred people video conferencing and generally two three four maybe six and you can record that as well is that how you kind of term video conference things with planets people then one thing we don 't do only that 's exactly how to explain it but one thing we don 't do is actually record these for record-keeping purposes which is actually a really good idea so I 'm going to steal that from you but one thing I 'd like to say about video conferencing is being on the coast and doing business in in Brisbane often or at least are being invited to attend meetings in Brisbane the can 't tell you the amount of times recently over the last six months in particular that I 've made it a very particular effort to request that those meetings happen either by Google Hangouts or Skype where it 's appropriate and the time that social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really significant in the business so I think as business moves more into the digital space using these tools and becoming familiar with these tools is is going to be really important to doing business and spending less time on the Bruce Highway absolutely we are getting an upgrade but how I travel when you don 't have to it 's more environmentally friendly you can have your pajamas on the bottom half there 's lots of some reasons why this can be good and I really like not only video conferencing but also flicking the docs to someone real-time kept chatting real-time a web link or something supporting the meeting personally our team is on skype all day every day and I discourage my team completely to use email unless absolutely necessary I 'd much rather they called me up I don 't necessarily need to see the face but nice sometimes it 's nice to see their face or to text chat me real-time because I say that 's five whole minutes I don 't have times wet send me up now real time let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit naughty sometimes being in the meeting and maybe someone keeps chatting me a quick question that I can quickly answer while still engaging the meeting so they can move on and in terms of productivity things aren 't held up so in terms of the platforms out there was video conferencing Skype is seen around the while Microsoft bought it they did some things I don 't like so much they then brought back some features because the whole community was sort of acting up mostly where it 's okay sometimes can be a bit patchy you 've also got on the left a Google hangout so that 's a pretty good solution we find with more people that you have on attend see a bit more robust in the bottom one bottom right is one called zoom a lot of corporate organizations tend to use that one so any comment on your favorite platforms the video conferencing then clearly the clear favorite for us is some is Google Hangouts because we use Google Apps or through the business some and our business is on the Google infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apps for us but Skype is is certainly to go to for others it 's a much more widely accepted I believe by most people yeah interesting you say that because we 're very Google centric company to vote for some reason I think this historical we use Skype for the video conference and chat stuff but um for those of you who missed session two where I interviewed Sonia Casas a real Microsoft expert and I gave some thoughts on Google as a system and all the different options you put in there and check that out if you haven 't already if you 're just starting to get to grips with all the stuff is or does apart from email because it don 't hangouts and it does a whole lot more than that as well which we covered in webinar now here 's yet another option to create a news video we 've got screen capture so you know explain screen capture to the audience bin and then some of the tools you can use to do that yes we talked about this briefly before the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your screen and often incorporating your your voice from your microphone as well so you can talk someone through something on the mean it 's a great way to train someone in how to use a piece of software very quickly way more quicker than typing out a how to kind of document so screen capture with audio from your microphone is something that you can use not only for that but also if you 're a in an area of business where your expertise is things that are done on a computer creating video content which is screen capture video content either how to use or tutorials is a great way to actually start to build content that 's a great value to your audience so great for marketing great for adding more content to your to your brand 's or even for monetizing that content by being able to sell tutorials or courses and things like that using simply screen capture software which is often either freely available on your computer or very low cost to you to acquire so yeah there 's more than one ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see there if you 've got a Mac you 've got QuickTime building which will which is pretty cool actually some people don 't realize it can actually you can plug in your smart device or your Apple device your iPad or your iPhone into QuickTime on your Mac and record your device 's screen as well which is really cool but it 'll obviously record your QuickTime so your Mac screen camtasia 's are very widely used tool another one there that it 's not there it 's called ScreenFlow so worth checking that out if you 're looking for tools for this I 'll just mention loom as well which is one that I just discovered this week I think it 's use alone comm to find it loons actually if you 're using Gmail you can you get a little video button next to your send button on loom and you can quickly just press that button record a quick screen capture showing your video if you want to be seen or just capturing your screen and then email it directly to someone so if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer it 's literally two or three clicks and the emails off them with the little screen capture ready to go so really cool there 's some other platforms there that you can use some as more than one tool to do anything like we mentioned before so guys for your homework I 'd like you to consider some of the strategies that we 've been sharing tonight and consider how you could use but video and your business to potentially reach more people increase your productivity or your profitability all through using video there 's been lots of cases shed here 's a case study that been shared with me earlier when we were planning tonight 's session this is a local legal firm called argon law so icon law contracted Ben 's company engaged media and pretty out-of-the-box I guess to be lawyers and create a whole lot of video content but you know you can see on the screen there there 's lots of different things that people want to know when it comes to legal so they created some film through brand story they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk lawyers their clients they produce videos as part of the blog and they even use some of the videos and adds the results that got pretty astounding and well done to Ben and his team for getting these they had on YouTube 20,000 views which if you consider the Sunshine Coast about a population of 300,000 that 's pretty good market share with 30,000 minutes watched on Facebook 24,000 views and 3.9 K minutes watched and the other really cool outcome which is something we haven 't really focused on that much tonight but there 's a really tangible outcome of video is that their Google page rankings increase because google loves video content and it particularly likes it when it 's on youtube so you go create videos you place them on YouTube and guess a lot of people are searching asset protection or bankruptcy and well Sunshine Coast lawyers etc these guys would have a chance of being ranked and also got them some good referral partners so not only were prospective clients and existing clients checking them out but other service providers accountants and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win that business gave them a valuable content library and it also helped to engage the email list so some really great the outcomes there so if you are going to do video some considerations for video formats you need to think about what kind of video will come out of the device you 're planning to film with like are you going to record the single mobile or a desktop person maybe a webcam tablet are you going to actually get a video camera hye-won borrow one by one our screen sharing platform are you looking at webinars then once your producing those videos out of that format you 've got to consider what kind of video editing program you 'll plan to you so for instance if you 're probably going to produce it an iPhone you might say in the Mac environment and edit it on iMovie but you might also supply that to a video editor who will produce it for you what kind of format is also best to the platform you 'll share on so are you going to upload it to YouTube ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of some of the most common video formats and probably out of all of those the dot mp4 is the one that universally tends to work the best some of the others are what will get output from some machines like dot mobs or movers as work short for a movie comes out of Apple 's QuickTime program if you 're in that whereas if you produce a movie on a Windows environment you might be well producing a dot WMV or Windows Media File here 's some other tools for editing video iMovie on a Mac pretty good windows movie makers pretty easy to use I was pretty proud of myself when I had a milestone birthday I 've got a bunch of cool photos and I used iMovie I 've never used it before and I threw them up and I threw an image up and it produced not a bad movie I was pretty impressed with myself and I shared it with my friends and they were suitably impressed too I also and here 's a tip on video underlaid a cool song that I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song that meant something to me and I thought my friends would enjoy as well but when I did upload it to my private Facebook group to share it with people who attended the event it actually only displayed without the music which kind of didn 't make as good an impact because I haven 't thought about copyright and things even though I was only sharing it to a private audience so similar to looking for stock image photos for websites and things like that so can you look for stock music which is world copyright free to underlay on your movie tracks and they have some amazing technology built into things like Facebook on YouTube which you can say will they 'll never know how would they even find out they know straight away and they will pick up that that is a copyright piece of music material so do beware Magisto is quite a cool little app you can get on your phone and produce some good work videos there 's Wii video there 's videolicious there 's adobe spark and even YouTube itself actually has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloading any of those things now here 's Ben 's top tips for making an awesome video perfect planning prevents P poor performance so it 's all in the planning just as if you were going to paint a room you 've got to prep it and then you 'll get a better result with paint job so to goes it with video making as well shorter is generally better say enough but don 't go on once you 've stated your message captions and visuals are key if you take the video context in Facebook for example when a video plays it doesn 't always have produced sound then that 's a good thing if you 're watching this at work you 'll get caught out that you 're actually on Facebook watching videos so seeing the words come up I can still consume that content not only that it makes that piece of content that whole lot more accessible don 't forget about audio quality which you might have to invest in Mike some things to get that right be consistent with your brand so if you reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were structured and looked and the fonts used was similar to stay on brand for them and in the end just do it you 'll improve as you go just as you may have once written a blog and you look back and go gee that was a bad blog so too you might look on your early videos and go they weren 't great but gee look how far I 've come when you 've produced a Scoob so you 've made northern video what do you do with it well be strategic has been his outlined earlier in this presentation you can 't just post and hope that is not good video marketing you probably won 't won 't get good results from that you 've got to have a plan for it a clear objective or clear audience and so on you then need to leverage the networks posted on each year social networks if that 's where you 're getting it out through consider who else might post it on your behalf ask people to share it tag them in and go fish where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LinkedIn might be the place to post that piece of video content an example those legal videos might go quite well in there if they were using the objective of trying to recruit other referral partners remember businesses not b2b or b2c b2b meaning business to business or business to consumer this is Ben 's philosophy he says its people-to-people p2p and I have to agree with them there in many cases also understand the platform you 're using an optimised speech that might mean keeping the video short twenty-nine seconds is a pretty good video links of facebook video ads for instance and play the long game you can 't just do this once or twice and go it didn 't work you got to keep posting video and be consistent before you see those great results like argon law and experiment play with different formats different speakers different types of videos different times you post and see what cuts through for you so Ben 's made a really generous offer to us where if you want to actually learn more about online video strategies offering us for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's engage video marketing comm foundation so Thank You Ben for that thank you for

successfully tended to the Sunshine Coast Council to develop and deliver this program even our years of experience and developing and delivering training on lots of stuff to do with digital I do lots of stuff I do like the public speaking I have my own show it should say about young entrepreneurs and I 'm also the chair of the knowledge and professional services task force for council and the chair of the Australian Institute of Company Directors on the Sunshine Coast so I guess you could say I 'm pretty active in the local business community I 'd now like to introduce you to our guest for tonight Laurel gray who 's darling and to us from Sydney hey Laurel hello how are you good thank you um so Laurel I met you a few years ago now and I love that we share lot the common interest I guess you could say we 're both fellow geeks but do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got to the space and why you know a bit about it sure well look I 've had my own closer of cloud technology integration business for the last five or six years I 've set it up while I was living in Singapore although obviously I 've got an American accent I 'm originally from upstate New York and now live in Sydney and look I actually originally started my career I don 't even know if you know this event but I started my career in technology because I worked for Howard storage world in Singapore you 're probably thinking that 's a little bit weird so we 're at what does Howard storage world have anything to do with technology it 's all about organizing your home using you know knickknacks basically and closet organizers I basically started off helping people get organized in their houses and realized really quickly that the reason why people hold on to a lot of stuff is because of some sort of psychological thing you know they might have lost a job they might have had a difficult time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I realized that I didn 't really want to be working specifically in that space but I loved the concept of being organized so I thought how can I apply this to businesses and wound up developing at a framework for businesses to get them organized and clear the clutter away because I really believe that if you 're successful in anything ninety-nine percent of that is just being organized and staying on top of things and that 's why I think it 's a really good fit and I really appreciate you asking you to speak on this topic because without systems and processes in your business it 's so easy for you to be overwhelmed and for the business to struggle absolutely and they can save it can take a little time setting the stuff up but I always explain it to people it 's like short-term pain to long-term gain right how do you describe to a business why you would want to look at the stuff and it 's more about the risks of not doing it mm-hmm so that it 's primarily the psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face you know it 's easy to go look at a room and say oh gosh there 's a bunch of clutter or there 's a bunch of crap here we 've got to clean it out and you can see why someone would be overwhelmed by that but we don 't often talk about the ramifications of having a cluttered inbox of having a million files sitting there in your Dropbox or Google Drive and not being able to find the right things for clients this really affects us not only our morale but also our ability to focus and get things done throughout the day and generate revenue for our businesses so it 's a really serious topic yeah and also our productivity of our staff if we have any contractors and ability to get help when you need help when you want to start growing the business so let 's move on with our content tonight so we want to talk about why have not just procedures but online procedures because and days gone by really diligent companies would have something like that folder there where someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off maybe had tab files or highlights or something like that and then it sat on the shelf so Laurel why do you love online procedures and why even have procedures in the first place well I guess I 'll start by addressing that question in the sense that I think in the next year year and a half we 're actually going to ban this this use of online and the word digital from our vocabulary because it 's just going to be a given that all of this happens online and people already are expecting and by people I mean your staff are already expecting that everything be accessible from their mobile so it 's it 's obvious that we need to have everything documented in some kind of online systems that can be accessed from a mobile phone from a tablet and from any device or any computer that someone 's logged into yeah you know in terms of having actual procedures I would say it 's not as important if it 's just you running the business and I 'm not sure how many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example do you have any statistics on that um we do know that about 92% of the Sunshine Coast are micro businesses as an only one or two and when we run our workshops they often ask that question and a huge amount of the audience maybe half for at least 40 cent a home-based and often they are the only person in the business but they do call on contractors and things like that which procedures can be helpful for absolutely if then someone who is operated as a sole trader for a long time in the past it 's I guess it 's easy to say it 's not important at all to have any procedures if you are operating that way with the difficulty from going from that one-person operation to even just having a contractor or one staff without any procedures is it 's absolutely impossible to do it you know who really can 't go from just being yourself to having anyone else involved without having at least something documented so I guess I want to stress when we say procedures it doesn 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share today are some ways that you can get stuff just out of your head and at least get it started because this is just as much about habit as it is developing out a lot of content that will show other people how to run your business yeah and even a few hours solo I would make the point that I found in my early days of my business when I was by myself I would go to do another task and six months later I 've forgotten the password I 've forgotten where you logged in and what was the second second what was the fourth step and was it like this and I realized this being more time on it than if I 'd actually just written down those steps so I could refer to them again in the future and I also lean on and turn white a lot in my early days and I still love giving interns the opportunity and they meet best in Excel so that you 're not dedicating your time to training a new person a new person a new person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're much happier with generally yeah that 's true that 's a very point do we move on Laurel from of course yes cool so online procedures and systems can help lots of businesses you 've helped lots of businesses if some examples on the screen um which can you give us any you know examples of businesses that particularly helps or you know really good case studies a lonely one look I think he 's given a good example here of retail or hospitality that one makes a lot of sense um I 'm not sure how many people in this group are a part of that probably I guess it 's primarily service based businesses that would be logging in tonight when you think about it for oh sorry I lost my train of thought uh businesses can procedures particularly help I mean it 's all of them really but if you 're in examples where you 've seen a business really flourished because they put the stuff in place and did it increase their bottom line or increase their productivity is there any sort of you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first example that you gave is excellent because we all know with retail and hospitality the turnover for casual staff and part-time staff is so so high and like that example that you gave her the intern it 's almost impossible to be able to get someone trained especially when you just you know you 've got a lunchtime service you 've got someone coming in on their first day and in a cafe or in a restaurant and they just need to hit the ground running it 's so much easier if you can have some kind of dedicated training program or some short lists that 's either either printed or part of the computer system that when that person turns up on their first day they know exactly what to do and they can tick through the procedures and it 's all either live or it 's something that 's just really simple and they can follow yeah even little one a lot of businesses I make this starting up and they 're excited to get on the journey but they don 't really think about retiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to exit soon and I sometimes think certainly yeah absolutely and I 've got a really good case study later of a business that I worked with where the owner actually wanted to scale up his business really fast within six months and wanted to move back to the UK so that he could spend some more time with his family and raise this child partially in the UK which is where he 's from and yeah he wanted to do that then they got their intranet up and running and they were able to onboard five new sales staff within that six month period of time so that they could just get things up and running and be generating revenue while he was away yeah and I guess as well even if none of these example suit your business just start even if you 've got not one procedure and after today you feel a bit overwhelmed because you think I 've got so much more work to do because of this program or just in general just the next time you do a task write it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas on where that might be because that is a start doing this and anything is better than nothing to write that well now does it the business is you talk to Laurel how do you quite excited yeah look I primarily will work with service based businesses where it can be really hard to think about what are the common threads and all the procedures that I do and you might think this is the number one problem that I hear from people is all no but we 're a bespoke service we offer different solutions that are customized and tailor-made to our clients and I know if you know especially if you 're a consultant out there you guys really think come on what I 'm doing that 's what they 're paying me for is to customize the solution and give my advice tailored to them so it doesn 't this kind of go against what I 'm selling but underneath every single thing that you do you can pull out a process and I think it 'll be a little bit more clear when we walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to kind of put whatever problems they 've got in their mind out for a second and just as we 're going through today write down a couple of ideas or even grab some index cards and follow along as we go it 's a good point because I 've had stuff that I said could you procedure eyes that please and they say oh it 's not possible to procedure eyes that and I 've had clients also said you can 't proceed rather business like mine but I would dare say every business can be procedure eyes does that going through Siler or would you agree with that no it 's everything everything can be broken down into step by step even if it is just natural phases and you do have to customize the actual output using some brain thinking there 's definitely some underlying piece to that that can be standardized absolutely cool so effective processes and procedures will be all these things again we don 't need to read every single one of these out to you but what are the most important things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your point of view Donnell I 'm just rereading this actually there 's so many good points on it look I think it 's this slide is actually true when you 're picking any piece of technology for your business we always want to think about a is it accessible from any device like I mentioned before so anything we talked about today I want to make sure that it 's available using oh and up-to-date mobile app on your phone that can install on your tablet as well if you 've got an iPad when it also is accessible in any browser window for you and that 's absolutely imperative that anything that you do follows that standard secondly whatever you pick has got to be from a reputable company so I think that one 's probably not on here but you know there 's so many different options in the market for cool tech tools and you 've got to make sure that you 're getting it from that you 're buying your solution or getting even a free version from a company that 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis that 's really important yeah yeah maybe yeah well I guess that 's more on the technology side the other thing to really keep in mind around effective processes and it can 't you kind of some are alluding to it in the bottom right hand corner where it says designed to empower and inform rather than constrain staff the most important thing here is that it 's I guess and I see this all the time when working with businesses that are doing this for the first time it 's really easy to I guess adding opinions or have kind of an assumption that the staff are going to have problems with it or they might have certain issues keep in mind that when you 're developing out the effective processes your goal is to make it a stock standard as possible and just give information rather than I guess making assumptions about you know what the the level of experience might be for the staff does that make sense yeah it does in my approach them with my staff is um I 'll write them but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done really I give it my best shot or I encourage them to give it their best shot and I encourage a culture of it doesn 't matter if it 's not 100 percent just get something down and we can refine it over time as we do test it out in different scenarios and go you know what step four isn 't applicable anymore with you know founder passed away or you know the things too updated because most systems or whatever so it is kind of an ongoing process I would also mention as well yeah absolutely and all the solutions that we 're going to talk about today will have that element of feedback built-in which means they 'll be able to the staff rather will be able to leave comments directly on let 's say it 's an intranet or on a project and task management system to be able to allow you to further refine the processes as long as you 've got that fallback option and really easy ways to collaborate with your team anyways you won 't have to worry about your instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get interactive as you guys know so do you currently have any of your company 's procedures systems and policies number one documented so if you do well done you that 's a good start even if they 're on Microsoft Word or a little bit out of date is there something I 'm curious to know where you are at and Laura will be interesting to hear their feedback on the schedule and sexy are they stored online for access by other people or are they your best kept secret on your hard drive or in a folder that 's got ducts on it on the shelf so let 's see what we 're dealing with here Laurel if you 've got anyone fitting in so far I can see christine has written No okay looking that that was a in response to the first question I don 't know you 've got any procedures documented um Stephen says that they 're just very few and they might be stored locally on an ass or on a hard drive Jen says some are documented on a hard drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the downsides of current apps and cloud services is that they change so often and procedures can be obsolete the next time you log in absolutely we 're definitely going to address that coming up soon and Liz says yep she 's got a lot of procedures on her server yeah that 's awesome so congrats for those who do Congrats to those of you who are honest and at least you know where you 're starting from and that 's what this program is all about wherever you 're starting just start start at whatever level and go up the level and hopefully after today we can definitely get starting to do this upper list on your priority okay so procedures and policies your business might need there 's so many of them how would you advise a business when you 're starting to work with them on the stuff Laurel what they would say because it would vary from industry to industry and stage of business and bunches of stuff right yeah absolutely and I will clarify look the core of the business is my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or extract that information directly to create the intranet or whatever it is the purpose is to choose the technology so I often don 't go into real nitty-gritty with a business I guess it 's only done that really with a couple of clients it 's not really my area of expertise so we might get some people to comment on this if they see if there 's anything that 's missing um but I think what you 've got here is it is a pretty exhaustive list what was the one that I was sinking here on one thing that I would say is missing from that actual list that you 've got is specifically around the financial stuff so especially internally you might have some bookkeeping regulations how Kyle employees can submit expense reports and that kind of thing that 's a good one to have through around the financials but the rest of it looks really good cool and I guess in terms of how you prioritize what you tackle first second third and so on I would probably encourage all of you out there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if you have policies on stuff like where it place health and safety technology anything in regards to compliance in regards to your particular industry certain industries there 's more complaints than others if you can create that take your asteroid or contractors and have sort of example that you have this in place that is going to hold you in really good seed and legal situations because you 've got that to lean on and go we actually have a policy for that they actually didn 't follow that they 've actually breached that therefore you can kind of shift the risk I guess the other thing you could consider in terms of prioritizing is what is going to help you make more money faster so it 's getting your sales thing documented and getting more sales people on board going to help your company make more money maybe prioritize writing those procedures so you can start to get help I guess another get another perspective would be what are the parts your business that you 're really struggling with that you really do need to outsource so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wasn 't getting to I didn 't enjoy it I wasn 't good at it and so the first thing I wanted to do was outsource but I still had to document my codes what I saw how much it was who my contractors were just after that any bookkeeper would understand how to basically manage that and I could have the conversation but have that as a reference point for them so that there was definitely no chance of misunderstanding anything you would add to that piece floral in terms of priorities of what you might go ahead and tackle in terms of what you create um I will address s in one second I 've got a comment here from a Manzo she just mentioned she can 't see any of the slides and I 'm I 'm able to see the slides I 'm not sure if anyone else is able to comment there just to say if you 're able to see them or not what sorry the slide yes sorry one of the the attendees is saying that they can 't see the slides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about that um are you saying them well on your screen wall I am they 're a little bit small I 've got it in full screen so I 'm not really sure how much bigger I could make it is that any bigger it 's slightly bigger I wonder if it 's because on your you got your icon there and it takes up about half a screen okay let me address that that will definitely be the issue I can make that sort I thought I had done that my apology just switching over getting rid of my little space invader man or person or really exactly what it is I 'm glad you brought that to our attention yeah yes yeah easier to see yes cool even said yes awesome fantastic um 30 what do you what do you people to create first so what 's your advice tomorrow well to be honest just and I 'm not sure if anyone can relate to this as well how good they 're saying it 's much better but yes these these fixed processes are really important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow a team and scale the first thing that I would actually get a business owner to do and think about are the processes around service and product delivery so that because that 's something that you 're often you 're so so tied to it so like Amanda had said here she works in a salon or she had she has a salon yes I would get her to think about what are the specific procedures around customer service around a haircut or customer service around I don 't hear nothin what 's the point the typical services so like step one step two step three and really hone that service delivery because that 's the first thing that you 're going to outsource business owners find the policies and procedures that are out are listed here on this slide that 's kind of the last thing that you start to let go or add your service and product delivery is the first thing that you start to hire other people to do it 's very true like for your business so that you do it load of web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your policies and procedures that you 've got we 've got step what what is what is dress one of a website look like how do we send out that first draft to clients and get their feedback on it and what step two in what step three yep we do it right from someone inquires and the prospecting stage is a website right through it 's like being delivered we get some training we give them a manual and everything in between and different people hate different parts of that process and regards to our business that yeah we could totally apply the same to yours so we 've been move on in the interest of time and because we want to make sure these guys have time for questions and so on in terms of what is a good procedure or standard look like there 's a few elements but you know by the same token you this is a reference point but also makes use what makes what sense to use like I don 't like to do hard and fast things but I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy or procedure exists so an example might be this policy or procedure exists to comply with current workplace health and safety standards in Australia under which we are governs for example revision history I might let you go into some of these Laurel because I 'm sure you could do them fit adjust this to me but feel free to give examples and things of why you might want to include these things on any given procedure yeah no problem and I think we 'll address a lot of this around the actual text technology demonstration as well definitely revision history on your system that you 're choosing should automatically keep a log of anytime anyone leaves a comment against something or makes a change it should keep a version history and that 's why you know keeping items in a Microsoft Word document unless you 're really versioning it carefully and everyone can share doesn 't usually cut the mustard when it comes to I 'm creating policies and procedures online yeah I would say that 's good the person is affected that 's good who creates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually respond to those questions that 's awesome so always really good to start off even if you are going to start documenting just your service line for example always have an organizational structure and those contact people as the first part that you build out the general policy yep I think that 's good probably for people just starting off they might not even have that information but they could always a lot for that space to have remember for the policy and then the definitions that 's great because so many businesses have got terms that they use especially like for my business is very technology focused there are tons of abbreviations and acronyms you know customer relationship management CRM that somebody who did not have a technology background and we 're coming in to do administration for example in the business they have a really difficult time learning all of those acronyms responsibility that goes back to point number three and then yet the procedures would be the rules the regulations and the method around who is responsible and I would say that 's the five wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why and how and just make sure if you run through every every section as you 're building this out and you ask yourself those questions you should be good to go yeah absolutely thank you so text chat we just want to make sure you 're really thinking about the seal business and you haven 't fallen asleep on us what procedures policies and standards might you need to create your business just do a little brain dump or ask a few bullet points but obviously you really get the most out of this webinar with the other thing for the slide all the things recording later as you made a good old brain dump list of what you will start with what would make the biggest impact in a size priority maybe highest risk what would dramatically improve your efficiency or profitability what 's rolled out and certain headings of any business generally has to have accounts procedures most businesses these days do use some form of IT all businesses need to market themselves all businesses need to have customer service so there 's some headings that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other specifics in relation to your business so feel free to read out if anything interesting come through you want to share Laurel but this is as much a chance for you to really think about it and download your brain and so that hopefully helps you is there anything coming through on that front well uh nope I 've just got one request one person says they weren 't able to hear properly I 'm since she 's had to log off and Amanda has asked about getting slides emailed so Jen made a good comment here she says HR any thoughts on employment here Oh Jen I think you 're my new best friends because I love employment here oh it 's absolutely one of my favorite tools and for those of you who aren 't sure what employment hero is it 's basically it 's an HR onboarding system and I 'm happy to actually hop on and share that but rather than actually building out your HR processes using an intranet or trying to build out your own systems and procedures for onboarding a new employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to select your industry it automatically pulls the information from Fair Work and the awards and it generates the contract for you and once you input that person 's email address it generates the contract sends it out and then allows that new employee to accept the contract from their email on their mobile phone or wherever they 're accessing their mail from they automatically get a new account on your HR platform that 's branded for your business and they can input their superannuation details they our next of kin all that information that you normally would have forms for and then they 're able to populate that information in and it pushes to your payroll system so you pay that person in accordance with the award based on the salary that 's been generated in the contract and that automatically syncs as well to zero or QuickBooks Online and so that it all syncs up with your cloud accounting software that 's a great fit we wouldn 't even do to talk about it tonight but I know who and I I haven 't found the slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week before so it 's great to get that in that accessor yep so that 's just an example as well it 's some software will actually do that for you so it pulls all those procedures that are already in your brain or in your in your business and they will build out that workflow and given that probably most of the businesses that are watching this are not stock standard but don 't have you know 100 staff employment here would be a great option if you sign up for their their entry-level plan and you use this one of the four main superannuation funds you also get free usage of the system so that 's awesome yeah absolutely so just in regards the person that asked about the slides all of the slides are made available and the program portion to people who are doing the full level up program we don 't usually see the slides out to people who have just signed up for one webinar but we most certainly can do that as that 's official request if you could just email up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you affect your situation and request those folks a webinar which is certainly sends the slide back out you more than happy to share so we better move on again Laurel we need to talk about what is an internet or wiki and how does this fit in with this whole procedure policy processing you want explain yes sure and look I 'll start by saying you 're going to have a number of technology systems in your business and an internet is just part of an ecosystem that will assist you to get your ideas and hear and your processes out of your brain or out off of paper or Microsoft Word documents and to a really awesome flow that works for you so we were just talking about employment hero which is a standalone piece an Internet is also sort of a standalone piece or it also can be integrated with a whole suite of other products and the idea is that it rather than being a word document you 're able to upload files you 're able to upload images integrate your calendar if you 're using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual editable trackable traceable policies and procedures system for your business that sits alongside a number of those other applications I know you 've made a comment on here about great integration with Google Apps for example want to make it really clear you can either get an intranet built in your Microsoft 365 or your Google Apps or G suite email Microsoft 365 and G suite are the two most well known hosted email contact calendaring file storage and intranet solutions and you can either go with those or that you 've got a couple of really great third-party intranet options as well for people to choose from yeah we do so maybe we should start taking and look at those so as we always do through this program we 're going to introduce you to technology that you can go and check out and as to what 's suitable for your particular business I would sort of just go check them out check out their features list sign up for a free demo and you also know after playing with it whether it 's you or not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook group for the program you only get access to that if you do do the full program and ask questions and you know have specifics so I 've checked this out but I 'm wondering about this and there 's 500 people in that group there might just be someone who 's already using that tool or who chose not to go with that tool and can give you some you know honest feedback about why it didn 't work out for them the other thing to realize is basically what Laura was just saying as we 've said all along through this program you do want to think about what 's the right tool for this solution so in regards to tonight we 're talking somewhere to put your online procedures policies processes but if you can get them to work together that 's always a great scenario because it 's you know you can end up with quite a few system quantity subscription so the more streamline that is the better and on that note next week 's topic is all about automation so that some what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that is still possible but um let 's start with the first one this is actually what I 've chosen to put my own company wiki or intranet on and Google site so you 've used Google Sites a whole lot Laurel like can you tell them a bit about it yeah certainly and guys I do have a demo loaded up but I think I 'm not able to share my screen at the moment so we might have to go just with with this screenshot if that 's ok yeah we might execute in live one maybe at the very end estates ok woods through these sorry about that I 'm using a new computer look with Google Sites the great thing is that I mentioned before is it fully integrated with your Google suite of products so you log in once you can be in your email in one tab and you 've got your internet loaded in another the other amazing benefit is that you 've got your company YouTube account that 's also linked to your Google account and your Google Drive for file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and large documents that you 've already got stored in Google Drive so let 's say you upload a Google Doc that 's got a boatload of information or templates that things that your staff need to send out to new customers for example you 're able to then create that document and then when a new version is created in Google Drive of that document it automatically uploads the intranet on Google Sites again what I mean when I 'm talking about we create a fully functional ecosystem for your business by using either Google or Microsoft 365 with their SharePoint options yeah so just to be played guys I guess another way of thinking about it a few struggling to get your head around this it is like a website but or like an internet site but we you know call it like an intranet because only the people you want to share it with perhaps just and general team was the that contractors get to see this particular website it is life but it 's not something that you can google and find and not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see the whole site and even create procedures and others can only view it and others can only see certain sections or even certain pages so you 've got full control on who sees what and when so if you have a contractor that you know you want to onboard and then after a while they 're not going to work with you any longer you can remove them so and you can also as Laurel was saying use different what 's the word format for get communicating stuff so you can have documents you can have videos you could have audios if you wanted you can have spreadsheets there 's different procedures and ways of I guess training people and giving people the information they need to do their job yeah so so SharePoint as you all know I don 't use Microsoft a whole lot but you have used it a little bit and have some familiarity right Laurel yes it looks good it 's basically it 's exactly the same conceptually right you 've still got your email you 've got your onedrive for file storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've got your calendar built in to that to that ecosystem so you 're able to create your own little cloud world for your business that only your employees can see using SharePoint now the cool thing about SharePoint is that and this might be a little bit you know thinking further down the track for your business but it 's got a lot of automation as well so you 're able to generate forms much like you can with them with Google Docs and Google Forms to be able to UM somebody 's saying we can 't hear me hear I can hear you okay Laurel so it 's guys if you do experience different problems it could be the internet connection at your end but be assured that we are recording a quality audio recording and Ariens definitely come across loud and clear to me and so you can always access the recording if you 're having any dramas receiving it with any internet connection that you were in cool all right it 's back medicine so basically with SharePoint it 's exactly the same it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more robust integration with if you 're especially if you 're really loved using your Outlook and you are Microsoft powerpoints on your computer it 's going to give you obviously that integration fully seamlessly which can be an advantage to send people so tell me Laurel if I am a Microsoft user if I purchase Microsoft 365 do I automatically get SharePoint or is this something like to add on or how does it currently work with Microsoft and yes look let me load up the pricing page I do believe it SharePoint comes automatically included with the premium version although yep so it comes with both office 365 the business essentials version and also office 365 the business premium version so both of those wanted at the lower end of the spectrum of one is at the higher end and chances are it is included already with your Microsoft 365 subscription so if you are going to say in Microsoft land and you haven 't upgraded to Microsoft 365 that is something you would have to do first because I know when we checked in on ecosystems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on some very old versions of the software and give me not the online versions so you wouldn 't be getting access to the cool features like this so that 's something to be aware of so that slide there kind of runs through the differences between SharePoint and Google so I guess you could totally also be on Microsoft with Microsoft 365 for our local calendar or whatever it is you like about Microsoft and you could use Google site I guess conversely you might use Gmail and Google products and choose to use SharePoint for some reason as well so there 's lots of different options here and you 've just got to evaluate what 's the right option for you yep definitely it really comes down to your familiarity with office products ultimately for my business I love operating completely in the web browser like I don 't download hardly anything to my computer so Google works perfectly for me but it really just depends on sort of your your personality I would say in a way yeah and also maybe what you 're just familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never changed and sometimes companies insist that that 's what you use or some industry so yeah I think some maybe medical centers and things like that still quite like their Microsoft world stuff so I went looking to see ok all apart from those two solutions what else is there out there and I did discover a glue and I said to Laurel earlier today actually never heard of this but it did one 2016 CMS critic award last year for best intranet software so I had a quick look at it and it looks quite cool what I liked about it from what I can see in comparison to say SharePoint in Google Sites as it looks like you can create a pretty nice-looking intranet pretty easily as I 've got some nice templates and it 's pretty cheap at 8 a user as well so did you check this one out Laurel but I mean you made the comment you hadn 't heard of it either at the time right right I haven 't heard of it before and I didn 't log in to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it probably is not because it 's not a fully best-of-breed option like they also are doing some other stuff with it you might not get the best outcome if you 're just looking to use it for an intranet like I know the next one that you got for example is just an intranet software um and when we talk about Best of Breed software we want to definitely use things that are they just sort of are serving one purpose if that makes sense and they try to pretty key as well as that the banging around that 's right and tried and tested yeah of course you know if it does look good to you definitely log in and get one of the free trials for that one if I were going to go down the track of testing I would probably be for me if I weren 't doing SharePoint or Google Sites I would look at Zoho which you 've got up on the screen or the next option that you gave as well now with Soho it 's a bit of a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing by creating all of these separate little pieces that that then do build together so you can have the home mail Zoho CRM Soho 's email marketing Soho recurring billing all those different things um and to be honest I used to hate the Zoho products I really did because the user interface was really ugly oh but now they 've upped the game and I 've gotten a lot of funding and it does look like they 're aimed to have a little bit of a comeback in the market yeah so I think again as well I totally agree with everything he said that with Soho it 's again an ecosystem decision some businesses I know choose to do everything in Soho so I 've introduced Soho solutions and quite a few of our lessons now last week I talked about that they do have an invoicing system this week I 'm saying they do have a wiki system so probably if you went this way you would do everything Zoho with all your other systems as well yet nice and streamlined but if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this looking would not be right for you but they 're also quite affordable too aren 't they that would you say mid-range not the cheapest for they 're not the most expensive and it would be in lower end of the market okay yes cool good to know now I also found this one this had quite a lot of presence I guess when searching on the internet for internet sandwiches as well also looks pretty easy to get up and running with and look pretty cheap if you 've got any experience of this one well I know I did log in now to have a quick look I mean it looks nice and neat and clean it gives you a lot of pre-built templates I 'm like you can see there in that screenshot that it 's got the directory it 's got a bit of a knowledge base it 's got some HR forms that are already there and manuals pre creatives and I would say if you 're just looking for something that you want to use and you don 't have Microsoft 365 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you yeah that feature of having some templates is pretty nice as well yes one of the kids access all procedures I knew that 's pretty good helping in that 's right but look the price event is a bit steep they 've got a free trial however it is 100 bucks a month USD so you better not commit to it I knew that yeah you gotta really want those templates oh so okay so this one is about the typical features so we 've already sort of touched on some of them in the process of going through those different solutions out there but help us understand Laurel what are the what should have wiki absolutely have and what are the things you know that you would suggest they look out for when they 're in the market for a wiki or an intranet I guess in terms of you know that 's a tough question to ask because really the most important thing is that you 're just getting things out of your head so I would say as you 're starting do not worry about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just consistent in terms of adding at least bullet points or numbered lists if and pick between one or the other if you 're going to do it procedurally but otherwise I wouldn 't worry too much about the formatting because a lot of these will allow you to go back and amend the formatting in bulk anyways yeah cool I personally out of all the features I really love the revision history I love seeing oh someone from my team has updated this recently and I love getting notified that someone has updated it too because then I can go all it 's good to know there 's now procedure on that when I need it I like being able to customize them and make them look like my own like with my own logo and things like that and I like making them look a bit pretty I totally agree with your point like just get something down but over time these different learners in this world out there like even yourself some of us live in a welcome video some of us from reading some of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you can put all those different elements into a wiki it 's going to be a better wiki at the end of the day for you even yourself or for others for you yes yeah okay moving on homework if you 're not already using a system to document your procedures we would highly recommend that you research the system 's outline and more thoroughly and look you can totally go google now you know that terminology to onjust wiki or online procedure or intranet and see what else is out there look at their features page look at their pricing page sign up for some free stuff throw some you know pretend procedures up and just get started and see what you think and you may need to talk with your team and get a bit of a download from them if you have team on what procedures you need and what sort of wiki might suit you whether you should look at the Google environment or the week are you going to move also Zoho and all those kind of more strategic decisions as well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborate on getting these done so it shouldn 't all be up to just you if you have got some members right Laurel how do you get everyone helping out with this when you 're working with a company really it 's just letting go of that control in giving and not necessarily admin access but edit access to your team to be able to make changes especially around Google Sites now I 'm not saying that you need to grant your team access to your entire file folder structure then we 've got Dropbox up on the screen I want to be really clear that doesn 't mean grant your team complete access and permission sharing to all of your files it just means whatever intranet you decide on do give them some kind of responsibility to go in and edit and make changes and make it a requirement that when the procedure changes or a new procedure is put in place that the first thing you do is go back to X whether it 's Google Sites Microsoft SharePoint or papers yes I guess also a suggestion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your team if you have a procedure on your hard drive please if you put it on Dropbox as we 're going to be getting a company working together or please if you 've got email templates that you regularly send that you think other team members might find helpful please could you drop them in Dropbox or upload them to Google Sites or a Google Drive or to SharePoint like there 's all these options and then the other two technologies we 've talked about and past webinars is Skype there 's private Facebook groups there 's all these different communication tools that you can use to communicate with your theme and so get them saying on that guy 's what do you think is the most urgent procedures we would create or if you could name you know one thing that you wish you knew how to do we 'll do it quicker or easier or someone in the organization knows a lot about what is that thing and get that discussion going on on there particularly if you have virtual groups spiritual teams which a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to not just create it and it 'd be the world 's best-kept secret we could have let them know don 't you so couple of examples of how I created a procedure on how to do financial reporting for our company and I did a post in our company Facebook hangout and told them this is where you 'll find it and I also popped it on our company Skype check and so they 've been told in a couple of different formats that that existed whether they love them or not do you have you got any other examples of just how to make sure that you 're not just creating them and people aren 't buying into it like how do you get that culture into the organization are using this so I 'll really depend on the business I 'm working at the moment whether over the large hospitality organization and they 've got about 400 staff and look with them they still send email out and then it needs to be dispersed to this to the teams verbally and they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general managers out to the team where it all happens it is verbal some of the communication goes out from the HR onboarding system and then some financial related information goes out from the payroll system but I guess it just really depends on your organization and your culture yes sure some do still do email and that 's other great points bring it up in meetings and go hey guys sitting in notification mister these procedures now exist please follow them please you know create them please give us feedback on them or that kind of stuff so actually that 's my next point so good I had better Nash makes your procedures say on the agenda meeting and so the sorts of things you might discuss what still needs to be created who will create them and by when what are the new procedures which have been created and where can they be found because just because you put it in the folder that makes total sense you might someone else might be looking somewhere else and expect it to be there think it 's not there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they go off and create one and thank feedback so I really commonly create them and then I will give them to interns and things and say I want you to test this to see drew out for me and be honest and tell me if it 's hard or it 's not or you know or you know it doesn 't make sense to you because that means it 's not good enough and we need to improve it and I also say it should be everybody 's job to create and improve procedures not just one person because let 's face it a lot of small businesses can certainly not afford to just pay someone who all they do is create procedures because that is a non durable task and while it might make you more productive it 's you know usually quite a big expense to do that but you know some people do subcontract that to people and there are people who can do that if you do need to outsource set up anything to add to any of that Laurel no nothing to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things that I really was hoping to share though yeah I think um on the next slide or summit we 're going to do those live demo so separately then great great ok homework make sure you work out who 's going to be responsible what the approval process will be can I just throw them up order to go via someone to check that they 're appropriate and relevant and accurate how are you going to encourage a team to contribute to them and where will they be stored are they going to go on Dropbox and then load it up to Google Sites or are they going straight onto Google Sites or so they get emailed to you and someone gets them up or what is the go I 'll zoom through this because I really want to get lower to shoot and like you know so like commissions I mentioned way back that different wiki 's work differently and you can share them with everybody in the organization or you can share them by section or by a page level and you can really customize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on Google and so you can refer to these slides but there 's Google has some pretty good help files that will help you enable page level permissions and so on so let 's get to the good stuff let 's get to this live demo of some tools accompanied with you or whatever Lola wants to show us so I 'm just going to come out of full view and come on out no normal unit says I 've got to install this the screen share extension I 'm just going to do that and then I might need to actually reload my page so if I drop out for a second is that okay yeah yeah do it so guys yeah we haven 't done a lot of this live stuff so I 'm going to I want to close my video but I want love to come figure so and I 'm obviously work out how to do this as well he is alright he 's the other floral like she 's dropped out like she fought I seas made a comment that any product which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so relatively expensive as they need to be updated constantly there are some Australian products mainly dealing with HR matters but they are not cheap so yeah fair enough Stephen I guess you 've got to weigh up the cost versus benefits and stuff like that and then Jim has said read maybe papyrus I think is how you say it maybe that 's what your aunts receive with templates relate to Australian law or more us I 'm not sure so yeah check that out and it may or may not be appropriate and Laurel wanted snow suggestions on a system divorce records oubli and have them converted to text this Dragon Dictation you could use but Laurel is the queen of knowing cool tools objection though others as well so I 'm just going to minimize my screen now and make yours bigger Laurel as we got you there for most sound perspective we just keep that sell we have yeah only good ok this is it is rush for everyone or you I hope you guys are all right just to say for maybe two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 yeah or even guys if you 're happy to go a few minutes over then let us know on texture feel happy we just thought a live demo would be a nice way to show you everything we taught you tonight live in action that 's right I do very quickly just want to touch on I guess three things first thing this is the brand new Google site okay so if you 're worried about the Google Sites that Evette showed in those slides looking just a bit outdated that 's because that 's the current version of Google Sites and this is a brand new one it 's awesome and you can add a logo you can add background images change the header type you can easily add in text you can add in files from Drive and drag from YouTube and the calendar and it 's so so super simple and you know you guys know probably by now that I love Google products but look it 's really simple to do to use this some the new version of Google Sites and sync everything up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a go you can actually log in to Google Sites without a G sweet subscribe you can do it using your free gmail address or lot by logging in with your company email address into Google so there 's no cost to you so um morale completely selfish question if I bought an existing Google site like I do how do I convert the new one and there is there should be an option underneath your existing site to convert it to the new Google Sites but I 'm not able to answer that question 100% for you just because it 's quite new okay no I 'm very clumsy out there rolling it out slowly like they might not offer it on everyone 's account yes you learn definitely I 'll click convert you 'll have to have a page G speed account though to convert your own old site to a new version yeah real good cool second thing I wanted to share is this awesome asana product so probably you 've seen asana before or a vet has mentioned it to you one thing that I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system can allow you to map out your processes using the Kanban or I don 't know if you pronounce it Kanban or Kanban or how you say it but you can now create projects in a board instead of doing tasks just in a list and so for example you could have professed one and this might be a little bit small let 's make my screen bigger here you know it looks like a sticky board will add columns and you can create phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and I know for myself before I actually convert things to an intranet I map it out using a board or like sticky notes or something because it helps me really clear on what the actual process is so if it 's a website development then you have initial consultation you send the proposal you send draft one you 'd send draft to and you can actually map out what are your policies and procedures that happen during every phase all right the last thing that I want to share is a software called the loom and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my my videos turn up here loom essentially and I 'll just go to youth loom comm to show you the landing page it installs an extension in your Chrome browser and allows you to click and then record your screen directly within your Chrome browser now my camera is turned off which is why that head turns up as black you can capture your screen and actually record what you 're doing and it automatically record your voice record the screen records your video and generates a link to the video immediately I 'm just going to open up this one as a sample this is something that I sent to a client yesterday it automatically processes the video and you can see it 's loaded it up here at certain junctures you can even add comments and you can add notes at the bottom so that when you 're sharing information either with a client or with another member of your team it 's really clear so that 's great I 'm actually a little bit ago Liz who 's online tonight suggestion on voice recording or video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine yeah perfect now loom doesn 't itself convert your your audio to text that would be awesome if it did that alongside and it turned up in the comments however what you can do is test out in Google Docs if you open that up there 's a little microphone that you can press and you can record your voice and it automatically types for you so I don 't have that loaded up but I could load up a Google Doc it 's just a native feature you can hear me talking on to take one yeah yes I make sure even get dances well you show us so yeah suck yeah so if you go underneath tools here you can go to voice typing and you can click on that microphone will allow my microphone and it should automatically type what I 'm saying uh-huh uh-huh whoo-hoo do you find though I think you 're privileged because American accents these dictation things love they don 't like my accent but don 't like the Kiwi accent do they no they really don 't the Kiwi any I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there as well I know somebody else asked a question about knowledge base creation I know for my business I use help Scouts help Scouts nets or help Scout calm and it also has got this docks function so that when you 're answering support requests you can also build out a dock or a wiki that 's public to your clients and then embed those documents directly into replies so that 's just another thing for you guys to think about it 's just help scout dotnet yeah absolutely I might read out some of these other comments and I guess we could sort of wrap this and you might sort some some of these Laurel and Ramallah asks how do you get older long term employees to accept changes or improvements or procedures that 's a tricky one andrew is really a charged discussion and I 'm no HR specialist but I definitely manage a few people I guess it 's a slow process and that the communication process is announcing what you 're doing why you 're doing it what the benefits are maybe taking some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move in this direction and then keeping it on the agenda like I said at the meetings so sooner or later they realize this is really happening and we 're accountable I actually do have on all my staff when they start with a company 's job description when you do the right to update someone 's job description in a very respectful way that they do they are required to create and update procedures as part of their job every single one of my employees has that one there so that 's something you could have to look at too so if you 've got any other suggestions of how and you might get around older long-term employees being it 's a change it might not be a very PC answer hahaha if it involves technology look the only thing that you can really do is how once you have a plan in place is implement one thing at a time and make it very clear to your employees what will happen so it all comes down to communication and letting them know and then give them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently where you do lose some of your your older employees I don 't mean older in age but it could be long-standing employees and they don 't want to get on board with inevitably the technology that comes along with changing policies and procedures and updating things and that 's ok too as long as you feel good in your conscience that you 've had good communication with the team yeah and I 've got a more of a comment than a question here from Daniel if it were these are great and when open to employees focus our focus on actual work procedures and info instead of policies yeah that 's that 's a good point policies about lots but yeah getting wet procedures will definitely get the work done so we 've got a few people asking for slides so definitely follow up with those get made a comment that that great employee heroes that Laurel mention amz actually offering employment hero premium freebie for business customers and discount some non customers so for those of you recent workshop we had ended there and you met some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask any of them there was Becks it was Andrew Squires there 's a few from their theme so he wasn 't happy to help you with that so that that 's great an employment hero it does have a free option as well it 's just not going to allow you to do some of that extra cool stuff that I talked about before around the full onboarding process you 'll only be able to do the basic paperless onboarding yeah sure thing all right well Laurel I think we did a wrap-up do you feel like you 've covered everything you wanted to share tonight no of course not there 's a million more things that I would love to share but I hope that those last couple of stools at the end gave you at least a few more things that you 're able to go out and check out for free yeah absolutely you 're right a bit we could both talk for weeks on end really about all this stuff okay guys so we will send you a survey about tonight this is about every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would really really appreciate your feedback we will send you the slides you will get access to the recording so thank you for joining us for tonight thank you officially to Laurel for giving up your time and staying in town and Sydney so that we could access her amazing knowledge we really do appreciate it and so any of you who are not part of the full level up program we would dearly love you to get involved if you found this one webinar

automations we 're talking in a very short Heather Porter who you know as well Laurel and yeah we 'll be talking about how to connect all these tools we 'll keep telling you about and if you kind of want to use one from a different ecosystem than another how can you actually clip them in the through api 's and automations is actually one of my favorite topics we 'd be really insanely wouldn 't you know I love it yes yeah it makes life easier doesn 't it when you you 've kind of got to teach all these guys the long division I explain and then that 's really the calculators isn 't it it 's a really cool fast way to get stuff done oh yeah so any parting words from you Laurel before we sign off no I don 't think so just thank you very much for your time and I hope that you got at least one

    "text": "good evening everyone and welcome to webinar h4 the Sunshine Coast level up program tonight 's topic is on automation which is a personal favorite topic of mine tonight we 're going to be covering all the basics of automations including how to streamline your operations online using some of the automation tools and software available which we 'll learn more about at a basic level what automation czar and the difference between automations and triggers and also who uses them and does it well and some of the cool uses you know cool little sinks that you can create with automations basically to create efficiencies in your business we 're also going to look at where to hunt circle software to plug into your existing system and create some automation of your own so for those that are new to the webinar this evening this is a Sunshine Coast Council initiative or funded program aimed at helping small and medium businesses where possible connect to the NBN which is coming to the Sunshine Coast whether NBN is not available to take advantage of faster Internet and in doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the really amazing digital tools and you know technology that 's available online in an effort to improve productivity profitability and you know general efficiencies in your business wherever possible so this is me my name 's Katrina Lee you can call me Kat my company is the creative collective I 'm a 50% partner in the creative collective we 're a full-service creative agency but very much very much specializing in the digital space so my background I I actually was

development crowdfunding but today now business I very much take a on the operation side of things they finance you know logistics and just general operations so when it comes to automation I love this topic I 've implemented a number of automations in our own business which has created huge efficiencies and and just really helps the way we work and you know how quickly we can respond to people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things so it 's definitely a favorite of mine I mean really great company tonight with Heather Porter and she has a string of amazing credential which I 'll let Heather take you through in a moment but essentially Heather is the founder of autopilot this is very much her domain the topic of automation she 's the author of a number one Amazon bestseller which is pretty cool you know Co Co host to a podcast that you know broadcast across 100 100 countries and you know has a range of cool credentials to boot so over to you heather to tell us a little bit more about your background and career Thank You Pat hello everybody I 'm so excited to be here with you and Kat I 'm excited to be here with you too because it 's when you said to me you love automation I feel like that we 're going to be geeking out a little bit over this hour and like you said you 're going to jump in as well and kind of give your thoughts your conversation as we go so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up for all you guys so it 's kind of is saying look my in my previous life I ran events for speakers like Tony Robbins and so it was very much a systems girl you know I had to run these huge massive seminars and around 2007 2008 one of the speakers came to me and they said hey you know we heard about this thing called Facebook and we really want to do take our tribe offline we want to move them online so that 's how I got started really with the online space I built a membership site in that launched we had 18,000 members and can you just say I was bit very hard by the online marketing bug at that point I was like wow you can have automation in tribes the membership sites and you got very excited and that was my calling and then from there started my auto pilot training company which I teach automations and they cat was seen I have books about business automation I have podcasts and all sorts of little things so thank you for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlight some of my I guess the things that I do and well automation is is its brilliance because I think a lot of people think that it 's techie you need to be techie and but you don 't you don 't at all so what is automation I love it we have a few definitions here and I 'm just going to skip right down to the bottom and say this in short automations are designed to help you streamline your day to day tasks freeing up your time to focus on other activities so at you know what I want to do actually right now is I want to paint a picture for you guys before we get sort of into the apps and and there 's things that you can actually do to automate your business at the simplest level I just want to paint a picture for you so you can really truly understand how powerful this stuff is so right now most of us know that we need to go on social media we need to be blogging or putting out some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online to actually promote ourselves and build rapport and relationships online now one of the key things a lot of us struggle with is the time that we need to find to actually create that content and put that out online and to our tribes and build our you know our business so here 's a really great example of how automation works at its simplest level so for example let 's say you 're going ahead and creating some content nowadays what people do is they 'll do what we call batch content creation so you say your business you go into the studio or you just simply sit down in front of your webcam you record about 10 different quick little tutorials from there you can then schedule those on YouTube so you can upload them to YouTube schedule those to be you know pre published at a future date you can then take the embed code put those on your website you can schedule your blog post to then be released at a future date you can then write emails and schedule those to be released at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend one day creating content and then you basically create your goes on YouTube your articles in your blog post and your emails all to be pre released in the future and by using systems to their full capability you now have content that 's going out all online even using you know social media automation tools that 's marketing your business and all you 've done is spent a day or so creating that content so really that 's how I look at it and then it obviously gets way more exciting than that absolutely and if I could just interject with our business and the you know we 're always talking to business owners and what I find with small businesses and their marketing is they have such a you know in many cases I 'm not saying everyone fits this description but so many small businesses are wearing multiple different hats and their approach to marketing is really ad hoc that you know they post something to social media or YouTube because they have that thought then and there and you know that they 've posted when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a batch approach to content means that they have you know the streamlined you know bulk amount of content that 's going to be drip fed out to their audience and I think that 's what 's really cool because you know to the whole audience it looks like you know you really actually have been really consistent and you 're always producing this amazing content yeah but you spend a day or two maybe a record or you know so yeah it 's incredibly incredibly powerful but there 's other things like on your screen guys you can see that you know you automations at work when you fill out an online form right so let 's say somebody comes to your website they 're on the contact page they fill out a form obviously that data for that form go somewhere maybe to you or somebody on your team your customers receive an automatic email when they subscribe to your mailing list so some of you guys might have heard about funnels sales funnels or lead generation funnels something along those lines right so somebody signs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emails once they sign up your website notifies you if there 's a new order or leads submitted so you get a little task or some sort of alert saying hey guess what you 've got a new lead an online purchases and shipped and you receive a shipping confirmation and a tracking number by email as well you know that 's all automated stuff so if you look at automations they essentially involve what we call triggers so which when they occur they solicit inaction so it 's like if this happens then let 's do this right so if somebody feels out of form then let 's email my team to tell them the forum has been filled out so automation for essence triggers what is it trigger it triggers any event that sets your automation in motion so some examples of triggers include a new email in Gmail a new web form submission or a new note and say Evernote for example then you have the action the automation side of that so that 's the event that 's completed in a second app automatically so some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note and Evernote adding a new spreadsheet row in a Google Doc or creating a new lead or opportunity in your CRM so the trigger happens and then the action happens as a result of that trigger and you 're basically just setting that up as automation you 're basically saying I want this to be the trigger and initially the action as a result let 's move on from there excellent so guys here for the task what is a pain point in your business that if you could just you know save three hours a week doing that task it would have an amazing impact on your business or what tasks you absolutely you know you blood boils to do it it 's just that you know that task that 's so monotonous and you know you could think of 10 million other things you 'd rather be doing perhaps is an automation that you can implement to to sort of take care of that task for you so we 'd love you to chat in and let us know if there 's you know something you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and we 'll do our best to sort of have a bit of a discussion around that at the end it sounds really good brilliant because most people like I think most of us when we 're just getting started with automations we actually don 't realize what we can do so I love that you asked that that 's perfect and so on all right so types of automation software available to guys so the first one is zapier and the second one we 're going to go to these as well so you just understand them a little bit more in a moment we have automate Gayo IFTTT which is if that if this then that that 's what it stands for pi think Microsoft flow and one SAS as well so yes love zapier Kelly I love it as well it 's my like like is what 's your favorite by the way cat I 'm JP I love it love it love it yeah it 's only on the same board really yes being honest like now if I 'm looking for like a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be I actually quite often will go to Xavier and see what systems think with APs and that 'll kind of be my go-to like there will be my short list of where I look to first because I know if they if they 're an app available through zapier I can get them talking with a million other apps yeah brilliantly said exactly so like me that 's kind of like that it 's like a shopping list that you go hey what can I oughta mate go there yeah so is app is basically what zpr has which is a connection or integration between two or more apps that automates your task right sweet this app is the trigger that 's we were saying about before it 's just like when this particular thing happens then let 's have the automation or the action take effect so for something like that like what 's up yours greater is more of a business used focus but it can be a little bit harder to master there 's over 500 apps and growing regularly meaning there 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so for free you get up to five EPS and a hundred tasks per month or paid plans from only twenty US per month which is what I have I mean you can do so much with just 20 US a month all right so what else do we have I love this little little moving movable graphic we have here so if you 're looking at your screen what you 're looking at is here in creating zap basically the types of apps that you can create so it just gives you a whole list of them by the icon so it 's nice and easy to recognize oh yeah they use MailChimp or ontraport or Infusionsoft or you know Google Docs or whatever it is so it 's much like that it really is like a shopping list for your like cool I 'm going to start with this particular app and then you move on from there and you create your triggers and your actions and we 'll show you a little bit about that more later as well so if this then that so now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rather than as app and here it 's called a recipe so it 's nice and simple to use you can also browse recipes made by other people which is quite cool and then just use them plug and play them into your business it is it does have an app which is great so you can use an Android or iOS devices it 's more consumer focused and a bit easier to master and at this point is around three hundred sixty five six three hundred and sixty seven or so online apps to connect it 's free as we say here forever and it includes every social network you can imagine so again if you want this to happen in your business then have this automation occur just kind of think of it automated like that that 's how I learned it cuz like if this then that actually which is what I love this is called so you 're constantly going well if this is happening in my business then can I make an automation around that and that 's how you always think about automation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something filling out a webform making a phone call you know if this thing is going on over here what can I make what can I have happen to make my life easier to have automation in my business yeah absolutely great so this an example of if-then than that IFTTT and that 's just basically a recipe on your screen there and it 's just showing you if you so similar sort of thing right so you 're choosing that trigger Channel and then from there let 's say it 's Gmail on the screen right there and then from there it 's like well what do you want to have happen in Gmail do you get a new email and then in this case it was get a new attachment and then what are you going to do with that attachment we 'll go ahead and plug that in dropbox so somebody sends me an email and Gmail they have an attachment I send all my touch mission to a particular folder in Dropbox so that 's what you 're seeing on your screen now that 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment yeah he just said there 's a few issues with the platform so I 'm not sure whether that 's just Peter or whether everyone 's having that issue that rest assured guys we are recording this I 've also got a backup recording going so if you 've got any excuse me issues locally with sound or visual there will be a recording that will be available to everyone once webinars complete probably you know within the next 24 hours brilliant good one all right so okay good so we do have some good dean says good on his intro that 's great so so one sauce so we have this is another tool that you guys could use it is submit Moeller so it has only 40 integrations to choose from it is more expensive it 's a little bit more premium as well as there 's more hand-holding that happens there so they used to provide assistance and build custom integrations and they may still it 's worth questioning if you 're struggling to really find software that works for you or perhaps sort of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business you might want to look at a company more like this that can develop something for your hand hold you through the process a bit more and like anything I mean as we go through all these different levels and these webinar topics and you know we present with presenter on with a range of different tools in the marketplace you know they also fill a purpose there 's a time and a place for all of them that really comes down to your business objectives I guess you know where you 're at and what you 're looking to do sometimes you know the simplest solution are a great starting point just to sort of play around and instead of experiment with some automations but perhaps you know if you 've got more complex needs you know going to a platform like one sessile or some other solutions you know may be more in line with what you 're looking to achieve yeah brilliant perfect automate Daioh so in this land it 's called the bot rather than the rest of the others app so basically it offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the apps and allows you to create simple one-to-one integrations or multi app workflows across multiple apps so you can run tasks tasks up to every 5 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes for some of the other tools and it does only have 27 apps currently and four more coming Stone so it 's a bit smaller but more I guess I 'd call this what would you say cat a little bit more higher-level automation because you can go multiple apps at the same time yeah absolutely so this is sort of yeah like instead of just one trigger triggering one sort of automation you could trigger multiple automations at one time I should mention that detail also has some of those capabilities as well so you can actually build in you know multi search and just to give you an example of how we use that with you now business when someone fills out an inquiry form on our website that the first action within zapier is it creates a customer record in our CRM and the second step that kicked in is it also then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to call and so that process for us has been amazing because it 's relieved any data entry of getting a webform you know manually typing it into a CRM and then you know the lag time between that process happening and the account manager having access to be able call call that prospect that 's been dramatically reduced it 's literally instantaneous at the moment that web forms filled out our Account Manager is basically pinged with all the relevant information they need to get the phone and call that person so amazing it even ignore it or you great love it right example next one we have pi sync so keep your contacts in sync pi think keeps your contacts and sync between your favorite cloud apps to a and in real time so 37 connections currently in about the same again in the pipeline real time and no free plans this is one I haven 't actually use of you have you guys know I haven 't used this one I suppose like zapier Marcus it has always been my go-to but it 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we always like to present all the ones available for everyone and and I suppose if anyone goes hunting you 'll probably discover that there 's even there 's even more than what we 're presenting tonight but these are some of the main ones just a couple of questions on chat well yeah well I see them Andrew said he wants to automatically SMS or email customers confirm booking times the Andrew we might come back to that one once we kind of work through the rest of the slides and if it hasn 't been sort of covered off we 'll cover it off at the end and then he said out of interest which CRM to where you so we actually use possible works CRM which has a direct think with with Gmail so we all work out of Gmail Siddhas is real amazing little add-on to Gmail so we 're basically by emailing we 're working within our CRM but there 's so many different ones available and you really need to do switch your religion they all different price capabilities I would suggest you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see which one 's going to tick those boxes where yeah absolutely Microsoft flow lover and always the last to the party Microsoft has a second flow is the news that 's so good my hopefully there is automation tool on the block and it 's the most limited it 's a Microsoft product so it 's strength is very much you know into with the integration with the Microsoft apps and works like IFTTT with two-step automation recipes and they called theirs template so it works with all the you know Microsoft suite like office 365 onedrive SQL and Outlook cetera alright so let 's look at some examples so these are some potential apps that you can set up inside of APR so first one now you I 've used this one a lot actually add new WooCommerce orders to MailChimp list so WooCommerce guys is a shopping carts plug-in if you use WordPress it 's a full-on shopping cart that you can use on your WordPress site so what happens there if you use a MailChimp which is just an email program like a an email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody purchases something they 're automatically added to say a customer email list in your MailChimp you can add new MailChimp subscribers from new contacts than zero so if you 're using zero as your bookkeeping and accounting software if you have new contexts in Xero that you add say a customer that comes on board then you can add them to a MailChimp customer list so you can then email them to your MailChimp another thing you could do you can add new wordpress post to facebook with shortened URLs so automatically you have your post going out in WordPress and then it can post for use a beer can post before you on your Facebook as a social media update with a nice short little URL you can create zero bills for new Eventbrite attendees so if you use Eventbrite as your event booking system online you can automatically creates and builds in your zero account software which is pretty cool the more remind fans of upcoming Google Calendar events on your Facebook page how cool is that and you can pin your new Instagram posts on Pinterest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with social media automation where it really does the cross sort of promotion in between your different social accounts you can copy new Google Drive files in any folder to Dropbox you can create prosper works leads for new jot form submissions now I have to say I have not used either of those but it sounds very except one of our so we use joke forms our current website platform isn 't on WordPress and it 's on Adobe business catalyst which is a little bit more limited when looking at upgrading ourselves in the later part of the year so we use a webcam program called jock bones to collect you know any leads or contact inquiries through our website and that deposits directly into passwords and are in relation to your question about SMS is when people make bookings and we are going to do a bit of a live demo in Xavier and Heather may have some experience on you know particular ways that you could achieve that I 'm very conscious about during that question for you as well but just on this point like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exponential because each of those 500 apps can almost sync with each of the other 500 apps so you know this disguise to limit virtually on what you can achieve so long as those apps are compatible with zapier if that 's the platform you 're using yeah and I already know that it does have a good one for estimates automation so yeah we might cover that when we do the demo all right some other ideas for you guys with 500 plus apps the opportunities are endless literally a hundred thousand syncs you can create with these apps now that spins your mind out definitely here and it 's exciting share you can share a new content automatically to social media can deposit new web leads directly into your CRM you can capture all your contacts into your email marketing lists you use delays to promote events you know certain number of days out from the actual event date so you can have automated emails going out to people reminding them of an event that 's coming out or SMS messages you can create nurture leads following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registers for an event sort of surveys or polls or all sorts of things you can do to check in with them after an event you can build a list of influencers save Twitter mentions to Google Spreadsheets so you can truly reach out to the right people that you 're following on Twitter and build relationships that way just a few amazing ideas and here 's some more as well you can add context to your CRM from new form submissions purchases emails address book contacts newsletter subscribers business cards event registrations helpdesk tickets database entries or contacts in another CRM so you can move around your contacts in any way shape or form that you want you can trigger automation from your CRM system as well including adding client emails to a mailing list sending customers a welcome email texting contacts yes you can do that assigning yourself a task creating custom documents or sending an invoice so pretty much anything that you can imagine which is amazing class who uses it and who does it well yes I know you do can I see you really being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the ways you use automations I mean I 've barely touched the surface of automations and this is very much you know your area of expertise so tell us about some of those things you do so look I it depends on in my business so it 's interesting so it depends on the business that I 'm working on or with and in my business I use my CRM system is ontraport which is a huge automation engine in and of itself so I 've kind of used a CRM that has a lot of automation built into it however with some of the other websites I 'm a part of that have shopping carts like WooCommerce I use a great deal of automation through zaps with that so like we were showing you before when we have a new order that comes in from WooCommerce we do all sorts of crazy cool things with that new order so we 'll put them into MailChimp or maybe active campaign which is another sort of email marketing CRM system we also do a lot of membership automation so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce or through PayPal or wherever they 're buying it from then we actually can move them in and out of email lists based on if their payments default or not so we can put them in hold lists so a lot of the automations that I do I guess through my business is done through my CRM but through outside of that it 's a lot of it 's done through e-commerce and membership site to do a great deal of automation using that for that which is really cool because what this is showing and demonstrating I think everybody is that you and I both use it extensively but in a lot of different ways and on the screen tubes tell me a little bit more about what we 're looking at there yeah I don 't know if anyone on the webinar tonight has experimented with Facebook lead and so lead ads they 're a particular type of ad type that you can run on Facebook now the thing is with the Facebook leads is that basically you have to log into Facebook and download a spreadsheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your lead form and then you know you get this clunky sort of spreadsheet it 's really not anything pretty to look at and you 're relying on from downloading it which you know if you get busy or you know you 're out of the office for a day or whatever you know a day in though in the realms of you know getting back to a lead can be can be huge it can be the difference between them going elsewhere or not so true xaviar you can actually think Facebook so that when someone fills out your lead campaign on Facebook it can deposit those details directly into your CRM so again you know that little leaf icon that you see there that 's the little icon for proper works but you could easily interchange that for you know Salesforce or sparsh or you know whatever sort of different CRM you 're using Sugar CRM is at 10 million won I mean this is just a example of how we we used Dave here and some of the actual zaps that we 've got in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone has inquired with us we send them to a list on MailChimp we 've also got this is another cool one so again it was just really frustrating that when we came to actually putting together a quote for a business that we would then have to manually enter that business 's details again in Xero which is our accounting system we use for actually raising quotes so again you know we 've got a trigger in place so that whenever a lead within our CRM you know gets a status change to estimate to be raised it takes that business 's details and it populates it in Xero so quite literally our count manager changes that Sunnis jumps into Xero and that business is in there ready to go and ready to quote so there 's tons of other things you can do not all of these we 've got active at the moment but I guess it 's just a little bit of insight into how we use them I mean that 's we 're pretty transparent with this kind of stuff but you know the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know these automations in 10 million different ways so keep those ideas coming on the chat if there 's something specific you want to do pick our brain yes absolutely and what I love what you said also about that is how you use it with Xero for your proposals and sort of changing that around because I think for a lot of businesses the whole proposal thing can be a real nightmare beside like creative proposals making sure that they 're followed up making sure the team 's alerted and the way you 're using it 's brilliant because really what you 're doing is coming from that whole customer service aspect and also your team is by taking care of better care of your team but it 's also taking better care of your customers that 's really what automation is all about it 's not to be sleazy it 's to actually really give amazing customer service and build an amazing team your own distinct resume with our business automation just means speeding things up so from the time that someone interacts with our company in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them and in actual fact there was an event I attended a little while ago now it was like a Google event and you know someone from Google stood up onstage in front of you know a thousand a thousand businesses and said the expectation when someone say you know makes an inquiry through Facebook or social media the expectation is a response from you within hours if they likewise with live chat live chat they they almost expect an instantaneous response webform even a little bit longer that 's still you know within probably eight hours and phone within that eight hour period as well so the way I see automations is just basically speeding up that process so that you can get that back to people much faster really cool and so what do you do when your app is not supported such a great photo or images if the server 's are up you are using does not appear to be supported by any of the tools that we 've shared in this session don 't worry you can definitely still find help there 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other and you can find a developer that actually specializes in API integration and they can actually create the own your own conversation between the apps so to speak with code so they 're usually bespoke and therefore obviously more costly but they can be really valuable for those of you that can 't find the right recipes or zaps to actually create what you need you can still find people that are going to be able to code this and develop something for you should you need it really the sky 's the limit I development is great for like industry or very mesh software so you know where is quite nation so it 's not generally available through zapier because you know it appeals to a particular target market only or a particular goose so that I find that that 's usually the type of software that isn 't already supported through the likes of you know use APR or if this and that and so that 's where API integration might come in handy for your business if you 've got very niche software like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that yeah perfect now right live demo great so I guess I 'm going to show my command for this one so I 'll go ahead and get that going right now and I 'll just want me to do guys is just walk you through what it looks like inside of my account and we 'll just go shopping for News app together and we 'll go ahead and create that now so my screen should be up on on the screen now do you be able to see that okay Iren job just got an issue with my crowdcast screen frozen let me just see oh here we go caught up I think it 's doing what my screen on can you guys confirm that on Chad looks like it 's both side by side hi Marty rain we 're all perfect turn my screen share off sorry bear with us good you guys okay oh good looks to be good so you guys should be seen my screen right now yeah that 's all great okay perfect all right so what you 're looking at here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you basically have these little tabs up here so this is just one of my my multiple accounts that I have and we have xplory of that you can actually see news app secret here you have zaps that your current zaps tasks history and connected accounts so just walk through these really quickly now then we 'll come back to this explorer one in a moment so basically in here that 's where you can make your zap yours that tag is where you actually see the different zaps that you have so this particular account that I have is very much geared at forms going into databases as well as WooCommerce to orders that are being made we have a task history so things that have than just in the last little while I can see the different saps that are happening and firing off and I have all my different connected accounts in here so I sort of you know these are the different programs that you use so I have a MailChimp account in there I have ontraport I have active campaign clickfunnels gosh all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storing information buffer which is a social media app as well so let 's start with the Zap and I 'm going to start with an SMS zap because I know that one of my most favorite SMS systems is in here called burst SMS Kat have you ever used that as versus Thomas it 's pretty amazing so I think she might be on on mute because I can 't hear but that 's okay so burst SMS is an amazing one so I know one of you guys was asking a question about that I highly yeah Kelly use burst it 's amazing for you guys I want to use SMS automation it 's unbelievable so if we 're looking here on the left hand side where it says search for any app by name what we want to do is this is where we 're picking that trigger remember we talked about that earlier we 're sort of saying if this happens then I 'm going to automate something over here on this side so I know we had a question before that if somebody books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if they book in for say an appointment can we then send them an SMS so what we see here is we have sort by popular so we have all the most popular different apps in here that you can look for but you can also just do a search as well so let 's just say that we look in visit there 's a booking tool called calendly let 's see that one comes up there it is so let 's say that somebody books an appointment with us in calendly then we can send them SMS reminders through births SMS right so if they actually have an appointment with us there I just going to double check we have any questions on that on the side cool come back to that in a moment or cat can come back to that as well I 'll just continue on ok great so here we go so we have calendly so let 's say we 're going to go ahead and use that as the actual trigger point so then from there pick apps to explore workflow ideas so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I already have some other ones I have a nurse ohn the X out of these search ones here we go AB calendly so it 's given me popular zaps for currently it 's sort of saying okay so you can create asana tasks zoom means you can create black chats all sorts of things in here so we 're going to actually see if I can go ahead and instead do a burst SMS that comes out from somebody that books in from calendly right so let 's go in let 's see see if there 's any more actually let 's do this I 'm looking for one that 's already existing to see if we can go in from that way look at that they keep coming up look at that more and more and more so see how unlimited this is you guys it 's amazing like you can do go to meetings crazy slack all sorts of things Wow amazing okay so I disappoint what I have to do is I 'd go in and connect to my account and then I basically going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to do because I 'll just take a little while with you guys but you would essentially connect your account and then now you 're going to be able to go in and create a zap with that particular app and then as you go through that process you would then connect your birth system s account as well so I 'm going to go back to some accounts that I already have active in this as a peer account right here and what we 'll do is we 'll search by let 's go into active campaign so we have active campaign and we 'll scroll down from there and let 's see and see there we go so I have account my accounts already created cool and we 'll go on into here oops okay cool just making sure okay so I 'm gonna go back up to the top I 'm gonna go ahead and make a zap BAM alright so when you go to make a zap it 's going to come up with this new little area where you download your left-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger like we already discussed you guys are now experts with that it 's like if this happens and then action is then do this so here are all my apps that I have connected so far so I 'm going to go ahead and say all right cool so if something happens in active campaign which is my CRM system now it 's giving me all these different options so it 's saying a new contacts updated we have new campaigns we have a new deal task we have all these different options here so let 's just say that a new contact is updated and then from there I click on save and continue and then from there I 'm moving on down the track and it 's just taking me down the left-hand side really easy to set up right so it 's basically now saying which account do I want this particular trigger to be happening in now I have three actual active campaign accounts that I 've already synced in here so I can just choose one of those so go ahead and choose this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly save and continue and then from there it 's going to say ok cool so which list are we talking about here so I then I 'm going to go ahead it 's going to pull up all my different lists that I have inside of this particular active campaign account obviously this is going to look different guys based on that particular app that you 're using is the trigger so if you 're using calendly it 's going to ask you it 's going to display different sorts of options in here because it 's specific to the app that you 're using so let 's say that they go into this particular list the power of yes ebook and then I 'm going to click on continue it 's going to walk me still down the left-hand side and it 's just going to say cool we 're just going to double check this for you make sure it 's all working so you go fetch and continue and then yep test is successful and then continue so at this point is just bacon making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there so then from there it 's now saying okay cool so choose another app that you want to have happen something to have happened here so from there I can basically choose any of my apps that I already have hooked up or it can go down to new popular apps from there and I can make something happen so let 's say an update has happened inside of my active campaign list I can say cool now I 'm going to send a message out to my team by a slack for example I want to send a channel message a direct message to somebody on the team add a reminder so let 's say you have so many books in your your you know lead magnet comes into your active campaign list and then suddenly they 're now being sent a reminder you 're a certain team member maybe a sales team person you know on your team is being sent a reminder that this person is now coming to your list so see how powerful this is you can do so many amazing things so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add reminder and then save and continue and now it 's going to make me connect one of my FAQ accounts so go ahead and do that it 's going to walk me through exactly how to do that and then I would continue down the path and at that point it 's going to walk me right down to the end and say everything 's done good to go let 's do a final test and then you can turn yours app live here in the right hand side so I 'm gonna double check in with you guys really quickly just to make sure they were all good in our chat everything looks to be alright perfect alright brilliant heading back in here we go so it 's as easy as that I 'm gonna go back into the dashboard and I 'm going to show you some zaps already have going on in here so if we 're looking down into this particular one so this is what commerce going into active campaign you can see it 's on I can click on that and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand side so if I want to be refreshed and go what 's actually going on here I can go in here and actually go through the steps again and it will show me exactly what 's happening so I have a subscription it 's created for a membership site and then I can go down and see that okay when that happens I can see that they 're actually now added into specific lists here inside of my active campaign down in this area so and all these fields come across as well so extraordinarily powerful stuff absolutely love it and what I 'm going to do now is move on into let 's see what we 'll do I 'm stop sharing my screen and then no cat you might be having some audio issues so all good with that I can continue talking while you perhaps work that out I have my slides as well so will absolutely make it work for you guys you know it 's always fun during life you always have little techy weird things that the Razr ugly head so do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have any questions about just the easy nature of zpo and how you use that just pop them in the chat on the right-hand side cool all good all right brilliant all right so I 'm going to come on back in here we can stop sharing my screen yes you guys thank you for feedback brilliant okay brilliant thanks Emma all right so what I want to start to end up with here and cat I 'm just really trying to get you back in just so you know but it 's not looking like I am able to so giving me the the permissions to do that for whatever reason so looking at the screen now what I want you guys to really have is a key takeaway from this session is this number one don 't rush into software subscriptions now just because you 've seen their potential and you see that zaps work with anything don 't just go out there and load up on software subscriptions you definitely want to do your research so that you can choose apps that sync and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looking at your wish list so really if you already have tools in your business and you 're happy with those go to zyb here go ahead and do search there to see if they those particular apps are supported in that in that platform and then if they already are and you 're happy with the tools that you 're using then BAM that 's great so you already can use that as I set up and create these apps if you have if you 're not number one if you 're not happy with your software now would be the time to look perhaps for other solutions and you could just start in vapir and have a look in there for potential zaps that you can create that might help you make some decisions around the software that you could be purchasing or using in your business number two be creative the sky is the limit as we have discussed throughout the last 40 minutes or so truly really anything that you can dream of you can do so whether that 's automating your content like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posting and automating your blog post to social whether that 's hooking up your you know you zero proposals and alerting your team the sky is absolutely the limit the next step in this number three always tests and tests every once in a while as well I 'm if you 're using something like zapier or one of these other platforms like if if IFTTT then you definitely want to make sure that you 've tested this yourself so like what i 've done in the past when I use the e-commerce side of things I 'll actually go and purchase with real money and make sure that I end up as the client in the right email list or I get the right SMS or whatever automation that you 're going to do and set up consider API integrations where those tools these tools don 't assist so like we said before if you have a very special setup like I 'm I know company that they do mortgages and mortgage broker and they really had to do some custom API to make their different platforms talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation does all the hard work cat did you anything you wanted to add no I think we 've done a fantastic job of it I think there is a couple of other questions in the live chat that I 'm sorry I 'm not sure if you tackled Heather you might have while I was just trying to get back on to the the presentation emma has we 're up to question time anyway guys but emma has asked what that she wants to create a zap from HubSpot with an SMS birth to advise clients when a job has moved to the next stage of the process how much you go about that hello so what you would do is you would go in and create is that by clicking on that create zap orange button and then you would start by using HubSpot as your initial trigger that 's right right it was as a trigger coming from HubSpot I think you were saying just looking is that from HubSpot yeah cool to that HubSpot with SMS bursts to advise clients when the job has moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right that you want your HubSpot to then so something happens in HubSpot where there 's an update and then you have a SMS go out to the client that 's why I interpret that so what you do is you set up the zap the trigger would be programmed HubSpot and then when you connect your HubSpot account you 'll have different options in there which will say what you can do as part of hub spots so for example if that particular client you know they 're quiet record has been updated then you can send out an SMS so you say I want if the clients been the client records been updated then it 'll sort of say how do you mean and then you 'll say well with the tag or whatever different options that they 're going to be updated so the job 's done and then the action would be a burst dismiss so once you move on from the trigger and with the client record being updated you would then go to the action and the action you would choose would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to your Bristow Miss account and then you would say what I want to have happen is an SMS then to go out to that person that has whose clients record has been updated in HubSpot so that 's essentially hotel has also asked about whether you can review Google Docs so in this particular scenario she 's recently put policies in to Google Drive dogs and she wants to kind of give it an automatic reminder say in calendar or something like that that that document needs to be reviewed in 12-month time she 'd think about a google calendar that you use or your team uses and you 'd basically would set it up to put an appointment into your calendar based on a particular you know trigger that you set up so if something 's updated say as a cool drive it 's updated then you can create an appointment to then fire away in a Google account a great question from to raise she 's asked whether there is an app from Excel to MailChimp now I know you could definitely go from a Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would you suggest there Heather exactly that so looking at a Google spreadsheet was it just essentially Excel on Google and look at doing this app from there but yeah since the since Excel if you use it offline as just a you know a Microsoft program on your machine which is not actually in the cloud then it would not be able to talk to yes so that 's a really good point and probably something that we haven 't specifically covered all all these applications or platforms like the API basically work with online tools so Google Spreadsheets would work because it 's typically an online tool but to raise if you missed it there was an early webinar we did it might have been kind of level three or four and there would be a recording that would be available to you as well and it talks about online collaboration tools etc and in that particular webinar we do talk a lot about the benefits of using something like Google Docs or office 365 as a cloud-based solution really really cool where you need to collaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of having different versions of the one file because it 's a live document yep and zpo does work with onedrive which I think you just said as well it is on onedrive perhaps so I do know that it works with onedrive and you 're on office 365 so those are all cloud-based set so that case yeah cool looking through chat are there any other questions I 'll keep them coming in we 've got a couple of other slides to cover I might get you to skip ahead if that 's okay Heather and we 'll just keep an eye on the chat and see if any other questions do come in but just a reminder to everyone if you are a full program participant on the LevelUp program which I 'll cover off the difference there in a moment don 't forget you have got access to mentors so to take advantage of mentors I think we 've got we 're level eight out of twelve levels so there 's sort of another four or so weeks of all four or four or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at level up Sunshine Coast gov dot au and you can actually request a you know a session with a mentor there through the portal so that 's totally free to you as a member there 's some amazing mentors that you 've got access to to take full advantage and you know tap into the expertise I might get you to skip along if that 's ok don 't forget true for full program members you 've also got the Facebook support group so again this is a really fantastic resolve because all the businesses that participate now for program are in the group and I love some of the conversations that happen in there that you know someone might post a question or they might post you know that they 've just implemented something from one of the webinars and the support from other businesses is fantastic so if there 's not you know necessarily an answer coming from a mentor or ambassador or trainer immediately sometimes it 's actually other businesses that are jumping in with that info so that 's pretty cool as well if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next webinar was got is on the 18th of July which is online customer experiences I should also mention too that workshop 3 so workshop 3 covers a number of different topics it covers I think six seven and sorry six seven eight and nine that 's on the 13th of July on the Sunshine Coast there so keep in mind pop that in your diary all the events are on the websites if you want to see what 's coming up jump on there I should mention too if you 're not a full program participant the webinars are free so these are totally free to jump on and listen to the advantages of being a full program participant is that you can actually go along to those workshops which you know much more kind of DIY you can take your laptop and and sort of implement some of this stuff as you go through and you can take I think for extra colleagues or team members from your team along to those as well absolutely no charge so the free half-day workshop available to you if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along to the next if that 's okay I get to workshop 3 coming up on the 32 July and sorry the next one there as well for more information if you 're wanting to learn more about the full program or upcoming events level up Sunshine Coast Queensland gov you re I think I left the Queensland out a moment ago and finally if we can jump over to the last word these are all that some of the amazing businesses that are supporting the program or a program partners so a lot of these are all sort of local businesses on the Sunshine Coast but thanks to these guys as well that concludes our webinar for this evening I 'm just jumping over to chat to make sure there was no last-minute questions I think that 's it everyone so thank you so much for joining us apologies for the for the technical mishap tonight I guess that 's live events and we try and navigate our way through as much as possible we still love technology they still enable us to to enables us to do very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much for letting us tap into your expertise and yeah absolutely loved geeking out with you tonight it 's been an absolute pleasure I wish we could carry on for another hour but we 'll be respectful of anyone only at least acremant 's I would say great timing tonight so thank you so much thanks everything guys the recording will be online hopefully

    "text": "level up webinar 5 this is number 5 in a series of 12 topics tonight 's topic is online banking and e-commerce solutions I 'm in very good company tonight with Stuart 's sorry Stuart McFarland 's sorry Stuart who is actually from a way which will cover off a little bit later tonight so very good company tonight we 're going to be covering a range of different topics namely all about online banking and the different options available and how to source the right online banking program yes how to transact online all about Bank seats so we 're going to learn a little bit more about how you can create efficiencies through bank feeds with your accounting software we 're going to have a little look at s person point-of-sale options ecommerce solutions some newer players in the e-commerce space as if paying after P solutions so that 's sort of buy now pay later and some other applications and tools throughout to keep your finances in order so just there with me while I get my slide deck here into presentation mode let us know by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight I 'd also welcome you to introduce yourself on the chat if you 've got any questions you 'd like to get in nice and early with feel free to pop them through and we 'll be answering some throughout the session but there will also be some questions at the end of the shift session tonight as well so we 've got one hour with you this evening so we 'll do a little bit of a coverage over all these different topics some of them you 'll learn in a little bit more depth for late leader webinars if you are interested so we 'll have a little bit of a look as to those topics coming up at the end of tonight 's session so this is me my name is Katrina Leeds I am a partner in the creative collective so we 're a company based on the Sunshine Coast or I had office based on the Sunshine Coast and we were successful in tendering for this project with Council and basically our role is in facilitating the program webinars workshops etc so my background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication from the University of the Sunshine Coast actually am based in Newcastle now and it 's very cold down here my strengths lie in design web development crowdfunding but in our business I very much play a role in finance and business operations so some of the things we 're talking about tonight are things that you know we 've implemented in our own business or that we 've you know experimented with you know different options and things like that I also take the lead on research and implementation of many new systems in our business including some as once we 're going to discuss across accounting banking and online transaction I think I just skipped ahead there a little bit just to recap on the level up program if you new with us this evening the level up program is a Sunshine Coast Council funded program heavily subsidised highly by Sunshine Coast Council it 's aimed at small and medium businesses and the idea behind this is that the NBN is coming to the Sunshine Coast Council would love you as business owners to connect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of faster internet and doing so will mean that you know you can fully take advantage of digital tools online technology and other business solutions in an effort basically to improve productivity efficiency in your business and ultimately profitable profitability so that 's where we are that is me and I 'd like to introduce to you and Stuart McFarland anyway so Stuart is a very very clever guy he 's had a head of product delivery and support at a way has extensive experience on this topic and some pretty cool credentials to boot so over to you Stuart to introduce itself properly thanks very much Katrina and yeah it 's great to be talking to Queensland again because I 've done a lot of great technology projects up there in Queensland over the past few decades I actually started out at global banking and securities transactions in Milton in Brisbane which was a great company that that handles the settlements were half of the Australian Stock Exchange every day Wow and I also worked at the earth stand young in Brisbane flight center I was a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US when they bought Liberty travel but now now I 'm doubting Canberra and anyway is a great Australian startup that that grew to become Australia 's largest online payment processor and then just last year we were acquired by Global Payments we with our branded become so big and the good thing about that it 's put us together with another queensland company that the goggle payments bought in 2014 which is easy debit so now we 're putting together the products of eating debit anyway so to help australians buy online fantastic and very cool little fact here you actually made the first-ever Apple pay payment in Australia is that right at that is that is right so we worked with that also for those who understand Apple and when they launched technology they they are absolutely they keep its totally secret and the the non-disclosure agreement you have to sign art with between EU a and Apple they 're actually with you personally so we couldn 't even tell our colleagues what we were working on and why my chief technologist he went home every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apple 's elliptic curve encryption and he would have to tell his wife that he was watching a video in the study that he actually was just watching online videos so because he couldn 't tell anyone and then it came to the night before the launch and lock and I was still at the airway office and we 've been told that it would go live at midnight and we 've moved we 've moved everything to production and we said why don 't we just give it a go I 've got it I 've got an American Express card so we put it in the payment went through successfully and I called up our our good friends at American Express and said ah just checking has a the life Apple pay transaction just came through and they look to it yes it did very cool indeed so guys if you haven 't heard of Apple pay we will cover it off briefly in tonight 's session as well so lots of different you know little bits of cool technology emerging as you know thanks try and compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology available so we 'll cover off some of that stuff tonight remember that this program is all about improving where you 're at now so it doesn 't matter if you know the concepts tonight a completely new to you or if you know you know you 're an old hand using online banking or bank feeds or whatever this program is all about improving where you 're at right now so learning something moving up a level etc as we progress through the levels of the program you know it gets a little a little bit more advanced each time so the state of the nation we 've got more than 14 million Australian banking customers in all this 2016 that we 're doing that banking online so to put that into perspective I think the population of Australia is around 26 or 27 million so we 've got more than half our population doing some kind of online banking in August 2016 which I just find staggering Stuart I mean you obviously would have lots of in lots of stats on on this kind of thing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all quite closely matches the there 's 17 million credit cards on issue in Australia well that people can people can know people can use to pay online so yeah look australians are great a great adopters of technology but it 's that last point that is most important to me we are just moving to the mobile platform hmmm that is where people want to be both purchasing engaging with businesses engaging with their banks and all the research from from research like people at KPMG or forest are showing that mobile platform is that the platform of choice for people today absolutely and from our perspective as an agency I mean we see it just in simple things like you know what people are using to visit websites like if you go back a couple of years probably going back for years you might have had you know 10 or 15% of your overall web traffic you know coming through on a mobile device these days it 's much more like 50 or 60 percent so it 's really really important cool so why should we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to you know walking into the bank using a teller getting cash out and I guess transacting in the traditional means give us some I guess advantages of banking online should oh well what we do everything online now look say it 's accessible when you 're you know when you 're available I mean we all work much longer hours than than in the past and you know the nine-to-five bank hours just don 't work so now we we do we online bank to pay our bills to see our pay to even even right up to organizing home loans now and you know I recently recently had a home loan with or applied for one with IMG and you know they 're on one platform really was that workflow you knew where you 're up to you saw that you supplied the documents online you know so I ever even had to go into a branch so the advantages of being able to engage with your financial institution when you want to at a time that 's convenient is one of the key advantages I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight that are already using online banking and think oh wow you know I 'm already all over there 's something using online banking for years but you would be surprised actually as to how many local setting closed businesses and you know people living on the coast that we 've encountered that actually still aren 't doing anything online for whatever reason perhaps they 're concerned about security or what-have-you but some other advantages of I guess doing your banking online is that it 's really easy to save payee so you know if you 're paying stuff or you 've got to transfer funds to your son or daughter or whoever it may be you know they can be saved within your online banking portal so it 's really quick and easy to pay them a lot of banks these days have mobile applications which make it really really simple to do on the run if you 've got a transfer money between accounts because you know you realize that your credit cards maxed out or you know you 've had a payment come out of your main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be you can do that on the run really really quickly even whilst you 're standing at a counter ready to ready to pay for something of course you can keep a close eye on your balances cash flow money in money out you know international transactions etc best of all it 's available 7 absolutely and if I could just just touch on one thing you mentioned it in their security mmm if people have concerns for security this is one term I want people to come away with tonight but the technical term is called two-factor authentication and it 's about when you log in whether it 's you 're logging in to your email logging in to your bank and what two-factor authentication is that 's when you have another code go to a device so instead of it just being you username and password two-factor authentication where you put in your username and your password and then it 's asks you for a code it may send the code to your mobile phone via SMS or the bank might have an app where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and that I just take nothing else away from tonight I want to understand that two-factor authentication is where they should in gay is what they should adopt but for all their platforms because it really is makes make it increases the security exponentially from just a username and password absolutely so we 'd love you to text chat in guys let us know if you 're currently using online banking what you 'd like about it what you don 't like are using it for both personal and business do you use online banking via desktop only a mobile device and app let us know we 'd love some feedback so that we can cater tonight 's content as much as possible to the audience we 've got listening radio so considerations when looking at online banking there 's lots of considerations essentially you 've got to shop around so where do you already bank what options do they have available do they already have you know an internet banking option most banks these days most decent-sized banks these days will have an internet banking option some better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good mobile app or is it user friendly on mobile is using online banking via mobile and important factors for you another consideration is you know whether you move money between accounts make payments pay bills view be pay etc so is your bank going to give you options to do all that kind of stuff to save payee I know some banks such as A&Z you know you can save such payments first things like wages and things like that which you know really can save a lot of time and a lot of human error when it comes to just simple things like paying wages in your business in the same token something else to consider when looking at online banking is online banking limits so for instance just to give you a very personal example we recently changed our mine banking because our previous provider only gave us a 5,000 a day pay limit so when we were paying suppliers and staff etcetera like that we had a 5,000 a day limit and we really outgrew that so we changed banks and I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can be in control of that so they 're the sort of things that you might want to think about Stewart have you got anything to add on this front I would look I was just someone someone asked a question about Apple pay and whether that they would take over from the banks well look I 've slept very slowly I mean the banks that the Australian banks certainly have a secure position in Australia because as as Paul pointed out only a.m. there the name American Express support Apple pay me are but Apple announced today a new product called Apple pay cash so to allow peer-to-peer payment actually yes over time where over time I in the next years I think we will see greater online sort of banking offerings from the tech giants of Google and Apple and and Samsung but right now look dark what he said is excellent yeah cool so other things some banks also offer online budgeting tools which can be pretty cool other banks like Stewart touched on earlier you know you can actually open a new account really really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings account sir I don 't know that holiday is saving for a business loan that you were paying or you know just so that your squirrel squirreling away money to cover you know in Christmas period or whatever it may be some banks offer a really easy way just to open a new account without having to go bank and all the rigmarole that goes with it and so we 're just going to look at some of Australia 's most popular internet banking choices number one ranked through info choices actually Commonwealth Bank cba according to Nielsen research 7.3 million Aziz in August 2016 were logging into internet banking through Commonwealth Bank they 've got an app as well which is really easy to use they offer pay wave and have and go shopping as well as a pay tags ticket for iPhones just so just to explain some of that pay wave is obviously where you can tap and go your cards to purchases under 100 rather than having to enter your PIN or even you know choose one account you just wave your card over you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay way we can do it all sorts of things like even parking meters these days or you know Airport parking and things like that pay tag is sort of similar but it 's like a little sticker that you can pop on your phone for example so that you don 't even need to carry your cards with you you can just swipe your phone and achieve that the same outcome Commonwealth Bank customers can also withdraw cash from an ATM without using their card at loads through toddlers cash functions on the app so they 're the most popular here in Australia then we 've got nabbed you want to tell us a little bit more about NAB sure yeah look navigate when we get to the e-commerce section now I say that the bank behind most of the e-commerce companies including it a way and strife is now NAB you know of the big four banks has has one of the most advances dance product lines allowing flexible things like dynamic descriptors which is where you can change the dynamically the message or that goes on people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been partnered with our National Australia Bank for many years so online no I mean as you say Commonwealth is that the most popular I use aimed it and this will get to those in a second yeah definitely said never was ranked number two Nielsen 's research in August last year remember I then similarly actually just coincidentally I also use and then it came in number third with 4.9 million users in August last year they 've got quite a cool can rule no on my budgeting tool as well that you can use their business or for personal purposes and as we touched on earlier as well they actually support Apple pay which just means that you know you don 't have to actually have your card on you it can be hooked up to your iPhone through Apple pay and they out they have three aims it actually has three apps for Android and tooth or I the the iOS the Apple phones and m1 there 's mobile pay which allows you to register a card on your phone to use as tap and go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transact online and and then they have their security one so that as I said that two-factor authentication so every time I want to make a payment up sizable payment I ends ed shield that 's what it 's called and they 'd shield every time I have to do a sizable online payment and it makes including the shield code club so we got West part number four we can probably skim through these you know obviously these are the big four banks but most you know most banks and credit unions these days will provide and on fine solution it 's probably no doubt that these four big players are the most popular because they 've probably got the most customers here in Australia as well but they 've also got big budgets to invest into technology and you know making sure that they 're delivering you know it 's the most amazing user experience when banking online and if you would like to confirm you know compare different options available visit this link on screen at the moment that info choice or calm today you Ford banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare different transaction accounts from some illustrative biggest banks and credit unions so a little bit of a screen shot there you know customer service might be another consideration another consideration for you so you know it might not necessarily be about what you can do online it might be more about you know whether that financial institution is accessible for support when you need them and that can be a big consideration rightio so now we 're going to have a little bit of look at Bank feed so you know let us know on the chat if you 're already using bank feeds in your business if you know what they are whether you 've never heard of them we 're just going to run through what they are and tell you a little bit more about them I would like to let you know that webinar six which is next Tuesday evening is dubbing deeper into business accounting and payroll so we will be covering off in a little bit more detail you know online accounting solutions whereas we just sort of glossing over it at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then things really are a game changer for small business so what they what they do is you know gone are the days of having to you know mentally you know menu Li keep books of you know your comings and goings from checkbooks etc then you know some people might have moved to you know even a desktop version of my of or even online cloud-based solutions like zero or my own cloud solution and you know may have been importing bank statements or still mentor and manually entering transactions what that feeds do is they allow you to automatically import account transactions directly from your bank so this is really really cool basically every day your accounting software syncs with your bank calls in all the latest transactions via income or expenses another really handy tool is that you can actually create rules so for example if you you know hey there 's a transaction on your credit card to Qantas or Jetstar you know you can serve a rule so that 's automatically coded in your chart of account as the travel expense for example so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in data entry which which is pretty cool and we way actually has a bank seed to zero so yeah let me know if you are selling online through through any online platform and the transactions are processed through anyway we we feed that straight into Xero to our merchants yeah and that 's an important point actually because in what we do with the creative collective you know you 've got we 've got clients with you know ecommerce solution selling products online and a big frustration of theirs is you know getting transactions from their website into their accounting software so you know if that transactions going through anyway then that 's one way of actually getting that transaction into their accounting software but you know again later on service sort of webinars down the track will be covering off things like automations and stuff like that as well so if you 're on the call tonight and that 's one of your frustrations and tune in for future webinars so how Bank feeds work basically you know you voluntarily good Commission 's through your software to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank link or a third-party provider different the bank actually determines which type of feeds you can set up you can as Stewart mention there you can have feeds for like a wave feed for the PayPal for your credit cards for you you know everyday transaction accounts and all sorts have you got any more detailed information you 'd like to sort of add on on that front sure no now look you 've covered it if you if you put a way where Bank is in the bottom right that we work the same way as the bank absolutely so if you are already using an online accounting program and you want to know if your bank provides a feed no doubt if you are using Xero or my own perhaps your accountant Azure you push you in this direction but the links on screen which will also pop it into the resource portal for full program participants around a moment 3G with my headset so with zero for example there 's probably approximately about 70 Australian banks and financial institutions that are supplying direct feeds to zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I was actually a little bit surprised because I thought I just I guess perception I thought that zero would be sort of the leader of the country but in fact it was actually well goes to show you don 't always know everything okay F cos this is definitely one for Stuart to you know be miss cross over to East Europe so the so f Tyson is East card press the difference between online and selling online is card not that 's called card not present because there 's a higher risk of people just entering their credit card details onto a browser whereas F pass the F pass system is the bank 's own system to take card present payments and so the fees you pay to your bank to take a card present payment is much lower per transactions whilst they still certainly have fees to to give you the terminal because these terminals that that just as a bit of trivia if a business wants to create a new terminal like in that picture it costs out a million dollars in certification costs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed quite a while ago but tonight but yet for your business taking card present payments is a really is really good especially for higher value transactions because the percentage our transaction see is much lower when we can do it through the F process that 's all major banks offer and and I think there 's a slide coming up on some of the mobile options as well which is certainly gaining popularity yeah absolutely so I believe there 's also private companies that can offer solutions as well I guess if you 're a business and you 're not currently offering escorts to your customers it 's one of those things that you need to weigh up that if offering that solution and the fees that come with it to you as a business owner you know our way perhaps the extra income that is going to generate by providing you know the convenience of an escrow solution so rather than only accepting you know cash payments if you 're in a bricks-and-mortar style business not even necessarily bricks and mortar I mean if cost is a solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tech side you know a mobile coffee van or if you 're tradesmen you know going out to do jobs and you know typically you do you know the the old paper invoices I mean that sort of stuff is just so easy to lose track of you know there 's no automatic reminders or things like that I mean how cool would it be if you couldn 't go and complete you know a job at someone 's house or at their business and you know before you even walk out the door you know you can actually receive payment for that job through a portable F pass solution you know it makes life a whole lot easier it 's good to cash flow and it saves you a whole lot of stress Kim in decorating as well can you tell us a little bit more and steward about portable solutions for F course I mean that there may be businesses on the webinar tonight such as you know someone that might sell goods or services at markets or you know like a tradesman or perhaps a cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's there 's quite a number of solutions and it 's quite a dynamic space because these have really come along in the last two to three years so I 'd hesitate to even say which is is is the leading one because they there 's so much innovation still happening in this mobile payment space the the one on the write the square device you know is certainly the Silicon Valley backed real innovator in this space but they 're still under there still only have an interim sort of operating agreement in Australia but look if I was any if I had to take payments I would absolutely have one of these because Australia tap and go in Australia has is the highest take up in the world my Australians have just so embraced that tap and go for transactions under 100 where you don 't even need a team yeah our adoption is a it has exceeded anywhere in the world so and I see it I see it out it shops especially the the Jen the Jen wise they just don 't carry cash you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a drink at a bar we see them they just want to tap I absolutely love it I mean it 's so absolutely lazy but I I just love the fact that I don 't have to enter my pin anymore and I don 't know about anyone else but I 've actually gone to use my card before and how to complete another mind link of what my opinions despite using it every day you know and tap and goes the answer to my prayers are you 're not alone they 're cool alright so I mean obviously s price is you know a great solution if you 're you know doing business with people face to face but what if you 're a business and you 're wanting to branch out you want to do business beyond the Sunshine Coast beyond you know your immediate area you want to be transacting with anyone no matter where they are in Australia all over see what are our options this is really your domain all the world exactly in all the world and that 's where Australians Australia who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia open up to us you know that day is such a demand for the high quality goods that we create in Australia and just see the success of that like Blackmore 's or Bellamy 's which is the baby formula company out of out of Tasmania you have the demand for their products from China is just so enormous because they so trust our quality standards here in Australia so if you make a product I you know yeah so the world is becoming flat and you should give the rest of the world that opportunity to buy your product and if you are going to do that you know you 've picked it right that these four these four companies one of the any of these four companies can help you get there of course anyways there but I have great respect for our competitors that you 've listed here and we are all slightly different there 's there 's there 's slight differences between why you 'd come to the different companies now stripe is is the the tech leader as in there there 's fact they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is push their valuation into the stratosphere and and their strength is this really abroad API application programming interface now if you don 't know what an application programming interfaces but you know then you probably don 't need what stripe or offering either technologist if I 'm trying to do the the absolute cutting edge of payments strife is where I 'd go anyway we 've always prided ourselves on easy helpful human so if you 're just starting out in the e-commerce space anyway unlike our competitors we offer a phone number and you can talk to our customer care team any day and find out about online payments and how you can get there and that that 's that 's been that 's how he way has grown to be the leader in Australia is just through helping people who say who phone and say I really want to sell my goods online how how do I get there I Square as I said is supporting people taking card well taking payments in person not quite card present yet and PayPal what PayPal is the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not everyone not every Australian wants to use PayPal so we always said at one of our one of the ways most successful campaigns was don 't use do both and that would be my recommendation to anyone don 't narrow it you are abroad and the payment options yet you 're offering so when people come to your site to buy your goods right now right now yeah PayPal anyway because in the future you know then you get to put Apple pay Apple Apple cash and eventually probably a crypto currency like Bitcoin or Hysterium which we 're probably really going to bamboozle if some people in the webinar talking a bit currency tonight you know probably an topic for another time but you 're absolutely right you know they 're probably you know payment options that we 're going to see you know popping up more and more online in the future and I 'm totally with you on that point that you know why choose one when you can use multiple most like when we 're talking more ways to transact online a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know plug into your website so you can take transactions online now lots you know usually you might be able to offer sort of a way in PayPal stripe and PayPal or either way enough to pay which will cover off in a little bit more detail later on but really it 's about providing ultimate convenience for your customer maximizing the chance that they 're going to purchase through you because of that convenience or because you offer the way that they like to pay I 'll also add to is 20 I 've heard lots of schools of thought where you know there 's still a whole realm of people that use PayPal because it 's just such a well-known international and trusted brand that you know if they 're still a little bit dubious about transacting online you know that they 're willing to espouse offered and you know in the past we 've had clients that you know have sort of added PayPal back into the mix you know just for that reason that there are some people that just know that name and trust it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know know the e way the e way name and trust out or stripe or or what have you so things you could sell online really the opportunities here are endless products you stock are obviously you know the obvious thing if you you know used to retail product wholesale products perhaps you you know sell tickets to events perhaps you 're a service provider and you know you sell your time selling online consults lots for example allowing people to book and paper appointments online could be know what you 're selling memberships subscriptions you know you can accept their nation 's you know make venues bookings or facility bookings pay deposits you know the opportunities are endless that should love to hear some of the you know the different sort of things that you 're seeing people selling online that might not necessarily be on this list any curly one ah look fashion fashion is a big one online it 's certainly the leader is our electronics say Cogan Cogan we process all of Cogan 's transactions so if anyone 's ever bought from Cogan it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread alcohol and and food certainly with the new things like menu log or eat now or services like catch of the day these are these are huge component of online sales in Australia and and look as big as our online is you know it 's it 's growing at ten percent a year it 's still only seven percent of all retail in Australia so you know the chance to grow that the opportunities for growth are just still huge in the online space yeah definitely I mean there 's all sorts of things people sell adult products you know online I mean if you 're a you know a business and you 're thinking you 're on the webinar tonight thinking what Kyle you know it 's really just like knowledge particular an e-book you could sell you know white paper and evil you know there 's some digital products as well and you know there 's lots of Handy tools where you know they purchase products and it actually issues them with you an electronic product might be PDF download or whatever it may be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're currently selling online what are you maybe planning on selling online or you know what else could you potentially sell online so you know I mean the whole nature of these webinars is that you apply you know the content of what we 're talking about and you know you get those ideas buzzing so we 'd love to hear them sorry I think I might have a little bit of a delay here there we go sorry I was there so um PayPal could you take us through PayPal as a solution we covered it off in a little bit of detail but um what are the pros and cons here absolutely look PayPal a huge consumer facing brand well known bye-bye-bye consumers everywhere also in that that top right picture offers a device called PayPal here which allows you to take credit card payments that the a great place to start but they 're there see that the reason they are very comprehensive service but they do charge for that so as people grow they tend to move move on from PayPal we find that actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know how much volume they 'll be selling online for example they tend to start out with a solution like PayPal it 's it 's relatively quick and painless to set up you don 't need merchant accounts and things like that which will tell us a little bit more about shortly but it 's nice and easy you set up an account you link it to an existing bank accounts you put after a little bit of a verification process but it 's quick and easy to set up the fees can be a little bit higher but it 's a good starting point just to gauge volume and you know we 'd always recommend any way that you do a little bit of an audit anyway on whatever solutions you 're using say on an annual basis we have any transactions you 're taking online you know what the income from those transactions are or the value of those transactions make sure you 're on if you 're not using PayPal and you using the lights of any way or stripe or you know other gateways available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan with that with that organisation and you know you might find across deficiencies that way as you grow but PayPal is nice easy easy to set up starting point just to gauge volume and you can always step it up a notch from there absolutely and look I should just tell people now I have an account with each of these businesses I have a PayPal merchant account I have a stripe I have a square and I have an anyway you know for all the different things maybe they all have their strengths and weaknesses so on the stripe as I said it is it is a US tech company and as a technologist we have great respect for stripe and in their business and their technology and what they can they can do but yeah our competitive advantage against them is that easy helpful human you know there is no phone number to call subscribe I guess there 's a time and a place for all of these applications and it 's just weighing up what your needs are in your business and you know if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things like that or really intricate needs maybe stripes away to go if you know more important to you is that you 've got that support and that sort of human you know human touch point then you know maybe arrays the way to go but I guess our role in delivering these webinars is to give you to give you options just sort of gloss over each of the options so that you can go and do you know your own due diligence as well and work out what 's right for you and of course thank you a full participant in the level up program then you know you 've also got access to mentors and you know the the online Facebook support group as well where you can lean on some of the other members um square so we touched on this one as well I 'm probably less familiar with Square actually so yeah quite informal here a little bit they are pushing the boundaries of the bank 's as I said when it comes to F Foss and and you 're right you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square have come into the market and as really they out of disruptor you know they their device is is far cheaper and more available than anyone elses like you can pick up their device from office works from from Bunnings I like that look it 's not on there but I 'm pretty sure you could buy a square device from Bunnings Wow look they are disrupted i full respect for for what they 've done if you if you just need to take a few payments sometimes you need to take card payments that they look at their price point where when you as you say when people do their own due diligence they 'll find that well it 's it 's so much cheaper than what anyone else could do pretty sexy looking devices we have definitely got a bit of Apple s core like global look absolutely and I have one as I said like is all of all of our competitors products as well because each has its own advantage cool all right anyway I believe serious slight delay on the transition of slides here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are a way is Australia 's largest we have the most merchants and we we price one in four online transactions in Australia is processed through anyway but also what we this is where we have an API and you can integrate against that if you want to do cutting-edge payments but we we have plugins to the three hundred top shopping carts and the e-commerce platforms like Neto or Magento so people are setting up their shop on Neto Magento be commerce WooCommerce they 'll find the e way plugging in on those platforms and all they do to do is select it putting the key that they get from e way and away they go make it simple so guys with you know these solutions that PayPal a wedding stripes you are going to be paying a fee for the convenience of that to put it into perspective do it we were having a conversation earlier about how you know at least 1% of that is going between banks right that 's right look this so let 's let 's talk about that 1.9 percent plus 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 1.1 percent of that is just back is called interchange fee it 's for fee between the issuing bank the bank that issued the credit card and the bank that is the Merc the acquiring bank civil mention and and the 20 set there 's this this is a global network controlled by Visa and MasterCard with a few key switches like companies you 've probably never heard of like first data or Miggs you know so all of that chips away the last fractions of a percentage what you 're paying for is those integration I mean that that 's effectively what it for anyway our what you 're paying for a way is to help us get you that internet merchant facility and we 're going to talk about that a bit more and because we 've given you a plugin that 's going to make it easy yeah absolutely so um yeah so you know visa you know probably a little bit much of a muchness from a solution solution you know sometimes they can be a setup fee or an annual an annual fee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know maybe estimate how many if you already transacting online do a little bit of research to work out how many transactions did you do in the last 12 months and what was the value of that and sort of I guess compare what that might have cost you in fees across some of these different platforms you know if you 're starting out and you haven 't transacted online before perhaps you might start something with something like PayPal and add a rayon or Nestor ipon later on down the track or perhaps you might look to using one of these other gateways straight up but starting off on one of the lower plans so it really just comes back to do due diligence don 't jump into it really merely do research and work out before I be best suited to your business now this I think is just a game-changer it 's a massive trend we 're seeing is pop up on so many more sites you guys might have seen it on sites that you 've been on and not sort of I 'm stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know you have do lots of transactions online using expenditure so this is a buy now pay later solution you know the pay is after pay those of others on the market as well but take a taste through this are you right it is a game changer and I just this guy we as part anyway has partnered with zip pay on this so that that 's just the commercial arrangement that 's in place but look they are they are a game changer and not just online you know that in store as well and having looked through the the terms and conditions of both Lucas is great for for consumers it 's great for the merchants because the price that the the consumer sees is is that book you know four payments of this or or just pay get now pay later it 's another line of credit but also the flexibility these companies are going to offer some merchants look we 're you know credit card payments are still you know in this ecosystem controlled by these global Giants of Visa and MasterCard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the sort of products that they 're going to be able to offer merchants going for it will be really flexible and really innovative yeah cool tell us because I 'm sure there 's probably business owners on here wondering if they if I had an online store and I was going to offer the pail or after pay do I as the business owner do I get the full payment up front and then these organizations chase the customer you know most months of the payments right I still get paid up front like there 's no not you name you do get paid up front there 's a there 's a percentage the merchants that of course like like anyway there 's our centage you know fee on the transaction but absolutely the rest into your hand and then it 's up that the company takes that risk to to chase people up well but but you know the I look at the the fees the fees they 're charging for that for the consumer is very reasonable but compared to the credit card rates that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just on this next slide which is just you know perfect example for know how after pay was a game changer for one business but I mean how cool is this is a concept that you know customers get the ability to pay for a product pay a product off stay over you know fortnightly payments or four monthly payments for example but you as a business owner get that money up like I just see this is a total GameChanger next to the industry here 's an example so this is from an online an online Facebook group like a business networking group Donna that I 'm in is about 47 members this is quite literally a post from last week so this particular lady let out these health obvious reasons she that I don 't know why I put after payoff so long this amount of orders has gone out every day this week since adding up pay on some day so in a few days she you truly these were all the additional orders that she had just from people that used after pay now as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of her business and you know how much traffic she gets and you know normal amount of transactions in a day but you know if you have that many extra orders in a week would paying a little bit extra in you know fees for the ability to have that service on your website would that be worth it if it rates in a whole lot of extra income and these are the things that you 've got to think about absolutely can I did I say look I run workshops we serve so anyways customers over the years and that these sort of online successes are out there literally and I literally had a merchant once say to me this lovely lady and she she sat through she asked some really good questions during the workshop and then I approached her after Anderson also which business is yours and she told me and she said you know I actually now have more money than I ever thought I would I just want someone to come and run it for me now these are this is there 's real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still goes to work five days a week you know these success stories are out there very cool indeed guys I 've just noticed on the chat that to raise you were having a few issues with sound cutting in and out I don 't know if that 's a localized issue to raise or whether other people are experiencing that if other people are experiencing that just chat in and let us know I am doing a dual recording of the webinar just in case we do have any sound issues and if we watch it back and that is the case then will of course make sure that everyone gets a copy of the webinar to watch back with listicles down we can also say a few more questions that have come in but if everyone 's okay I might just save them up to the end when we cover off questions and tackle them all at once cool so guys if you are just you know embarking on perhaps a POS system point-of-sale system you 're looking to you know start transacting online at cetera these guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the big players in the point-of-sale space started on the Central Coast by Sunshine Coast guy Aaron Blackman I believe and so they offer you know basically solutions so they can look at you know what you 're doing in your business what your situation is it set try and make recommendations to you on perhaps other she 's may install point-of-sale systems or mobile point-of-sale systems they also do you know some smart sort of inventory control and things like that which is another bugbear that we 've seen actually with e-commerce businesses is you know if you 've got say a bricks-and-mortar you know fashion store but you 're fulfilling that same stock online how can you manage inventory as if it was all you know sitting in the one one place and that 's where you know a company like retail express may be able to assist you online merchant facilities so I noticed one of the questions that 's come in is in relation to whether you simply you know hook up a gateway solution with a bank account now this can get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have sure you know presenting tonight and can it kind of be miss this for us but my understanding correct me if I 'm wrong Stewart something like PayPal you can link within existing bank account that 's something like a way or stripe you do need a special merchant account exactly right well that that 's changed quite right no it you can definitely come to II way now and we will we will give we will give you that on that the internet merchant facility is the technical term for it but you do you do to be able to take credit card transactions you need to go through a credit process because the needs to show that that your your you 're the right type because it says line of credit being able to take money from the seventeen million credit cards on issue in Australia and the tens of millions more around the world there is a bar to get over but companies like a way make that easy for people they are and you can apply to us and we 'll take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that probably sums it up quite well that if you you know receiving funds before you actually you know handing over a product then obviously it 's like a line of credit and so you know if you go to a bank and open up a merchant account you know that they do want to see some verification and you know you 've got a sort of chicks and things off a checklist to be able to get approval for that but cool to know that anyway also offer merchants facilities and things like that as well now as well cool so we 're almost to the end of the slides would love you to text chat in and let us know if your business is using any of these systems to sell online already or quit let us know what ideas you 've got fuzzing some major e-commerce platforms so you know all of these are on the screen will integrate with paypal away stripe etc so these are major sort of e-commerce platforms the popular go to you know tools that people use to actually set up ecommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got Shopify Shopify is both a content management system meaning that you know you manage your website and your content for Shopify but also you know provides the platform you know that the e-commerce platform as well where you know you set up your products all that kind of stuff and you link it with your gateway being e-waste right etcetera we 've got WooCommerce the WooCommerce is a free plug-in that you can use with your WordPress site if you 've got a WordPress website there 's lots and lots of add-ons that you can actually plug in as advanced features to WooCommerce or other plugins that are compatible with WooCommerce so really the sky 's the limit there we 've got Magento so Magento is another really really popular e-commerce platform so content managed system yet quite sort of you know Advanced Options with Magento as well big commerce is another popular one and nature is one that we 've seen really emerge in a couple of years and I actually think from a web development perspective in the in the e-commerce space Lido 's definitely definitely want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know integrations with things that you might be doing outside your website like google adwords and compress that as well so look just some of them they 're obviously if you don 't already have a website and you 're looking to get into the e-commerce space you know talk to some web developers you know get a couple of opinions get recommendations you 'll find different web developers prefer different platforms for example where as a company we tend to work mostly with WooCommerce for web sites that we develop but you 've got other specialists that work with Shopify etc so yeah that 's just a little bit of an overview there and but if you don 't have a website and you don 't have the budget to get a website you can actually also sell on Facebook so sure you want to tell us a little bit more about this is a solution yes look social selling that through social is certainly become along and it 's really about having a very focused product offering in social so really it 's about showing your product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether that like the examples on the screen you know cycling the community as is surfing and so it 's not just about having that broad offering on social it 's about engaging with with those communities and and and showing your products in in context and there 's some over the years look I just one that always pops them on this show PO a great business that I got even sure is anyway merchants but just someone who 's done a great job of showing her products in context and and really growing a great business she 's an absolute powerhouse Jenner is actually the owner behind Teahupoo she 's probably only 25 years old and in fact that business group that I shared the example from earlier was actually started by Jane Lou funnily enough who 's the founder of Shoko coincidentally in the interest of time I know we 're a few minutes over guys but we 're pretty much at the end of the slide deck now and we 're going to just cover off a little bit more about the level up program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case study on the Sunshine Coast Scandic cafe the local cafe using point of sale software that software means that for the transactions that they take in the cafe feeds directly into their Xero accounting six hundreds of hours in bookkeeping and data entry but it also speeds up reconciliation at the end of the day and let 's face it if you 're a cafe owner or you know managing a restaurant or whatever it may be and you 're on your feet all day the last thing you really want to do at the end of the day is you know try and reconcile all you takings etc so certainly speeds up that process if you 're not happy with your current solution or you don 't have a current solution and do some due diligence check out some of the you know options that we talked about today good starting point is to go and talk to your bank or to talk to a point of sale specialist like retail Express you can even pop into places like I know there 's not one on the Sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole business team that can help you with you know point-of-sale solutions and things like that as well so there 's lots of options you know if you 're looking for where to go questions just before we do I just want to quickly cover up a little bit more about the level up program so we 're actually at level five this evening which is getting started with thanking online and point-of-sale systems so we 're not quite halfway through the program now the different topics are on screen there we cover off things like you know PBX phone systems and CRM how to automate some operations in your business which is definitely one of my favorite topics next week sorry in two weeks time we 're going to be covering off you know online systems and developing of you know companies we use and and things like that you know level 12 we 're going to be sort of looking at more reporting mechanisms and business KPI etc so really this program is covering the full spectrum of you know what you can do online now some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know perhaps just someone in your business that you feel might benefit from one of these topics which is where we can we come into the program here so look you can take bite-sized topics as you like these webinars are absolutely free to attend if you don 't attend the webinar and you want to access the recording later on and download it it 's a 25 fee so just by you know turning up on the night and watching it live it 's absolutely free we 're also doing workshops so we 've delivered one workshop already this three more to go potentially more to be added into the mix but basically each workshop is three and a half hours in Jewish duration covers three to four topics in a chunk its 75 per workshop if you just want to go as a one-off now the best value for this program as I touched on at the very beginning of the webinar this is a fully subsidized program by the sunshine crows council guys take advantage of it it offers an enormous value for two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that colleagues you know admin staff marketing people whoever they may be can participate in the full program so what you get is attendance at all the workshops for four people so there 's four workshops in total half a day H there 's workbooks and all sorts that come with them all of the webinars all of the recordings you get access to the online resource portal where we follow up with you know links and extra resources and things you know reinforcing any of the things we 've talked about on the on the webinars or throughout the topics but another cool factor which is where I think you can get a huge amount of value is if you 're a full program participant you can actually get access to some of the program mentors so these are various different experts across different fields and you can actually get one-on-one time with those mentors at absolutely no cost no extra cost just by participating in the program so it 's twelve modules twelve webinars those twelve webinar topics are also covered across four workshops resources workbooks etc through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know resource links there 's also a private Facebook group as well where you know all the participants of the program are there all the mentors are there and it 's a really great support network you know if you just want to kind of you know get a little bit more detail on the topic covered or clarify something these are some of the mentors of digital champions that are available to you if you 're a full program participant anyway in the interest of time I 'm going to jump back to questions if that 's okay with everyone so what have we got here there with me so got you there Stuart oh you do yeah I know and look that there 's my a ways giving a webinar that I 'm hosting next Thursday so people have questions on really advanced payments like crypto currencies where we 're going with invisible that that 's where so that 's next Thursday at 11 a.m. next Thursday the 15th of June so just you can find that through a wacom believe you yeah cool so um Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process Global Payments absolutely we can 't we could we could take if you with a way you can take payments from anywhere in the world yeah and Paul just to clarify you know it can be a little bit more complicated than just registering your bank details with the gateways so as we said with PayPal you can use any kind of bank account link that up still a bit of a verification process but for the likes of stripe anyway etc you will need a merchant account you can either enquire with your bank on the set up of a merchant account um Steve 's will differ from bank to bank anyway also office merchant accounts option there as well and great question as well again from Paul is whether you can also also schedule monthly gateway transactions ie for subscriptions or you know regular payments and things like that you can can 't use yeah and Paul the the technical terms that is recurring so if if you 're talking to your provider about that sort that yet monthly subscriptions and occurring and look II need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I were required by Global Payments client so valentina looks like you may have experienced some blanks in sound as well so we 'll definitely listen back and if we do have any issues we 'll try and fix them up before the webinar is recording but thanks for that feedback Andrew love the feedback so Andrew studies already realized more than his fee for the program so thank you so much Andrew you know this program is really just about giving objective information on all the options that are available to you no I mean yes we 've got Stuart from anyway he 's not but I think everyone can agree you know he 's really given a all around view of the options available you know without prejudice and that 's what this is about it 's just about giving you guys I guess the information to make informed choices or to sort of point you in the right direction on you know how you can do a little bit more due diligence and and there 's just a question by Valentina they 're on a limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transaction amount you can do in a credit card payment okay there are only limits based on the risk of a business so when you renew mer when you 're a new merchant with a gateway like a way that the sky isn 't the limit you need to talk to us about how big the payments are but at end of the business case for that but I could tell you there 's no technical limit if you want to if you want to take a payment for millions through a credit card it is absolutely possible very cool excellent well guys we 're a little bit over time it looks like there 's no more questions coming true so I 'd like to thank everyone very much for joining us on your Tuesday evening for the webinar would love to have you join us for next week 's webinar I believe I 'm also facilitating that one it 's actually on online accounting systems and payroll so if you 're you know using more of a desktop accounting solution or my gosh even sort of you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the webinar next week term to learn more about the program guide if you 're not a full program participant or you just like to you know find out a little bit more about future topics visit level up Sunshine Coast Queensland of a you I would like to thank Stuart for joining us tonight Stuart your expertise has been invaluable so thank you so much it 's my pleasure wonderful well thanks guys signing off the webinar will be available on the online portal within the next day hopefully and we 'll see you all next time have a great night"

actually may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening on the coast at the moment and it 's really important particularly for businesses to be very prepared for that rollout so we 'll take you through that tonight but just a little bit of a context for you in advance contender why the NBN is so important as a project you can see there 2.2 trillion dollars every year worldwide on annual online sales part of NBN is rolling out the infrastructure that will allow you guys to take even just a small piece of that large apply we know that the number of connected devices is growing more and more every year wearables devices tablets everything contributes to the amount of data that we use so we need quality infrastructure in place so that it can you can deal with the increasing data usage that Australia in the world has over the next few years we also know that over 3 now of customers referred actually conducts transactions online so if you 're not online to till about a third of the population you 're invisible so it 's really important that we have infrastructure that allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interact with you in a way that they choose and you can see they 're just about everybody uses the internet at least once a year to research products and services so that potential Bostonians use if you 're not using some of these digital tools to get online Deloitte conducted a survey last year to look at the digital maturity of the number of Australian small businesses and you can see what they 've done is basically ranked them into a number of categories everything from basic intermediate high and advanced and you can see that there on the screens of different categories that they place them into and the reasons why they categorize them as such what 's really interesting about PSN if you conduct the digital scorecard that the Queensland Government 's pull out that 'll give you a sense of where you are and at maturity scale that will be talked about it at a later date but what 's really interesting about that is we know that those that have a more advanced level of maturity see more benefits you know including 1.5 times more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's a whole vast array array of benefits to actually getting online and that 's why the program level up program is so important because it will help you to give you the tools and the skills to actually move that maturity process to be as profitable as you possibly can as efficient as you can in your small business so nvn is a really key piece of infrastructure behind that so the government has asked us to provide every single premises wherever it is in country with access to fast reliable broadband by 2020 and so the government 's are supposed to provide wholesales speeds of 25 megabits per second download and five negatives per second upload as a minimum every single person at home across the country so we 're providing the digital infrastructure that will allow those increasing number of devices the increasing amount of data that we 're using to actually make us a more digitally economic country so we 're actually quite a fair way through the roller more than 30 percent already complete we 're approaching five million premises that can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and to be able to connect and buyer in the middle of next year three and four people will actually be able to get a connection and there 's a huge amount of work already happening on the Sunshine Coast so if it 's not already in your area it will be very shortly so that preparation even if it 's not with you yet is really important especially to small businesses and there 's a number of technologies that we 're rolling out on the coast the government has basically asked us to roll out the technology which is the most cost effective and time efficient the majority of the Sunshine Coast build is farther to the node which is basically you might have seen some of the green cabinets popping up around your strength or your suburb basically a way of increasing the speed and capacity to every single home as you move outside of of the built-up areas there 's other technologies such as fixed wireless and to climb up there our satellite service as well you can jump online and anytime that Indian condo you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map there on the screen is the controller which comes from our rollout map on our website the purple is lies the Browns under struction and that purple will only increase so you can actually go on that website typing your address and it will tell you approximately when you can get an MDM service and the type of technology and what that will actually mean to you so I 'll encourage every person and business to jump on there as soon as possible so that they can get the full picture of what 's happening for their particular address so there 's a really important steps and it can be a little bit more complicated too or complex lots more things to think about for business to switch other services to the NBN then just a residential customer so the first thing to do is to check your address if you can 't get a service yet you can actually register on the website for an update and will actually let you know when you can get a service being the equipment and capability and compatibility is really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services will need to be migrated to the ambience or whether that 's facts security alarms fire panels with panels across machines ATMs whatever it might be needs to have a solution to be migrated to so it 's a good opportunity to do a teleporter on all of your services and make sure that you know what needs to be migrated how it needs to be migrated and to also look at the future picture so is there any of that technology that is now obsolete that you can consolidate to enable your business to profit into the future as you NBN rolls out now that 's a really important part because I 18 months after Neriah goes live the legacy copper network will actually be disconnected so it 's really important that you understand what those services are and to get them motivated before that 18-month window is closed because that may potentially result in you losing your phone number losing your email addresses any of those kinds of things which are critical to your business so really important to how to check your service provider as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a lot of small businesses that they just don 't know where to start particularly when it comes to switching to the NBN they don 't have an IT consultant if they 're not tech savvy where do I start so on our website there you can see NBN Condor you slash business there 's actually a really good business readiness checklist to enable you to basically chicken flick and choose services that you have to to be a leader in start on that journey of understanding what you need to do to make the switch so there 's a range of services that you can see conflict depending on what it is are you having your business so whether that 's just pure internet whether it 's a cloud services whether you do have an ATM on-site you can check those and what you 're left with them is basically a checklist that you can go through and provide to your IT consultant or to your service providers and say here 's all the things that I know that I need to have sorted and migrated across to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process so again I would encourage everybody to jump on the website complete their business readiness checklist well well in advance of the NBN going live because some of those processes will take some time and we 'd like to make sure that everyone 's got those in place before the disconnection period closes now unlike the current ADSL services where you get what you get with the NBN there is a range of options and speed tiers that you have so you can see there the NBN 25 50 and 100 they relate to download speeds so what you have an opportunity to do is is also to assess not just what your business uses now but what it might use in the future so if you intend as a business to use lots of very video rich content or you send large files or you have lots of people doing real-time face-to-face teleconferences then you might need to consider a higher speed here which provides you with higher capacity and higher capability of actually conducting those in in a reliable way and so again consider your current users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and speak your service provider about the most appropriate plan for you and your business a couple of quick quick case study so this is a guy called Noll who runs a fish farm outside of lager and you can see there basically as a result of reliable broadband through the NBA something really simple like being able to download emails in in when they 're actually sent instead of two or three days later regular contact with is his export partners overseas has allowed him to double his exports and increase his annual exports so his business is now more profitable just through having good reliable telecommunications and there 's probably lots of similar examples on the coasts where I 'm currently suffering from from poor telecommunication so we 're expecting that the NBN will have a significant impact on your ability to do business and another really simple case in where Conte has basically put all of the applications and all of their business processes into the cloud so the manager of this particular cafe is able to do everything that they need to do online and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that could be keeping an eye on milk supplies or checking that the latest delivery schedule but they can do everything that they need to do through some simple cost-effective hardware and software services and I know that part of this program is to talk more about some of those those programs that 's really all I wanted to say I 'm happy to be part of the Facebook discussion so if you do have questions jump on that Facebook page and we can get the answers to you sounds good thanks so much Ryan really informative a couple more things just on this topic if you aren 't sure what speed you have currently and I guess when Ryan talks about those faster speed how much faster that actually is go to speedtest.net don 't do this off your phone because it will give you the speed to your phone but rather on a desktop at your place of work or your home and you will get a score of downloads and uploads and if even that doesn 't make sense downloads are basically the speed at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image or Facebook or pull a PDF off an email and upload to the speed at which you can upload a file such as a text file to an email you want then or upload a video to dropbox so pretty handy to know what your current download and upload is and also to check what you 've got the NBN how much that hopefully improve there are a range of solutions and providers is ryan alluded to here on the Sunshine Coast so it can be a little overwhelming where to go personally I chose to stay with my current provider when I got the invent on at home just this week because I didn 't want to any muck around I just wanted faster internet and the quickest and easiest way they proposed that I go on a plan that was pretty basic and like I said give me your fastest plan and I don 't mind if it 's 20 bucks more a month because I know what difference that can make to my family and my business but this website or multiple websites here show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Facebook group to and talk about experiences you 've had with local providers probably good and bad so that you all know which is the best ones to go with I 'll highlight to the resource created by RDA or Regional Development Australia 's Sunshine Coast cool speed it up and they have on their websites digital Sunshine Coast come today you a list of NBN retail service providers and a lot of those resources I put in the online resource portal for this program so go check them out as Ryan said he 'll take questions in the Facebook group which is really generous of them so please feel free to ask them and you never know even if Ryan doesn 't answer straightaway because these are pretty busy guy might be someone else you know get your questions which is the benefit of a collective group as well these are some of the resources available on the program and P Prime 's really kindly provided bunches from NBN as well that 'll save you a little digging around but as if there 's is lots on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out as the NBN or other fast internet solutions are available in your area this is pretty important because as Ryan says if you don 't switch eventually it just will be cut off the Moghuls do it sooner rather than later not only that but a lot of the technologies we 'll be sharing in this program you really won 't be able to use or use at the level that you could if you had faster internet you won 't be able to enjoy them so decide on a provider get it implemented confirm once done tell the world on our Facebook group and we 'll all applaud you and know that you 've done your homework now just a few quick things on this level up program a lot of this information can be accessed on our free info session webinar which is available on the offense page of the level up website so if you 'd like to go into it in more detail I urge you to check out that recording at level up Sunshine Co Co Co au events but we 've just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future lessons level 2 level 3 lots of great stuff to go through and the format is always to have a topic expert that you can ask questions and pretty much run through content for about 45 minutes and open ask questions anything that can 't be covered in that time will answer in the Facebook group as well there 's lots of engagement options some of you might have just thought on this webinar to check out what this is all about and decide whether you want to do the program or not we don 't mind if you do that but you won 't get access to the recordings SS airily you can just come to workshops if you have listened to the cymbal and I really want someone has shown

    "text": "good evening everyone and welcome to webinar three for the Sunshine Coast Council level up program my name is Kat I am from the creative collective I have with me tonight one of your mentors Luke humble who will be presenting with me tonight on communication and collaboration tool to stay with me I 'm just going to get my screen into presentation mode excellent so you should have my slide deck on screen at the moment if anyone is having any dramas viewing or if my sounds no good for any reason just Skype in on chat and let us know so tonight 's webinar number three in the mix so last week we had working online which is essentially how to get online with the endian and get access to a range of sort of digital technology and tools that can help you in your business so level that women are three collaborating and communication online so the Sunshine Coast level up program just to give you a very brief run run-through for those that are new on the webinar tonight level our program is the Sunshine Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council to help small and medium businesses connect to the NBN where available and school utilize digital tools so over the course of this program we 'll be presenting on a range of different topics giving you you know little sort of bite-sized workshops on various different digital tools and solutions that you can implement in your business to improve productivity profitability efficiency and essentially you know ability to work within your business online where possible so this is my mug shot my name is Katrina Lee I 'm a partner in the creative creative collective so the creative collective we were successful in winning the tender to a design develop and implement the level up program in conjunction with our sister company the training collective so very very briefly I 've had been involved with the creative collective in some capacity since DDOT 2007 back where 10 years this year have to plan a party for that one and I 've been a partner in the company since 2014 so my background is actually in graphic design and marketing these days I pay more in the doodle marketing pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level up program and you will see a little bit more of me as the program progresses we have with us tonight Luther humble so I 'll hand over to Luke to give you a bit of an intro to him but he 's a very clever guy guy he 's a Queensland government digital champion which essentially means to get that accolade he 's very very active in the community with advocating for you know digital technology and digital upscaling etc so look over to you to introduce yourself properly and let the team know that you 're in good hands thank you very much Katrina so yes my name is Luke humble and I do have that wonderful title which is bestowed on me earlier this year I 'm actually one of around about 12 here on the Sunshine Coast and I believe the Sunshine Coast has the the most digital champions in one region than anywhere else across Queensland so go Sunshine Coast so we 're not good I 've been in this industry now for over 18 years and having built my first website back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South of France New Zealand in here in Australia in part of number of startup businesses and other businesses which I 've helped grow as well in various different industries but all of them being around the basis of technology and more specifically digital technology and how you can use that Jesus within your business to help streamline and communication such as obviously this webinar talking about another areas of the business as well so I 'm very much into using this technology to grow business and I have a big passion for it that 's for sure fantastic so these are just I guess some of the ways that you can use technology to communicate and collaborate online so guys have a look at the screen let us know if you 're using any of these let us know if we 've missed any I mean there 's hundreds of hundreds of different tools available but Luke you want to maybe run through some of the main ones here yeah definitely and firstly I 'd probably go bottom right hand side I want to how many of you people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands up now in the room so and definitely emails one of your and your ways of communicating but there are some other fantastic ones out here now a lot of people might be thinking that Facebook Messenger or whatsapp and going wrong why is that on there well it 's actually third pretty handy tools if you just change your your perspective around them they are about communication about instant communication and they 're with you all the time so you know sometimes it 's reframing how you use something in your life can actually help benefit without a doubt if we look at some of the group 's LinkedIn groups and Facebook groups and you know very powerful tools for collaboration and sharing information and obviously just below Facebook group spam which is on the bottom left-hand side of your screen you 'll also see Facebook for work which we 're going to touch on later on in this webinar and but going straight to the middle top right there Google Docs Google Spreadsheets Google presentation and this actual presentation here for the webinar is through Google presentations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk a little bit more about those later on to excellent friends um I 'll just mention that webinar for next week is actually on videoconferencing so some of the some of the tools that we 'll touch on tonight don 't freak out if you know it 's not too detailed tonight is a really a top-level look at some of the tools and technology available and as the program progresses we will bill deeper into some of these particular areas so I touched on this a moment ago but how does your business currently communicate online what new technologies could you potentially trial so you know is there something that you 've heard about in business that you 're not too sure how it works but you have heard it 's amazing for your particular industry or you know you 've heard that you know GCE is an amazing you know tool to replace the office 365 or something like that but you 're just not sure whether it 's right for your business so let us know on the chat if there 's anything that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some question time at the end to cover off individual questions there so this one here why isn 't email isn 't efficient and isn 't always necessary so I don 't know about you Luke but I get about 300 emails a day and I mean a lot of its junk that I can just you know go through and delete or or markers read but it 's still very very time-consuming to basically Wade my way through that are you in the same boat there well definitely definitely and the thing is is that emails are sometimes treated is these passing bits of data or information that can be sent and they somebody has a random floor or random question they 'll send it there you know if we 're talking about misleading subject headings or no incorrect attachments it 's just it opens up this it 's whole playgrounds where you can just be inundated with information you know the tools out there they 're pudgy sweets and they 're obvious resupplied which will touch a little bit more further on they try to you know work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a actually bringing certain emails that are around the same subject and conversation together to make it easier but even then it still can be really overwhelming NASA sure yeah totally and I know about you in your business Lutz but we find a major frustration for some of the clients that come over to the creative collective is pop3 email accounts that you know you can open and download email on say your laptop but then you know you transfer over to another computer at the office or you jump on your phone or your iPad and you know you have some emails on one system and not on other systems and it can be really really frustrating so that 's a massive bugbear that we find with traditional email and there are solutions around that as well yeah definitely definitely a lot of people don 't realize actually that there 's some different ways that emails can actually be let 's just say downloaded two devices you know that that pot or pop3 as it 's also sometimes referred to is about downloading and removing it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's an entire crime app which is it like leaving a copy of that letter in a lot of box and even still that the customers to manage where that data is and miserabie if it 's been read who 's downloaded it it 's just it can be a big riddle yep and so this is you know obviously really topical stuff when we 're talking collaboration so you know collaboration to me is is not just you know conferencing and and working with most people multiple people online but it 's being also to I guess think you know documents and things like that across multiple devices that no matter where you are what you 're doing you can access those same documents wherever you are so if you have to use email there 's lots of different options available I looked at an office 365 guy which is perfectly fine I 'm I 'm a gmail girl so with the creative collective we love our our Google suite of products Gmail being one of them now Gmail is a completely free option I mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 bigger bites per person for Gmail it 's backed up for free is super powerful you know it 's really good from a spam filtering system and you know there 's instant messaging you 've got Google Hangouts which we 'll touch on more in webinar 4 and that 's about you know video conferencing just like you know what we 're doing tonight you know you can drag and drop really amazing filter features you can put rules in place the other cool thing I love about Gmail is that you can actually plug in what is called labs into your Gmail so you know canned responses for example so I think I 'm probably getting a little bit of ahead of myself that we cover this further down the track but there 's some really amazing little tools and features that you can plug in to your Gmail to make that system even easier to you so things like yoke and responses that if she 's got you know that sort of response that you send regularly you can pull that in at basically a quick you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus you know being a Gmail a Google product sorry it seems really well with other Google products and it 's readily available on your phone so if you 're one of those people using pop emails or pop3 if you did move over to a Gmail based email system then effectively you can get the same emails on your on your phone on your iPad on your computer without a drama our top Gmail tricks so boomerang quick searches labels filters and canned responses so boomerang is pretty cool that if you need to highlight an email so it 's really easy to send you know 40 a mails in a day and you know unless you 're sort of rifling back through your sent items sometimes it 's easy to sort of you know forget that you need to follow up an email if you haven 't heard back and things like that the boomerang is a really cool tool where you can sort of set Gmail to remind you say in two days if you haven 't had a response or likewise if you 've received an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park it there at the moment you don 't want to leave it as unread but you want to get a little reminder that ok on Friday you know you need to reply to that you might be waiting to expect from another colleague to respond or something like that quick searches so there 's a lot of little shortcuts that you can use in your Gmail bar for finding a particular email so for me to try and wade through all those emails I get on a daily basis I use rules such as is unread Plus in my inbox folder or is unread and is a Google Calendar notification so I can sort of filter my unread emails based on those searches and then do a maths markers read or a masterly etc labels are really cool so labels is where you can you know basically add I guess your own colour coding or your own filing system within your inbox so you can use colors or particular text labels and things like that so you know you might highlight all your emails from clients as a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well I use filters a great deal so for example just use that example of you know calendar notification I can set up a filter that if it 's a calendar notification its bypasses the inbox and might go directly you know to my trash or or might go directly to a subfolder if it 's an invoice if it 's got me a word invoice in the subject it might go direct to an accounts related subfolder within my inbox so it 's pretty cool and can responses I touch them as well that if there 's regular emails that you send you know you can save them as a canned response and basically at the click of a button you can quick and easily pull that into the body of your email you know shopping change various bits as you need and send that also and there 's lots of tools for efficiency you can response against me I 'm just going to jump on as well yeah sure very good time-saver and the fact as you 're saying that those things that you typically have the similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can set up these these email responses just known as can messages so say for example you and you ask for somebody to update their account they tell you to book at a correct address you can have a can respond to thank them for updating their address with them rather than having to write out maybe two or three sentences or maybe Childre graphic times never if you something like that absolutely under their similar tools look with office 365 yes there are there are some the tools and some of them are actually built into office 365 and so it 's the same principle you need to activate them as an add-on or a plug-in lets say yeah there 's definitely they 're similar tools office 365 that allow you to do that and my team and italic creative do and do use the camera sponsors quite a bit where it is on standard requests or for information as such yeah very close might be personal at the end of the day though so when you know when you scan responses correctly otherwise you then become a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on human in your interest yeah very much on screen at the moment as some couple of tools that I say will save your life so I I use unreal me and I used same box and I absolutely love them so just to give you a little insight to the two of these unroll me is basically like a mess unsubscribed tool so I believe it 's free to use you punch in your your email address so if you 've got a particular email address that you just you know over the years you 've had for 10 years and you know you would just subscribe so many newsletters that you get stick of you know deleting or marking is read and you know there 's just so many of them to unsubscribe from unroll me basically you can pop in your email address it 'll basically search your email and work out what subscriptions you 're on and you can basically select all or select particular ones and actually unsubscribe yourself so there 's a similar tool webbley which is unsubscribed me which is another one sandbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this one does require a little bit of training if you like so basically you implement this and you have you know seen later seen archived and seen seen spam etc basically if you are consistently marking a particular email sender as read or as trash scene leader will recognize that behavior and automatically mimic that behavior on your behalf so in the early part I found it takes it took a little bit of training in the sense that you know I had to pop into those folders and just make sure that there was nothing that I actually needed to read that somehow was making it over there but you know with with a little bit of training early on that particular tool saves me hundreds and hundreds of emails every day which is really cool prosper works is a CRM that works indirectly with Gmail you can use it in your web-based browser or you can use it and plug it into Gmail so that 's pretty cool but yeah look I might hand over to you for some of your favorites in in the mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is that LinkedIn so for those user use LinkedIn it 's a business social network so not so much about sharing cuddly photos of yourself with your daughter it 's really about how you 're doing in your business in Korea and there 's actually integration between l-looking LinkedIn so that when somebody emails you it 'll actually connected to your LinkedIn account and if depending on whether you 're connected or not to them it 'll bring through their data and their information including a photo so you get a bit of background behind them their current some job title and some support so it 's really good for getting a lot of context about you know the person you having a conversation with because as I said before there 's a lot of people 's and email and one of them is you know you may not get enough context about who you 're actually receiving the information from and Evernote and is it 's a really good note-taking tool and it 's got lots of different levels to it I 'm not going to go too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration with the outlook which is really great that you can share that information and for those of you that know of and maybe even have use over for traveling around there 's an integration with Outlook for uber so based on meetings you can actually um schedule and call up and book uber to take you from A to B very cool okay so evaluating your company 's efficiency when it comes to how to communicate so we 're talking productivity tools now in many respects so I guess you know in terms of evaluating where your time goes in business on a day to day to day basis it 's much like if you are keeping a log book free car and I 'm sure there 's many you know business owners on the webinar tonight that a various points you know in a in their business life have to keep a log book to substantiate you their accountant of to you know how many kilometres you 're doing and where you 're traveling etc you know it 's exactly the same with your technology and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really cool for actually assessing where you 're spending your time in the business and where your team is spending their time as well definitely so on you know I actually ask myself this question and last year what am I actually spending my time on and it actually led me to to find into use the first one that list called rescue time so this is it 's actually plugged into my computer and it 's running all the time in the background you 're going to use the word time several times there are like and so it 's tracking everything that I 'm interacting with whether the web browser whether it be Outlook whether it be slack or Skype or using word and it recorded all this information it even looks at the websites that I go to in the browser as well and then I get this lovely reports and sent to me each month and you can see down your spree and then it gives me this breakdown about my productivity where my time was was spent now when you start to think about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how I spend my time oh well you know I just worked on emails for for half an hour this morning well you find that actually there 's probably more like 50 minutes and as part of that you have to jump onto website to get some information and so you end up in the browser and the portal not really Facebook you spend a three minutes this has everything it 's unbiased gives you get feedback and you can actually use this to make informed decisions there is a way that you can also implement this for apps for your staff as well so you can get a better context about how everyone 's working in the tools it does that 's why I kind of a bot but if you tweak it look and give some background nation so for example if you look at the middle bottom of the screen there says two hours 59 minutes on go zero calm so if you don 't like state a theorem is a final accounting software and I believe that 's going to be touched on want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ webinars you can actually stated that some business activity and so it recognizes that and then moves that into your productivity school which then increases yeah you can set some targets as well as they will probably my productivity score is 63% I 'm over there the rest of this month I want to increase taxes ability and it will help you along the line yeah very cool I myself reviews rescue home as well and I love it almost it almost becomes a little bit of a giant distraction itself sometimes you you know you 're sort of popping I will go or one productive this really unproductive today time same is time save is another one and I believe last week a bit briefly touched on Chrome extensions with you time save is the Chrome extension so you can add it onto your browser I 've got a screenshot here I mean this is just a sort of gimmicky screenshot so essentially if there 's particular size that you just know you get terribly you know distracted on Facebook for example or I don 't know you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever and you know you can block those sites out for particular time periods of the day so it 's almost like a timetable but you know when you 're going to access you know it sites for social youth I find the screenshots so amusing that you can you know fight the urge and not access that site or you can give in but you 've got to click the button 50 times so you 've got to be you know really committed to breaking the rules you I 'm actually break it yes and this one is actually a good one on top of recipe time because rescue time is about monitoring you give them feedback whereas time saver is about directly informing and manipulating you into your decision process about whether you want to save time or waste time so you know this is that next level next layer above what what actually rescue times up yeah absolutely and just to read happen if you work on webinar too you can basically just Google Chrome extensions and bring up the application in your browser be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some really cool little gadgets in there definitely they 're a bit like an accessories for us you know like a new watch or new necklace or something like that that 's exactly what Google extensions are around absolutely so there 's some other ones on here minute dog which is more of a sort of time tracking system in at Duke and I mean there 's lots of time tracking systems available you know there 's I actually did the research we were sort of migrating ourselves to a new time tracking system within the last 12 months and I was so overwhelmed that there was literally hundreds and hundreds available so a little tip here is work out you know whether in an ideal world that time tracking system needs to talk to any of your other systems so in our particular case we work with minute dot because it 's you know integrated really really nicely with zero and also some automation tools which we 'll touch on later on in the program as well trigger up on less experience with Luke have you got any experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit so it 's it 's a really good tool and if you 've got a client basically you need to manage the products on and track your time so think of it a little bit like your minute doc but just with deeper project management and analytics integration so it may be taking it the next level actually above what whether the minute doc does so it 's a really good tool I have played with it it wasn 't suitable and for what I was looking for for italic and but we have looked at it and recommended it to a number of our clients just because it takes the box them so it 's really good sort of that all-encompassing tool yeah so my just overarching recommendation on anything like this is there 's usually lots of differentials available in each category so do your research do due diligence you know sign up for trials and see how those systems sort of working you know with your other systems before committing to them I sort of feel like you you know you 're almost need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode which you know actively using them with real day-to-day stuff to get a feel for you know how user-friendly they are to use but some of the tools that will touch on throughout the webinar and throughout future webinars the ones that either ask or our you know mentors like Luke who are presenting have actually you 've tried and tested okie-dokie so a little bit of homework for you so we 're really curious to know how much time your team is losing and I get lack of efficiency or productivity due to email or perhaps you know other distractions in the workplace such as Facebook so use some of the technologies that we 've shared with you already and evaluate your situation if you 're a full program participant and you 've got access to the level up close Facebook group we 'd love your feedback on you know once you 've implemented these tools co-found them if you currently use them feel free to chat in it and let know how you find them but a little bit of homework there for you if you haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case study here Luke takes through this yes so and this lady here these three pigeons her name 's Amanda and she and she had an issue in her family whereby she was trying to work out what people are doing all at any one time and so she actually created a family calendar and the idea is that you 've got five columns at the top of each column you put a family name and you 've got the rows that represents a different day of the month and you 've got a month 's natural in front of you so it gives you a clear shot of what 's going on for that month the entire family you know students have used it for the different courses and you know couples have used it for their pets you know all those different ways of implementing it the problem that she was having in their business as it was growing as she was having her troubles both keeping on top of emails to all my customers because she was just doing on her own and she as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laptop and a mobile phone and just by just below her laptop to the right hand side there there 's also a wireless mobile dongle as well because she was actually quite quite regional where she was living so she had to rely on digital technology and to communicate so we used them a little bit like Ken responses for Gmail and set this up for her to help automate a lot of responses that she was getting customers looked at moving her to clown email so that her emails synchronized between her phone and a laptop which just that move alone we were mentioning about pop email and downloading and emails being on multiple devices but not synced geo certain one move alone help streamline her business dramatically but also helped her move our website to integrate with Xero for bookkeeping and that 's when you touched on later on in the level up program integrated with our website and also gave her some other tools to help track and time so all of these we actually gotten to talk all together which gave us an incredible powerful clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it collaborates so much easier and especially with the the print farm the designs or her calendars she had that on Dropbox which I can share that with owners and others to collaborate in which no different to using the the Doc 's facility in the G suite and it was about having those documents one place where everyone can work on them together so you know she 's really gone from strength to strength and instead of her going to the post office three dollars a day to post these things that she 's a she 's not going at all now instead of flying over to the printers and put stuffs all the print houses don 't she doing it in the cloud remotely of Commerce 's so it 's really given a lot of freedom a lot of you know these tools that we 're talking about the only way read during your business where you can really help optimize your workflow communicate IDO not just with your staff but also those externally to you maybe even your customers and once you find out where those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tools which will help sell them the special absolutely so you know with all these tools that we 're discussing some are free some are paid again it comes back to your due diligence and really evaluating how much time you know is that tool going to save you or you know how much money is it going to make you and your team and increased productivity sometimes you know an application that might cost a subscription of a hundred dollars a month is so worth it because it saves you you know 10 hours a week or even five hours a week or whatever it may be I will just mention two we mentioned trigger app now one of our digital champions on the program Andrea Martens I believe actually worked at trigger app so if you do have kind of questions on our application again don 't go to the Facebook group if you 're a full program participant and you know utilize our champions the likes of Luke and Andrea and some of the other amazing talent that 's available too rightio so over to collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen for you I don 't need to you know rehash on this but I guess from my perspective collaboration is just the ability to work simultaneously in real-time with multiple colleagues you no more than two people no matter where you 're located so you don 't necessarily have to be in the same room in our particular business we 've got people located all over the place I 'm based in Newcastle my business partner and the majority of our team is based on the Sunshine Coast so collaboration for us is you know using tools like Skype and Google Docs and being able to work as if we were you know sitting around the same computer or in the same room Luke what 's your spin on collaboration how you use it and your business yeah look at it some the collaboration sort of thing is so important and it 's been important since the day of businesses began we just have different way to collaborate now and because with such a globally connected world we forget that actually you know what it is ok for somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tools communicate now we 've got clients and in the UK and as we collaborate with them you know seamlessly all be able to fly time delay but some seamlessly on documents and information and our team is based here on Sunshine Coast you 're down in Newcastle I 'm I 'm often with Sunshine Coast you know having you and we collaborating on this so it really is about finding the right tools and then and helping each other to be efficient in the topic you 're trying to complete absolutely and I mean just to give you some practical examples you know technology has enabled you know healthcare practitioners to be able to give health consultations you know outside the immediate area that they work by using tools like Skype for example these days you can actually you know go online to get a doctor 's certificate so you you see you know you basically have a doctor 's consultation online and you know you get your doctor 's certificate to set us by your employer actually legit that happened to us on one occasion you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do business you know far beyond you know that your immediate area and which is really really cool so I guess these are some of the reasons why we would use online collaboration tools and you know these are the don 't you just hate it when and and these are summers I guess the the challenges or the bugbears you know with with using traditional you know applications like Microsoft Word and version based type systems so you know we hate it when we create a document and accidentally overwrite it or you know the computer crashes and all the program crashes and you haven 't saved it and you lose a whole heap of data oh sorry whole people work you know when you send a document to someone and you lose version control or there 's so many you know versions of a document that you know you start to lose track which is the most up-to-date one you reliant on people using adequate file naming mechanisms to keep track of what is the latest version um you know if you 're on a deadline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the job just to help you you know punch out that proposal or that tender application or whatever it may be you know when you 're working on a document that sort of locally on your computer it 's very difficult to collaborate on that kind of stuff you know for us being a creative business and Luke I 'm sure you 're much the same you know you do have days where you 're feeling you know a lack of inspiration or not as creative and unreal to be able to you know pull other people into it and into a project and have a sounding board and get that creative you know or you know injection you know into a brainstorming session or whatever it may be um the other one is obviously you know when it 's a version based document you know you can 't necessarily work on it few more taneous Lee and you know you 've got different operating systems different versions of software etc so if they are bugbears for your business here 's how you could collaborate online so tools like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools available can be use for some of these examples so you know whether you 're a service based business or bricks and mortar type business you know there 's there 's ways that you can use this tool collaborate so for us and I 'm interesting interested to hear to me your fav look but for us that you know some of those things I just touched on a moment ago so putting together proposals brainstorming sessions tender applications online meetings my gosh I probably eighty percent of my meetings you know actually via Skype versus you know face to face but look your insights into how some of these tools could be used to collaborate in various different types of businesses definitely so and if we talk about business plans you know that 's about everyone getting together or even just aesthetic planning whether it be a digital and strategy marketing strategy garage strategy having that document inviting the right people and this is obviously key here it 's not like new credit document it 's just publicly available we would invite people to help collaborate on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic and brainstorming it 's a really good use of online collaboration tools whether you 're doing it through Facebook Messenger or Facebook group whether you 're doing it through an online document for collaboration whether you 're doing it through Skype and having a chat about it rather than just writing something now these are all fantastic ways that we 've found utilize technology to collaborate better online and but definitely you know I see the big the big wins of when you 've got the big documents to work on more than just one person needs to contribute to it now if you 're talking about these proposals or yes there 's going to be designer CEO MD whatever the title might be but it 's going to be I 'm working on this because they 've got a vested interest there might be some sales are accounts person that needs to talk about what they 're selling in there you might have a finance person to make sure you 've got their the finance breakdown correctly and then what you 're proposing you might have some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're you know actually constructing something maybe they 're building something maybe they 're developing something digital and they need to put in their information it 's not just a case of one person writes it it 's actually quite a few people come together so we 've definitely big benefits when there 's been large documents but still benefits on the smaller ones and definitely online meetings incredible you know somebody 's and maybe a little bit sick and they need to stay home their conference work but you need to talk to them about some things you know five minutes on a quick Skype call and got all your finished press time again mmm absolutely I 'm curious to hear how many people on the webinar tonight are also mums or dads two young children I mean working around kids is a massive one I 've got a four year old myself and I 'm sure I 'm not alone that you know she can and can 't go to a daycare or whatever it may be sometimes you need to sort of you know do the juggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily missile or reschedule around being at home around a little one and you know it 's quite meeting from the ability to jump online you know for meetings that you would otherwise be face to face on is you know just invaluable so I 'm going to give you a little bit of a demo on a Google Doc just just sort of show you what it looks like and some of the stuff that you can do it so easy to use but the great thing about Google Docs and you know Luke and I can totally appreciate you know the the Chosin software of business and that 's what this program is values it 's an objective view at all the tools and all the technology out there available to you and it 's about personal preference and it 's about what fits your business for us it 's G suite and the suite of Google products Google Docs included so why I love Google Docs there 's no software required all you need is an internet connection you don 't need to buy licenses for Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can create and edit Word documents spreadsheets presentations create forms callate responses etc really really easily the other thing I love about Google is any word document any Excel document any PowerPoint presentation can be open in Google Docs it works very very similarly I 've actually had PowerPoint open today because the client provided me a PowerPoint presentation I needed to edit and I actually imported that into Google presentations to edit and then as soon as I was done with it I exported it back to PowerPoint to supply back to the client and that was because my preferred method of working was actually in Google presentations so it speaks seamlessly with you know to either open Microsoft documents in Google Docs or to download Google Docs for those programs you can sort documents into folders which is really cool it 's got all the everything you love about the Google search engine the pining stuff is available throughout the suite of Google products so so it is really powerful in Gmail it 's really really powerful in Google Docs some amazing little hats and shortcuts you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share and collaborate on documents with other people which I 'll give you a very quick demo on in a moment it can also save so amazing you know you don 't need to be saving every couple of minutes on this document you don 't have to worry about you know if the battery dies or you computer crashes or it you know has a little meltdown and you get that spinning wheel of death for five minutes before it freezes Google Documents do autosave and you can come back into them as soon as your computer reboots and yeah we touched on that so you can upload emails and Microsoft documents straight into Google there are mostly some pretty and pretty good pointed that you 've made but one of the biggest things I 'd like to point out to our clients that we work with in businesses and I mentor is that unlike using a desktop app which typically is just associated with Microsoft Office it could everything get up in the cloud with Google it means that if your computer dies don 't lose your data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home when you go to the office you can use any computer login to your Google account and access everything like you are just on your original laptop so it 's a really good tool moving around and that I think something that isn 't really shouted enough about yeah absolutely the other point too is that all your documents actually backed up and stored on the cloud so you 're not eating into your local computer hard drive safe to hard drive space sorry to actually sort store those documents if you like me and you like those creature comforts of being able to save documents to your computer and access them and save them off really easily without going through the browser there are also add-on extensions that you can have to actually download Google Drive to your computer to locally save documents as well so another one that does that same thing is Dropbox so there 'll be more later on in the program on you know storage options for working on the cloud as well we 'll cover off in flight Dropbox in more detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product so here 's a little screenshot of what Google Drive looks like and just bear with me I 'm just going to escape my screen here and Luke can you tell me is my screen my screen is still up yeah yes I can see no Google Drive right in front of me now beautiful so I 'm going to show you a document very very quickly in the interest of time that we actually collaborated on as a team last year so it was our Telstra Business Awards application I 'm just going to show you how easy it is save it in a folder so you come up here and you click on a folder and you can move an item around I 'm going to come over here and I can click share so I can share this with anyone with a Google account or in fact anyone with an email address if they 've got an email address they may be able to access it but not edit there 's a nice handy share link that if once I 've shared a document would stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document to a really quickly I just send as a link so really nice and handy you 're not sending you know 10 megabyte files through email I 'm going to show you revision history so this is pretty cool where are we see revision history so as you can see at the time you know these are all I guess our versions or our dates of editing on this document so you know a couple of late night skins in the mix there but you can see you know this document was touched by a vet was touched by me it was touched by tomorrow another another colleague on our team so numerous people could be working on this document at the same time the cool thing is is that if I 'm on here and working and you know one of my colleagues is working at the same time they get a little icon up here in the top right hand corner so I can see if you know loots on this document working at the same time you can see my cursor here if Luke was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pink cursor that would say you know Luke humbled so I can see where he 's typing I can actually see him types of for my eyes which is really really cool you cannot do that with you know Microsoft Office 2003 and I wouldn 't be surprised if you know some of the people participating in this program are still using old versions of software such as that definitely obvious 365 has a similar option but it 's about you still have to use it in the browser a bit like Google Docs but yeah if you 're using some of the old desktop software for Microsoft Office you 're just missing that amazing collaboration feature really do ya just on revision history you can actually go back to a particular date and actually see the version of that document at that day you can copy and paste you can roll back to do all sorts of cool stuff like that so it 's amazing if you 've worked on a document and then you realize oh my god there 's you know a whole section missing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision history find the version where that was in place copy and paste it and you know pop it back into the current version so ways you can use Google Docs or similar to collaborate so take us through some of these blue alright so let 's start with the exporting your accounts data and boarding it directly into Google Spreadsheets now if you using my lab or QuickBooks or anything like that and you can bring that strain into Google Spreadsheets and allow you to break it down even further but then as you just saw what I would just session that live demo about collaborating you can bring in your business advisers and so they can then start taking a look at that data and giving you feedback on it making Twitter adjustments and and helping your business and so there 's a fantastic opportunity there definitely when it comes to running the monthly company reports you can share those with who you need to and the right people at the right time and give them the right access as well so goals last thing you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a document so you can control that which is a great thing to do presentations and you 're looking at one right now which is creating Google Docs and and we actually collaborated on this document didn 't we absolutely did and that is lots to show we actually did collaborate on that on this prayer and this presentation together and make tweaks adjustments and slot bits of information and then work on it together and that really helped us especially as we are in very different locations and you 've also got the the Google Form which allows you to create sand forms to capture data and this can be turned into surveys as well so if you want to get feedback from your customers about how long how you 're doing or how that project went or how can you better serve them and you can grab these forms and send them out and that data can then be pulled through into a spreadsheet for you to analyze which is yeah and there 's sort of templates for all different types of forms if you 're hosting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and then you know it 'll automatically plate all of those RSVPs into a Google spreadsheet for you they 're really really handy in the interest of time I 'm going to skip ahead these this presentation is recorded so if we 've covered off something quite quickly or you know you want to have a closer look at some of the tools on screen you can watch the presentation back and you know of course if you 're a full program participant you 've got the online portal with a whole heap of resources available in there as well so quick exercise here is consider how your business could use Google Docs or similar you know office 365 or whatever it may be to collaborate note your ideas trial them in your business test some of these tools out and let us know how you go I 've just mentioned here that you can access a workbook place notes within the online resource portal so I know I 've mentioned you know full program participants and you know the resource portal a few times I 'll just go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have to be a full program participant though of course to access some of this great content on demand if you would just like particular topics and things like that so over to slack now Luke is a slack expert I can 't say I 've used it I 've heard heaps about it I 'm really excited to hear more about it tell us what it does so it 's like is in its simplest form a chat tool but that chat tool is about bringing teams together and talk about common interest solicit talk let 's just add a project now that project could be an about and bringing a new product line to your business and so you create what 's referred to in slack as a channel just somewhere where you 'd actually talk about that you think about a channel a bit like a TV channel you get certain information through that channel you create this channel and it 's a little bit tacky because it uses what 's known as a hashtag and why you can see a bit about that hashtag is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that means that if you 're talking to somebody directly and are you 're messaging them communicating talking to them on one on one you can actually use the hashtag to reference a channel and it will put that information in that channel that conversation there so it 's a great way of limpin then you know how many times have you been talking to somebody in the office about a particular project and then you send a separate email to someone else and you forget to mention that conversation that you can well this is where it brings all together one of the other great things about slack is and it 's got these add-ons a little bit like I mentioned about the browser extensions in Chrome and also in Google and having their different apps in there so I can 't allow you to integrate new features as well one of them that I love is it 's called a birthday bot so once we actually integrated it into slack it actually are all my staff what their birthday wants and as part of that if then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before to let me know that there was going to be a star birthday and then on the day of their birthday there was a public announcement to celebrate that it was their birthday so that everyone got involved it 's lots of little animals out there which are really good and slack is it 's free to use and there is a paid version which gives you a few sort of enterprise level features but it 's a great tool really is and it 's helped us communicate not just with the team in-house but also external team globally and it 's fantastic tools absolutely so in the interest of time I don 't know that we 've got time to do a live demo plus logistically is a little bit clunky with the presentation on my screen and Luke doing a live demo however Luke is one of our digital champions and mentors on the program so I 'm going to cover off later on in the webinar how you can actually access one-on-one time with loop which is pretty cool and like I said if this program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunshine Coast Council so guys jump on board and take advantage to you know some of the talents such as Luke and get further inputs some of these corporal future communication and collaboration so we 're just going to touch a little bit on you know where technology is heading in the space of communication and collaboration of course video is major we 're going to see more video already in existence we 've got Skype and Google Hangouts but you know Facebook for work I believe is is sort of moving even more so into this space right yeah definitely definitely we 're touching upon that in just a moment as well yeah fantastic so webinar 4 which is next week is actually delving deeper into video conferencing and some of the cool stuff you can do with that yeah social media of Facebook Messenger so you know we 're seeing more businesses using facebook Messenger we 're seeing more customers communicating with businesses via facebook Messenger can you tell us a little bit more Luke about you know I guess like Auto responses and message boxes and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook Messenger obviously it is messaging program built into Facebook and it 's connected to your business page now the two differences here you 've got a personal profile that you used to log into Facebook and a business page that represents your business so this is the messenger connected with your business page and this is actually a very powerful tool and those of you that you have a wordpress website and there 's an integration between the WordPress website and the Facebook Messenger so you can actually have somebody use facebook Messenger whilst looking at your website to content to and chat with you and it 's something we 've implemented on a number of our clients websites if something weren 't clicking hold up the great thing about it is it 's instant communication and now how many times have you sent an email to someone or use one of their contact forms then you just sit back and wait for whenever they might reply and hope the base of the information for you directly well this is real-time and Facebook actually recomm will reward you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your business page to help promote in your career responder there is also as you mentioned just now and there are cam responses so you can actually you see on that screen on the right hand side there you 've got a response assistant and you can actually set up certain responses based on information that it will actually type in and there are BOTS and these are robots that you can connect that more assist you with this think of it like a bit like a digital assistant so there 's a lot of integration seeing that it 's a powerful tool because it 's about quick online communication absolutely and I love the term don 't let perfect get in the way of better you don 't have to launch into using Facebook Messenger and have all canned response going and you know integration you know small steps this program is all about just you know upscaling moving up a level if you 've never used facebook Messenger maybe you can you know try and implement it within your business and open it up as a channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then move up another level you know add another level of depth through you know canned responses and things like that Facebook for work pretty rewrite yes definitely and and I mean I 'd love to see a show of hands how many people lie to you about this but strangely enough I can 't see your hands so yeah it 's um it 's a very very new facility and Facebook 's actually been training over the last year with around about 2000 businesses so this isn 't just a product of little head push shell they 've actually adjusted based on feedback and tweaked and created this digital product it 's a little bit like an slack like we just mentioned in I suppose a familiar interface people a lot of people know about Facebook if you don 't then this is probably the right program for you to be on that 's for sure and so it 's if any of you used Facebook groups that 's one of the core features of one a place with the quickest and easiest way to sum it up it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business that 's it you can still use the live chat the Facebook Messenger but between staff and business colleagues you 've got your groups which you can repurpose to talk about topics or categories or projects you can do document upload and sharing and eventually they say they 're going to be allowing you to actually edit those documents directly in there but for now all you can do is upload and share them and you can set access so that certain people concern these certain groups and certain documents and that newsfeed that you 're so familiar with when you log into Facebook there 's our own version for the workplace by Facebook which talks about everything of people putting in everyone all the staff or your team members they 're actually putting in in terms of updating and statuses and putting in text updates links uploading documents so it really is it 's just imagine Facebook but you get rid of all those nice photos and those funny animations and those videos and it 's all about how the company communicates like your internal communication tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know so just a quick case study and we 're going to open up for questions but we use a car at a simple level of a secret Facebook group within our team so we 've got you know 44 members in our Facebook group you know across our team and some of our contractors etc I think our executive coaches even in here on our group this is all you know work-related stuff sometimes that 's the you know the odd funny you know I guess this is like the water cooler so when you you know operating a business across multiple locations with team that might be team members that might be out on the world or a different office whatever it may be this is kind of like gathering around the water cooler to you know have a quick joke or go hey can I catch up later on that project or whatever it may be so we 're really really active in our Facebook group with the creative collective other ways that this can be used and that I 've seen Facebook groups used is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if coming up with content to post your social media channels such as Facebook or or LinkedIn or Twitter or whatever is a real challenge for your business you might think about setting up an internal Facebook group where you invite various different team members that as they come across you know useful articles or content or whatever it may be that they share it within the group and then it 's almost like a little you know depository where all those things are saved and stored come time from scheduled social media so I 'm going to just exit presentation mode so I can read some of your questions out at the moment before I do I 'm very conscious that some of you may need to to lock so if that is the case feel free to get your questions in and we 'll do our very best to answer them this of course will be recorded so if you do miss miss out on your answer and you have to run off you know you can listen back to the recording and you know skip straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question just quickly before

customer experiences and how you can use online systems such as PBX phone systems and serums and and the like you know customer satisfaction School surveying polls all that kind of cool cool jazz level 11 you know they 're not going to be relevant to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can completely deliver online courses online project management systems and more and then finally level four you can learn all about open data and how you can use it in your business data analytics recording etc so once you 've got everything in your place in place how do you evaluate it or how do you interpret what is happening within your business engagement options so we 've had information sessions they were free if you 've missed them and you want to learn more about the program pop on to level up Sunshine

mean there 's some amazing and talent available to some of our digital champions is a whole heap more we 've got Luke there as well and your Facebook group so I 'm going to exit out of there you 've got some upcoming dates there if you 're not sure of the dates again pop on to the website level up top Sunshine Coast Queensland Government 's and on that site as well you can learn a whole lot more about the program the bear with me here as screen is going to have a little tiny meltdown as it does oh yes oh where are we not going to believe that it actually looks like it 's frozen up have you got the questions there in front of you Luca yeah we 'll go run through some of those yes I do try to answer the most we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we am use the is come on the border iPhone mailbox or use a separate app so my suggestion was actually to use the Gmail app I find just because it 's um it 's it 's got a better experience in there and it 's actually built in oh sorry guys I don 't know if I might have had a bit of a technical glitch there we don 't yet we 're back sorry about that fantastic so yeah I was just talking about the using the Gmail app for iPhone just because it 's because I 'm into users and specifically for Gmail and it 's got all the tools and relevant functions that you 're used to in GML for a browser but directly on your phone it 's not to say that the email app in the iPhone is isn 't any good it 's just it 's not let 's say it 's not a design to add email in mind so there 's some definitely benefits there Christine was talking about the rescuetime app and whether it 's free yes it is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 which gives you a little bit more analytics from there and and also Christine asked whether rescue Tom wants cross-browser it does work across a large number of browsers but of course there are so many out there it 's not guaranteed to work with all of them but it will work on majority of modern day ones and you can go to rescue time calm to find out more information about that cool killer I was asking about the difference between G Suites in Google Docs just saying GS which is basically the umbrella or all-encompassing name for all the different apps that Google has and and so that includes Google Docs Google Hangouts and all that kind of stuff and then sounding is just saying unfortunately she with them a little bit behind you to work couldn 't get to the beginning of this awesome webinar and which is awesome whether she can watch a recording in saying yes you can absolutely so I believe webinars are free to attend if you aren 't a full program participant it 's 25 to access the recording all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get access to all the recordings and all the resources um cool at the same time some rescuetime seems to be a bit of a popular topic here which doesn 't surprise me it 's a really cool little tool I think that 's it for the questions guys if you have any final questions just pop them through on the chat at the moment and we 'll try and cover those off before we sign up so I 'll just give it another 30 seconds or so to see if anything comes in before we end the broadcast but while we are waiting for that loop thank you so much for your time and your expertise and I absolutely love hearing you know another effectively another agency on the course you know different perspective on some of these cool tools and I love the fact that you know there 's many tools that we 're both using and some that you know it 's a bit of friendly rivalry on so very cool yeah definitely and that 's you know this is just a classic example again about collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in they 're the same or very similar industry yet we 're here collaborating to trying to help as many businesses as possible so it 's not just about the tools but it 's also about the collaboration between different businesses and that 's really what we 're talking about here it 's really about how you all come together no matter where you are on what you 're doing and what devices you have yeah absolutely I love it and it 's one of the reasons why the level web program is so fantastic because you 're not just going to one particular business and you know finding out what what they want to recommend or getting push the products or applications that you know they perhaps get a kickback for or whatever it may be you 're getting really objective advice from from lots of different experts you know predominantly on the coast on a range of different topic so you know it 's great from that respect um so it doesn 't look like we 've got any more questions tonight so we will leave it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday evening and we 've had a fantastic turnout reminder for webinar for next week on videoconferencing and you jump onto the LevelUp website and learn more about the program if you 're not already involved thank you again and I will talk to you all soon I will be presenting I think on some later webinars look at you down for any more presenting collagen it 's a big beautiful down perfume so we 're just phone lines in which ones are bit of call if you 're part of the full program and you can access me as a mentor to to help you with both of these and other areas your business as well fantastic well thank you guys we 'll end it there and have a good evening see you later"

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome to tonight 's webinar on the little app program tonight we 're talking working online and going cloud I do want to start with a couple of apologies some of you tried to join us last week for webinar 1 and we variant unfortunately some technical issues quite a lot of irony in that because it was about getting online and I despite having three different options to be online and despite doing test I was unable to so for those of you who did try and get on and want to access that content it will be made available to you by Friday we 've arranged the rerecords with Indian Ryan Williams and so the recording will be made available and the online resource portal and everyone will also be emailed a link to make that super easy for you I also understand there was a few abusing mobs and for midday today despite us advertising 30 tonight on all channels apparently on the system at a different time that 's now been updated across the board and tonight 30 is always given 30 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you might be listening to the recording and got on at 00 expecting to hear at live apologies but hopefully we can redeem ourselves with a really great session and I most certainly know I have a really great guest to introduce you to tonight so I 'm going to share my screen now and I 'm just going to pop over to there we go my webinar slides and it will check between motes and doing some live demos with you tonight as well so first our closest get a thumbs up that the sounds working okay for everyone and that you can see my screen okay could you just type a little list or hello or something like that in the text area which we very much want you to interact with tonight because we will be answering questions at the end of the session so if you 've got a question during the session popping it on the text area is a good idea we 're going to run the content for about 45 minutes and then we 'll answer questions at the end if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that topic anyway so you can see if we do or we don 't and as we don 't we can put it off at the end so hopefully that sounds alright someone said it sounds crackly yes working well for most people it 's good I can see it from Sciences through that 's wonderful as well one thing to note is that if you are seeing it crackly with an hour one recording can be really valuable to you because you can run a speed test and see what your internet connection is like we do fit speech on the webinar registration page what sort of feed you ideally need to enjoy a good webinar session and if you don 't have that it could actually be that you need to upgrade your and snap those webinar one contents are really helpful for that okay without further ado let 's get into this content so this is webinar 2 working online and all going cloud I like to call it working online because it sounds a little friendlier and whether you realize it or not many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it going cloud or cloud computing and everyone went where are these clouds well cloud the kind of just putting it on a server but you can 't see so I guess that 's why we call it a cloud the reality is this stuff is actually still sitting somewhere it is sitting on a server somewhere on the in the world and it 's a different way of working and whether you 're just starting out with moving online how you work or whether you 're already doing this and just looking for a couple of tips that might make working a little bit more efficient or a little bit more profitable productive for you or your team I 'm hoping that tonight we can give that to you so this webinar is part of the Sunshine Coast Council 's level up program that is a digital upskilling program and it 's aimed at helping small and medium businesses which we did know there are an awful lot on the Sunshine Coast about 90% of our businesses here are small and medium and we want them to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and then not only that actually start using the tools available to you if you 're on fast internet and ultimately the outcome is help you be more productive do more with less time and be more profitable make more money maybe even compete nationally and internationally and not just have a Sunshine Coast market all because you 've accessed these tools and you can now get some scale and do a whole lot more so my name is Yvette Adams some of you I might have had the pleasure of meeting during the info sessions we ran around the Sunshine Coast through March and April and even some online sessions for those of you I haven 't met that heard about this program through a friend or Facebook or radio and different things we 've been doing a super quick introduction we accent you come here is a qe1 and you 're about to hear sannyas as well and she 's also a Kiwi so I 'm not calling in the Cuban mafia community base and been here a while and she 'll explain his background but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I wanted to give a different perspective on things so we had a nice balanced view of both the Google world and the Microsoft world because lots different businesses do this differently so how do we make decisions about what 50 or business um I first left school and went straight to work so I 've worked for government so I do understand that area of work and if you work in that area and making the migration to startup phase which I know some of you were meant to be in position city where I do understand that I had started six businesses of cell two right now I run three one of those businesses is called the creative collective so our company successfully tended for this program and we are responsible for developing and delivering it so we are a digital marketing agency we moved to be fully cloud in 2009 so we don 't just tell people we practice what we preach and use the stuff every day for ourselves we love telling clients about it and helping them make that digital transformation journey as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selectors which is all about teaching people digital skills so you can see this as a compliment they 're in a set to run the program the third business is a business awards portal called awards hub calm where we help people find business awards and then do replications to I 'm pretty active in the Sunshine Coast community so I am the chair of knowledge a professional services task force which is a council task force aimed at bringing together the industry and feeding back to council what our issues are and things we might need moved along so I can help you with that certainly get in touch and I 'm also proud to be the chair of the Australian Institute of Company Directors Sunshine Coast Committee and I 'm a mum of a 10 and a 13 year old and I put a sort of here with me tonight some of you might have children at home and probably juggles dinners and things but that 's a little bit about me so I would now love to introduce you to Sonya how you 're doing tonight Bonnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two speaker boxes and make a slide full screen that is a really good idea thanks for following me wet you 're seeing some a different type when I flip to this screen I can only see what is run out in slits oh yeah let me see it 's mine minimizer there is okay now which will be getting a much better view that everyone appreciate cool so Sonya I 'm not going to talk about you I 'm going to let you introduce yourself tell us a bit about yourself well as you think you know Kiwi accents tonight I 've been here over 12 years now so occasionally an Aussie would slip them but more often than not working with a Kiwi husband it 's still very much Kiwi in our household so we moved here in 2004 looking for a change so I started my IT career and a bank moved into big government departments police defense so I cut my teeth on really big large clunky old systems and moving very large environments around doing all that kind of system stuff before we looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own business and inside a family ourselves as well so I I wear a lot of hats my day job is running a business that provides IT support and advice to small businesses and I also am a regular contributor and the community both writing online gift podcasts and speaking both at Microsoft events here and overseas as well and I recently got an award and a Microsoft MVP award and the MVP you words are a great honor because they are recognizing your contributions back to the community be that the in your community or the technical community and it is evaluated every year and only judged on events that you do for free so none of the MVP activities that we pour our heart and souls into we actually get paid me extra money for it so that was a great honor to be recognized by Microsoft for that kind of work congratulations on that Sonya that 's awesome so I 'm sure all the listeners can understand like we 're talking Microsoft no wonder you 're my go-to person I like them a bit more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go on let 's talk about the topic some more and in your atop an expert I guess let 's start from the start and talk about what is working online so as I said sort of earlier moving your business operations to the cloud or online can mean that you can increase yours and your team productivity profitability ale ability and funnily enough sometimes security sometimes people 's main fear of not moving it online and will it be secure but I personally love it because I like being flexible I like being a mum being able to look at my phone and send a few emails or check out a document that 's on my G Drive because I need to pull it out for a meeting and I 've only got a phone with me not a laptop and many other instances what 's working online to use on you how do you decide but I love that security concern online security is one of those things that there are a few steps that you need to take to protect yourself and we 'll talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something investment that these companies have put in to protecting their cloud infrastructure is just phenomenal and when I think of the amount of small businesses that might have a server in their office and it 's sitting underneath the receptionist desk for example in their data centers that we 're talking about whether likes of Microsoft to be a physical security to get access to those computers is their intent for example you need to stand on a scale when you go into a room and come out of a room so they actually weigh you to make sure that the weights going in and the weight it was the same see you haven 't taken anything and and left it there or taken anything out you shouldn 't and that kind of security is hidden behind the scenes in the cloud Li we don 't get to see it but it 's certainly there Wow so Peter he Pedone us on the meeting inside you got a stake outside I think there 's any food in those rooms if the data centers are very impressive that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's talk about what 's driving the working online trend because it 's lots of things and I 'm not one for reading off the slides and reading all of these out you guys can look at these in your own time and find a way all these slides are made will be made available after the session generally within the week you 'll get the recording some resources the slides that you can download and recover in your own time but um what 's your thoughts on your on what 's driving the trend that you 're seeing at the moment because I feel like in 2012 the lights went on in Queensland because we had the floods and like you said some people had servers and reception desks and car parts they lost a lot of data so they started going geez maybe this club thing not such a bad idea after all that drove a lot of people to it but here we are five years forward what what 's going on now would you say effectively just have an expectation as consumers that we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience and that means that businesses have to be a lot more responsive and being a responsive business these days is not about being tied to a desk 00 to 00 it 's about having the flexibility to work where you need to when you need to there 's a phrase we use that says workers no longer a place you go it 's a thing you do and people expect now in our modern society that they do have the flexibility to work wherever they need to whenever they need to and that 's one of the things that the cloud certainly enables yeah I 'm all about lifestyle for myself in my team and I love the fact that you know if someone took at home their child they can work from home and I think at the end of the day you can work really really hard and some people say that working online thing means it 's 7 you 're never out of contact but I think it 's about putting up boundaries and making sure that you communicate and educate clients with customer base when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair anything yeah but I think as well as our goal for this program is to help you scale and maybe go global you know working online can help to do that because even if you can 't find the sort of talent you need locally you can be hiring people online working with them virtually gaining efficiency because they 're working overnight maybe it achieved a rate so you 're gaining profitability I 'm not saying outsource everything that I 'm saying there 's a whole lot more options available to you as a business owner that 's right it 's just so so much easier these days to share information with the people who need up yeah so I myself have teamed with an office in Newcastle with team and Melbourne and all over do you work the same giving virtual teams which was only very so enter virtual staff overseas and we also look after customers that have officers not only around Australia but in other countries as well what was your move as a business owner to do that walk through that for you and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a lifestyle so the business that we started we run from home we have a family and we wanted to be able to increase that capacity to service our customers but not have to go and rent an office space and have staff that turned up Monday to Friday yeah and I could examples of even here on the Sunshine Coast it 's like a real traditional business like say a plumbing organization where they 've made cloud and going cloud or going online work for them by changing the way they do business previously the the team the plumbers would go out and do the work and have to bring back the paperwork to say what tools I 'd use you know what parts and what invoicing and hours that spent and then someone would manually have to program that all in and then later on they were Bill and in might be a 30 or 60 days billing cycle they 've moved into iPads and now they fill it in they 're on the job no one has to reenter it and they can actually clock off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building 's all done they need to reprogram it and there 's the debtors got a whole lot buses let the cool example as well have you got any other example of companies that have gone online and seen the real difference in the way or their profitability or products and then by going in it 's perfect and those kind of trades absolutely exemplify what we 're talking about here in terms of real life examples of digital transformation there 's a whole sort of ecosystem out there for apps to help make the process easier for services based companies like tray-tease to communicate with their customers record the parts and the hours they use and get billed for it more easily while they 're out and about yeah and through this program we will introduce you in lots of different armed systems we 're not going to save the system of you for everyone because it 's different businesses at different stages with different budget different size teams and different aspirations but we will introduce you to them and you can go off and evaluate whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn more and do some live exercises you can download resources and work with your team and chair them at meetings and we 've even got mentors for you which will explain a bit more later so back to this topic benefits of working in the cloud there 's a whole lot on the screen there Sonya how do you explain what the benefits are working in the cloud or online asks of people useful too I think it 's a lot of what we 've spoken about already in terms of giving you the flexible either work when you need to any access to the right information yeah and there 's a little point of probably will highlight the bottom left is in some cases no desktop software so some businesses do operate with really nothing much on there and just as an example I don 't own Microsoft Word or PowerPoint or any of that and I haven 't for some time but some of the office365 stuff if you do so in that environment you do sort of have something on your desktop so now we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit later if you have the choice now which is really great yeah you can go online or of the bit of bone brightener so so when we explain this whole working online context the probably the best way we can explain it to you is that it 's like renting versus buying a house you can rent software or just use free or low-cost subscription software or you can go and buy it so I guess we used to go out and buy Microsoft Office didn 't we install it on a machine and we had it and so we needed to upgrade that 's what we didn 't on you so how would you explain because Microsoft is probably what most companies are familiar with and how it worked how that changed over the years so the first dabble into office365 that most small businesses would have taken would have been office 365 on a new computer or an office 365 bought from somewhere like office works where they were still looking for things like Word and Excel but they found that they now had an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars to the package the main difference between these two buying options is that with the newer versions where you 're paying that lower monthly or annual subscription fee you 're getting a version that 's always updated so as Microsoft bring out new features new product updates and major versions you don 't have to go out and buy the next major version of Office if you want to upgrade it to the latest features curious to know actually be cool if you guys for texture in are you on Microsoft Office older versions are you on Microsoft 365 or are you like me to jointly using Google stuff at the moment love to know where you 're at and will reflect on those answers when we come to questions it will help us understand the audience and I guess where you 're at now and and where maybe we can take you as well ok so moving forward if you are thinking about taking your business online sure there 's some stuff to think about and you want to plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time so I think we should go into some of these a bit more and expand on them because they 're pretty important so how reliable the Internet is pretty important and we cover that in webinar one so when that becomes available please have a look at it make sure you 've got good internet before you 've got that you really can 't consider this stuff too much and as always I just are going to stress it learn a little bit too we have a customer at the moment who 's looking at what they do with their file storage and sharing in their organization and they have very bad internet at both of their locations and they would absolutely hate me if I put their files anywhere near the right now so we made a decision to hold off for a couple of months until they 've got the NBN at those locations because it just wouldn 't be usable yeah we 've got to be practical and we 're realistic here we know there are some businesses I was at one today it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't have it but it suits their business people like to go there and log off but what does it mean for my business operations perspective well they do actually maybe have to go to a different location to do their office and book work from time to time to catch up hmm now budgets a big one I think a lot of people fear that moving to the cloud or doing new things differently than a costume an arm and a leg would you say that 's what you also have people say to use and they have certainly a consideration and I think it 's a different type of perspective on your budget small businesses are used to spending money when they have it they 'd like to invest in technology we may are cash rich and and profitable and the cloud is a different way of thinking because it senses technology expenses into more of an operating expense and a capital expense and so it is something that they need to plan for in terms of all their budgets handle cloud software along the term but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying for subscription fees and those low monthly costs you 're getting rid of a whole bunch of other costs that you don 't need to plan for in terms of replacing hardware and extra IT support all that kind of stuff yeah so you 've really got to do a cost versus benefit analysis and what that involves is almost doing an audit on what do I have now what does it cost me not just some dollars but in time and some people are literally paying like check the scenario of the plumber and all the different plumbers they had in the sweeps I think they had about 10 or 12 so we 're coming back to the offers and giving those invoices and all those parts to be entered every day that was a full-time job for an admin person now we 're not here to kill jobs because you know these are livelihoods as well but affect person doesn 't have to enter those and can instead market the business to win more business or do something else that benefits the business then suddenly things have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending time on something that actually can be done by technology is that the way you planet that your customers only and one of the other things that I stress is it 's not about trying to do the same thing with different technology a lot of companies go out and they put in cloud solutions and then I find them using email and using other systems the same way that they always have any business except it 's in the cloud instead of installed on their computer so there really is a opportunity there to not only multiplayer software but when you take a look at the new features and capabilities it gives you and and really implement how that 's going to give you a business and edge with the new things you can do yeah and we 're using words now like change and transformation and it is that it 's not just a little IT thing you do to make life better it is kind of changing the whole way you work not just you your workforce and how you interact with customers and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elephant we start with one bite it 's the same thing and that you 've got to really work out what are all the different systems I need to run my business what am i using now we 're at the pain point what are the ones costing me a lot of money or aren 't efficient and I know it where I get complaints from customers and how can I make them better so whether that 's your marketing system or your financial system or your CRM which means a client relationship management system where you actually log every interaction you have with clients fee at a phone call an email webform or otherwise a walk-in for instance and work out let 's just start with taking that online and let 's see if that makes life better is that as an approach you have Sonia or how do you discuss with clients when they might want to make some transformations like what 's the biggest priority when it 's all a bit overwhelming if you 're looking at cloud as being an IT project you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't an IT project it 's a business project with the IT components so it really is about looking at how your business can operate in this new world and those IT things that you do in the background of support that it 's just a small part of the puzzle yeah and another thing I find is sometimes people have been in business a while can use 20 years due to use summer actually even close to retirement and telling them that we want to transform their business there bit like what I 'm about to retire I don 't want to know about it but something that sometimes gets them thinking well maybe I 've got to find the motivation and enthusiasm to do this is this could add value to your business after when you do want to sell so whatever time or cost you might pay a consultant or implement a new system or even make a few mistakes before you get it right might mean that you can sell your business for a whole lot more because you are so much more up-to-date than if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to value have you heard stories at all Sonya of businesses things valued more because they are more online and more digitally and the other consideration we have to take in to account is the new employees are coming into our workforces so and your employees are you know about the iPhone generation they expect there to be an app for that and they they don 't want to see that you 've got some old horrible computer that 's running office 2003 you know they expect new technology in there here we go back in my day back in my day we used to have better technology in the workplace than we did at home because it was very expensive and it needed skill like they killed 80 people to look after and now we 've flipped that totally on its head and we 're finding that people have better technology in their homes and they do in new workplaces the cloud has shifted the the ball game to mean that small businesses now have more affordable access than ever to that really cool kinds of technology now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's very true and and you know with less people in the workforce to hire from in an aging population we 've got to think about how to make ourselves attractive if we do want to hire good talent so there 's other things on here but I feel like we publish should move on you know you 've got to consider what stage of business you 're out and therefore what do you need because if you 're starting out sometimes you need to try some different online tools and then get to the right one you don 't really want to invest in a whole lot up front in case it 's not the right thing and your business evolved what do you already have in place and could new technologies plug into it as a really important consider security if you 're in the field of law or medical or there 's many other instances where security and privacy is and these and higher considerations in other industries then you have to consider well what systems are out there some resources do you have and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the training make sure it 's all on track you 're going to have to get external consultants short term long term are you going to hire someone even or can you all do parts and all make those transformations together they 're also all considerations anything else to add to that before we move on Sonia I think we could probably do a session just on that in themselves yeah it 's a pretty big slide that one and pretty important but I guess inside an hour session we just want to open some light bulbs in the mind and get you thinking into noise ask the questions on specifics at the end so being safe online is also a massive topic and we could just do one on this but I want to make you all aware of a cool resource that the government has in case you didn 't know it stay smart online gov today you there 's a whole section on to protect your business so if you are in a risky area or you just want to make sure when or if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can I protect against it that 's a really good resource but I 'm Sonia what are your main areas of restful things you recommend to customers in the same space okay my two top tips for being safe online the first one is something called two-factor authentication if you don 't know what it is find out about it it should definitely be on systems like financial systems you have in the cloud banking systems and I know that both g3 and office365 also supported two factor authentication is the way of getting another thing to input as well as your password so that might be a code that rolls over on an app it might be an SMS with a code in it for example it is the best possible way for you to protect your love and account if a hacker was to get access to your login details it is very very unlikely that they will have access to that second form of what we call off the indication so two-factor authentication is my top tip for any of those class systems and my other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen so many examples even recently with scams where people pretend to be somebody you know they send you a link to open a document or to log into a website for example and then all of a sudden you 've actually given them access because you 've clicked on their things if you get an email with a link in it even if it 's on somebody you know if you 're not expecting it pick up the phone and ask them just ring them and say hey did you send me a link to a document or did you need me to sign into the Swiss but if it 's your bank I know it 's annoying pick up the phone and call them because if you 're sending you links some emails to log into systems you are far better to fire up your internet browser type in your bank 's address manually and log into your internet banking like you normally do then you are clicking on links and emails links and emails should be banned I mean it 's very rare few banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag immediately anyway yeah if lots of other scams there 's always new ones say smart online I believe even has an alert service you can see here on the right so you can sign up and I don 't tend to go myself fires a silly thing to friends post on Facebook and emails people forwards on watch out for this sometimes they 're actually the scams themselves and you 're encouraging it and forwarding it the virus etc so I would rather sign up to an authority service like this and there are others and when they say there 's an issue watch out for this go buy that not buy what you make at the pub told you or your friend posted on Facebook last night yeah moving on um so here we go google girl this is Microsoft girl Sonya likes Microsoft I like Google we don 't care really what you use but we are saying most businesses would probably do one of these suite of tools would you agree with that Sonya are there any we 're completely missing you look there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of users and improvements in the product and support from the size of the companies these two have got to be the leaders in the field yeah and so I 've got a little thing in the bottom left and what subject you already have in place what could you plug into it 's kinda like what kind of car do you like to drive does isn 't it like it 's not this is a better system it 's just what do you prefer so I prefer Google because I like the search function on Google I like logging into one ecosystem and having at my fingertips the GG sweeeeet G Drive Google Calendar all that stuff and I went to these guys and 2010 and sales using this when Microsoft hadn 't taken things online because I was a bit of an early adopter and because of that I guess I became loyal through Google and stopped using Microsoft but why have you stayed loyal to Microsoft and what 's your toy reason for choices going to use that song bit but that 's an absolutely valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud stuff and I think Google taught them a lesson in terms of where they needed to be looking at with their technology they underwent a change in leadership at Microsoft which has had a huge impact on the company and if you haven 't dealt with Microsoft for a few years it is a very very different company now to what it used to be when we left the corporate world and started a business supporting small businesses the majority of our businesses hadn 't gone clarium was still as very much in a Microsoft on-premises world with their technology and so the Microsoft moved to the Microsoft cloud was just the next step in an evolution for them because they were using systems where they might have heavily reliance on formulas and things and Excel spreadsheets and the Microsoft system was what they were comfortable with so I think that 's why I really ended up staying with it we do actually and have some customers with some Google products so we have some coverage and support our first products too but for the majority of our customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's probably we 're also mentioning there are some capsules we do both so you can play in both camps even as Microsoft 365 and use some of the Google tools some of the time or for certain functions and what do you think it would be fair to say that quite a lot of startups and I guess more budget-conscious businesses you Google and more sort of corporate and government clients use Microsoft do you think they 'll be fair comment yeah I think we 've seen a lot more uptake of Google in the in the small like the sole traders online and entrepreneurs that kind of space whereas most of their Microsoft businesses tend to be more from existing small businesses that are growing up yeah and at the end of the day it 's what car do you like to drive just like I love that you mean to makers we use the Holden vs. Ford analogy all the time too yeah for sure they 're not better or worse that 's just what you might have to drive so moving on I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could easily do a whole presentation on this so be aware this is a you know quite versus level one and if you want to go and more detail would love to see when our next workshop on the 26 the moment details of which are on the website which I 'll explain in a moment so I 'll just quickly go through a few slides to give you a bit of an intro to G Drive and then I 'll hand it over to Sonya and she 'll give you a bit of a live demo some Microsoft stuff as well so we use the word ecosystem which basically means not just the place you go and look at one thing but you 've got access to lots of things or things that working together so when it comes to Google lots of people think it 's just a search engine but it 's actually got a whole lot more things than that and some people are aware of them some aren 't some use them already some don 't to start using anything Google to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these is free you just go to google.com slash account or go to it now and show you and it 's just like signing up for an email address so I don 't need to spend very long doing it I 'm already logged in there so I 'd have to log out I 'm going to edit an account it should give me the option to summon the option to sign up to another one I 'd have to sign out and use another account sign in more options create account but pretty much as you can see that 's it there 's it 's the window I fill in Lodi I log into Google world and I kind of hang out in it all day so I joke and say my Google account is my passport to Google world once inside Google will pretty much everything is online so if the internet drops out and isn 't reliable no this isn 't going to be the best thing for you to use however some companies then pull up their phone or their tablet and start using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I love that so I used Google stuff when I go on the plane I might be doing emails up to the moment I 'm going on the plane and actually sending them I then load up my Gmail offline do a bunch of emails and my outbox might have 20 emails by the time I hit Melbourne the moment I connect to the internet all those emails go out so that 's pretty cool you can also get most of these same tools on an app for your phone or tablet so like I said today I 've had to go somewhere I couldn 't remember the details of where I needed to be I pulled up the Google Calendar and I could see there the address who I was meeting with and some supporting documents so that was pretty helpful as well now you can use G sweet stuff for free and you can also use the paid version the paid version is going to set you back five dollars per user per month so if you have three people in your organization all using it 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bigger you get the more you pay so if you just small the costs are pretty low paying for G sweet basically means you can make sure that the emails going out are coming from your apps URLs domain so mine would come from at the creative collective and not only that that when I do a calendar invite the calendar I 'm using also looks nice and professional so that 's one of the benefits of using G suite paid another cool tool as part of the G sweet collection is Google Drive so as it says they can keep everything and share anything so I 'm just going to pull up my G Drive here it is live here and it 's a bit like a I don 't know how to explain it a file storage place so I can keep personal files on here as you can see I 've got a bit what else when I was planning my birthday I can have client sales I can go to new and create something new and I can create a Google Doc which is basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got beautiful sheets and look like Excel I 've got Google slides a lot like PowerPoint and there 's even more there 's Google Forms where I can create a survey or online poll Google drawings I can literally sketch something up my map I can create a map rate log different locations for my stores or something like that Google Sites which we 'll cover in future lessons that 's what you can have like a company intranet your own mini website that you gives different people access to different parts real-time border don 't use but I believe it 's like an online whiteboard and zip extractor which extracts files and you can add even more there so I can create new folders I can create a new document if I was to create a new document and its simplest form you 'll notice it kind of looks a lot like to Microsoft I can bold stuff I can Center it but probably the coolest feature which is why we moved to users as I can share the stock with someone and once I 've shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put test run give it a Doc 's name and I could share this with Sonya um so that is the one she said to share it with and I could say like hi Sonia let 's work on the document and that will go through email so it literally reruns team meetings and we 'll be writing an agenda and everyone 's contributing or similarly we 'll do a new spreadsheet and we 'll report on our figures and different team members have to work on that the best feature about all that is it saves on version control no more sending it to someone they updated it you also updated at all god which pages did you work on I 've already done that someone else down the hall has oh dear so that 's a super quick run-through of it but it 's got some pretty cool features um this next one is Google Calendar people often say to me how do you do what you do in a day run three companies you have two children you do the chair of the board things and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything off calendar so I 'll switch it over to my calendar so I have my calendar which is the orange I can I have a boardroom and we book that out I couldn 't turn on the calendar of any of my team agos justin free at the moment I guess he is free tomorrow I 'll go grab them for a meeting I can create meetings and I can invite them so that 's pretty cool I can add an attachment just today I had a confirmation that I 've got a speaking gig so I added the attachment with all the details about that now I find a doctor 's appointment and I didn 't want people to know that I was going to the doctor 's for something very private I can simply say I 'm busy and this is private so it 'll say if it is busy you don 't know what doing I happen to be at the doctor 's so ultimate flexibility there and I also again why I love Google stuff I can search in here I can go when am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull up any mention of Brisbane so I can say to the clients I 'll be here on these days and that 's pretty cool so it 's got the mobile version which I love and highly recommend so there 's a lot more features that you can go through in your leisure it manages invites that people accept them you can see it I can share my calendar with people if I wanted to I can sync it without look if I wanted to use both and bunches of other stuff so again like I say these are on the slides now one thing to note for using Google stuff is you kind of have to use the right browser now the browser is what you use to look at the Internet and some of these might look familiar I don 't know which of these you click on to look at the internet but if you 're clicking on Internet Explorer that 's probably not going to work that well with some of the Google products Google Chrome which is this icon here is going to work better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonia what 's your preferred browser and what works well with Microsoft sir um I probably look like three different browsers in my day because I have different windows open and different login and I have three screens as well so I 'm a bit all over the place but microscope reservation Google Chrome and google chrome works really well for office 365 stuff yeah so one thing I would say is this whatever you use I want to push you outside your comfort zone and I encourage you to go download another browser so this will be in your homework that we 'll send out to as well but how do you do this you just go to google google calm so we 're most people search you could go to bring as well I get search i 'm download it say i want to here we go I think I 've already got this on my machine when it wants to load and there it is there I click on download it and they 're all free so none of these will cost you any money but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tools are going to introduce you to over the next few weeks some will work well and browsers or not on others so probably Chrome and Firefox are the most popular one are they the ones you can be go to be the most on you out III now my other two internet one certain Microsoft one so you 've Google Chrome Internet Explorer and edge which is Microsoft 's new browser on Windows 10 so glad I asked it you do it differently to me I would go Chrome Firefox Safari probably third if I had to I 've got a couple more slides well in westeros I want only to have heaps of time there 's an ecosystem so not only are those those tools but you can go to Google Chrome extensions so Chrome doc google.com slash Web Store and you can then download other things that help you be more productive and more profitable online so they 're definitely worth checking out for your homework some of my favorites would be the Google Calendar ones for Gmail offline one the Google Drive ones I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you can actually I saw a question on this earlier do an email and say I want this to go at 9 a.m. not midnight but they don 't know you 've been working at midnight or because it 's tuition and it gets there on a certain deadline so that 's a good one but there 's a social media one where you can see a cool article and quickly from your browser it to go out on your social channels later this one is cross the works that 's what we use throughout the RM which we 'll talk about in later months and reports of you can add to Gmail and see on the right-hand side what social channels are person you 're talking to on email heads and therefore to next to them on LinkedIn and things like that so the home workers search for and we 're relevant also look at some Google Chrome extensions that might help your business so go under the umbrella productivity or go under the umbrella finance and see what you can find that looks cool download it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boomerang boomerang is supported by office 365 as well and it 's great for being able to do things like smooth emails out of your inbox so that they pop up a couple of days later if someone hasn 't replied to you again that 's a cool tip I love em Randy you need to remind some people looks fun I 'm probably one of those people that need be reminded okay over the use zhonya Microsoft ecosystem helped us understand how it works okay office 365 is you said this ecosystem word that comes up again it basically means a collection of things under the one banner and for us that also means the one login which makes things really easy our first record is about more than just a monthly updated version of Word and Excel and the office products we used to and all of those little icons will appear in different forms depending on the planes that you 're on and this is before office 365 comes in a couple of different flavors you can have a business subscription that gives you access to online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud and online versions of Word Excel and PowerPoint with nothing installed anywhere or you can get a version of office 365 that still supports those installed applications that you may want on your PC but doesn 't give you online versions of Word or some of the other productivity features or you can mix and match both so the business premium plan for example which is about 12 50 per person per month lets you not only use the online services but you can install office we 're on up to five pcs or Macs and then five phones or tablets for the planned person so these days you know you probably have a phone maybe an iPad a laptop maybe a desktop in the office so under your license your code for all of those devices to install the things you want to install whether they 're installed software on a PC or they are I always saw Android apps for example and you can also add individual services so if you have somebody in your office that literally just needs to use mail and calendar you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to pay for them to have all the other stuff if they only need access to my own calendar so Sunday we have planned to do sort of live demos of bunches of stuff but under gana I 'm what if it cut it short but if it was one live demo we want to tell me what it is and we 'll just make sure we pause on that or yeah we might just do the next one actually so if I will talk about mail and calendar and her outlook looks and we 'll take a bit of a look a bit of look at that on screen I think because I had a couple of tips and tricks for using that so the way that Microsoft reviews mail and calendar is it 's all part of the one mailbox and online it 's called outlook it 's different from Outlook that you install on your PC and it works slightly differently in the browser but the majority of the functionality is there and so it puts mail and calendar into that what we call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my screen and share it so you can take a look and see okay if you want to minimize your screen event and beautiful okay so this is office of outlook that 's actually installed on my PC I can work offline if I need to I 've got a few emails in there and there 's a couple of little tricks I want to show you this here for example I 'm viewing up by conversation which means there were actually a couple of other emails that were sent here and our lookers realized that they 're part of the same chain now I 've decided that this particular thing is being handled by the team and I really don 't need to get involved in it at all it doesn 't concern me and so I 'm going to do is going to right-click on this I 'm going to go ignore I can actually ignore that message and what it 's going to do is it 's going to make this message to my deleted items folder and any replies that come in to this are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to see them if I suddenly remember that I am being brought back on that projection I do need to know what 's going on I can go back into my deleted items and I can stop ignoring the conversation to get both back but it 's really handy if say someone 's arranging leaving drinks next Friday night and you can 't go because you 've got other plans right you don 't want 50 emails going backwards and forth in your inbox about where we 're going on what time we 're meeting if you can 't even attend so ignore conversation and the very handy head and little trick in there another one that 's great in terms of the calendar integration we 've talked about if I 've got an email that 's talking about connecting up with somebody I can actually drag that straight onto my calendar icon and it will pop up a calendar appointment and it will already fill it in with all of the details from the email and it will only any attachments if there are attachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that straight into my calendar if we haven 't actually decided when we 're going to meet what I can do is a hidden little icon up here which does a reply with meeting and if I have reply it turns this email into a meeting invitation so I can come in here and grab this copy and paste the location I really think I want to meet at 30 for coffee soon let 's make that on Friday at 30 p.m. for example and send today if she sends that as a meeting invitation for the person to to apply to when we 're also talking about integration with online file storage if they 're doing new email and I want to attach a file by clicking on the attach file I can I can sheep as web locations and this little icon here is my onedrive for business so that 's Microsoft 's version of Google Drive where I 've got my files stored and the clowned on this computer they are also synced locally so I can work on them offline online wherever I like but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud my internet is going to be a little bit slow because I 'm screen sharing and doing all the things as well okay so this one here my one onedrive is where my files are if I click on the advertising budget and insert that it 's actually inserting it but it 's a link to the cloud so the person who is getting this effect got access they 'll actually click on this link and they 'll go into the straight online version and they 'll be editing and updating and improving it so when I go into onedrive I 'll be able to see their updates and that straight away now if they don 't have access to this or I don 't want to get them the hassle of the cloud stuff I can click on here and go attach to the copy and that will actually attach it as a standard documentation that we used to other as a separate copy of the file so that 's just a little bit of the the file in the onedrive integration pretty cool yeah we 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring this slide back up thanks again learn I will we can 't help you guys okay I believe that is my screen and back to these slides can you see that yes again okay and so you mentioned Chrome extensions for Google stuff in Outlook and in office 365 there is also a store so Microsoft has a store where they publish extra add-ons that people put in that that atoms in their products find time as a Microsoft exclusive and that lets you create a poll with other recipients to agree on a meeting time so you know that 's like when you 've got maybe three people or more you will need to meet at the same time you do this table tennis back and forth as can I meet no I can 't meet them no they can 't meet then they find moments you create a meeting poll where you pick a few times when you 're available and that gets sent out to the participants and they get to vote on yes I can make this time no I can 't make that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody in agreement it publishes the results and seems that calendar invitations they find it fun times during useful boomerang we talked about that supported in office district five Microsoft bought wonder list and are doing great work in that space that I can 't tell you about you because it 's not been made public but right now they do have an integration between Outlook and wonder list for your ones of us tasks they 've got some PayPal integration intubation with even though if you use that microsoft also has their own product called OneNote but they have Evernote integration effects your thing and also a cool little one for the playing on tasks like a Kanban board so if anybody 's done anything with productivity and moving touch through stages Kanban boards are kind of the cool new thing in terms of productivity and there 's a nice little Adam for that too very cool combine they also call it what the tweeted secretary sucks leaders wrote originated and so they have of exiled stuff so I 'm onedrive how does that vary from D Drive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I mentioned the two visions of onedrive and onedrive for business of onedrive is the free version free you will get about five gigabytes of storage Microsoft 's got some bad press over dropping the limit because it used to be a lot more than that rightly deserved bad press and but what we 're seeing is onedrive for business is the one that comes with your office 365 subscription it has a lot more controls in the back end is the advanced versioning it 's got content approval in it so if you need to push information through an approval cycle and some tasks and things in there as well so onedrive for business just have a lot more of the business controls there is a great little thing called data loss prevention they let you even enforce rules for example like not storing credit cards and Word document so if it 's or a credit card number that have been typed and it would actually give you a warning and weird saying that this isn 't allowed to your organizational policies so there are some very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for business so that would be why I feel a lot of corporate and government clients probably like it quite a lot to make sure that they 've got that by level of security absolutely okay and yeah and just briefly as I see it on the when one of the slides will be looked about all the icons and we 've only just scratched the surface with a couple other products under that office 365 suite a few that you might not know about you bookings was released for the business premium plan which is an online an online booking system so businesses that are services based businesses for example or if you 're a freelancer in your doing some consulting bookings as a service that is included as part of your office 365 subscription where your customers can go to a website see your branding see your services packages how much they cost and how long before and then choose an available time that they you see that you 're free to actually book an appointment with you yeah so there 's bookings the one just below it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if anybody has used systems like as a PR or FM then if the send that which are used for connecting to systems that don 't usually connect together Microsoft flow is Microsoft version of that they are only just getting started in the space they support a lot more Microsoft products than they do third-party products off the rank obviously because that was where the drive and the need was first under their product space but I had never played with it today and I actually managed to create a flow that would monitor my company Facebook page for a particular some particular negative word that somebody was leaving and bad stuff on my Facebook page and then it would send an email to the customer service team with a link to that posting and asking them to trace it up for that customer Microsoft flow is a free product you can actually sign up for flowed on microsoft.com without needing an office through subscription but again it 's there in the absolu ensure we talked about that ecosystem when you log in to office 365 there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the one pool for you Microsoft teams is the other one so that 's on the right hand side that 's my lovely purple window it is very very new it is being billed as the Flex competitor and it is a fantastic space for communicating with your team and forcing company culture when you 've got people in different offices it supports spots and gifts and a whole bunch of stuff for keeping conversations rolling in and keeping people connected to so that 's Microsoft pins cool lots of new stuff I 'd no idea they 're releasing all that because I just hang out in dimple world so but look I have a hard time keeping up with it so it 's a fun job holy this is valuable to you guys minutes ago looking at all the latest releases and you 've got it from someone who is giving you the spin on it so again on the slide 28 we 're not going to like time for live demos Dropbox but I 'd say out of every single map screen probably Dropbox is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers here in the Microsoft environment you have got G drivers here in the Google environment but Dropbox is also another solution that doesn 't really matter which environment we play and I guess that Switzerland option emerge place that 's neutral no yeah and in Dropbox recently released and office online support as well so that you can like view and edit Word documents and Dropbox so they 're all playing nicely together like they are Dropbox has a presence and a presence in Australia now and they are making more and more web solutions their work you sort of funny things that useful and employers but you can essentially get Dropbox for free get someone to invite you to it and if you invite a whole lot of other people to it they give you more storage when you start paying it can get a little bit census I know our teams on a plan that 's about I think 100 a user perhaps a year so what about end users it 's about a thousand dollars a year so we are starting to use more G Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess the poor cousin of Dropbox is still quite popular I drives been around for a long time mozzie you guys might even like to drop in others that you use or know of but the industry standards of probably Dropbox any other comments that lead from us I think so moving on backups are important if you 're going to work on lines maybe even this is the first place to start let 's just start with going online as a business by backing it up and making sure that should something go wrong we 're kind of covered so what you backup really varies business business and again you might prioritize this enjoyable out of everything we would be shot if we lost out that say accounting systems at the moment it 's all on mild and it 's all on a hard drive therefore work out a way to back that up a lot of people don 't think about about backing up their phone yet they take a lot of photos to work on it or even just their treasured family photos think about backing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your computer just over the course of using it are you backing them up how would it affect you some people say to me will house this show back up and I say well how much you prepared to lose if you could go weak and lose it all and it wouldn 't affect business too much then back up every week as the day goes by you do a lot of work if you lost any of it you would die then probably should be backing up every single day there 's other solutions on there some of what you 've suggested for me how do you explain the importance of backing up and how to go about it to customers that 's the biggest issue I see with customers is thinking that cloud or step back up and we 've seen what the ransomware that 's going around that encrypts all your files that if you are thinking things locally to a computer and they get affected those infections are just going to think straight back up to the cloud because the cloud just sees them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how much you 're paying for it is going to determine how easy it is to roll those files back to before they got encrypted and got that virus all over them so it is really important to know what your backup plan is if you need to restore files or roll them back whether or not they 're in Google Drive or one Drive or Dropbox that 's really important and I know some other people like to look at options to see is there a way of backing up my cloud stuff and a completely different system all together so if I 've got my finances in the cloud or if I 'm putting documents in the cloud can I put them somewhere else as well complete outside of that system just so that I know I 've got a copy of my data should anything happen to the company or that system and there are third-party providers out there that do even support backing up things like your office365 will you Jeff suite data into another system so I gives all these solutions we 're giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you think this is enough to go on and you could do it yourself go for it but if you think this is pretty important there 's a lot of stuff I 'm not even sure where it is or how we go about it in some cases you guys might be better to pay an external consultant to really do a thorough job on this and get it right that 's totally up to you as Sonia was just alluding to though it can even happen to the big guys it doesn 't happen often and they 're very careful and I dare say better than most because their whole livelihood depends on it but you know back in 2011 some Gmail users lobster accounts and they have a lot of users there were outages of Amazon some people back up their stuff to Amazon servers a lot of people don 't realize a lot of the technology and software companies used Amazon servers so when they 're affected affects other companies and this example reddit HootSuite Foursquare now some of these examples are affair while ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that actually hasn 't been others if I really went looking I 'm sure I could find headlines of alpha jizz all over apparently even Facebook went down today the do you get from where is it you too busy to be on Facebook today so no I didn 't hear that that was one of our team put out something funny about us being out for 30 minutes ins and all just about having withdrawal so it was the business surfaces I like to think that it just happened today apparently oh okay I 'm conscious of the time but zooming through these last few slides there is a whole lot more stuff you can have in the cloud we 're going to cover this in future workshops and webinars if you 're sitting there going oh but I really want to snow that online accounting tonight or CRM or something else don 't worry is a high chance we 'll be covering this tonight is really about talking opening your eyes to the basics like backups and systems that you might go on and helping you get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nitty Gritty so we have got some downsides here you can read at your vini and such so what 's already being used is it offshore as it has been backed up into a Dropbox or something else and they 're owned by an American company on the love of cases your subjects jurisdictions you want to base Italy look at the fine print and work out how that affects your business and also keep up to date with the changing face of legislation this is still new relatively new charactery there 's one landmark case and it means that everything changes about where you can store it now you can store it what you can store so there 's time to keep up with that doing this sort of training what you 're doing is a good idea privacy commissioners really stuff and there can be other trainings available and how do you explain the risks to people and where to look to check out what sorts of things to be aware of from a legal perspective well if I lost you something oh sorry I mute my mic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do a search that you 'll find it 's where they explain a lot of things in plain English about security and compliance I know it 's really hard because for a lot of cloud providers is buried under those terms and conditions and we all read those right but it 's really it really is a case of doing your investigation and you do due diligence first offici if you are and are very heavily regulated and compliance type environment just it 's worth getting it done properly we use an accountant for our for our finances they are the professionals say no to tax laws and it 's not the kind of thing that I do myself because the risk is too great and if you 're putting your information and the cloud and nearly internet you 've really got to take the same approach so they get professional help this last piece I 'm going to leave you for your homework so the government Queensland Government 's actually put out a new resource and if you 're kind of like well I don 't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we not it 's actually a new digital scorecard and it will help you think about how online or digital ready as your business right now so I 'm going to send you this link so you can do that it only takes a few minutes myself and it 's a digital scorecard so you enter your details and it gives you a school I did really well you may or may not get that school I 'm quite competitive I 'd love to know how I get the other two percent and then you can view it in a visual sense as well have you to play with the school card technology at all yes now I haven 't seen it before that 's really cool yeah it 's brand-new um so yeah it 's have a look at it and I 'm encouraging all of us to do it just as a bit of a benchmark and started going on this journey on the program and hopefully at the end of the program we can redo this and see that we 've all made some improvements which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have the chance to ask questions I think will I answer these in the text format I 'm going to go back through the question we 've had to date and feel free to ping yours now that you know what we 've covered and at the very very end I will give you a few other I guess little housekeeping and headlines about program and how to get get engaged some more if some your point peaceful um I might just turn off my screen share which you guys probably don 't need to see everything that goes on here is upset mm-hmm not able to okay so when I ask you what you 're all using I had office 365 365 Google three six five three six five 365 an old office package 2007 and Google Google on desktop and operations live on laptop older version of Microsoft Office resupplied and Google Google lift Microsoft ages ago Microsoft Office 2013 so we 've got a big mixture in there so just as we thought Andrew backed up that banks never send email links as we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets yes Helen there is resources in the online resource portal with links to these and if they 're not there they will be up within the week usually whatever webinar content we deliver resources slides recording are all made available during the week for that week so you can focus on them on work there 's a really good help file here to ask do I use a paid version of boomerang like that I don 't use a paid version what about you Sonya no DeYoung office365 version is free actually it 's not pay for it on who yeah it does my stuff why things need it to do um Rachel a question might share it might benefit others she said I use G Suites my email that doesn 't fit with Outlook for the calendar but longer you answer that saying Google Calendar can be added in as read-only is a feature request ins make it to way but it 's complicated anything else Ed 's next on you welcome you know I do have some customers that have fun between Outlook and Google and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use mail and calendar it really does pay to stick to the one system so whether that 's Google or its Office 365 they do lose features if you try and cross the streams with those two particular products so I think you 're just best to use this you know is the one that 's a platform that you use and yeah I 'm Charles gave a good tip and I love that when our participants give tips we love to share those and I sometimes learn too you did look at Google Apps unlimited for unlimited space so unlimited so is it but you know can never have enough it 's worry about adding to and adding more money so yeah and some of the office365 phones offer unlimited storage for onedrive for business as well so and you know business is kind of probably want that right they don 't want to be stopping every now and then going up will run out of storage please cancel to get us more you just mix women Christine Feist is my of is online now as well it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting we 'll be explaining that and 0 another online systems to do with accounting we will have an online accounting expert online like Sonya 's next good at Microsoft stuff so you can step into their brain Heather 's added Carbonite has moved their storage location so back up to Australia now takes a month support is awesome that computer resource tanks a month with no options for sender file and the mail I 'm not using Carbonite not that familiar with it but it must be another file storage system ok Shane said where do you find the Microsoft at such as through Morang you do a live demo of that at all Sonya the easiest place to find them is there 's two places you can find them inside outlook itself if you have it installed there 's a store icon that actually sits at the top on your bar with all your other icons and it 's a nice little red briefcase store icon if you are logged in to office 365 on your launcher on your app launcher it 's actually there 's a Store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm tempted to close this video because I 'm conscious that this affects you right now but I 'm scared if I do that might actually close out the whole session so music they can 't do that Helen has our caddy a backup G suite well as we pointed out it is essentially online and that is essentially your backup there were two solutions we just mention I 'll just go back to those for your eyes the one sidekick and storage press I wasn 't actually aware of those but I 'm Sonia you were saying they work for Google and Microsoft is that right yeah Skype Skype Skype echoing supports office365 at the moment I know storage craft upbringing G suite online so storage craft is a an amazing company internationally and here in Australia fantastic local support we use storage craft backup software for anybody that has a server at their place or a critical computer that they need to protect but storage craft also have a cloud backup offering that is new to the market so they backup office365 right now is G suite is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasn 't quite listened yet so I don 't have an ETA for it but George Kraft cloud backup will allow you to backup your emails your calendars and the stuff in your G Drive cool so hopefully that answers your question Helen I 'm not seeing any more questions coming through so hopefully we 've given you guys a really good comprehensive session an interest of time I might close it up but I would like to thank everyone for getting online and official thanks to Sonya for giving the time up we can all see I think from our knowledge of why she is Richard Snyder with the wards things with Microsoft and you 're so up-to-date I love the fact you 're saying that completely new and and that 's all being really valuable stuff and Thank You Sonya a most pleasure thank you so much for the invitation no worries so feel free to say online I 'm just going to give these guys a real quick rundown off the level up program so some of you may have just joined this webinar seen and advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on if you want to get the most out of this program we kind of need to surround you with lots of support and resources because there is a fair bit to this as we said it 's not just about a couple of tweaks and some IP it 's sort of you know operational change so if you are to do the whole program you 'll get access to all these levels we 've called it the level up programs as businesses kind of like a game and we want to take you through the levels it starts off easy it gets product right now we 're at level 2 but you can go back and look at level 1 when we make it available so we 're going to go through all these lessons now you could continue to jump on these webinars for free each week and that 's all you do effectively you have time for and will gladly take you but if you wanted to get a little more out of the program you could actually sign up for the full program get access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support and all of that is only 295 not only that that doesn 't cover one person it covers up to four from your organization so it 's less than a hundred dollars to a person if you look at it that way now soon we will be charging 25 for access to the recordings if you can 't make them if you are a program participant you get access to the recordings anyway that 's all inclusive but you can jump on the live sessions for free if you prefer or just one workshop that grabs your attention your prefer learning in person there 's three and a half hours you can come along to one of those as well we tend to cover three to four topics per session so they 're kind of like taking the webinar content and running them concurrently but sometimes these different trainers we might make it more interactive so there 's slightly different than of webinar format as well if you do join the program these are all the things you get with creating workbooks at the moment we 'll be loading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your emails to prompt you to continue learning but super important if you haven 't received emails from us today and you are in the program that you let us know so we can check your email and that you are receiving them we have had a couple of people that aside and received anything but it turned out we had the wrong email on file for them you do do the program you also get access to a private Facebook group if you are on the program I 'd encourage you to look on the online portal and join that we 'd love to have you on there but super valuable is a mentor so you only get this if you do the full program not if you come to work shuttle justice and webinars these are experienced people a lot of them are digital champions as named by Queensland government and they 'll sit down with you will pay them and they can go through the stuff with you you can say hey I did a session last night with some your any event and I learn about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't know which one 's best for my business and they all help guide you on the journey of what to do about that so there 's a lot of boys on that photo but don 't worry we do have some girls and once you become a program assistant you can go onto the system and book a session with them whether it be online or in person for an hour and it could be a one-off or it can be a regular thing the mentor just has to be available and willing the Facebook group as I said about 400 people in there some from previous programs with run but all have the same thing in common they 're motivated and committed to improving their businesses digitally and you can ask questions mentors will come and trainers will come in other program assistants like we 're doing today collaborating and helping each other in the journey they 're really valuable to join that as well if you want to join other webinars they 're almost all on Tuesdays at 30 that 's not a good time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your program assistant we just ran lots of surveys and early days of programs and we found that that Kim did see a bit of time for businesses that just don 't get a lunch break and can 't concentrate then and their evening for better for them so that 's why I was gone for that topic but there 's a topic you can look at at your measure we 've got the different workshops coming up it 's actually we 're a bit mixed up say this should say three and this should say four workshop one is actually happening on the 26th of May all of these are listed on events we 've changed up how they are registered for now so you 'll actually go through Eventbrite because we had some issues which we rescheduled due to me being in the hospital and nearly died that we had to change up that system and streamline it a little bit so that 's all being done now so anyways any other since grabbing your attention you can go to level up Sunshine Coast cured even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to register any of those webinars workshops coming up or people you know please direct them to that event page and finally this program wouldn 't be possible without the support of lots of awesome partners we 've got telcos on board we 've had support from Regional Development Australia in VN cciq Chamber Alliance and others so there is a really great offer actually from hive which is one of our newer program partners they 're not listed on there we can get some free days co-working at their amazing your space and oh my gosh if you 've never experienced fast internet you 've got to go in there because it is screamingly fast go and try it and see what life is like in businesses like on buses in it you may just want to relocate Rockets to there or go work there once a week to get access to fast internet because it 's pretty damn cool doesn 't look like any more questions as come through so getting lots of thank-yous and cheers an informative session so that is great feedback we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamline pass to just keep delivering this program and helping out business so I 'll see you online next week or my business partner will also facilitate some some weeks actually something to a week when won 't you quit won 't even because we 'll see you online next week at 30 and lots more stuff that loads to the online resource portal and notifications to go out through the week have a good week and do your homework good night all and thanks again Sonia"

    "text": "I was born born and raised in Sunshine Coast and I was raised by my grandmother and she talked to us at the kitchen table that 's where I got all my stories all the information sitting around there and then you know living here and walking the land is what we sort of talk about and you know protecting things that need to protect it and just following the laws and so you know I get the opportunity to talk about that local knowledge that perspective comes from the Aboriginal people how they saw the land and what the land sort of provided both being gifted with a little bit of skill with the hand I can draw a bit I use that telling a bit and and try and create some of the stories with the art yeah and a lot of the patterns that you see in the art patterns and designs artwork that was from this district I 've done a number of seasons in the painting and I basically called it his native place that 's a phrase that was coined by one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herb chili when they asked him about you know his connection and the way he labeled this place he called it his native place I did sort of season indicated stories stories that pertain to or you know where the people source or a plant or something flower or loser sparks they could they knew what was in season where they needed to be camping and waiting for that food at first one being the mullet migration story where the seagull sort of pictured in the middle of the painting and it 's sort of signifying that this animal was our ally and in fact that it helped us know when to start the hunting for the fish I see him every time you go out there you always seem see him or her but you know that one is a symbol of that mullet season when the red stringy bark loses its bark the mullet are running up into our district for spawning the temperature of the water is perfect and so they 're coming up here to release all of eggs in the warm temperature water all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had mullet run you know but leading on from the mullet you know you 've got the story of the dolphin I put the dolphin on me the dolphin was another animal that was our ally just like the sea eagle we would never hurt the Dolphins we would never hurt the sea eagles with only hunt the mullet fish you know but that seagull as we said you know it told us when we could start a hunt so the mullet was here but we didn 't enter the water until a seagull started the hunt it told us that we couldn 't hunt the leaders but the followers juveniles are the ones you 're allowed to hunt so when the leaders passed through the water nothing gets hunted until they pass through our district our part of water we see the seagulls in our district striking the top of the water then we will enter the water only then you know your nets Spears your canoes are poised and ready to enter the water sinister seagull strikes as the mullet season continues the mullet still here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt with with eating a mullet let 's go down and get some more and so you know you might need a different technique of catching this is the way that people did it in this district they they use the dolphins and they used to call out to them even call out to their names in the song and and slap the water with their spears or make some of type of commotion at the water 's edge usually in a bay area or on a point where the fish can be herded into in court and the Dolphins respond with the signal of tapping of the water percussion and they respond by coming towards the coastline at the same they 're they 're scaring any fish in those deeper waters towards shallower waters towards the coastline driving the fish towards us but you know one of the most important things is the portion of the catch is given back to sea eagles to the Daltons most importantly and then you sort of come up the rivers and in the rivers they 're you know you 've got abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now really I did a mud crab one I grew up in this area and the mud crab was one of our favorite I 'd have to say one of my favorites and the uncles were their providers I 'd wake up to the smell of the mud crabs cooking on the pot they just got home and they just wanted to cook a feed before they go to have a little bit of a camp because they didn 't had all night you know I 've had to straight up the bat hot straight out of the pot with some bread that he just got from the bakery and there was one of my favorite sort of things growing up here eating so I thought incorporate that story and then you know tell about the the season of it there 's a tree it 's a growth round here everywhere just like the registry marks is indicated for the mullet the batwing coral tree is indicated for the mud crabs it 's the one that sort of tells you now therefore now that fat does the best time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red bloom and so you know you think it wants and so to do it mudkip but then you sort of realize I hear that 's what the color is when it 's cooked and so I 've incorporated that put that orangey bloom in there with the batwing coal leaf very distinctive leeks the mud crab very distinctive animal you know so then you know also incorporated that Black Swan and then that Black Swan is a very important figure for Don Marucci River Marucci is the word for the Black Swan it 's a compound word has got three words involved Mirchi door you 've got muru is nose which is red door or dart it 's a place of so the place of the red nose on the place of the black fondant our families would hunt them in molting season but some some people that were related to them like they told him they wouldn 't touch them and so there is the story of you know the Black Swan and how it sort of molds into the creation story of how the Marucci River came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of you know people understand that Marucci cried her tears in the story which created the salty waters of the the river and then also in the background that it 's very hard to sort of see but I 've got a I 've got a carpet snake twirling around the Sun sort of thinking he 's in the background he 's of the symbol of this area and if the season indicator for him was really your royal passionfruit and whenever that 's in bloom people were allowed to eat the cup of snake and some people didn 't you know like our family didn 't we didn 't because there was our totem animal and these are stories that relate to this land they 're not anybody 's owner of it it 's something that people knew that lived here and so I want to continue on that tradition and keep up the knowledge of the landscape that the people that live here now feel other next people to be the carers of it the custodian so warming them about those stories can help them achieve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunshine Coast Airport we 've got international you know people coming in now so it 's getting very broad but you know to get that out there as part of the you know what they see and experience here I think that 's that 's a great great thing for me to be a part of"

your businesses productivity and profitably I 've got about an hour with you tonight and I have allocated time for questions if you haven 't been on a webinar before there is a text chat area and you 're very welcome to drop me a line and I 'll do my best to keep an eye out on that as we go through the content and but I will mostly hope rose over until the end um I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything and restart everything due to the late start but um yeah as I said the program level up is a initiative from sunshine coast council you 're very progressive council for offering a program like this and the reason they 're offering it is they want to see our local economy and grow and develop and right here on the sunshine coast we have the Indian being rolled out right now at the moment which is really exciting some areas have it already some won 't have it for another 12 months 18 months but the reality is that everybody well not everybody lots of areas will eventually have it at the moment there 's about what the figures it 's about 30,000 businesses that will be able to have it and about 16,000 only have got it on at the moment so there 's still a long way to go in terms of who my access it I 'm just going to share my slides I 've got those ready to go for you now so if you could just give me a thumbs up if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off because you don 't really need me much more exciting just a little slides at least know what I look like ok here we are on the slides and good luck that will work beautifully once it loads there we are there 's a slide so as I say the liver that program so as I same Indian is rolling out and the coast Center increase council wants you to fully utilize digital tools innovation principles and business solutions to help you basically get more productive like do more in a day but maybe have more time at the other end too I know I was just at the beach earlier this afternoon which was awesome with the family and profitability so they want you to make more money and do it in an easier way and we also want everyone to have the opportunity to compete nationally and internationally I 'm biased but I think we live on one of the most beautiful parts of the world and I traveled about 40 countries over a seven-year period so I kind of say that with a little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could just in enough to get by you could work for somebody else or if you 've got a business which lots and lots of people do you can actually grow your visit you lay on back now you confirm if you can hear me now ok cool complete our google chrome crash which is lots of our okay here we are here 's the slides again and we can get back into the content so as I was saying welcome to this webinar provided to you by the Sunshine Coast Council it 's all about the level up program a digital upskilling program that the Sunshine Coast Council is offering my name is Yvette Adams I 'll be your presenter today I 'd love you to interact with me and send me your questions and if you can do that via the texture area or I can have a chat with you later on at of the session as I was saying here on the Sunshine Coast the NBN or national broadband network and other faster internet solutions are rolling out all over the coast some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and I won 't have them for another 12 to 18 months so we want to make sure you know what to do with it if you have them on how to prepare for it if you don 't already have it once you 've got the NBN it 's not just about having fast internet keeping on doing what you 've always done faster but is actually about looking at perhaps using different tools that can make you get the job done quicker and easier and maybe even make more money it may even be more competitive maybe even with national and international companies despite being based right here on sunshine coast which is a pretty nice lifestyle before we get into the content I do want to acknowledge some awesome program partners we have we just signed on another one this week which is the hive which is a new co-working space in maroochydore has 200 mega pixels up and down speed which if you don 't know what sort of speed that is my original offer speed was eight down so 200 is pretty exceptionally fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one if you 're lucky so they 've got 200 up as well which is amazing if you want to run a web an hour upload speed they 're actually nice enough to be offering some options for people who sign up for a level up program for you to go and try the hive and see if you like it so contact them and let them know that you are involved in the level up program and they look after you we 've also got a lot of the local telcos or telecommunications companies involved as partners also cciq which is of course a Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland Sunshine Coast chamber Alliance which is all the different chambers of commerce here on the coast integ which has some pretty cool technology solutions to offer regional developments tralia even Indians come on board but the program is being developed and delivered for you by the Sunshine Coast council so a quick little background on me before we get into the content so for those of you who I haven 't met before I was born and raised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left there when I was 21 and I traveled the world for seven years as I was saying earlier went to about 40 countries so I do feel like I 'm qualified to say I feel like some time post the most beautiful place around I ended up here in 2004 I brought my little boy who was born in England my children now aged 10 my girl and 13 my boy so I 've been juggling businesses around them my first two business is actually first one was when I was 17 it was a newspaper second one was when I was 26 it was a fashion online store so it was selling t-shirts online and this is around the year 2000 and I actually remember saying to people hey by one of my t-shirts online on this HTML knocked up website I 've made and it uses paypal and people were going oh my gosh i 'm not buying something online that 's so dangerous and now that 's really common place it just shows how far we 've come i sold that business and i sold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creative collective which is a digital marketing agency based here in maroochydore we do websites we do social media we do SEO etc we 've been in this space well that business has been operation for 10 years this may which is pretty exciting whatever 10th birthday party then I have the training collective which is a digital upskilling company so we actually are those two companies successfully tendered with sunshine coast Council to win this contract and it is because we 've operated as a business with the creative collective fully cloud-based since we started really whatever was available and there 's become more and more stuff available so 2009 not so we went fully cloud that 's when we started using zero that 's where we moved to gmail away from things like Microsoft Outlook so I 'm by no means saying don 't use some of these things that I refer to or do use these things but the program is all about introducing you to alternative options and you have any information to make a decision on what 's right for you um I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find business awards and we also do your business awards applications I get to do some pretty cool stuff like speak for Google and lots of other organizations I have my own online show that should say about young entrepreneurs you can download that and watch it for free on a app called Bryn I 'm also the chair of the knowledge of professional services task force for the Sunshine Coast council so ever feel that to do with them and the chair of the Australian Institute of company directors for the Sunshine Coast committee so a little busy I guess you could say and short though I love business I 'm really closely connected to lots of amazing people and I get a real kick out of helping up a business owners to find out what 's out there apply it and really get great results so look this whole level up concept we actually came up the brand and we came up with a concept because we were saying you know business is a lot like a game well if you want to get into it you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play it and whatever level you 're starting it whether it 's ground zero level one because you really don 't have the skills or knowledge to start it or whether you 're starting at level five because maybe like a guy I was talking today he 's had a couple of businesses already and it kind of knows what he 's doing um we don 't really mind what level you 're starting on with this program we just want you to go from whatever level you 're at and go to a higher level so you 'll go to the website and I could show you it later and may recognize that level one is all about just getting onto faster internet being safe online so for some of you that would be super easy content and for others of you you 'll go actually I could benefit from that I really need to start with just the basics moving right through to higher levels you 'll find they get progressively more advanced so the short of it is I think you 'll agree that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you have to have digital skills if you want to survive in business and you have to be applying them so we 're basically saying what are you waiting for let 's go play so here 's the issue I don 't know if you 're aware but Amazon which is a really massive online company is actually starting here in September in Australia so Amazon 's been around for a long long time in America I remember ordering books from it in early 2000s in the UK and I was always amazed at how great the online experience was and how they up sold you and how they do free shipping and they would get content to you the books to just so super quick so um nowadays in the UK in America and other countries as well they ought to just about everything from amazon not just books they can literally the night before go oh I need a new hair dryer let 's say i 'll order one on amazon and using their card they go on and it 's there the next day so what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're selling products and you 're in a retail environment means a lot people could sell it on amazon maybe they already are you need to relook at your business model and we 're getting your products from and whether you might need to sell different products that they 're not selling on amazon or sell them for cheaper or offer free shipping or offer some value some service about how you help people select those products don 't be complacent please know that this is a major disruption you 've also got to think of this as an opportunity though to could you as a local sub-bass sunshine coast business start selling on amazon because that 's a massive opportunity and a massive audience if you can not only sell to people with the sunshine coast but maybe even nationally and maybe even internationally that 's pretty exciting there 's other major e-commerce juggernauts entering this space in Australia so another one is Ali Baba they are the biggest e-commerce website in the world sell a lot of clothing and things like that they sit up officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're already here and they 're doing stuff as well and that will also continue to change the space um this one isn 't an online example but my point here is that even the big guys don 't go under and I don 't know the exact backstory to Masters and Wyatt went but I just marvel at the fact there are a huge operation employing a lot of people a lot of stock big warehouses and things and maybe just maybe they weren 't keeping up with changes and operating agile and being productive and profitable as they could be maybe they weren 't playing the digital game so they closed all that stores end of last year even the big guys it happens to talking about disruption this is one that 's usually sort of hits home and really tangible I say to my kids do you remember when we used to go the video store in a rainy day and get candy and rent a video and bring it home and basically scratch sometimes and it was all part of the experience well these days none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store a pretty crazy phenomenon they 'll all stream start from places like Netflix and there 's lots of others as well so those businesses got disrupted and you know video stores are very few and far between now um as I was saying earlier the current situation with all this fast internet stuff here on the coast is that the national broadband network or the NBN has been deployed in some communities around australia and ghana Sunshine Coast already if you live in areas like Caloundra Ryan Williams who were working closely with from the EM bein was telling us that an event you won 't actually get it until about during next year so it 's a little over a year to wait during 2018 that is in Mullaney there are pockets where because of configuration you can 't get it but the key to know is there are alternatives so through this program we 're hoping to introduce you to what those alternatives are one of the alternatives is 1 i 've already mentioned that 's actually going and working out of someone like the hive i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good internet we bought a telstra box we still couldn 't get online so ended up and co-working space called coke cave and we loved it was fast internet they had people coming and giving massages and selling honey and it was a wonderful day of working and meeting new people another thing to know about our current situation in terms of the internet here on the sunshine coast as is actually proposal out to possibly build an undersea internet cable in our own region which I think would be an absolute game changer what that means is they will wrap a cable into the ocean coming from Guam which is a country in Asia where a lot about internet comes from believe it or not and they have already done the feasibility studies topographically geographically it makes a lot of sense for this cable to come into the sunshine coast now if it did that would open up whole industries we might get servers with boo CIT seen people who are seeking fast internet and cheap Brent as opposed to places like Sydney and Melbourne where most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine coast so if you 're a business that really would benefit from fast internet that is also a project you can get involved in and petition on here 's the thing as well some regions got the Indian really early like a few years ago now and this is a example in burnie tasmania so they got the fast internet they can have a program like this from the local council no one did really anything different and life went on as normal Bernie so look you know there are still safe and healthy and that 's awesome but their whole local economy the pointers could have been potentially grown boosted new jobs created people having more time with their families if only they 'd known one to get on the NBN and two to be utilizing the faster internet for business results now the main reason i hear business is saying I can 't get the fast internet I can 't learn these programs I can 't change the way I do it because I haven 't got the time is usually a really common excuse look I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy business owner I wear lots of hats I have to do the HR today did for interviews back to back I have to resolve IT issues I have to make money I have to think about marketing and all that stuff and it is really hectic and I have to be a mum and all those other hats I told you I wear but I want to appeal to you and say you know you really got to find the time for the stuff because if you don 't you might not have a business to be busy and much longer because if your competitors are getting onto these tools and doing things quicker you know able to offer them cheaper they get a give a bit of service to the customers then maybe people going to start using that 's the the hard truth of it the other excuse i hear a lot is um i haven 't got the money well I get that because I didn 't have the money when I started my business and if you are a start-up or home-based business or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time having the money to start up everything you need whether it 's a computer stock outsourcing your bookkeeping or just whatever it is you need money wise to get started so um the good news is a lot of the tools will introduce you to as part of the level up program actually are either free free is good right or low cost so I 'm talking ten dollars a month twenty dollars a month thirty dollars a month which you might say yeah but if I get you know five or six of them that 's 100 bucks or you know 150 bucks worth of subscriptions a month well you know what it might be but if I said to you that was going to save you how many hours a month maybe of quite a few hours it would totally be worth 150 dollars right and it might also be worth that if you don 't have to hire someone to do those things so an example of that is I use an online calendar system and I could pay someone to schedule all my appointments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the backbone out of it by sending people my calendar link which links with my google calendar and people can see when i 'm free and not available in request an appointment so there 's none others back and forth and mucking around and that 's something that saves me time just as an example so because you 've been good enough to get online tonight I wanted to give you something and you know whether your sign up to the program will have more to do with sunshine coast Council or anything I wanted you to go away feeling like that was a good session I 've got something out of it so what should you be doing in relation to this whole topic we 're talking about well number one I would encourage you to check what speed you have now and I 've got a tool on that and I 'll flip back to those slides if you 're going on my part I didn 't read that um you can all right now pull up this if you want and do a live demo go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely crashed while I was mid on air and I had a nice flow on so I 'm so sorry about that I 'm just going to share my screen again i 'm not sure why things are not behaving themselves tonight can you all just before i continue confirm that you were able to see the slides a moment ago and that you were hearing me okay until my chrome crashed he say yes and the text area if you were okay fantastic hopefully over here I 'm saying yeses and yep so thank you guys for confirming that I 've live a clear round until the finish I hope you getting what 's out of the session I was just talking to you before we got interrupted by my naughty machine or software just crashing this one so I was encouraging you to go to speedtest.net and run a quick test so one of the things you want to do before you go and get fast internet there 's no what you 've got now maybe you 've got fast internet and you don 't really need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want now and how do you use it kind of good together so oh I 'm on 8 download and 1.1 megabytes up and you 'll sound really intelligent so love you to do that and text me through what your speed is as a live exercise so once you know what speed you have you can go shopping so I 'm the Indian co websites really good it 's got three step process week it helps you find a runner little test in the NBN Co calm calm calm delay you business you can actually work out what services you already need that rely on the internet and it can make recommendations of what sort of package you might need it can also tell you when your internet will be available in your area which is pretty cool so we encourage you to access fast internet and tell us if you have next up we encourage you to review your current business systems and procedures because then we can help you identify where you might get some efficiencies so I to consider things like am i doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my banking online do I do my accounting online tour do my payroll online do I use a project management system if that 's relevant to what you do do I have my calendar online do i do my emails online technically everything can be online and it can be integrated you can get some pretty good efficiency so that 's the sort of stuff for what you can set up and I also want you to consider gee if I could save some time on this little annoying thing I spend a lot of time on then be amazing so just give me the problem and I 'll do my best to resolve it the other thing is I encourage you to take your whole team on the journey whatever changes you and get involved in whatever training you engage in this should not be the job of one person if you are at one person business and even if you are on a person business bring your advisors along for the journey bring your accountant bring your business coach bring your lawyer whoever is keen to learn some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along because it will really help you get the most out of it too and I also encourage you to make the stuff a priority or you could end up like a blockbuster or a masters too so send those speed tests through if you want to run it and see me how you got on so once you have good internet we 're saying let 's do the level up program leave it if you haven 't got the fast internet let 's do the program anyway because you can do the program learn all the stuff and then when the fast internet comes to your area you 'll already be skilled and though exactly what new solutions and things you might get in place so who is this for this program or basically micro and small businesses from research we know there are many of you on the sunshine coast in fact they 're about ninety two percent of all the 30,000 businesses here on the coast a micro ism one or two people or smaller than about five people so we want people who are motivated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity they 're easy to do things efficiency and who want to build their technical and digital capabilities because they 've got this faster internet available now so what can you do to get involved in this program well option one you 're actually already doing you could come to a live-in position we 've actually ran a lot of these now they 're all on this website level up sunshine coast qld Guv today you we 're running the last one at Nambour next week on the fifth of april so that 's totally free if you want to meet us see that for real also come along and meet some of the telcos and hear what might be available in your area and or when it will be available and how much it costs and how to get it on all that kind of stuff come to one of those live free you ok so I 'm sharing my screen again here we are we were talking about our options for engaging in the program so I 'm just going to double check we 're all running ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so option two is a webinar you 're doing that now and because it 's been a bit stop and start and don 't worry I 've got a good copy of a webinar I did on the first March that one there and I didn 't drop out that day so I 'll send you all a copy of that and you can watch it with this interruptions next time so thank you for your patience tonight look option three is just to come to some three and a half or half day our workshops and we 're running them starting straight after Easter so from the 20th of April they heavily subsidized usually the workshop like that would probably set you back a few hundred bucks but because it 's a council program only 75 a workshop first and first serve you can go and register for them now at live laptop sunshine coast qld up today you so feel free I 'm option for is to engage in one or more content webinars so they 're going to start after Easter as well and we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be using the same crowdcast technology I 'll be doing more tests with my chrome before we start the content and they are some really great topics have got some really great speakers and experts on those you can attend them totally for free or you can pay 25 to get the recordings thereafter or you can access the whole program for 295 dollars and up to four people can do that sorry that so that 's you and three others like I said if it 's only you and your business get your business partner get your banker get your account and a lawyer or any business advisors to access that as well maybe even a life partner so I 'll tell you more about the program because though at the moment you might be going well I 'll just do a workshop 75 bucks cheaper than 295 there 's all this value built into the program so let me tell you about it um these are the topics will go through that 's quite small text there I 'm going to leave this on the sku are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicting for some reason so as I said the levels get progressively more difficult level one is getting online with faster internet how to be safe and smart online using online storage so look at stuff like g-drive at boxtop near and um dropbox and i 've already using these things you 're going i 'd be all right at that listen i would encourage you to be open-minded and get on all of them because even if we show you one little trick with Dropbox that you didn 't know and it does save your time or it does save you money then I think you 'll be pretty happy with us so open minds required for all lessons and levels live on to will show you how to work more efficiently online who doesn 't want to you know get more done in the day and maybe log off early and do what they really loved or even spend time with their families so and that will talk about with a G sweep or office 365 is the better environment the honest truth is there is neither but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll talk about google calendar and docs and Drive and Dropbox and more tools that you can be more efficient online with level three will be great that 's communicating and collaborating online using tools like whatsapp Facebook Messenger Scott and more Facebook 's rolling out facebook for work and all sorts of things to collaborate with I love collaborating rating with my national team with an office and you castle with clients everywhere we have you know team everywhere and you know we couldn 't live without some of these tools and I just know that if I could introduce some businesses to these they 'll get a lot out of it live will fall we 'll be looking at video conferencing and capturing and editing you know video becomes very viable or faster internet will look at different technologies you can use GoToWebinar WebEx webinar Jam there 's all sorts of QuickTime and different screen capture ones and then you can use this to either become the expert in your field and compete nationally or internationally or also to create and procedures so you can grow your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep doing that um level five will look at banking online a lot of you might be banking online but we want to say which banks are doing what and how which apps you can get and whether you can do things easier I know I 've lutes and things recently that I 'm telling everyone how to do because they just make life so much easier we 'll also talk about e-commerce solutions and selling online paypal eway stripe and more level six we 're going to without doing your accounting and payroll online including syncing your accounts to your website if poss to save on data entry if we can save you that time how good will that be document level 7 will look at documenting procedures and systems I do think the reason my company is one of your awards and had a bit of success along the way is because we are really really firm on documenting procedures and how to do stuff and sharing it so you know everyone 's doing it the same way it means I don 't have to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me and that means I can be more efficient and basically make more money spending at the time on what I am good at level 8 is how to streamline and automate so you can see this getting a bit more difficult this is a little bit tricky we 're going to talk about things like api 's add-ons but basically all they are as let 's call them connectors or things you add onto software you might already use which maybe give you some again efficiencies streamline things and or automate things really great example that this week with my team is we used to sell support packages online for people to get their web sites updated and they used to log on pay for it and then that would go to paypal and then the counter hits you tell the team that they have paid for it then and there could be delays like sometimes when people buy met they just want to get started and then that have to create a spreadsheet then the A 's with the client of what they wanted and then strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mess so we said you know wouldn 't it be better if you could just have it so that on the website you buy the support hours and automatically it creates a ticket so the boys know they 've got to work on it straightaway and then just tell the accountant this is how you account that and that 's what we 're doing now it 's so much better so people aren 't getting lost in its they 're getting quicker response and that just means we 've got a lot more streamlined process I 'm live online most businesses need to have good customer experience something they do and they don 't have one so we 'll talk about what is out there to support you with that CRMs which our client relationship management systems there where you look everything in interactions with clients so that when they come to your next you know exactly where you left off this is also really valuable if you were to ever sell your this there 's also online phone systems and more that capture recording so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know we had a staff member a while ago now that we thought was giving a great experience but when we listen to some of the reporting through our pbx we were kind of cringing at some of the stuff with her to say so a lot more training was required on that front level 10 you need to know if your customers are satisfied and there 's all sorts of online systems to run surveys polls and more on that level 11 well they won 't be relevant to all businesses there 's a much more other online tools we 'd like to show you but we they 're not all relevant to all businesses so we 're going to gem them into one lesson and go there 's also learning management systems there 's also project management systems and introduce you to other cool tools that are really popular out there and tell you why they 're popular and last but not least we 're going to learn about what open data is the Sunshine Coast council actually has lots of data it 's happened to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity you can do stuff with that so what is that data how to analyze data and also how to create reports and identify your business kpi 's so once you 've done these things what it was relevant to you you can start though where was i before where am i after i know i met with a client last week and she was an accommodation provider and I said to her how much business to get from X booking engine and how much you get from y booking engine and said and she said I don 't know about this much about thirty percent that she was all about about you really didn 't know and so I said we 've got to get some trekking up the running for you so that you know exactly what 's working and what 's not and you can do a much better job with your business so the program is essentially a 12 that should say module afraid it not program and so 12 modules is I 've just outlined and you can learn online and in person there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can watch them at the time that suits you so they 're 25 bucks to access but not if you 're doing for program then that 's inclusive of that 295 there 's 12 lessons or workbooks that you can work through and download there 's lots of emails to prompt you to keep learning there 's a private facebook group and this mentors that we tell me bit more about them so mentors um you can book an accession and meet face-to-face or online what if you prefer with a range of people who can help you get these things into your business because I don 't know about you but sometimes you go these workshops you get all fired up I think this is great i 'm going to do it and then the reality is that you um try and do it you hit roadblocks you get a bit lost and you 're a bit uncertain so it 's really nice to be able to have that access to go and you know get their feedback from mentors that yes you 're on the right track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you should do with the webinars these are starting actually on 7th of May at seven thirty at night we did serve a business owners and we found out that evenings were better because people were in shops and cafes and all that kind of stuff during the day is just no good um so we appreciate 730 on a Tuesday they were going to be held on Tuesdays doesn 't suit everybody but there are recording so if it doesn 't suit you that 's okay and we 've had other people say I were going to be away overseas on the second of May or for some of that and we say again will don 't worry because you get the recordings you can watch it from overseas if you wanted to if your super keen get up in that time zone and if you weren 't that keen you can just access the recording so that 's pretty easy um look we 've got a facebook group if you do the program so if you just do a workbook or module you don 't get access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group you do and there 's over 400 people all over already in that because we 've trained a lot of different people and you can post them there that you 're struggling with something at midnight or that you 've just got a little question for someone or celebrate a success and because it runs on the same user journey you should get a really good response in there and I 'll tag people and I think might be able to help you and so on my team um so we 've already run as I said most of these sessions so all of these right now have actually been so I 'm going to make them random but we 've got this one next Wednesday and we can also send you the recording so that 's your updated list their best chances and then bore if you want to come meet us these are not past and these are all login on the level up website starting Thursday the 20th we 're going to walk through our levels 23 on workshop one then we 're going to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems and automations and procedures on workshop three so there 's about one a month and then they get followed by webinars so we do the topic and then you jump on webinar to reinforce it here different ways get some live demos and all of that should embed the learning so who are you going to learn from well I 've got a pretty awesome team and this is just a sample of them and I 've got pretty awesome network so I 've been locking in some really fantastic because then I 'm so excited to introduce you to there 's me there 's Andrew second along from me and it 's kept my amazing business partner there 's Johannes who sunshine coast-based he 's amazing with automations and things and we 'll be pulling in as I said a whole lot more we 've got a fantastic team from the council who obviously right behind this and there to help in any way they can as well you 've got Tim there on the left he may well be the person you seen your registration form grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program and the council wanting to deliver it and as our liaison point between the program development delivery and the senior management there and the counselors we 've got Kelly who works within the economic development team and Amanda goody who it within the economic development team who are also there to support you get started and get involved to the program um remember i mentioned mentors well they 're all pretty awesome and we 're adding to that list all the mentors are digital champions at the moment as named by a queensland government this because they 're awesome at what they do and they often give back to the community we are paying them though so there is an allocation of 100 mentor hours so um you know about 100 people could get one hour or you know 50 people could get two hours and we will potentially go back to council if it 's really popular and we need more time but you don 't pay if you do the program you get access to these and you can go sit down with them and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the website and the private area because you have to be a registered paid program member that goes to the mentor they 'll accept or decline and negotiate what date they can meet you then you 'll exchange contact details and then you hold the first session now some of them might do it in person like I said maybe their place of work maybe yours or maybe at a cafe whatever you guys mutually agree on um some of you might hold it online now after that one session some of you might say oh my gosh it was so valuable I learnt so much stuff I don 't need to see them again ages so thank you others will say that was so valuable I really want to see them regularly like every couple of weeks or every month if that 's the case you just have to negotiate it with them direct and other times you 'll start with a mentor and things going gangbusters and then over time you go you know what actually I think I 've got what I need from this topic so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up another mentor so that 's pretty cool so the short of it is we don 't get massively involved in that and we 're just here to facilitate and introduce you to mentors you can go from there I wanted to show you just how awesome um doing the staff can be it give you a really live example of someone on the sunshine coast so scandic cafes and Richard or on first day of down from KFC there don 't know if you know it or not um I mean cafes a business most people understand you probably go in there and get coffee fixes if you 're anything like me so these guys are rely on a digital POS or point-of-sale system to enable them to manage their orders and serve their customers in a really fast way investable that lives up to their accounting software so their records are done in a few clips so what does all that mean well a lot of cafes would take orders have paper maybe if to feed and all that accounting at the end of the day and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they made any money that day or that week with it month or that year but these guys the way they 're doing it 's all real time data going to this point of sale so whilst they might have invested up front or ongoingly they have pinpoint accuracy on how their business is performing which is what we would love to see more businesses on sunshine coast have and would love to get some more case studies from this program so that 's it for me um if you would like to join the program you can simply go to this website level up sunshine coast of your deduct up today you and once you hit there you can have a scroll through a lot of what I 've run today is there there 's a low levels why do the program if you just want to join because you 're quite keen you click on here or on the menu which is registration now I will warn you it is quite a long registration form but it 's that for a reason we want to gather lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and can then give you that feedback of what it is how it 's improved over time so I don 't care if you 're starting at level 1 if you got to a level 2 because of the program fantastic have

that we will get lot sign up and the council very ambitious they want to help a lot of people sort of you know put some good resources behind this program and a lot of thinking and they really hope

looking after this precinct we 're here to open up for visitors actively look after the place and to assist council with advice about the place councils really central to operations we pick up the community partnerships crime which funds our basic running costs but we 've also had a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently we we had a grant to publish the little Lighthouse a children 's book it 's proved to be a great adjunct to our income and very popular book currently have a grant to a an update on our conservation management plan which will look at how the place moves forward over the next decade or so the age of like house has passed but it 's still an ideal venue and opportunity to to spread the word about heritage and beyond this place I basically consider at the palmer woods hall as my second home i followed in my parents footsteps and i 've been heavily involved in the problem with Hall Association a lot of community groups are also members of the Hall Association it 's a place where people can come and share their skill sets with each other it 's also a place of fellowship council provides support for the day-to-day operation of the hall through the Community Partnership funding program we provide a venue and there is a lot of non for profit community groups that do use the hall through our fundraising efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a very low cost so I think without that service a lot of the community groups that use the hall wouldn 't necessarily be able to exist additionally through council 's major and minor grants program up our moods Memorial Hall Association has been able to invest in valuable modifications to the hall media equipment community Christmas parties and the creation of a community digital platform to improve and augment its services to the community so I think it 's vital in helping people to stay in touch palmwoods has a large demographic of older people so I think it 's really important for them to stay connected with each other and stay and active part of the community we 're very proud that for such a long time we 've been able to maintain that community spirit which is essential in keeping a small country town alive as a community place to be we 're here for the 17th annual seniors week amador fun walk it 's an event we 've had 17 years straight it covers all ages of seniors from 50 to 59 up into 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we invite family friends puppy dogs the whole thing it 's a day to get the seniors out in the Sun but the day starts off with the registration at the oaks oasis followed by an aerobic warm-up or gently controlled by professional we then leave in that individual eight groups monitored by the SES who had water stations they monitors there are safety officers we after the groups come down that they come to the lawn here at the barber club and we have breakfast it 's grown from two thousand from thirty people up to two or three hundred more a lot of people will leave here they 'll go to volunteering will give information two of them will talk about volunteering assisting other people and it comes back without the grants program we could never succeed but would never happen the old calendar Council has been very supportive and know the Sunshine Coast Council is very supportive without that support it wouldn 't have seniors and not a spent force we abdicate the seniors have so much to pass on we abdicate that their mentors they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very supportive to the community around August of 2012 the Lions Club of Coulomb was approached by a member of the local community seeking their support for the establishment of a mention in coolum we have got a fairly high percentage of older men in in the community and they could see a need there for it and knew it would it be a benefit to the community so they got to got a gun it was an idea that quickly gained traction by October members of the Lions Club an interested local men had met informed the coulomb mention the men shed is a organization its australia-wide and now worldwide it 's a way of meeting people and helping the community and just getting involved it gives them something to do and interact with others rather than just sort of staying at home and that 's probably the main benefit since then the coulomb Men 's Shed has led a transient existence occupying three different sheds over a few short years in 2014 the path to a permanent home became clearer with the identification of a parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the facility to accommodate more members because where we were in a warehouse it was so compact now with the support of council together with state and federal government grants their permanent home is finally taking shape while in the minor grants it was to do with machinery like tools and that sort of thing the major one was towards the building of the ship the cost of the shed is in the vicinity of 70,000 a couple of our members have put in substantial amounts we recently received 15,000 from the federal government in the stronger communities program which was for infrastructure the shed will have a terrific work space as well as an area with disabled access toilet facilities and administration area and a true because of our limited capabilities so far we have only would work with the new facility we can offer a lot more color men chatter excited that their new shed is finally a reality and are extremely thankful to council for their support we provide the services for children from two to three years old right through to two adults to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know kids of all descriptions that that participate in the sport you know foot for fun and inactivity and also what we do offer is some of those elite gymnasts go on and do other things in the community that we see already Jordan Mercer and Alana Boyd to name a couple and that assists in that profile of healthy living in the community and hopefully encourages you know young children to participating involvement we 've been successful with two greens in the Sunshine Coast grants program over the last couple of years with the Community Partnership funding program we 've received 12 thousand dollars now that 's went towards our operating costs for electricity it 's been freed up some cash for us we 've been able to employ more administration stration staff we 've also been successful in a local council major grant of twenty thousand dollars that will go towards our extension we 've been at capacity for nearly five years we can we also need to offer some better spectating areas for competitions so we 're looking at expanding the gym we 've got a 1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next 12 to 18 months one of the key benefits to our extension will be having a facility not only to provide two more children to train but also having a facility that we can run a large competition and I 'm talking junior and senior competition up to international being involved in a non-for-profit organizations very relying on funding and we wouldn 't be where we are today without the grants that we 've achieved especially through local council and it 's putting that back into the community and seeing that the smiles on the faces and the kids involved that really what we get out of it as volunteers knoepfel has so many attractive attributes we find that there 's quite a number of subgroups within month or so the tourism is the obvious one with in tourism we have the food industry and the accommodation retailed the arts and crafts as well so it 's quite an extensive list that we represent here the Community Partnership funding grant has been a great blessing to the chamber we 've been able to administer a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extra person to cover the administration work the Christmas campaign is a very large one but also we took up the village wedding expo and that does bring a lot of economic benefits to the entire Sunshine Coast England region and the other large project that we 've run for the last four or five years since we 've had the council support has been the range restaurant awards and the restaurant awards gives us an opportunity to showcase to a wider audience what we 've got up here not only have we increased the number of projects we 've been able to administer them more professionally having that extra support

more and more we find them roosting in our neighborhoods causing conflict in our urban communities Council acknowledges that difficulties faced by residents living near a large roost so in November 2013 when the Queensland state government released guidelines and codes of practice to allow local governments to manage roosts Council took on a lead role in ruse management for the region as a result of this new responsibility council has developed a regional flying fox management plan to provide clear direction for roost management across council land the family have lived in palm woods for 45 years Dunning street and lingerer Avenue did not exist at that time it was a lot bush and farms all around my experience with the Flying Fox in palm woods I believe they came here around five or six years ago each year the numbers increased sometimes doubling there were thousands upon thousands of them and the smell the noise was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us physically and and emotionally because it was relentless we felt quite alone the council would come and the Brazile they were on the flying foxes side and we felt let down they ultimately came to to the aid of us and cleared underneath the flying fox colony when the colony wasn 't there and touch would they haven 't returned we worried that they may just move up the creek line and come closer to us but we 're watching and being quite aware we 've been informed by counsel in the environment officers that the flying foxes like a an area that is quite lush and green and with a lot of undergrowth I would be essentially managing my my land to keep the flying foxes at bay it 's best to for us just to do it ourselves I believe and maybe if it became too much then council would come to our aid so it 's just moving them on we aren 't asking them to be destroyed we just want them relocated and the council have done that quite successfully we didn 't have flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years was only in the last about three years that we started to notice some of them coming into the area and that gradually built up and up and it got worse and worse as time went on you know getting woken up at anywhere from 30 to 00 and that every morning even with all the windows shut it was unbearable and our quality of life had gone and we thought I 'll well we 'll just move you know they can have it but then we realized good luck selling he 'd buy a house in an area that 's got you know six to eight thousand flying foxes when they were here in large numbers some of the experiences that we had to deal with was not only the the screeching but it was also the stench of them particularly in wet weather our health concerns at the time the flying foxes were here in large numbers was that they could be spreading the lyssavirus we contacted the council to find out if there are any plans or if they 're aware of it even and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and monitoring it but they said unfortunately our hands are tied because the government legislation was in place for some of these species so we realized in that there was a long haul to overcome that when the final go-ahead was was given we missed it we missed our opportunity because she can only disperse them when they 're not pregnant and there 's only a slight window that is around about April May June maybe July that this can happen in the whole year by the time the next window came along everything was in place and council had made sure that they were ready to go we felt relieved that nervous and and concerned that it may not work how I felt after the dispersal all of a sudden that the very next night we got a beautiful peaceful night 's sleep which we hadn 't had for a number of years we can have the windows open and get nice ventilation and cool air we get working in the morning by beautiful birdsong and not screeching and and the sound that we were dreading I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just here but elsewhere on the coast because they 're all over the place and where necessary undertake non-lethal disperse or action to make sure they don 't reassume high urban areas for a person to develop Hendra they 've actually got to come in contact with the infected horse a bat can 't give them Hendra so it has to go from the bat to the horse from the horse to a person so to protect yourself from Hendra for example is if you 've got a horse you need to have your horse vaccination against Hendra there 's 12 different lists of viruses in the world and Australian bat lyssavirus is one of them it 's the only one that we 've got here in Australia and so you get it directly from an infected bat you 're not going to know if a bats infected just by looking at it so you have to treat all that 's exactly the same and the moral of story is just don 't touch them so if you don 't touch them you can 't get the disease that urine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all it 's not infectious Australian bat lyssavirus doesn 't stay alive very long outside the bash at all if you come across a bat that 's lying on the ground or is injured if it 's hanging in a fence don 't touch it the most important thing is that you ring somebody who can come and help you it 's really important that the kids know not to touch so they may find a bash on the ground and want to pick it up or they may be concerned that it 's sick they have to know from the very beginning that they must never touch a wild animal and that includes bats and they should tell a grown-up about it I have a lot of sympathy with people who are trying to manage flying foxes and particularly people who 've got flying foxes landing in their backyard and they don 't want them there that 's that 's a real problem that we 've still got to solve in an effective way one of the problems with managing flying foxes here in Australia is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell us how to look after a colony of flying foxes how to move it on Australia is one of the only developed countries where flying foxes are found so it 's our problem and we 've got to learn how to solve it in terms of intelligence flying foxes are right up there with dogs so they 're very smart animal and this makes them even more difficult to manage because they learn fairly quickly and often you think you might have fooled them you 'd chase them out of an area and you look around half an hour later and they 're back again and the other problem is where do they go you know you 're going to just chase them away to someone else make Ataman else 's problems there are very difficult animals to manage this is a problem for council because if they want to move the flying fox call me it depends on what species is there and if it 's a gray head they 've got to get permission now this is unfortunate because one of the best ways to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't let them settle in regard this is a good place to be unfortunately this doesn 't often happen and by the time flying foxes are well established and a permits through they don 't want to leave the other side of the coin is the positive things flying foxes do in our environment there are native animal they 've been here for a long long time they 're one of the biggest bats in the world and some of our commercial hardwoods like Blackbird and what and some of these big commercial Timbers pollinated only by flying foxes at night so the health of our forest is very much dependent on flying fox activity at night eco Shah has been assisting council biomonitoring six urban flying fox roofs for the past year and that will help residents be able to see that the natural movement there was two or three months where we had no flying foxes in any of those six ruse there are two broad types of management that you can take and that 's to either try and get the flying foxes to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ways that you can do that is create buffers to to cause the roost to be further away from the conflict area which is often a residential area Council also has a regional flying fox plan and it 's really important to take that strategic approach because managing at one roost will most likely impact other routes if you 're trying to get them to move on so looking at that landscape scale approach is really important I consider that the Sunshine Coast is one of the leading councils to have a proper flying fox management program it 's a very sensible management program that 's very considerate to flying foxes and their role in the environment and to the problems that people face with them we 're learning from our residents we 're learning from the experts and we 're learning from the management experiences of other councils what we have learnt is that each ruse must be managed in the way that will be most effective for that location and with a management plan to guide these decisions"

they 're getting better and better do we all agree I can just feel there is such a great energy in this room and I 'm just so excited to see the rest of the schools workshops and presentations that we have on display today so congratulations everyone in being part of the kids teaching kids 2015 target kids teaching kids week program oh it 's a really fun two days fun and interactive two days where children get to come and show what they 've been working on and presented to other kids and also learn you know in case and have a look at what else what 's everyone else be looking at kids in action is when lots of kids from all that sunshine coast come together and teach each other kids in action what I 've seen today these kids teaching other kids about environmental issues what they 're currently doing in their school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorites but then it is Blair there that turns genes into people yes oh my gosh how great is that yeah the is the worst one from there are you reversed and so it 's supposed to be like as you 're walking through first I like an experience of what it 's like and there 's different section that has different information on different parts of the Mara River so like there 's the Mary River crocodile but with court there the floods and their vegetable and the endangered and special animals in the New River I didn 't know about the damning that they will go to do than the river and how much people protested against it and eventually it didn 't happen for a tower above like people if a group of people get together they can make a big difference and stop a big plan my favorite part would be when we got to seal the stalls so the other kids are doing and there 's some really great storms about saving the water ass I think they get a kick out of having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're this year with Mady a movie and we 're presenting a workshop and we 've also doesn 't display so we 've had all these sort of end goals rather than kind of just doing something that doesn 't me to come too much so it 's really kind of added a bit of impetus to what we 're working on kids in action consistently demonstrates the wealth of knowledge and understanding of our young people have about the important issues and I hope that somewhere over these two days also discuss and give us some feedback as your local leaders about term returns and dumb should all plastic water bottles should you be able to return them should there be some refunds on our glasses you know these are the discussions that the governments are having today and I 'd like to strongly recommend that you all get in a bus head down to the federal government down there in Canberra I think that you are the thinkers of tomorrow so assist them and so that also assist us in local government I 'll be respectful enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment for the future my favorite part was the workshop because seeing what other schools have been working on and them teaching I kind of make different things and how that was how they make you some things I 've seen kids interact we 've got a number of schools here on the coast that it that are here today and and they 're interacting and they 're sharing their ideas they 're having a wonderful day kids the dark no other kids from other schools are sharing their ideas and they 're going to take it back to their own schools and share it amongst their peers they 're learning but they don 't actually realize that they 're learning because they 're having so much fun it 's very creative so it sort of texts like there 's the environmental benefits but then there 's just straight up teaching benefits you know so it takes a lot of boxes and it 's a lot I 'm very grateful to be a part of it I really enjoyed the two workshops that I did and we did a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw away rubbish and then got told to pick it up again so I put in the bin and then we celebrated because is that and I enjoyed making origami frog that was really fun yeah so what we want to do this year is create a vision and environmental vision i use environmental vision for the Sunshine Coast that we can present the council so you can be part of that change so you 've got an opportunity to articulate that change two people are making decisions well they get to take back a whole world of knowledge but for example our school is going to come back our for guys and girls have come today they 're going to present what they 've scenes at the conference and they 're going to i 'm sure it to the whole school without a thousand years it 's really fun i haven 't done before so this is my first year doing it and i really enjoyed it so i encourage anyone who wants to do it just yeah come along and enjoy the fun i 'll

future inclusion in an interpretive design and display happen to keep each Park sad day in some ways but happy down other ways that the Dickey will be maintained for a community to I hope fall in love with again as a result of the interpreter design up in the park and down here on the beach part of it the lower part of the the wreck akhil around the guilt that will say institute in its spiritual home so people will have the best of both worlds of the SSD key after all these years so people can reconnect or connect for the first time with the Dickey in two ways into the future and we certainly hope that having those two options for people gives the SSD key the due respect that it deserves for the the memories and the sentiment that it 's held within the community she 's forever till to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archaeologist who has been contracted by the council I first became involved with a dick in 2008 when I was asked to do conservation management plan of the wreck in response to ongoing concerns about deterioration and that was then contacted again last year of council have decided to look at removing the remains of the ticket to get a permit to do so they needed a conservation management plan here is impact assessment and interpretation plan we were contacted by councils undertake those works the Heritage impact assessment was an options paper looking at various options on how to safeguard will preserve the heritage values of the Tiki while at the same time addressing concerns over public safety to the dwindling remains of the wreck and looking at the various options and balance those two can major concerns against the value for money and Kostas things like that so we look at a whole range of options everything from constructing a cofferdam and pumping out the water and working on it over pier a month and then removing it in one piece to building putting buns and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work on it as divers without having waves to worry about we also looked at options of dragging it out in piece of sea dragging it out along the beach and looking at the risks associated with that to the Heritage values of the wreck as well as the costs involved in the end one of the options one of the options was chosen by council which was to remove the upper portions of the wreck that is the exposed visible starboard Stern section the stern assembly such as the the part of the wreck that was closest to the surf zone so that was that course of action was decided upon in early 2015 and as part of the preparation for all these works be able to test excavation in April the purpose of actually understanding you know what type of equipment would be best used to do the cutting where to do the cuts and just understanding the nature of you know the title flow in the area and sand cover it 's stuff that how to deal with that so it is an april and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state government to disturb the wreck and also effectively bit had a rehearsal on how to actually best approach to removing the upper portions without you know running over time over budget and having to fit in within the tides weather etc and that culminated in today 's activities which so far I have come off really well work better than me than we had hoped in terms of time eighty ninety three rocky so what we do when our pieces have been removed from the wreck is give them an individual artifact number and then all the odd items get taken back to the council depot where they 'll be recorded in further detail and that reference number just gives us a way to link all our records together at the moment there 's a lot of extra sand cars are on the record and usually is so this morning we did a scraping away of some of the sand towards the bow end here to enable us to do a metal detector survey in order to delineate the western boundary of the wreck and we do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling off the wreck and we 're trying to locate that wreckage tomorrow and to try and remove it we had one anomaly up to the side of the wreck which are we 've just recorded the position of and we 'll look into that position tomorrow and hopefully it 's the piece of wreckage that we 're looking for one of the fines today we believe is the sternpost his position behind the pillar and we believe they probably cut it off so 1968 when actually two propeller out and they discarded it next to the wreck and the important part of it is that the actual rudder attaches to it so it 's actually a key piece she 'll always know how the sand and the crashing phone she came to rest on the reach that takes you it never is Slade the vision and I 'm she the decade Diggy who ever see resting on been walking Oh generate she now graceful dick she 's

they were always busy when we seen the emergence of the high-rise buildings are we looking forward to hearing all the views of the key stakeholders through throughout the Mooloolaba placemaking project really confident that they will come up with some fantastic ideas that will take Mooloolaba into the future and really deliver that world-class precinct that we 're looking forward with this project and the early phase was important to engage with as much of the community as possible I 'm all about being a good mix of locals and tourists and covering all age groups we developed a plan to consult with school-aged children through to the elderly population we had a visioning day on Saturday night of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the road so they had an opportunity to write their ideas and draw their ideas and shock on the road it 's a great opportunity for the community to see the potential of that space if it was no longer a road we had about 1,000 people comes through across the three hours that we held the event for and there is opportunities for people to have a one-on-one conversation with council officers and members of the project team also have a look at some display boards on offer which showcased some ideas around what could happen in this space in the future touching on the foreshore area green links and what development might look like in the future in terms of built form and character there is also an opportunity to fill servo form where we got some feedback on what do you love it but would you like to see change in the future and what is your vision for the future of mooloolaba there is no better piece I 'll have ever seen a little about these connection between the esplanade and the beach you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful places on earth so so it 's one of the best north facing beaches on the eastern coast is due a seaside country town with class we came here in summer it was active it was vibrant it 's a great place for families to visit just a beautiful place to live that is one of the main issues really frustrated with that car parked down on the lower beach so major issues you don 't even try parking them anymore you can 't run a main thoroughfare through a comp I lower road taken out where the car park is and I want the brisbane road car park built close the road right through well I 'm along the beach frontiers it is an amazing experience come over from our works and you drive along the beach there where else do you get that you can 't do it at noosa let 's carcinoma would be great to take all the parking on this don 't need any cars on this map of course you need have to survive don 't take any of our car parks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for emotion I encourage people like myself to park there and then ride in ever high-rise come right at the back big car back down there in Brisbane road and still be privatised to the local and the state in the federal government 's don 't have the funds we need to ask consumers paper because it is that come to the coast absolutely they they could be paying for it locals they shouldn 't have to pay per night without the locals there is no more based on a spike everyone talks about the tourists never talks about the benefits that the tourists bring but those benefits would be useless to any business here if the locals didn 't support it vision would be a big big open space in here open up the entire script we 've got a big Esplanade rumors where is it if this area from the caravan park right to the end of the spit could just be the greatest walk the greatest piece of real estate anywhere appoint a pedestrian family-friendly part of the Central Coast we don 't want to turn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what they are an ocean floor would be nice another thing I would like to see is a a rock food in here maybe esplanade something really worthwhile building a lot and family area barbecue to caravan parks in town that are just fantastic still like the idea we still have a caravan park human caravan parks would be public spicy as well as the journal area between the Esplanade and the car park something else that I think is pretty special about the amplifier and unique is the caravan park oh sure the caravan park is not only limited access but you feel that you shouldn 't even walk through that area there should be better access for pedestrians the activation of the heart of the tail it 's not just the Esplanade coming out but we really want to activate those you know the first ever use and the street frontage behind currently we have around 650 students enrolled at Mooloolaba at a significant number to reside in unit complexes we don 't really have a little hub clears just like saw and psychological problem it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever I have had the blood sucked out of them from and ridiculous Randall 's have more permanent residents here at the moment wiggle highs or lows so that 'll then fill in a lot of the holes we really need the locals to come back and come down and support the local shops or brain space probably less cars you know change because thinking more connections with full baths and the pedestrians I 'd like to see better a psychopath access and bikeways through here basically people walk around the lumber walkways through the back streets on the river as a light rail system of something people

really attractive yeah allow the developers to come in and do things a bit out of the box is at the moment the council have all the regulations and you kinda did you come to that developers why doona t recursively simulations are approximate and allow who came over even more ability to do what they need to do I feel very passionate about bringing people back down to the wharf in mooloolaba the major thing is that to ensure that the wharf has structures and infrastructure that suits the region and actually takes the region forward and actually takes mooloolaba forward the entry when you first arrive at mooloolaba now it looks a little bit like an industrial estate it doesn 't display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that turned around and as they come up brisbane road they really get excited and they know they 're going to the destination which is mooloolaba light rail would be fantastic in this precinct from maroochydore through to caloundra i think if we could get a tram system similar to what the Gold Coast has would be definitely away for the future we have to somehow or other get people attractive to go down there and if there 's more shops there where people to originally see it then they 're going to go down there mooloolaba enjoys over 7 million day-trippers every year coming to this area I 'd love to see that it became a haven for people from the three-hour drive market we asked our student leaders that share their views to write a postcard as if they were in 2020 and it reads des anthe today I went to the beach most things have changed like the parking lot is a water park now with huge slides in the kiddie pool I love the band that played there it 's so much fun now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was fun too we can come up with a vision that captures what everyone needs some many strong decisions need to be made about where it goes to from here placemaking is the livability and love ability of a place within the Sunshine Coast region mooloolaba are certainly

bark been a lot of ideas put port and we 're really looking forward to bringing all those ideas together and publishing a draft pricing plan"

    "text": "I 'm Julie O 'Connor I 'm the senior conservation officer with Sunshine Coast Council I coordinate the turtle camp program which is some community partnership between the Sunshine Coast Council community and Department of Environment and Resource Management turtle cares about conserving and endangered species in particular here on the Sunshine Coast we help the loggerhead turtles in their breeding season to try and make sure that we can get as many as possible of the young ones after the water once they 're hatched we monitor the Sunshine Coast which is pretty much the southerly most point where you get regular reliable the nesting of the loggerhead occasional green turtles as well that have been nesting here for millions of years of course now it 's a big issue for them because they 're not in such an untyped of pristine environment and sharing the environment with them a lot of people here on the Sunshine Coast so there 's a lot of factors that that impact on their nesting this is the mesh that we use to cover up for this month we find the eggs we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really in Point Park writing Calandra and this actually the hatchlings can come through this Ridge but the Foxes generally can 't get in foxes have really introduced by people in the mid-1800s they 're a significant predator of investing loggerhead turtles here and that 's the major role of the community group is finding these nests meshing them with Fox approval with a box exclusion mesh and then just monitoring them until they hatch we don 't need a fear with the young ones as they 're going down we like to see them make their own way down they don 't need our interference they 've been doing this for millions of years they they don 't need our help to get to the beach it 's really important that they walk that distance from the nest to the beach as they 're going there building strength which helps them once they reach the water and also they 're registering that the dip and slope of the Earth 's magnetic field as they 're walking to the beach as well which helps them later on in life when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding and nesting areas so it 's it 's pretty much important that you just respect that this is a natural process and just let nature take its course yeah I bet on the coast here at least 25 years of sand the last six years or so that I became aware that loggerheads or and greens actually nesting on the beach here so by taking an interest in things watching what 's happening on our beaches we can help keep the beaches clean for the future everyone can do them holiday makeup if you 're walking along the beach and you see rubbish pick it up I pick up probably a kilo of rubbish every day up the beaches there 's a lot of plastic out there if you 're fishing don 't need a fishing line around fishing lines can hang around the environment for 600 years capturing things and entangling turtles and also if you 're a local during nesting season and during hatchling season which is February to April if you 're lucky enough to see hatch things and you have torches with you keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tend to disorient as well hatchlings respond very strongly to any light they 're their natural instinct is to go towards the ocean it 's the sound of the ocean that attracts them and also they go to the the brightest light lowest on the horizon so if you 've got torches around on the sand they 'll start turning around and going towards those and it really can be quite disastrous for them because they 're wasting valuable energy chasing lights all over the sand when they should be going directly to the ocean if you down on the beach and you see a female coming up to nest the best thing to do is just sit down right where you are any movement will will startle her and she might be quite likely to go back it 's a great idea we always say to have the turtle care contact phone number in your mobile if you 're a regular beach goer which is zero four three seven double five nine zero six seven you can call one of the volunteers to see quietly call it call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turtles tagged we also won 't disturb the turtle until she actually starts to lay and then once you 've finished that process we 'll measure her tiger if she hasn 't been done it 's been tagged already and then measure her and then let her go back to the ocean and then we 'll mesh the nest there volunteers are fantastic they 're wonderful people some of them have been doing this for many years you can see in the background the Charlie 's Angels going new they like to call themselves we know that the turtles will come up and lay their eggs for a long time and they don 't really need us to interfere but what they do need is to protect them and it 's mainly without the community on this project we wouldn 't be having the success we 're having protecting turtles and there 's a lot of people healthy and it 's and it 's good for our environment and Todd would you give it up for anything"

    "text": "it 's so wonderful to be here today and to see this most beautiful landscape I 'm having a very bad case of storage Envy I want what you 've got I want a heritage levy I want a council that 's proud of its heritage and is wanting to invest in it I I know these achievements are not just driven by councillors it 's all of you in the room who maintain public enthusiasm and confidence for conserving and interpreting heritage so I just congratulate you all and I 'm quite sure this fantastic building is going to set you up for the next century of really engaging programs so my top today it 's really telling you how to suck eggs I think because everything that we do in community museums in a way is about sharing stories so you all know what public programs are about even they encompass a whole range of activities talks lectures demonstrations curriculum linked education programs performances to as field trips and there 's a subset of public programs which are the more informal conversation based programs we know that pub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every museum visit we all have had the experience of going to a heritage house or being in a museum exhibition and seeing people standing there and looking at the display and remembering their own object stories as they relate to the things that are on display and this is really the substance of what I want to explore with you today so I 've got a few slides just to kind of tell you some of the programs that I 've been involved in and then we might have a bit of a workshop activity which we can build around the objects that you 've bought along and hopefully we 'll have enough time for you to share some of the object stories that you 've bought with you so I guess I just want to reinforce that community museums have a very special niche in the ecology of museums because they exist in a much closer relationship with their community and with their audiences and of course I think community museums have an incredible freedom to be innovative and to get things off the ground without too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of programs I 'm talking to you about today can be done you know really easily and creatively they don 't take a lot of money they just take a passion for the objects that you 're caring for and a willingness to kind of share those stories and listen to community stories because the essence of this is that it is about a conversation it all comes down to the power of show-and-tell which you know as we know as every kindergarten teacher knows is a very powerful way of giving people space to share their story and also building a conversation around those stories it 's an important ingredient of the changing landscape of museum visitation we 're just going to look at things in showcases or look at an in situ display isn 't enough anymore to engage visitors that you know are now coming to our museums with a much more finger active trigger finger you know rapidly changing digital screens multitasking between the iphone and the tablet and the TV remote control so standing for hours looking at museum displays we 're coming to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas are about tapping into the memories and stories that visitors bring to our museums stories that are part and parcel of your heritage fabric and using the power of memories to that are triggered by objects with stories as we know when people talk about objects that they 've treasured that have been passed on to them from their mother or grandmother in many cases are triggers very powerful memories that are not tapped by other parts of our everyday life or normal experience and that 's one of the things that museums can do because our core business is about collections and heritage and about the stories that underpin them and the other thing I want to kind of emphasize in the talk today is that it 's these stories and this kind of storytelling it 's also a tool to get a key conservation message out about objects and collections which is that we need to write the story down because we 've all had the experience of clearing up a deceased estate or inheriting an object or finding something in an antique shop and you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passed on or indeed working with so many museum collections that are bereft of their stories because the people have built those collections didn 't keep on top of their cataloging and because in many cases our early musi ology didn 't recognize the importance of provenance and history and context in contributing and underpinning and actually being the essence of the meaning of the object so we 're all working in in various ways with objects that are in some mint some cases bereft of their stories but by having these kind of programs it gives us the opportunity to actually learn from people that still have stories around similar objects and together work together to make sure these stories have got down on paper so I 've just talked about a few things that I 've been involved in so this was a lovely project that we did on the mid-north coast of New South Wales around Port Macquarie where all the museums networked together to document their women 's stories and for the gentleman in the audience I 'm afraid there 's quite a lot women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but don 't feel that there aren 't equal opportunities around men 's stories and tools and sheds and wagons and things like that these are just the things that have come to mind in my work so as part of the herstory project which began with documenting collections we we ran a range of public programs around women 's stories based on those collections so one of them was object stories we did another one about textile treasures so we invited people to bring their textile treasures and share their story and look at some of the textile treasures in the museum same format for the aprons admission by apron bring your apron share the story write it down number one message and then there was another lovely program about celebrating spinsters because as we know so many collections and historic houses are endowed by spinsters and yet they 're rarely recognized in our public culture so this is a bit of a summary of the typical sharing object stories format so you hold an event you ask visitors to bring a favorite or object associated with a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run you might have a guest speaker to introduce the discussion you 'd be surprised how much talent there is in your local community you ask participants to show their object tease out why it 's important to them encourage them to write the story down and that 's it 's a really important conservation strategy it 's not just the frou-frou that helps you get your visitor numbers up it 's actually an integral part of the conservation work that you can do in your community around collections because these days we don 't have to collect everything in order to see that it 's conserved and passed to the next generation we can do really productive work with families to encourage them to look after things that they have in their home so I 'm working on a new museum project in orange and we 've been having a similar version of these objects stories calling for the community to bring along objects for our object casting calls as we 're calling them and the first one we had was around food and recipes and kitchen implements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around food and produce in the region at the moment so um so we had the legendary will perish who I don 't know if any of you saw her young master chef she 's a famous CWA cook and show judge and so she gave a really beautiful introduction to the event and spoke about her life in this village called ki dal and also got the object stories going by bringing along to favorite kitchen implements one her wooden spoon and you can just tell how many cakes it 's made when you look at how long it is and the other her icing knife which God knows how many cakes that siced inherited from her mother and before that her grandmother it 's a third-generation icing knife now these are not the sort of objects that the community is typically going to offer to donate to your museum but we found these things really powerful and we 've put in a bid for Mills wooden spoon and icing knife when she 's ready to go up to the great cake making tower in the sky we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another project that we 've been running related to the museum development it 's a project about the villagers of the central west and a big part of the work is around documenting local produce and food and cooking traditions so we just recently done this program celebrating the pack and pair it which was bred or developed at molong another little village and central west we had more parish come and make a new pair and spice cake as part of the morning tea and the whole event celebrating the pack impaired and she did she demonstrated the cake and then it was really quite hilarious because the cake stuck to the bottom of the team and everyone was just so relieved and child it was kind of the highlight of the event which is a bit cruel but it 's like we 've all got feet of clay even even cooking legends so this is our exercise for today so I 'd like you to break up into each table and have a chat about what kinds of object based conversations you might develop pick up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the concept is think about an event or an occasion you can relate it to who your audience is and your program partners if that 's relevant and how you might market it and then if we 've got time we 'll just have a quick snapshot from each table to hear about your best object story conversation idea I 'm so charmed and interested in all your ideas and I really hope a few of them will come to fruition because I can see from the conversation you 've been having it 's actually bringing in like bringing up the light bulbs and creating the stories and ideas about relating objects to contemporary life and using them to animate and and help us to look again at what 's in our collections because there 's nothing like bringing out that teapot and having a really good look at it and thinking about all its spatial and cultural and historic and contemporary connections to see it in a whole new light so well done all of you I just want to thank you all for what you 've contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to say but there is a hand outta me yeah you got the handout so most of its in that handout thank you so much you"

our government house that I received arguably the funniest response and perhaps it 's also a problematic response so after introducing myself and saying I 'm in the story I asked what do you think an historian does there was that leaving few seconds of silence where every student avoids eye contact hoping that another would answer the question and then when it get be painful the answer came to set the context of fraction more I welcome school groups in the doorway of the museum so they can just peek in and on this one day one of my colleagues I was walking through the door and as the answer came it stopped her in her tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the response to what do you think an historian does it was not much ah I was initially speechless which I can assure you doesn 't happen very often and while I thought it was hilarious my response was let 's well let 's go inside and see if that 's true okay and more on that later everyone and everything has a past and this presents an infinite number of topics to investigate whether out of pure interest or to reveal an untold story or historical event historians are the investigators detectives of the past we endeavor to present new ways to look at revel in and value our history we are in the simplest terms nosy storytellers that I am constantly learning and that my focus approach is constantly changing is that the core of my presentation today but it did present me with a dilemma of how to tell the unfolding story of my experience with one key building in a way that was both interesting and worthy of sharing after lunch and telling our own stories we all pluck out will focus on crucial times events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes at different stages of our life this too is a familiar pattern of my approach in interpreting the history of old government house quite big enough so in 2007 when I was first appointed my role was in a nutshell to research and write the content and to develop a range of interpretive displays to in collaboration with an exhibition design company nothing particularly extraordinary there but the key to this is I didn 't present the usual attributes associated with a typical historic house that being a large and varied collection of objects and I have readily and naturally had to focus on creating links to what happened in the house and on who lived and worked here so I wanted to frame my talk today on two quotes that really have underpinned or expressed the best way my approach to researching and presenting the story of 150 year old building with no furniture and no objects well except for the building itself okay the first one heritage spaces are acknowledges as places of aesthetic reference a connection to periods of time and a reference to people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one we dream in narrative remember anticipate hope despair believe doubt plan revised criticized construct gossip learn hate and love by narrative in order really to live we make up stories about ourselves and others about the personal as well as the social past and future so it is the story and how that story our stories was presented was there for pivotal in any effect of interpretation of this landmark colonial building I had to ensure that the stories would resonate with our visitors and make them me because they were informative surprising and engaging okay before I go on and how I did that I wanted to give you a bit of context on the history of the house obviously old government house is the only purposely designed and constructed residents for the governor it was completed in 1862 it was occupied by vice-regal families are 11 of them up until 1910 in 1900 I 'll give you some more photos it was built for George and diamontina Bowen okay our first governor it costs a whopping 19 thousand pounds that is an extraordinary sum of money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it estimated to be a hundred thousand pounds and we had a total population at the time of 25,000 people nice bit of debt to start us all off but it 's also a great signify of how important this building was to the people of Queensland that we would invest such amount the building as i said was used as a vice regal residents okay and then in a political move it was handed over to be the inaugural building of the University of Queensland so in 1910 Sir William MacGregor moved out and when he passed through the gates it became known as old government house and he was moving to temporary government house while new government house was being built but temporary government house are was now permanent government house in its Thornburg ok so on the tenth of December Queensland 's 50th anniversary Sir William MacGregor officially handed over the building to be the inaugural University building and McGregor moved out in June the following year then the house was stripped of all elements of its vice-regal nature and it was turned into University or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up for their first classes so what 's really wonderful about that is that 26 of them were women and this was the first time that women could enter University at the beginning of a university 's career but anyway that aspect of this story I haven 't told and that 's because of time and just haven 't got to it yet so but it 's a very important part ok so here 's the building it is taken over progressively by qit which be called Tech College qit university needs more buildings to provide really ugly architecture around it so they want to demolish this building and thankfully there was a quite a campaign to not have that happened and it 's really the beginning of the National Trust in Queensland the building is saved the National Trust occupies it for a number of years but in 2002 they conceded there was too much for it too it just couldn 't financially fix the building up so this is one of the last photos taken of it before the restoration and then 15 million dollars later didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the key issues and at that time 15 million dollars was an extraordinary amount of money then came City Hall and that changed it massively the house was closed for two years we 've dealt with her massive problems of structural problems termites asbestos and all sorts of elements okay it is also a building that is in the middle of a campus okay but it 's a beautiful building so to give you some insight into what we 're looking at I get to go to work here it 's tough okay so one of the elements about the building is it 's an empty shell okay and this is a couple of things that were very important also in creating or populating an empty shell you need to create will find the stories in the history and we came across a couple of different things and one I just like to touch on because it 's one of those Eureka moments but also not at that same time and that is the problem that i have with the vice-regal residents is that it was covered by protocols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house stayed a secret in the house it meant that you get very few anecdotal evidence which is a large resource for most historians now by design colonial government houses were purposely built as places of power and not surprisingly most interpretations have never be focused on the lives of the white often upper-class male residents who occupied the role as governor but beyond the scenes that each government house was a veritable army of men and women who generally outnumbered the front of house of kippers and they work to ensure the lives of the governor and his family round is comfortably and smoothly as possible and these were the household staff the floor plan of this house is here you probably can 't really see that but it is a very much set up to keep the rear of staff house staff away from the front of house okay we have the you are all very familiar of the concept of upstairs and downstairs but in colonies the British colonies much more space so it 's front of house and rear of house so i have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well documented house in the sense of the public pro Public Works Department looked after it but in the fact that i can actually detail the records on how many number of pine tables were in the kitchen and the scullery and the servants Hall as well as the types of brushes the housemaids used and what cooking utensils were preferred in the kitchen I 'd actually don 't have the names of the people who use them okay and this is the kind of interesting element that emerged to me over a period of time and objects you know as we saw this morning are great to prompt discussions and elements like that but it is the fact that it 's people that we connect to its our stories that we do and this was the stories of the everyday person in the servant who my visitors as a rule generally prefer to hear about rather than the guy in the really tight white pants okay so one of the elements about this is trying to research that as an historian rather than the curator role which is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across this picture and this was a fantastic picture for me because it was obviously of the working class now in the time that I 've got today I just wanted to break this down and we were talking about photos before in the sense that you know he wanted to take a photo this is a time when photography 's it very expensive this is also glass negatives it 's a slow exposure so all of these people are being pulled from their work environments okay to position themselves in this photo and there 's a hierarchy in there that I can decode so what 's really fascinating is that he went to all this trouble to create this photo and his descriptor he 's only descriptor was government house servants okay so he didn 't feel the necessity to pass on the names of these people but he you know he took this photo so in one respect for me this was a fantastic moment it indicated the size of the servants class or service household servants yet at the time it raised more questions than that collectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've only managed to identify 44 individuals as domestic servants and in almost 50 years and it 's estimated that a number of closer to about 200 would be representative a sort of a medium staffing level and further that the number of household servants or staff was recognized as a higher status we would expect more at all government house and I won 't go too much into it but one of the interesting side notes and this is one of my charms and it still makes me laugh but is that the place they found most information was the reporting of court cases in the newspaper okay and these are kind of element and you know there 's one particular court case whereas I sort of say and my thing is it was really a case of the butler really did do it and he got a house made pregnant and there was a cool case about paying support for him but his full name was mr. Albion wise and that is the only time a butler is given the full name of a butler in 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the highest person staff member in a household this size so there 's a lot of different aspects of having lack of information cool so this so these are some of the people I 've identified from these this is sort of kind of an interesting little thing and I will read this because I did get a lot of stuff out of this and it 's kind of humorous but the sort of odd looking chap in with the head is Wellington William willington cans and he was governor who and in great sense of England Queensland irony couldn 't stand the heat so we named in one of the most northern towns after him but he was an odd man and that is probably the best way his own private secretary who 's on there on whatever way the other side Alfred maudsley actually described him as a very odd man and he was that 's a very nice way but Alfred maudsley in a letter to his sister in 1875 repented repeated in a book that he published called life in the Pacific 50 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare and intriguing insight into the importance of having good household servants and maudsley detailed the chaotic consequences of the governor 's ad hoc hiring policy and I 'm just going to read you this quote give you this was a springboard for me for lots of other stuff of the five men who came out three including the butler have already been discharged they really were a bad loss there remains thomas age 22 years the coachman who drives very badly two men steward one a scoundrel has been sacked and the other roberts has been promoted to house steward he is rather imprudent and with a queer temper and has now been given by the command of earner complete charge of the household though the other servants dislike him next comes hopper a nice youth aged 21 he came out intending to go upcountry but was captured on landing and taken into the household he is a very good fellow but knows nothing about waiting or housework cook we have none the French cook engaged at cafe anglaise in Paris has gone the wife of another immigrant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stables though he had never touched a horse before the wife is the cook and she ruins a leg of mutton or a joint of beef in her attempts to prepare them for our the beefsteak she cooked for breakfast today was very cold when it came to the table and on inquiry we were told that it had been found necessary to wash it before bringing it in and this is vice regal life ok so I can unpick all that but it gives you a fascinating insight and it 's not quite surprising that within a year Alfred maudsley left Kansas employ and took up a post with Sir Arthur Gordon in Fiji remember this is 1875 and it would seem that fiji was a better place to be in eighteen seventy five then to be working for governor cans ok so with all these issues you know I came together to try and create a museum and the best way to show you of what I did was really just to put it in pictures so we claimed three of the downstairs rooms as museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction in the layout and style of the house and you walk in and this gives you the who what when and why ok we talk about a lot of the elements we actually focus more on the household staff then on the governors and this has proved at people interested in this element we have a number of touchscreens ok so what was really it 's nice and appealing is that after the chaos of pulling it all together we managed we won a competition Wow we 'll all water the governor 's gold medal and another Museum and galleries award and that 's all really well and it looked great and it was fantastic but what worked and what didn 't ok one of the key things to remember and if you remember those photos is that I have a working building and three of the Builder three of the rooms are empty so the question that really sort of brings a left aight which to me is where 's all the furniture okay and this is where this object focused approach to being a house museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've rejiggered a few things I think that we 've sort of managed to get over that and so you may not be able to read this but I just took a couple of images from my visitors book and it really you know makes me feel great because I think people are really getting it what we 're doing there and about the value of the building but it 's still a work in building it needs to have events to raise money to keep it going and so I 've got some you know once that you probably can 't read but beautiful and interesting can I move in is a common one until night time but it 's a lovely building and then one and the next one is fabulous and so proud of it protect your harwich with someone from South Africa so it has been very successful we 've had a lot of people come through but a couple of things that you don 't think about from left field have made life more difficult one of the things so I just going to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn 't work in the design phase we of the restoration project ie I wasn 't involved and I probably wouldn 't have picked this up was that the public entrance to the house was moved so you 're looking at the building front on the large tree which is the Bunya pine tree was the governor 's office and that was the traditional entry for most people and the other side of the building is the private family side of the building it was considered that we would make the governor 's library estately or a ceremonial office in line with what it was originally and that we would welcome people in through the private drawing room this hasn 't worked and it 's been a massive problem we 've spent a lot of money on signage because I constantly have people trying the doors to come in through the element it 's also a great testament to Charles Tiffin who was the architect he designed it that way that was the public access side of the building and it 's frustrating but I acknowledge he did a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banners to try and say go to the other side in a polite way but again that wasn 't something I would have thought about predicting a visitor pathway look at the element of the you cannot predict I would argue you cannot predict I visitors pathway you can try and give it arm access on each side one of the really interesting things that I have discovered is that people will come in and do it whatever they want but we can see there that 's my visitor service assistant and her desk is there exactly opposite her is this really vital panel and it is sort of the how Queensland came around and the building of the house in built in it is a touchscreen I took set the 3d structural changes how the house is evolved what we found is that because it 's touch screen and a little vast majority of my visitors through the day are retired or you know not young like me don 't and then there 's a privacy issue they want to engage with the technology but they don 't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving it replicating it to another room where people can interact with it and that sort of element the depth of information this is where my training as an historian really crept in and you know I 've transferred from historical information gathering and writing too didactic panels and short punchy bits but too much information is is destroying and a lot of panels have too much information so i created this layered approach where i was presented the biography of the governor and his family and key events now we can check through that and see how that 's going but you know not no one is no one is investigating it so there is this level of having too much information also I know element of providing information externally because this is Queensland 's house it means that people should be able to come and visit it from all over the Queensland through the web mainly and again click throughs on this indicate that people aren 't and people aren 't looking for that information they want that information in context so yeah less is more this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the downsides of having a really innovative and I 'm using innovative technologies as a way to present your information is that it really quickly comes out of its outdated very quickly and it doesn 't always work and one of the key elements was the virtual version of the house and we had one that had a curved screen it was fantastic but it made people sick okay there was motion sickness and so the kids loved it Ethel well is wicked but you know that sort of element so we 've had to reject that and put it into a new flat screen television and using your game engine and this is much better and kids love it because it we 've been built in an educational aspect to it and every time we walk into the room the thing that triggers in interest is that it is has an xbox controller okay and you should see the excitement on it and I know it 's laden full of history so that 's that sort of element so as a curator I see my principal role is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective of a project that I did which was the governor 's library project and it 's proved a really great success okay in the sense that it does use the sense of what we were holly was talking about this morning is about objects to stimulate conversation okay and it very much is a project that draws on my overseas summer school study trip in 2012 and in particular the emphasis on excursion based learning or learning outside the classroom and this was to refurnish or reimagine one of the key rooms in the house which is the governor 's library so this is some of the stuff the kids interact with on the virtual house that 's my governor 's library project so as a historian the governor 's library was a particularly important room it was a hub of the power and where all the acts and laws were made when kinda would have been a hive of activity okay one of the most effective and traditional venues for teaching history is arguably their storage house for it is the power of these museums more than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct contact with objects so this is a project that I 've done we were given all this okay so this is one of the cheapest projects I 've done because sadly everyone is getting rid of their books and their furniture the colonial furniture so I was really I overrun with people wanting to contribute and most and the chairs were being lent from Parliament because they had nowhere to store it storage is a major problem the papers are facts Emily 's and they 're thin so next month on changing them to look at the lamington national park okay so kids get to interact and play with it but it is object base and one of the key objects that really gets people kids going is the telephone okay and I think that that 's where the success of this project is is evidence by the side of 25 schoolchildren trying to squeeze in between the chairs to get closer to the table and objects I 'm followed by a burst of questions of particular fascination is this 1890s telephone a telephone with no numbers on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogation follows from this object to a discussion of why telephone numbers in the column colonial telephone numbers initially only had three numbers to the historical significance of all governed house being one of the first houses in Brisbane to have a telephone in in the 1880s so we 'll go back to my little chap and and how it my opening story about the young student who believed that historians didn 't do much and I 'm very happy to report that this student was very engaged and he was animated in the governor 's library discussion and when we passing the other half of his cloth and his group as they came out of the virtual house presentation he said to the other group it 's really cool okay so I of course had an inward fist pump of success because I had engaged and hopefully taught something of the past because it is through play that we do so much of our learning and we learn best when we are having fun and I just if I 've got time have a good time yep I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really talk about my project that has come again from overseas thing which is a voice in the walls and again it 's about interacting children actively with history and it 's called the voice in the walls project and i just want to show you some of the photos it is a play it 's an interactive play with headphones and the kids are sent on a quest to help find the Child Protection Act ok of 1899 to help save Mary who is a house made a young housemaid and there are two live actors and we use the whole house it was in response to the fact that QUT as old government house is in a campus and during December and January it 's a very quiet place to be and we 're trying to bring people in there okay so the kids come in here they lie down and then they cut walk around the various points of the house and these are just some of the images that we 've taken so there 's two live actors one is a house house no sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so this is a child engaging they have to research and here he is presenting these elements so this is using space and in a different way in an innovative why and that 's a wonderful thing and I just wanted to say that this one of the things about this is that all you want to do is to try and inspire our interest in history and so the first performances of this play were exceptionally well received and one of the responses was all right you have officially amazed me that was absolutely incredible I love the voice in the wall so much Israel age 9 but this is the best one and I love this and I 'm going to finish on this one because it is about amazing kids that was the best thing that I have ever done in my entire life Tom age 9 ok so with new stories to tell the new ways to tell them the story of old government house continues thank you"

    "text": "my talk has basically got three parts one is the overview of the history of the All Hallows convent building the second part is an outline of the planning processes in the development of or the redevelopment of the museum so things like the plan and the brief the themes that we developed and also practical things like the label hierarchy and then lots of pretty pictures and examples so okay so this is editon 1518 258 you might recognize his older than old government house by a couple years so this one was built by John Petrie for dr. George Fullerton and his family and the Fullerton 's lived there for two years so it 's quite significant because John Petrie became Brisbane first mayor in 1859 and George Fullerton was a member of the first legislative council of Queensland plus it 's a pre Queensland building with 1859 being separation cut to the page ok we also had quite a lot of documentary evidence in the Sisters of Mercy collection that image there is a sketch by one of the art teachers from the 1930s and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house there 's also things like the newspaper account of the construction of the building and naming the people involved the reported didn 't like the architecture keep calling it an exceedingly plain but strong building in the London street style external appearance has been sacrificed for convenience and comfort within this one is a sketch of an Street in 1858 it 's from the valley looking towards the city and the building on the top of the hill on the left is editon and also this was another of the All Hallows art teachers so with separate asian of Queensland from New South Wales that created a new roman catholic diocese the bishop Quinn was appointed as the first bishop and he sought out the Sisters of Mercy to come and start Catholic education in Queensland so this is a mural that was painted on the wall absence Stephen 's Cathedral depicting the arrival of the bishop the priests and the six sisters of mercy there on the side the stephen 's church or cathedral building is in the background there as well so those that was a life-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the restoration of since Stevens in 1988 this is Brisbane in 1862 so the sisters and the priests arrived in Queensland in 1861 they took over an existing a school at Stephens so that Stephens there and this is the house that the sisters lived in this is Queen Street that 's where hungry jacks is on the mall if you want to know and that block of land there the swamp that was where they built City Hall that 's why it sunk and then this one is the next part across of that panorama and that is editon I forgot to point out government house anyway oh and this is an straight there so as I said the bulletin spent three years trying to sell the house and in November 1863 the bishop bought the house for the sisters as their first permanent home and gave them the bill so they establish their network of schools and health education and Welfare with their main ministry areas so over the years that has meant a number of different things but basically it was the the head office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this building as well so the two front rooms on the ground floor there were the classrooms and the two equivalent rooms upstairs were the borders dormitories and the sisters fit in the attic and a number of other buildings on the grounds that they rented so the building was extended in 1892 and the original building was left intact basically they took the roof off the old house added another level and then extended it out in both directions so the as you look at the pitch other two chimneys it towards the left-hand end that 's the border of the 1858 house and this is just a slightly later picture the bishop also bought a house across the road from the sisters to keep an eye on them and that 's his house in the background on the right so as I said it was the congregation head office from 1863 right up until 1975 it was a residence from 1858 with the Fullerton family up until two thousand and seven when the twelve sisters living there moved out and we were given a large piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in one part already but basically we were given a third of the building so we were given the 1858 ground floor and the whole first floor to turn into the music in this is developing the interpretation plan so we had to consider things like the use and other users of the building and the grounds it 's in a school a school of 1,600 students so it 's a publicly accessible museum within that space so that presents a lot of problems for the school and for us to get people in there that other sort of consequence of the decision to give us part of the building is that the school was in the other parts of the building and sensitive areas like school counselors were sort of right next to where the Heritage Center ended up being in the building so we couldn 't let people wander through the building every visitor had to be guided in terms of audiences we knew the groups that were already coming to the heritage center so that was predominantly aged groups and school groups but the sisters wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in the ministries or that the businesses of the sisters could learn about that history so that was a primary audience not so much the public they weren 't so interested in big visitor numbers as long as we had the right sort of visitor the types of visitors that I don 't know if you 've heard this term before but there 's the streak of the student and the scholar so the streaker museum visitor is the person who walks into the room looks around and walks back out again the students the one who reads every fifth label and the scholar is the one who reads every single word yeah so obviously when you you have to guide every visitor and every single visitor has to be ordered the the guides need to have something to do so we had a number of different scripts where the guides could add extra things and the labels and the text written in a certain way so that we had extra stories to tell we would also says that there 's a fourth type visit visitor and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room and because there 's a guy there they just stand there with the arms fold and wait for you to tell them what to look at so that was something we had to consider as well we obviously wanted people to come back we didn 't want them to come once and then never come back so there was also a structure for different itineraries through the building so they didn 't have to do a full hour and a half two hour tour in one go they could come and see a bit and then go away and come back another time what else did I miss educational opportunities is about the connections to the national curriculum and so our museum was obviously one that uniquely connected to the religious curriculum and also with the history curriculum being developed at the time that we did this that was something that we kept in mind as well and also the the focus on primary and secondary sources that is in the curriculum now planning documents there were sisters sort of dreams from 20 and 30 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulate to it to justify to the people paying the bills with in there were documents from the Vatican so there was a Pontifical Commission for the cultural heritage of the church and a few other ones like that were that added a bit of weight to me saying that things need to be done properly so there was also a fairly extensive conservation management plan that was commissioned for the building mainly the sisters wanting to stop other things happening in the building so there was a concern that it fit went to the school that they 'd knock out walls they introduce walls and some of that history of the building would be lost so there 's some quite specific guidelines and policies in the conservation management plan ok so the exhibition themes that we came up with there were six each space could have well should have at least one but it could have up to all six so beginnings were the foundation stories health is the sisters work with visiting the sick nursing healthcare and hospitals education was the 52 Sisters of Mercy schools throughout Queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catechism and music and the arts which the sisters were quite prominent in tertiary education and industrial school so they were where they taught needlework and sewing and later on shorthand and typing and that sort of thing welfare the sisters had a number of initiatives over the years including care of children and the the first orphanage in Queensland was set up by the sisters they had a home for unmarried mothers at a time where that was socially unacceptable care for intellectually disabled and aged care and refugees are much more modern initiatives religious life is about prayer spirit spirituality the training and the internal evidence of that in the building and then building histories obviously changes within the building and its use living stakeholders was a big one because you would get our story from someone and then you would have five other people contradict that story so and delivery it 's so delivery it was due in three stages 2010 was the ground floor 2011 was most of the first four and 2012 was the main exhibition so we needed to make sure that that framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it didn 't look like things were done three years apart so one of the key things and that was the label hierarchy so there was a room history panel in most rooms which was the specific history of that building a story panel which is about the exhibition in that space a sub story panel which were smaller ones just to tell little little anecdotes and then the labels so these are room history panel examples and basically the image at the bottom is the part of the building that it 's in so you can see the first ones in 1858 image the next one is the 1892 extension the third one 's the chapel as it looked in 1961 and then the sacristy is where the pre-stressed so this is them queuing up the big red sections is that clear on the screen those are quotes so some of those are newspaper clippings some of them are anecdotes from the the governors of the time some of them are the trans transcription of the foundation stone that 's outside the building and hidden behind a hedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third shuffle so it 's all just part of that story the major story panels these are just examples again and the backgrounds on these the graphic design we had it tied to the building so if you can see some of the details in the back of background of those panels one is taken from our a bedspread as a pattern from a bedspread that was used in all the sisters of mercy boarding schools another one is the detail from a fan light the glass panel above the door and another one is a stencil that was painted in the chapel and those are the ones as well so sub story panels these are the little ones so these this four different ones here one is a paraphrased anecdote another one is a sort of a job description of a particular role of one of the sisters and we had a really nice photo of of that sister so that 's a photo from about 1950 and we had a photo of her mid eighties standing next to that panel I 'm being very proud that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one is a is a story that one of the sisters told us these are just labels just to show this different so you can see this different word counts as different ways that those have been done some of them talk about it objects in different ways but so these ones are we I just called them specialty panel so these were in different areas generally as a as a barrier or on a sort of a handrail for one of the better words one of the things with the orphanage the green ones the orphanage one is there were obviously positive and negative histories and I was quite clear that I didn 't really want to hide the bad stuff and the sisters were quite happy with that so the little newspaper articles you can see there one is an inspection by the minister saying how wonderful it all was another one is a story of a woman who took her went to the orphanage and took her son went to the train station took him for an outing for the day and she ended up spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the authority of the minister to take her son up so yeah there are those positive and negative parts of the history that you know really shouldn 't hide so oh this is the the visitor map of all the exhibitions so this is the ground floor and that 's the 1858 house there and then up on the first floor that 's the 1858 house there so it 's about there was about 26 exhibition elements permanent exhibitions in in the redevelopment of the center this is an early version of a sketch from the exhibition designers and basically because of the if you look at that conservation management that 's what CMP conservation manner plan policy 13 it talks about an interpretation plan so the designers came up the idea of offsetting all the introduced elements at 30 degrees so all those blue or is it purple elements you can see those are the the new parts so the exhibition furniture the cabinets the glass barriers that we put through and things like that so we 've set them on an angle to make it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that early sketch but again this one is about layering the layers of the history again there 's another conservation management policy there but basically we had someone scalpel off the layers of paint and they 're dated there so that 's the 1863 1892 1930s and 1950s color schemes of the convent so we also removed a couple of walls non-original walls which meant that we had bigger exhibition spaces as well so this this area became an open collection store so some of the artwork within the collection was on display but also with in storage and it had a motion sensor that put the lights on for a couple of minutes so that people could see what was in there get a sense of the space and then we could keep going some of these are about linking stories with spaces I won 't go into what the first one is because it 's pretty tricky topic to explain but that 's about religious relics the next one is sacred vessels so the the church chalices and ciborium and various other things but that was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priests dressing area the sacristy alright so these ones now are a bit more detailed examples so this was the ground floor front room one of the very first ones that you walk into and originally it was one of the classrooms for all hallows school the little inset picture at the bottom is what it looked like before we did the exhibition work and then the big ones obviously what it looks like now so the conservation policy said that we had to retain these rooms on the ground floor as large meeting spaces so we kept the furniture from the 18 probably about 1880s this table seems to have come in when the school had its own separate building built and the kids moved out of the building so this was a meeting space on the other side of one wall is we had a couple of desks student desks from the 1900s lined up there were things inside the desk because we found that when the sisters moved out we did big tours of the convent when it was empty and there was lots of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dummy displays in some of the rooms and people kept opening up the desks to see nothing inside so we put things inside these ones so that they get open them up and see see photos of the school over time the big graphic on the wall all there we had made to look like a blackboard so that brings in part of that school history as well and that 's the room history panel sort of just sticking at the side there this was the story of the the founder of the sisters of mercy Catherine McAuley and it was in the other ground floor entry space the room was called a green parlor because it had a green half and the sisters had a small little display case of you probably see the Barbie dolls office sisters dress up in the case there and I didn 't want to use the Barbie dolls but we did use quite a lot of the things that are in that term that original case that the sisters had set up we used in the big case that we introduced into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slide oh alright so that 's the external wall of the 1858 building you can see the archway in the doorway there so that 's the external wall of the 1858 building and that 's the 1892 stairwell there so what we have done there is a modern version of what was called the chapel list so it was a list in order of death of the sisters of mercy and we had them stenciled on the wall in a very font based on the handwriting of one of the early sisters using a laser cut stencil so they were sponged on the wall to look aged and they wrapped right around the stairwell there and there 's room for the ones that 's still alive to fit on the wall as well I don 't know if you can see that one any better it 's me it 's very difficult to photograph but there was if you look at that little token box there as the sisters came down the stairs and into the chapel for prayers they take a numbered token look up the number on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the tokens get put back in the other side and then everyone gets prayed for so the little insert is the is that before to the right of that image is the the Ulta frontal the the carved front part of the altar that was in the chapel from nineteen oh five to nineteen sixty eight and when they changed the chapel with Vatican to the altar was cut apart but they did keep the carved front section of the altar and for some reason they took it upstairs so we decided to put it back into the chapel also when we pull up the carpet you can see on the in the big image the different floorboards so that was because there were two stairwells originally in that area from 1890s to the 1950s and one was for the junior one was for the novices and one was for the fully professed sisters so they weren 't allowed to talk to each other and they weren 't allowed to use the same set of stairs and they weren 't they had two separate entrances into the chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the old staircase was and there 's a if you can see that it probably just looks like a big flash on the wall on the right so that 's a wall quote so a wall quote is basically a story from a person so this is one of the sisters trying to explain to other people what religious life is about so we use those practically in every exhibition in every space so this is some definitely one of the the visitor favorite exhibitions and this was the novice ship and if you look at the top image in the 1970s of the sisters set up a little art gallery up there with a fluorescent light header around the room and a picture rail and some beautiful 1990s green curtains so we pulled all that out but you can see the statue stand in the corner still and the cross and the statue of Mary is still in the same room and also the desks so these desks were eighteen ninety at 24 this building this room was built as the novice ship or the new bishop where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks and there 's a big bus reproduction down one side of the room there as well so this is just one of the desks open and you can see all the things that are inside so these are this one 's a story about us why a system became i entered the order while she became a sister and there 's a whole series of little photos in there as well and this one is just to show the different ways that people were using the space to big eight seater desks so there was 16 seats in the room so it 's quite good for school groups and there 's a big group of people looking at all the desks there there 's our sisters standing in front of a mannequin which is of herself we had to none of the wedding dresses that they wore during their reception ceremonies were still still existed so we had to reproduce recreate this one from a photograph so that 's her standing next to a mannequin of herself and then the kids doing the dress up activities so we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters habits because they were always used for prayer services centenary celebrations that sort of thing that in that included some reenactment as part of that and they would often wear the wrong habits so we had some proper ones made um so they were historically accurate and they fit kids this is just a music room set up like a music room would have been set up and you can probably see we didn 't put cabinets in there is just a glass barrier across the room and this is a close-up just to show you one of those barrier panels so that 's talking about some of the objects that are on display in there this is a bedroom or a cell and again the conservation plan saying that we had to keep a representative sample of the cells and it and they should be interpreted and also that 's one of the sub story panels there so the chapel was a bit of a challenge because it was a functioning sacred space that needed to be interpreted discreetly so up in the choir gallery upstairs there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room history panels so one has the chapel as it was in eighteen ninety two and the chapel extension shows a photo of the chapel in 1961 and obviously you can see what the chapel looks like because you 're standing in it but and then the guides there also do additional to interpretation up in the choir gallery there was a little handrail as well so there was some additional interpretation down there so that it wasn 't visible from people using the chapel or kids who are supposed to be paying attention to mass so these things work stairs on the barrier you can see the photo of the guide with two students and that 's the that nineteen oh five to nineteen sixty-eight ultra frontal that we 've brought back down into the chapel and then there 's a photographic panel on the top to show the different changes to the inside of the chapel so things like the way the seating was laid out the different floors that it 's had a different times that 's all in those little photos now I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Center there 's anyone here from Melbourne or Geelong of good versus I this was from one of the sisters writing in 1862 get permission to go to Brisbane so her argument was that much sin might be prevented by instructing the females of this first small population and the eerily religion in immorality would not grow as they have in Melbourne and Geelong it 's a good one and then this is the the main exhibition space so it was the convent community room this is a photo of it from about 1909 this is where the sisters had they had a fairly structured day but they had an hour and 15 minutes of free time and it was usually gather in the community room so that 's a community room there that 's what it will look like in 2007 when the sisters moved out we had tours inside the convent of all four levels just to you know show people what it look like before we get hold of it and the school would hold of it so we had part of that those tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the statue in the cross are pretty well there most of the time in these images this is 2008 when we had the floor done and the big glass wall got pulled down this is 2009 when our museum blinds went in and our lighting winning and the buggy got craned up onto the second floor of the building through the window and built inside the space and that 's the completed exhibition so you can see again those big flashes up on the wall those are the wall quotes around the room and I 'll just put another one up there so this was not a chronological exhibition it was a somatic one so there were the that Ares that the sisters had worked in health education and welfare education we had the story of the 52 Sisters of Mercy schools because it was based at All Hallows there was a feeling that it would focus on All Hallows so we had to make sure that they were all got equal representation so there was i don 't think i 'll put a sliding of that but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is just to show you some of those those barrier panels again and this one is the one at the front there is that orphanage one that i mentioned so it 's right at the front of the carriage the carriage was associated with the orphanage and we also did quite deliberate things in the case so there was the 1894 orphanage license from the governor governor and right next to it was Kevin Rudd 's apology so did quite deliberately do some of those things just to show that the positive and the negative stories my last slide is a 2011 we did the national standards program and this is a comment from our reviewers the layering of building interpretation personal accounts and interpretation of objects artifacts and personalities is into woven throughout each of the spaces and this assists the visitor to build up a comprehensive understanding of the life and the work of the sisters I"

    "text": "the Sunshine Coast region is a biodiversity hotspot with an impressive 84 seperate ecosystems recorded in only 3000 square kilometers this diversity of habitat types supports an incredible variety of plants and animals with some not occurring anywhere else in the world despite the fact that there are numerous national parks and other protected areas in the Sunshine Coast region 160 species of plants and animals are now listed as threatened given that well over half of the remnant vegetation remaining today lies on privately owned land the council recognizes that in order to adequately conserve biodiversity across the region it needs to develop strong partnerships with private land holders the voluntary conservation agreement program supports land holders that wish to protect significant areas of vegetation on their property in perpetuity in return the land holders receive ongoing annual financial support to assist with the management of their property and they are also eligible for a rate rebate with my family on the owner of this property you can call the Luther Valley Nature Refuge staff side Mullaney so the 50 acre property and fortunately for us it 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2001 we 've worked at the local councils to to protect that forest remnant and the conservation agreement I made a lot of progress it 's enough we bought the property was untouched with the local land care group to find out about how best to go about protecting the forest and through them we met some people very quickly who were experts in the area and Nick Clancy the local landfill wildlife officer I comments got a lot of time because walking through the forest and helping to identify what was there and with his help we pretty quickly realized that it was a very special thing that we had on the property when he why did the idea of the conservation is very much I think we realized very quickly that it fitted in with our own plans for the property well the voluntary conservation agreement program is a way that land holders can protect part of their property in perpetuity so it 's actually a covenant that 's bounded the title and protects significant areas of forest into the future it also provides land holders with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in the program for a number of years you can really see the changes over time just without that on ground assistance with contractors coming on doing weed control and facilitating natural regeneration it can really turn a property around in a short period of time I 've been fortunate enough to be working on this property for almost ten years starting off farm with some broadleaf privet control along the edges and then moving into the land Tanner and the gullies and that 's one of the great benefits of this this program with council the VCA program is that there 's funding available for contractors like myself and my team come in and assist you with your weed control and management of your property that makes sure that the bush gets looked after and comes back each year the council provides some funds that cover the cost of Spencer local contractor come in with his work for you and they get quite a lot of work done down in the forest much more than we 'd be able to do on our own VCA program prepares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the management of their property and that 's probably one of the best things about this program is that quite often land holders don 't know where to start with their with their properties and you do need a plan so today fantastic to catch up with Paul and just see all the progress on the property just how much change there 's been in the in the last couple of years with the on ground works it 's really turned around if any land holders are interested in the conservation agreement idea I 've certainly encouraged them to look into it we found the whole process pretty much pain free it was very interesting and we learned a lot as we went along inevitably there 's a little bit of form-filling to do but we 're able to be guided by Nick the council officer and really a trouble-free process for property to be eligible to enter into the programs they need to have significant ecological values on their property so we 're looking for things like old-growth forest habitat for rare or threatened species part of the wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve like a national park or a council Bush Land Reserve this is a chance for you to to really work with Council and some really great people to gain knowledge and to gain resources and time and money to make real differences on your property I 've handed a hundred percent positive experience you know that you 're not only doing your own little bit for nature and conservation that it 's protected in the future if you don 't own their property forever what 's the next thing they 're going to do so with a conservation agreement you know the work you 're putting in is going to be of a lasting benefit to

    "text": "so your worms aren 't eating all your food or they 're very very slow few solutions for you to help your worms process the food it 's good to chop it up smaller you can even pop it all in a blender and buzz it up just remember this is going to make it quite moist so you 'll need to add something that 'll take up some of that moisture perfect solution is shredded paper like a bit of that in there make a nice little mix beautiful that 'll help make it so it doesn 't go compacted on you you need that extra fiber in there now remember also only feed your worm farm a little bit at a time divide your worm farm up in your mind into quarters and each time you feed your worm farm put a little bit in the new quarter so for example we 've got this one at the back here the food is almost gone at the back ready to feed I 'm just going to put a tiny little bit of this food in to start off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for them to eat faster they 'll eat it cover that up and then the next time when you come back that 'll almost be gone and you 'll be ready for your next quadrant so your wounds aren 't behaving themselves they 're not moving up from this tray into the second one there 's an easy solution there 's still food down in here that 's where they 're staying there you need to take this off stop feeding them for a week they need to use up all this food sauce before they 're going to leave once it 's all used up next working tray back on put their favorite food in there so they will move up because they 're nice and hungry after that week and they 'll behave themselves quite well for you if Mice and cockroaches have moved into your worm farm it 's because you 've invited them in with the wrong foods in here you need to make sure there 's no meat and no dairy products in here if there are get them out remove those foods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you won 't farm smelly it could be that you 've been feeding it too much and it 's gone acidic on you if it 's gone acidic it 's going to have a really bad smell about it but don 't worry you can fix it really easily one stopped feeding it so much it 's not feeding for a while they 'll eat up all that excess food and just add a little bit at a time be careful what you put into a wine farm everything that was once alive and is now dead they 'll eat it but don 't put any citrus in there anything like oranges even onions and chilies anything like that can change your ph quite quickly you 'll need to add something to get that pH to level back out again you can add common garden line just a light sprinkle remember you want to change things gradually you can also add some nice coarse material and some carbon material like your shredded paper and that 'll help balance your pH back out again also use your soil pH test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there all those smells and extra critters nature 's trying to tell you that something 's wrong this will guide you on how to fix it if ants have moved into your worm farm there are really good indicator that it 's way too dry so you need to add moisture just a light spray to start with allow it to seep down into your worm farm and bring that moisture back up again but you probably got a massive population of ants in here so you need to get them out solution take this tray toss it out into your spare working tray completely upturn it disturb those ants and they will move out of your worm farm then you can take this put it back onto your worm farm and it 's ready to keep working for you but you can take a few measures to prevent the ants from moving in in the first place that moisture level is very important but also add a few extras you can get a big jar of Vaseline and do a nice ring around the bottom of your worm farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 'll stop them from moving in another great trick my grandma taught me was put your worm farm legs in little bowls of water the ants can 't get across the water back into your worm farm just be careful though cuz those little bowls of water can breed mosquitoes so make sure that you tip them out regularly but the Vaseline is brilliant keep that moisture level up and you won 't have ants moving into your own farm if there 's one particular critter that 's over running your worm farm then that 's nature trying to tell you that something 's out of balance so it 's time to go back and check all your vitals you 've got your moisture level your pH level and also the food that you 've put in there if any of these are off then that 's what 's making those critters dominate over everything else so once you 've balanced all those back out it might still be an issue having too many of the critters in there easy way to get rid of them get yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place that in the mitts all your extra critters they 'll get attracted to that bread leave it for two to three days just to be sure then you might want to get yourself a shovel scrape off that piece of bread with all the extra critters on it and get it out of your worm farm so once everything is balanced back out again you 've got the XX critters problem solved so if you 've made a few mistakes along the way welcome to the club the big thing to remember is take small corrective actions nature doesn 't want big drastic changes you 've got to take it easy you might make a small change wait for a few days to see the reaction you really need to be patient with these little fellows when you 're making those changes remember to keep it simple worms have survived for millions of years without our intervention or gadgets they 're one of nature 's most perfect inventions eating our waste and turning it into the perfect resource"

    "text": "worm farms are a great way to turn your leftover organic waste into a rich fertilizer especially if you live on a small block or in a unit they can even be placed on a balcony all you need is a cool well shaded spot compost worms have the ability to convert your organic waste into a rich soil called vermi cast or worm castings high in soluble nutrients and beneficial microbes the liquid from the worm farm is called worm leachate this is different to worm tea which you can learn how to make in the products and their garden benefits section of this DVD with the right conditions worms can reproduce every two to three weeks so numbers can increase dramatically within a short period of time but worms are smarter than us and will not over populate their home there are 350 different species of worms in Australian soils but only a few will thrive in a worm farm compost worms such as red wrigglers Tiger worms and Indian blues are best for producing organic waste the larger African night crawlers don 't like the smaller worm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bathtub you can source these worms from one of our many new sub worm farms most small commercial worm farms start with a thousand worms if starting a larger style farm in something like a bathtub but a minimum of 4,000 worms is recommended to ensure a density of population that will reproduce they don 't actively seek out a partner they just bump into each other and make the most of the situation there are many different types of worm farms on the market or you can use an old bathtub or create a worm tower from a 30 litre bucket all commercial worm farms will have the basics a drainage layer for liquid collection multiple working trays lid tap and legs for elevation they may also contain a bedding block for setting up a commercial worm farm today first thing we need to do is set up our liquid collection tray I like to call it the basement it 's got lots of aeration holes at each leg so we need to get our legs in place slap your basement down five legs in place there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs so like the rectangular models I 'd probably put those on the coupler Besser bricks just to make them nice and sturdy there 's our five legs on this model nice and sturdy next step get your tap in place which comes with your kit when you buy one quite easy to do not it in here just make sure to always leave your tap turned on that way the air can flow in and then the liquid can also drain out done bedding tray this is where your worms will live this is where your liquid will drain through and your castings will collect so this goes in on top before you add your worms add a piece of cardboard or some newspaper if you don 't have it this comes with the farm so this goes into the bottom nice and easy and that covers the holes perfect then of course you need worms so you need about a thousand worms to start off one of these small commercial farms get them from your worm farmer beautiful little sack like this but if you just throw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bedding so the worm farm comes with this which is your block of coconut fiber you 'll need to soak that in a bucket of water until it looks like this this is ready to go down for the bedding for your worms so add this to your one phone beautiful easy betting even better than this is compost and some aged men you are your worms will love that but this core fiber will do the job then you can grab your thousand worms add them to the bedding and you go fellas beautiful so you 've got yourself really nice population of worms they 're always make sure you get your worms from a worm farmer then what you 'll need to do is make sure that they feel nice and safe cool I 've taken an old potato sack an old fashioned bag I soaked it in some water I 've cut it in half and then that can be laid simply on top and then of course the last bit is the lid don 't forget to always place that on top perfect ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next step is finding the perfect location we need somewhere that shady and protected we don 't want downpours of rain hitting this the ultimate goal is to keep it nice and constant temperature around the 18 to 25 degrees Celsius your worms will love it so make sure that it is shaded and protected where you position your worm farm now also with your moisture level you want to make sure that to moisture level when you pick up a handful of your bedding and you squeeze it just a couple of drops of water come out between your fingers always make sure as mentioned before they leave your tat turned on and something underneath there to catch that beautiful black gold that comes out watering cans are great because they only have a small entry and that means you 're not going to get frogs and toads getting inside there and now sit back and let them settle in we set this little worm farm up about two to three days ago this is a beautiful location for it on this little deck really close to where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen so this little guy has had two to three days to settle in and he 's ready to feed now worms will eat anything that is organic but just remember this is only a small invite ironmen so things are going to change really really quickly for your worms if you put the wrong thing in and they 've got nowhere to escape so you must be careful with what you feed your worms worms eat anything organic but in your worm farm things can change quickly and worms can 't escape vegetable and fruit scraps tea bags and coffee grounds as well as some shredded paper and cardboard our best avoid feeding your worms too much bread meat in oil and foods like dairy products or acidic foods like citrus or onion they 'll eat these but meat can smell and attract pests and citrus or onion can change the wound farm pH quickly now we know what to feed our worms but you have to be careful you can 't just throw in any old amount always remember to at least leave half of your worm farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them place it in a new area each time around the farm always always cover up your worms with a hessian bag it could be a cotton tea towel even some newspaper just make sure it 's nice and damp this will keep the worms moist and it 'll keep the surface dark which is what they need to come up and feed also remember that your worms will change with the seasons you might need to feed them more in the warmer months and less in the cooler months so be very very careful not to over feed your worms it 's best to start off with a little bit less is best and then move up to more and more so now our worm farm has been it working away for a couple of months and we 're ready to harvest the trick to harvesting is stop feeding your worms for at least a week before you 're going to harvest then it 's time to put the extra working tray on to take your lid off take your hash and bag your cloth whatever you have covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have no food on top here so the worms are ready and hungry to move up grab your spare working tray which should look like this fellow make sure that you 'll cast things and your bedding here touches the bottom of this train when you put it in worms can 't jump through the air so they need to be in contact to be able to migrate up and down now some people will just start putting food in here that 'll work but it 's going to take a long time to build up enough bedding for your worms to want to stay up in this top shelf another way to get them to move up is to put something that they really love in here so you can use something like compost I got a nice compost and manure mix here and that will make a good bedding as well as a good food source and encourage them to move up into this top shelf remember they 're nice and hungry and they 're going to want to come after this food so pop this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need more than that don 't forget to cover it back up again keeping them damp and dark pop your lid back on and keep doing that keep feeding them now this will start to build up and your worms are migrated up in the top in a couple of weeks maybe a couple of months time will come back and we 'll be ready to use this tray out in our garden so it 's been a couple of months now since we put this secondary tray on our worms will have moved up inside there 's a nice depth of bedding for them to live in so now our mission is to harvest this tray full of castings to use on our garden we need to do is take off this top layer remember all your worms are in this top layer to take them off positioning them on buckets is really easy to access and lift now remember these trays full of casting is going to be really really heavy so you 're going to need a nice friend like Adam here to help you lift this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lifts beautiful thank so appreciate yup so now we 've got our castings here and we 've got our worms here it 's time to put our worms back in their home the poor little fellows so back we go with their worms and this becomes our working tray as it was don 't forget cover them back up with your damn passion bag we want to keep them damp and dark and nice and happy for us we can feed them normally with our fruit and veggie scraps around the farm lid back on ready to keep working and producing the castings for us and here 's our tray ready to be used out in the garden if you prefer to make your own worm farm then try a bathtub clean and rinse the bathtub and elevated off the ground a couple of large bricks will work put a container under the drain hole or a pipe to direct the liquid out cover the drain hole on the inside with shade cloth to ensure remains free of debris place a drainage layer of 50 to 100 millimeters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal works well cover with a very fine grade geotextile fabric to prevent castings from silting up the drainage layer now you need to make some organic bedding for your worms a mixture of koya fiber and straw pre soaked in water is good to lay down first add some shredded paper if you have some add some compost and age manure but don 't add chuck manure to a worm farm as it creates too much heat water the bedding to make it just moist a good test is to wring out a handful of bedding only a couple of drops of water that 's great you 'll need about four thousand worms to start off the bathtub then cover the worms with a piece of carpet underlay or Hessian bags that are damned this will keep the farm cool and moist if the worm farm even seems dry re moisten this cover layer most commercial worm farmers use a mist spray irrigation system to add moisture when you 've got them in their new home don 't forget a rainproof cover all corrugated iron is good for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a week start adding food at one end of the farm this worm farm is much bigger so more food can be added but better to start small and add more later always leave half the bathtub surface with no food on it to harvest the castings wait until all the food is gone in the current location then start feeding on the other side most worms will move to the new food after a couple of weeks harvest the non feeding side and refill it with bedding if you 're into the simple life then free-range worm farming may be for you a great way to do this is with a worm tower straight into the garden start with something like a 30 litre bucket or an old concrete or large plastic drain pipe but has a diameter of 300 millimetres or more and a length of 500 millimetres or more some say to drill holes but it 's not essential it is essential however to cut the bottom out of buckets to allow drainage and access bury the bottom half of the bucket or pipe into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manure add your 1,000 worms put in some food scraps sprinkle in some shredded paper or torn cardboard cover with shade cloth and an old pot plant this allows air in without allowing heavy rain and critters in your worms will migrate in and out feeding at night and taking castings and liquid back out into your soil you can even put compost in here and the worms will process it even further and spread it through the soil easy you"

    "text": "a common problem with a compost bin especially this model is that it can get a little smelly now that 's because there might be something crawl so let 's have a look at some of the basics one it could mean that it 's too wet so to solve that problem add some dry stuff which is the brown side of the diet for your compost bin so it could be dry leaves it could be the good old toilet roll cardboard egg carton all those sorts of things will absorb that extra moisture your shredded paper straw anything you can possibly think of the other problem might be that because of that extra moisture it 's become compacted so you need to add some air into your system it can be as simple as grabbing something like this little fence post whacking that in there and you 'll punch air holes down into your compost system this can also be done with the garden fork so you can get in there with your garden fork poke it in and turn it as much as possible now if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you there is a simpler solution to get air into your compost bin especially this model is this boy here he 's known as a piece of Ag pipe you can use PVC piping but this guy already has holes in him so you set him in the middle of your compost bin a little bit lower than your lid so that you 've got your lid over the top and air will flow down through the core and out through the holes so it allows nice airflow through your compost bin another problem could be acidity right that doesn 't smell very good at all some people find it really hard to listen to nature so wait to find out what you said is with one of these guys a soil pH test kit will tell you what nature is doing in there so by evening a way to even that out is by adding something like your garden lime a natural way of doing it is crushed up eggshells and that will balance your pH back out again but that test kit will help guide you through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you won 't have a smelly compost bin it 'll go from a stinky swamp to a beautiful rainforest floor and that 's what you want another common problem with the compost bin is that you might have critters trying to make this their home cockroaches mice and rats could make this their little habitat there could be two reasons they 're looking for somewhere to live or they 're after a certain food source solution rough things up so this isn 't a habitat that they want to be their home that 's where your aeration comes in so keep working your compost aerating it you can simply be sticking the fork in there and that 'll disturb their habitat and they won 't want to live in there your other problem is that you might be putting a food source in there that they 're attracted to so don 't add any meat dairy or even any cooked or sweet things so that means like bread and biscuits and pasta if you put those sorts of things in there you 'll attract the pests to the system so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want in there this is a living ecosystem but these guys will come in and they 'll become pests so to keep mice rats and cockroaches out of your system rough it up and disturb their habitats and don 't put any food in there that 's going to attract them like your meat and your dairy products if you open your compost bin and a whole heap a little vinegar flies come flying out they could be fruit fly or vinegar fly the reason they 're in your compost bin is because there 's exposed fruit and exposed edge problem solved add some brown material so every time you add a layer of green add a layer of brown that 's a good rule of thumb and it will stop this problem so your shredded paper your dry leaves anything even a shovel of dirt if you don 't have anything else to cover that fruit and veg and you 'll stop those little vinegar flies from flying up your nose another issue might be that your compost bin is a little bit slow so you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's not enough Sun to get enough heat it could mean that it 's drier not going to nuff moisture so you add some of those nitrogen-rich things it could also mean that there 's not enough air so you need to aerate it to get it going so here we go here 's your compost bin might be a bit slow check that there 's enough Sun getting on this you need as much soon as possible with these little systems that gets that heat and gets it working a lot faster there might also be a lot of dry material in there so add some more greens if you don 't have fruit and veg look into your green grass that you just cut off the lawn that can help also also don 't forget aeration you 've got to get air down in there to get your compost being active and going and finally if all else fails get your activators in activators can be things like your horse manure cow manure goat manure whatever you 've got floating around just remember no dog poo or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfrey yarrow arrowroot they 're all fantastic activators there 's your horse who don 't forget to make sure that 's aged horse poo you don 't want any chemicals going in there from the worming mixture and if you 've got all those things just right your compost bin should be working quite rapidly you can get compost in six weeks if this is working at its optimum with temperature moisture and air they 're the main things to look for when your compost bin is working a bit slow for you"

the ceo down they really make the place look pristine which it does it 's immaculate i 'm a local i 've been here since 1993 their previous life as a baker pastry chef and joined the council and haven 't looked back living on the coast is great i mean i 've got a young boy at home and beautiful wife and it 's close and convenient for everything if you want to go into the hinterland and have a cup of coffee up in montville and mulaney and the beach you gotta love the beach my brother actually had a traineeship while i was still in school and he loved it so i looked at that and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very closely with the galleries team they have a new exhibition all the time the libraries are amazing as well caloundra music festival is getting bigger and bigger every year most of the major festivals are in brisbane or gold coast you have to travel now we 're bringing all the big acts here i love pretty much everything about my job i love the people that i work with and the camaraderie have come into the council and coming to work and the use of water and what water can do is something i really enjoy i had come from the sugar industry on the sunshine coast and that had closed down and i saw council as a good opportunity to get a good job and you provide a good service you 're doing something good for the for the community i really enjoy the hours that the council works and having the time off being close to your family being able to go home in the afternoon at a reasonable time i always tell people it 's a great place to work because of the variety that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas and have a great career i was born and bred here on the coast gone other places in the world but i 've come back here and settled and have my children and have a really nice relaxing lifestyle here it 's hard to go past it i love the diversity that i get in working for council of meeting new people and i do love helping the community and i chose it because it 's a stable job where i 'm able to learn and it 's interesting i 'm a coastal engineer mostly we 're looking at any sort of potential damage to infrastructure and as you can see here we 've done some reprofiling of the beach i came here initially for the weather as most people do after i moved up here i became a keen surfer i find it really convenient it 's just a really nice place to live and you 're close to brisbane and you 've got a decent airport most people in the waterways team enjoy their job and i think we 're really contributing to the case i start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me time to do a really good day 's work and then i also get time in the afternoons to spend with my family i might go fishing or i might go surfing or go for a paddle it 's just a good place to work and there 's got good people this is an office is a great spot to work you know not many people get to have an office with a space like this i love sharing the aspects of the environment with the public and helping them get an insight into how maybe the area looked a couple hundred years ago before the landscape was clear i get to see visitors from all around the country and even around the world i love it i think it 's full of a lot of motivated hard-working people and they just want to see the best outcome for the community because yeah we live here too i deal with the major urban developments these new projects are accommodating probably another 70 80 000 people on the coast so the variety of people that you get to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talented people internally as well finish work and be down the beach walking the dogs within five minutes yeah there 's just a lot happening but it 's still got that sort of good coastal vibe i think the diversity of roles it 's always challenging sunshine coast council wants to be one of the first regions in australia to adopt a smart city platform using technology to improve the lifestyle of the community reducing waste and being more efficient and connected with the communities it 'll be intelligent for example bus services knowing whether there 's patrons actually waiting down to street lighting turning on lights when people are actually in the area so reducing wastage everything 's going digital and more people are becoming connected and social so it 's important that we tap into what the community needs the good thing about the council and with the airport management always put us through a lot of training but people who work in my role for example are really well trained we 've got the same sort of qualifications of anybody in australia everybody 's from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work as a team we 're all here for one purpose and we all know our roles and it all works in australia beaches restaurants anything you want to do everywhere you got good schools places going ahead we 're all excited about it everybody you"
