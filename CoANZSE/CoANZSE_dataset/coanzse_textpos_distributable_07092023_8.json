    "text": "hello today I 'm going to show you how to make a reusable food wrap and out of cotton and beeswax and some hobo oil and some pine resin now these are wraps that you can use to wrap around the salad bowl or to wrap your sandwiches and things in for kids lunch boxes and they 'll last for about a year so you can do away with plastic wrap in your kitchen okay I just give you a quick idea of what were using today so I have beeswax here and we 've grated that and it just comes out like a hard cheese this is pine tree resin and some of the finer resin there is easier to to melt so just a spoonful of that and that makes it sticky and the jojoba oil which is a nice pure oil that doesn 't go off and that just gives it some extra flexibility got some pinking shears here and they 're lovely just for making the zigzags along the sides and that helps them not to fray so it 's the first thing you need to will need 100% cotton so no quality cotton because you don 't want to be melting polyester something that it 's going to go me or food so have a look for some cotton if you 've got pre-loved material loss wraps around the house then it 's fine to use those if you want to just give them a little wash beforehand that 's good or if you have off cuts and things like that of new stuff that 's perfectly fine too so this size here is about 40 centimetres square and that 's a big size and nice to wrap around the tops of bowls or anything really yeah okay so all what I 've done today is I 've grated some beeswax and it 's just a little bit like cheese but it is really quite hard so please be careful when you 're great not to get any of your fingers Bucknam and I 've laid out an old towel here to protect my table I have some baking paper to the side here to be roughly bring it across and I have two squares my cotton across and I also have a fire so pretty heated and ready to go so you just set that on a cool setting so that 's on all at the moment so that it 's ready to melt the wax and the oils and things in so what we do is we make a bit of a pizza so we sprinkle your cheese no no your beeswax wrap of beeswax on here and you might find it a little bit tricky to find beeswax but if you do Google your local beekeeping Association and find local beekeepers and they will be selling these mites usually in a kind of soap bar kind of size or you might get a number of blocks to use so that 's the beeswax grated on there and they 're not that stuff this pine resin so it 's pine resin I found that they a whole food shop but have a look on the internet and see what you can find and now some of these things if you 're just making one or two it might not seem like a sensible group of families who are interested in in making them together and it might be a really good way to to engage with other people and families at your school for instance and make them with your PNC 's and then we just put a few squirts of this hop over oil so the prime resin makes it sticky the beeswax kind of creates a seal and it has any bacterial properties and the Huff over oil spelt jojoba jo-jo ba oil just gives that a little bit of flexibility so that 's all there and then this is a slightly smaller piece there over the top so we get to none at once and then another couple of pieces of baking paper over the top and then I 'm just going to bring and that really just catches catches the extra wax and things as we 're melting it so what we want to do with our iron its just start with really little circles and a little bit like pizza cheese you 'll start to see it melting under the heat so you don 't really need to want to melt all of those rates of but beeswax but we also want to melt the resin and just be able to move it around a little bit so that all of the cotton is nicely and evenly soaked there we go a beautiful reusable alternative to a plastic wrap so once you 've made them you just use the warmth of your hand to mold it and take get it to take shape around a bowl and this one is just fold it up and make a little sandwich parcel and keep things fresh for you okay and just to take care of them you can just wash them with some cool water a little bit of soap and I 'm just put them on the dish rack to dry so now you have some alternative to plastic food wrap for your kitchen and your picnics and your lunch boxes I hope you have a go and let me know if there 's any questions and check out plastic free July for other hot tips and alternatives to plastic in your life _"

    "text": "[Music] back in the builders of the beer just here well I said no burning no even in this crazy old pirate school we learned all sorts of wonderful things again here now knowing that be a bit of a scary number for us pirates because knowing is a number of the cats tails like at a nine tails here that no I don 't know maybe to face the captain knows he 'll you 'll need to stand like a pirate in the laughs show me the courage you need to face this ready that 's right feet apart and so details that be one of our punishment it was basically a whimper a leather straps knowing straps with not to the end and that 's how he used to punish people right what you do right if you 've done something bad one of the things they do is they get you to kiss the gunner 's daughter they called it right so you remember out gun the cannon right to get you lashed over that okay wait so Eden and so your back was facing there by they give you the whippin by that never more than thirty ninth oh you know cuz we are a superstitious breed us and in the Bible it says that forty Wentzel Kia so we only I didn 't know what to fall through you know mean as we really didn 't like that Allah but no no we 'll be under thirty you know you know I pants off and you get whipped by that pie and I know lots of expressions come on you heard of the expression letting the cat out of the bag all right you 're that expression right right well it 's not about a real cat it 's about the cat annoying tales all right it was kept in a bag and once the cat was out yeah I had to use it right so that 's what you wouldn 't want to see it out sometimes they wave around say or I get you with a cat behavior or not to keep people annoying but once the cat came out it was punishing toy you that 's what you get punished with the number for us point rates but anyway now we 're gonna go and talk a few more things about navigation right just to wind up one up and then we 're gonna talk about playboy you 're it flags soy de stuff the old-fashioned way even the flag so now I also wanted to say yeah last time email it was talking about not having GPS as our iPhones and stuff like that but some of you Foca they were looking down your nose at me and thinking off our back when I see y 'all back were delay yells pirates no GPS no I Yvonne 's I 'd like you to remember right that we started this old paper right with the oi patch ah that 's right so next time you 're looking down that you think the pirates say oh they started all this right now I 'm talking about the watches and all that sort of stuff I believe the watches when we talk about them right you have two watches important a star ready so we keeping track of things and then what to be we ever half hour the what should record the speed will go and you lot blowing in and we 'll go the knots and all that sort of stuff and and they like that down and they get an accomplished now do the directions they Roy that down every off Alice you know what you 're doing right but Alban do that how they know where the toy human how do they tell the toy when you 're at sea you know well there were two essential items I 've got here right now or not I 've got a real one the belt the other one I 've got another picture right okay that 's another hourglass right remember we had done our gloss right with a low blow but that was 30 seconds this one be thirty minutes right all right and you see it 's got the ropes attached to it on each side so it could be secured on there so I wouldn 't wash away all right you turn it upside down good place I didn 't take 30 minutes to go through right and bell all right every time and you know H watch and it go on right so when it was first Bell of the watch it 'd be one second Bell then the third bell that would just do that so if you 're a sailor right you knew the Watchers on the air and you heard the bell ring four times you 'd be able to work out what time it is by what watched if there was all right so they had arranged a shift times okay basically basic they put the watch down there because of the bell down there cause it 's been you know in the road but they 'd have those on the ships and often they 're the names on them and when they do with a ship hunting right that 's how they would often tell what the name of the ship is because the bells still be there because it were made out of brass right that 's why a lot of the guns are super made out of bras because they 've done rust all right so that 's why we 've been able to be down the bottom of the sea you want some there it is there right ah we know that anyway so how he watches all right there were five watches of four hours and two watches of two hours they were the dog one chain now the dog watches were good because that 's where you change your over okay so you weren 't getting the same watches all the time so during the dog watches we 're gonna get the two short watches you 'll change them over right it 's all the watches when basically you 'd started sailors day starts at noon right why would it start at noon remember last week right we talked about the Sexton known is the only time we could really check the time was right you know you got guys ticking over the hourglass Theory half hour and all that that 's subjective bit error already you know like dogs are it 's not there at the right time to do it and start again and there 's no way you can catch up with saying I half an hour food so just to make up for that roid at noon we do the reading with a sextant so we see the Sun 90 degrees above the horizon and that 's how we know what I write at noon we start so that 's why watches and ship stays and ships logs they all start at noon because that 's the most accurate time that we can actually have on a ship is new in a book that 's right twelve o 'clock in the day all right that 's why you know it 's easier to have a gate on sunny days are you onto a big mother cloud and stuff like that then you 're getting some estimates and let 's make it a bit harder and you 're more likely to get lost all right so we like to see the Sun around noon if we can so that 's what we are that all right so the watches watches a cool right is the afternoon so he started noon so noon to 00 that 's the noon and then from 4 to 6 that 's the second dog watch obviously all right and the first watch is the 8 to 12 first lunch that 's 8 to 12 the middle watch which is basically the middle of night it 's 12 to 4 arena then your morning watch that 's for today right and then you before noon watch that be 8 to 12 and then we 're back again right so that 's your watches you do all those watches my lap and every offer out of the bells ring in the ER that clean crying and a preach are fair it gets another one so if we could say in the tenant we know what I 'd say you 're in the forenoon what 's right so our Freight King bill runs once 9 o 'clock Dean Dean twice alright so for bills that be off plus ten for bills in the forenoon 10 so that 's a util time right and that 's it and so what do you do then you got a little thing you 're taking your readings every half-hour right the different watches and all that of sleep right we have these bits of sleep there and you write down what was happening in that watch the last job of the watch would be to take the thumbs on the slate and write it in the log there 's a book we can recorded everything that way you can keep track of where you 've gone and you take your way be salient to all the distance and all that new work at your app app and anything went wrong you know because it was written down in the lobby you track it all back down it 's like boxing the planes only manual you know what do you do at the end of that well you wipe the slate clean and that 's where that expression comes from why can 't the slate clean it 's actually the slate that used to record the alley reads on earth during a watch right and that 's why did start the new watch with a clean slate another expression coming from this island all right oh we should celebrate where you going ah that 'd be right Martin all these expressions and all these wonderful things you do now what we gonna talk about we don 't know what book and all that sort of technical stuff so now we gonna get a bit of interesting stuff about themselves and their flags hahaha you see me all jolly what you 're flying over there all the tell you mom Jolly Roger is an interesting word I think honor that Rogers are very happy fella but that 's not where it comes from it 's actually a French word it 's Julie rules reason one and it means pretty red hot which sounds a bit funny but actually it was supposedly scary red but I thought were pretty red there 's a bit of a a taunt or one kind of stuff because I read sort of a scary color of blood or my stuff and they say we will have no will take no prisoners and all this sort of stuff for the scare people because pirate flag is basically advertising for us right you know once you put up a lawyer plaque you main tasks but give up all right you just want him to give up really you don 't want to be fighting as many times do you you know we take 400 ships over three years imagine all those fights there you know get right to yourself oh I 'm so bored with it are but know so a lot of times you scare them and you get their big gravitation once you got the big ramp they just get on the straightaway you do it you know hold up straightaway alright so now let 's think about the flag didn 't always look like this right I mean it 's the really popular one now right but really they reflected the personalities of the sailors and and those ones came to be really just popular culture top ones like that kind of stuff they 're all the harder ones so first I 'm going to show you this from an old pirate called a manual win another Frenchie right he 's really the first to go black and white you can see that he had the skull and crossbones ear you also has run routes so surrender now hard cap Emmanuel win marry me so next up I was gonna show you this low right see he 's flag is the red skull skeleton right you know it 's scary in a dog i means all you mean business they don 't know the bones about it her he 's a scary old chappie alright so next up we got uhhh is it a fellow gentleman poke pirate areas a pullback seeing the seated right Oh captain Bonnie you 're right are you a subtle like you know he 's got the dagger on that side right now ha I 'm this so even over the cross of the ball over the top of their bowling like that so basic it 's like you know death and life life or death you choose alright surrender now ha see oh good advertise and people think oh I don 't want to do that everything they want and they oh yo calories another flash bugger Calico Jack Rackham on there alright ah yeah the cross cutlasses instead of the bones alright yeah that 's at all the swords are gonna miss your throne II know it 's a renderer a b-grade flash hi people can skill him there too if he 's happy to be threatened another Oh our anywh else we got we 've got yeah I think yeah Thomas it was a bit more simple about easier I got a strong arm a big Cutlass give me all your money Polaroid will surrender or else not going are they married so that was all the ones here this one was the first one actually to do with the crossbones underneath right he was long bad Avery you know yeah the oldest gold cross bones in the skull but this car was gone so you ate he 's different right first actually credited doing the traditional flag his old cap whirly right he 's gone to one with a girl and crossbones there and it became really popular and Oh Captain England right Edward England he moved the bones underneath and he brought a small ladder but it 's pretty similar to a bloody balls underneath which is you know similar to what you know that 's all you don 't know I just like this one here crystal moody you in back to the ready at the arm yeah now I 've lost with wings hey yeah this cross bone as world leaders have been turning on their old moody hey it was very moody didn 't know what he wanted hey alright next is one here this be the one of Captain Bartholomew Robin strain captain Bartholomew Roberts one of the most successful pirates ever we ever he took over 400 prizes very good very successful pretty detailed flag there with the old scale in this beer and the boss fact it was two flags tell rags not one not one but 200 you might call that greedy but being a boy written in green is what is all about it in no way did this is the other flag right you see ol boss all of you black bar they used to call him ed up into the feet against the guys from Barbados and botany game hard times we swore vengeance on the blood is right and so you these sword standing on skulls over these letters these letters stand for uh Levitas him Ana Martinique ed right so he 's basically threatened the guys from those Islands I see yeah your daughter 's sorry you chorus so that was his vengeance for his horror bracha blue that 's way big old black bar great pirate very successful Oh what bar oh

    "text": "[Music] we 're back and it be listen to pretend hahaha not do this I get down to be Tolls cap them as well because we 're up to ten that 's right ten fantastic number four it 's 10 over here at all salta tables about the legendary black beard sandal off like pardon remember what are we call the front of the ship that 's the bow in the back I see off all the stern and thus targets is so a gist here in Syed from the old eighties and the ports are you is the other side you should be the large but I say I 'm doing low heat so they changed its porn because I got a bit confusing larva the star so Viking words Lawrence Tarbert starving the star for steering for the Vikings when I had a big paddle down the sorry and larb it was a sunny day loaded on that all the Viking you diapers right now somebody had a question for me I read they asked me about Dublin that 's a funny name remember the watch right between four hours but there 's two short watches in two hours and they go from four to six it 's excited and they sit why do they call him the dumb ones cuz we talked about don 't watch is now you know well they call that the DOM watch because the first star you see at no point okay you 're the day the brightest star that you can see when you see the first starring that be serious right now and the other name for serious is a dog star right now they called the dog star so that being the first guy you see your anointing you 're gonna see it when it goes dark alright what 's happens anytime between four and eight basically and so that 's when you see the dog star so that becoming the dog watch so that 's that one that was pretty simple really hurry so just so you know that 's why they don 't watch come from right now the other question they had for me and I think this is a problem with the toys that everyone to the toilet where where do on their boat you know I thought to myself surely they know where to go they told you but don 't what I 've got worried so I 'll let you know you 've heard the expression they 're headed for the toilet we 're at that people call it the head especially ones that NCR yes and those all those sort of shovels are people either I know about nor do the head alright well that 's what they call it on a shoot right that 's where that comes from maybe CES something or other egg that comes off that 's why that is about the Navy that 's why they call it the head and they have lots of shows how you talk about the head alright why was a call ahead Wow because ahead of the ship up at the bow right so they call it the head because you 're going to the bow of the ship right what they had was you wouldn 't even have railings all right early days you know railings they could lead across rope so you could sit in right but basically the head wouldn 't you go either so you know when it got a bit lower on this is like like this picture oh you 're right you can see there see those there they 're the toilets all right now that one each saw importance turbine but that wasn 't the important part of it right it was important part of it right was the leeward or the windward side remember wind wind was away where the wind was coming from Leawood was where it 's going to right so if you were gonna use a toilet you 'd want to use the one on the leeward side so it was blowing away from ya not to you right that 's how you make it a choice unless you were desperate then you do the other way you wouldn 't carry so that was the thing you see these are got little wooden things on the top of the ship there and that was a bit modern more are there when they weren 't the ropes in there England good 's why you go on the leeward side and other good thing about it right because it 's open to the sea just go straight down to the sea and the waves of the boys crashed into it cuz that 's the front of the boat but it 's going through the ways that would clean it out and keep everything nice and clean so that 's why it was all there at the front other advantage of that is where a sailing ship right so the wind is always at our back right rolls through the sails we 're talking about do we know that we 'll talk about sailing right so the wind grows this way so any smell that comes from there goes away from us right it blowed away from us so we don 't have to worry getting all those smells back on us and that 's what we had that day right now some people get a bit confused with a poop deck they say surely the poop Nik is the toilet ah well maybe you would think that but actually the poop dick want to have one of the beard Roman have that raised bed in the back you see it all of those old movies appearance in stuff like that all right that was a poop deck right and that actually should be a French word poop a you remember the French they pasady francs a lot of you learn to come for the French Jolly Roger all that sorts of crazy then right you know to your many French poets but they just gave us a Lord 's very weary poop decks has been in the back and poop poop a P o ope right is the French word for the rear or Stern alright and so that 's why it was poop deck because cuz of those frames right and I don 't know with you know poop actually came the other way around ago that 's the back flow always sense as well but I 'm not raised to searching toilets here I 'm doing bold so we like we 'll just leave that to your imagination but that 's where the poop decks goes alright now what I Blackbeard ha ha ha Blackbeard was a pirate who is to stand with his legs apart he 's handle his hip and he would laugh out loud like us scream ha ha that 's right he was a real part of the old Blackbeard and this be his wife we saw it last week briefly when I was talking flies right see his flag he was very mean and scary tea he 's got the hourglass innocent you taught him is open and he 's got Blackbeard there the big skeleton with a crown is it cuz he was a king of crowns king of dare Santa lots of stuff it 's got a spear there and always coming to get you her and a heart there a bleedin ha just to make it really obvious right that 's what it was all about all right he had a bit of everything in his flag and he was a scary man cuz he was a dick the head of marketing as well he was really good at marketing himself as a pirate right he had a lots of things what right big black beard how many people say about your buy beer is he that 's my black Beard 's her and mines the black really is it is for both the cultural you know lots of colors I 'm gonna book the married I mean if I was not captain but Celia I could be multi beard the pirate or something I know that 's beard big really long I 'd used to Planet right you put all little things like this seed have all these like that all of them so nobody had snakes when you strike what do you went into battle but he waited the battle what do you do is you get some long fuses and said tobacco and he twist him into the plants right where he was platinum up and he 'd Lloyd him was he was bad to go over this all year doing and so he 's faithful he jumped over it looked like his face was alive and in fire what does he look like a demon it scared the bejesus out of people and II don 't know if Cobra his flash red when I got from another sold you tell you somebody quite like it cookies me warm but he was destined for star you know that cause me had a big black coat and he was Pat it up a bit so you don 't even bigger on there and you see I got I carry my Cutlass the old colors when they all cut this right a carry out on on this white strap read what he would do okay all right what he would do easy it had braces or pistols on there right so he had three or four braces epistles remember braces to I know I used to just go for the bracelet base little bit you know sets of them going down right there just stick now that so people would see you know you and he 's built along with these Cutlass he would have noise all stuck down in there reading a couple extra pistols so he was there all the EV the armed right so he hopes carry and mean and all that guy stuff plus he used to that he just shot one of his crew in the knee just for a laugh I don 't know putting that for you but he 's not always funny and he may be more scary girl that there 's a legend that he could cut a man from top to bottom and one stroke with his Cutlass that 's how strongly was right and that if people was slow would give me jewelry he would just cut off their all and the throw low land of the chest don 't were the kind of room is a spread so people were afeard of him right but he also is smart because he 's had the flip outside of that this there was a rumor going around that he was actually generous a coin to those who cooperated with him so people for you well I get my hand cut off I get cut and sunder you know tell you shoot me the knee just for a laugh or I just make it make you welcome and say hey come along home have you seen this ring do you like that 's all so that 's what he did so we didn 't have so many fights you know he 's dead people around very smart mother fact he was properly educated right he come from a dead world a new family in England right right before he was well Lou and he could read him right so he 's a smart fella already he was a smart fella the all-black in fact he started as a regular sailor for a privateer are you working for a private Eagle Captain hornigold right now privateer you might don 't know that that 's really another word for pirate but an official sort of pirate you see they all kings and queens were saving money but not having a full memory maybe they get pirates and say well let 's have a bit of a deal here I 'd be going to private business with Maori so there 's a private business of pirating so where they would actually just attack so if you 're English you just attack Spanish ships right the Spanish with all the gold so that was the best go although sorry so we 'd attack the Spanish ones Rainey right was private to here and then you sweep the booty with the quarry arm and all that and that way they wouldn 't get pursued and you had the freedom other he was ports and all that sort of stuff so I had some good things to go with it right that was a private here it 's all back be right he won 't get nobody only Laurel he turned out he was good enough ie new tactics so he soon rose up the rank I want to go liked him so much he gave him his own command and then together they sailed the spouts Terrorizer sees for a quite a while all together its privateer isn 't the Spanish he didn 't even all that sort of stuff but he was quite popular with the English at that time right now hey but one day forget an acorn this is one of the most famous victories they caught the Concord right they actually captured that ship and it was a big 300-400 grain 26 guns all out all right another forty guns they put 40 guns on it right and they called it the Queen Anne and I became the flagship writer and then Owen Oconee gold he decided to retire then Blackbeard had an old thing for himself and that 's it and he gonna be jack of the whole thing about handing over off these money to the stingy old king and all that he said no no privateer pirate and he got a full Roman point written went off terrorized and things himself ha I want a priority was he had a huge mouth with big sea battles and he 's daring do and all that comes all the real priority stuff ah he was a one one of these big battles he sunk the ship the HMS scar ah who 's for human size big friggin very big military friggin Oh pump and proud and myself a Blackbeard some car HMS tree that stands for his or her depending on what you got at the tow him majesty surface and that means like the government for the king stuff so that Queens army or whatever that is alright that 's how you tell those apart all those words in front of there 's the front of ships they tell you what they are I can explain some of that later one of the other classes I 'm sure right so that 's why you need some of the sky remember that any even two islands and towns over as well you 'd have the town there and you 'll braid out of that town and they needed to bring all these booty back right and even sell it through the towns markets and all that I suddenly felt like very probable he was a bit of a businessman the old beer as well right even dimes one time right and and at that time rate you had like you know understand he had like 300 pirates and four ships he was operating at the same time as part of his fleet like it was like an admiral of pirates he was right one time even took over old town in the USA you ate bullied and I can 't remember all took over that town I kept the people there the really important people we had them all on rusty train Hilden hostages barricaded around the town out there and kept them all stuck in the town until they paid a ransom higher all ransom nobody needs a grant some you 'll think like hordes and hordes of gold and booty but Nolan was actually medicine see cuz all of his crew memory at over 300 there was sick at the time so he got lots of medicine and they paid it and he made it wealthy so he also worked with that so other parents around their life 's like Captain Bonet you remember we had his flag last week right bit of a flash Frenchy guy there they are it 's a French guy we all this one pretty cool all right so would it be enough thinking 's a bit of a deal right didn 't it was very good made stupid choices so he cut him loose right and then he actually maroon about 30 these cruise I 'm sip on a somewhat and what happened was English air the pirate containers he betrayed him so one day a guy called lieutenant min I arrived her got right when old Blackbeard sailed in just one ship does one of these smaller ships the adventure he was just on a little trip with one of those right and he was probably about the same size as Romeo follow like mine and he was in the in the inlet there overnight and become who they knew he was it 'd been a setup right so he turned up with these two big battleships and a couple of slopes right sorry didn 't it was the pearl in the lid right there hms hms pearl hms lynn rate they were out there big big battleship straightener and queen around this all you and then at dawn y 'all_''_850.22 got me neither came in with us a couple of those ropes to hate the smaller ships and it sounded though now see on and bolt soundings on you do when you measure and how far the bottom is right you go the sounding arrival you don 't so you tell how in there no matter and but a captain become aware right and he went to cut and run remember cut and run II cut the anchors came on the anchors right so we could let their cuz go on just to sail off he started sailing off when he started fighting with him and fighting against him rain and the big fire for you did sued for the cannons bang off banging off and he 's only the little bedroom but he was such a good sailor they actually sent the Lamanites at the win and badly damaged to pearl but he 's always was pretty damaged because they had lots of cannons he was vastly out gun but he seal and mean he was sort of that and captained by Blackbeard sinking hard I need a new ship anyway I 'm gonna grab me that pearl all right so he pulled up to this high heat and they across with a grappling hook all right master nicely and their swords and all that sort of stuff give my Cutlass down there dude ah but Oh captain Maynard had one lot of Marines down below weed and down below in the pearl it 'd been a crap alright fightin and there 's a big battle ensued and eventually Oh Blackbeard drew his last breath higher it be true they reckon he had four shots in him right four shots and a 20 cuts right before they got him once he was past trade they jumped his head off and stuck it on the marsh to scare other pirates and show off what they 've done the big black and they threw his body Oh Wesley and over the side in a wreckin right that they actually swarm around the bolt three times before it sunk so big and scary he was yo there 's two legends about email rain when you see unexplained lights at night right especially around the caribou and you see those unexplained lights you see around the place every now then right they call them teachers lives because teach that was his last name it was Edward Teach was his real name that Blackbeard he called all his friends that over and there 's two cows with it all right but I call him teachers lines and he 's 14th wife remember I told you he was a ladies man but I tell you was a ladies man I was gonna mention was a ladies man coming for actually said that right he had 14 wives that 's how much a lady man he was crazy man I 'd say you 14 wise but he 's last wife right he 's last remaining wife the ghost of her is dead to walk the cliffs in Portsmouth where he 'd left her there behind when he went off to the last bottle of journeys before he never returned into the battle just waiting for him to come back so that 's their that 's what religion he 's got all these stories about even all that stuff a legendary pirate blackbeard are not be he 's scoring now what else we gonna do right other people fall off good alright so one last thing we 're gonna cover a rate and I think actually first we need to get I wanna do back home give me it right yeah people complain surely that was a relief not to hear me sing my Dungy little shanties how are you here but no one we 've got another one all right another one no way and it 's to go with stand like a points down like a pylori and so it 's a short whole shanty member short halt Andy 's there the quick ones are eight quick ones cuz you pick it up a short job right some little job that we want to work out quickly remember the shanties there are working songs we work to them all right so as I do the chorus which is euro and a lot of the room Oh what about the Rome that 's our pulling bit there right the verse which is just two lines and then of course is just one line nice simpler one right and it 's quick so it 's just like we 're up for word as you see I 'm always rocking for honey I 'm on the ships that 's a Rockies or a stream so we go so well how through the first verse they get hang of it right so it 's like a pirate love for this guy y 'all_''_1135.28 hold on aroma so that simple remote so right now it 's all you 're ready we 'll begin array all right here we go stem I got pirate and laugh at the sky yo whole bottle of rum a fret so we 've also got an oversupply yo hole but no problem the danger and risk old pirate say are you we like to seal things we tend not to buy yo or the monitor problem we follow up prayer

    "text": "hi there and welcome to part 2 in our series react improve and prosper my name is David Coleman and for many years I 've been working with small to medium businesses to assist them to grow and thrive and so we decided to put together a number of small webinars to assist our small and medium businesses in the change that 's occurring currently as we move out of lockdown from the pandemic and back into a more normal style of environment and business and there 's been a lot of challenges and changes for everybody to be involved in and so you see we have a number of small webinars number two first one is a bit of an introduction but getting into how to make these changes and what we 're going to do today we 're going to focus on the customer which is fantastic and the changes that have occurred there and I 'll just share my presentation with you do now and we 'll get straight into it as we go so with react improve and prosper what would what has happened here Liz medium and large business but business has changed and coming back it 's going to be very different from how we actually conducted business three months even just as much as three months ago you 're going to have to have an understanding of where your customer is at what they 're doing what they change patterns are in it communicate that to your customer how you 've changed how you 've had to manage your business and how you now present to the customer and how you want your customer to actually perform interact with you so it 's a real change that we all have to communicate both ways as the business owner you 've got to take the lead here and let the customer know what has happened you have to actually then we 're going to look a little bit later how we actually create those changes so that when you 're coming back out of lockdown you 've got actually got that opportunity to create some income revenue immediately and then we 're also going to have a look at how we can improve grow laws have changed across the country we have to actually take it back down take advantage of these law changes in the best possible way things have occurred to make business different and that 's going to be different to offer you most of our businesses with food venues if we 're retail shops if we simply our office to office a business to business the way we are doing business will change and has changed with our staff with our customer with our suppliers and everything on the way through so we 're going to analyze we 're going to take action and we 're going to build a plan to succeed in the future so that 's what today 's about and we 're going to get into that and hopefully you find some interesting information that you can implement on act in your own business so there 's three parts to our to our plan that we 're going to look at as we go what 's happened we 've been in the react mode so that 's where we 've had to spend time pivoting to had to scramble to keep ahead of the changes depending and with the government changing the rules every day there through our March and early April as small businesses we will continually changing changing changing for some of us that meant taking our businesses from a full service business to a part-time business maybe to delivery service we have created online opportunities we have created a different way of communicating with our customer and of customer has created different ways of communicating with us because they may not be in the same place that they work when were servicing before so there 's been on a whole lot of different ways that we 've been managing to to build our business we 've turned to an upon rely on world as well and we 're going to look at that a little bit later very important in business in 20 for the next six months is to have an online presence and we 'll go into that with the lockdown restrictions being lifted and we 're starting to take action to get back and restart our businesses we 're going SS if we 're going to take this action to restart our business and then focus on what do you 've got to do to actually take that business and to restart your business yourself that 's very exciting here we go you finally go back into your shops finally get back into your offices in your industrial spaces wherever it may be and you can actually start having customers coming going and creating that it 's different it may be more limited than it was before but we start to look at some revenue we also got out people coming back we 've had a little people yesterday and we will have a look at people as we go forward then we 're going to have a look at our planning stage which we call our prosper stage and we need to look at planning and then implement those plans to win new business opportunities the big thing coming out of these lock downs is that there 's going to be new opportunities that may have not been there for you before you look at this you can redo business and this has been a very big inconvenience and you think is go back and run your successful business put a new that 's great but what we 're looking at also is for those businesses who want to grow those businesses who want to become more successful those particular businesses have got a real opportunity out there to take advantage of some of the disruption that 's out there for years we 've heard about disruption disrupting businesses that take advantage well here 's your chance maybe your competitor has some coming out of the box as well as you have maybe they haven 't been able to develop such a great service maybe this webinar will help you plan some of the ideas that you can just go out there and grab some extra market share so hopefully we can help you with that so as we times have changed small small medium business is the Australian economy the the majority of Australians are employed by small business and this is why we 've had been all been himself had an hour kana didn 't hit me manufacturing business hadn 't really been affected that much as they serve automotive but we are very much face to face small business you know with dealing people to people or small business to small business there 's been a huge affection with the change to abandon me this is what we 're running series of women end of weather and a stir just to give you some assistance around how you can react and improve the center for prosperity what you do now can really affect your ability to prosper in the future how you come back how you reopen your business how you perform in front of your customer your client your supply chain and in front of your competitors so how you actually work in come out of this area can really affect your you know your future business the one thing it will do is get in quite a great deal of flexibility before may not be in the future we 're gonna need your determination as you know small and medium business owners have the greatest determination that 's why you 're doing what you working for somebody else that 's going to require big do go back and get ya all that 42 than you 've had before and the other thing for small business we 're going to need your persistence it 's going to be a bit of a journey through recovery that we 're going to have to keep pushing and pushing so we 've created three phases that we can take action around as we come back online so we have the analyze phase and this is what we 're going to look at where your business is today and what what 's been happening with your business and how you 've had to react and pivot to the vendor mate we 're looking at the recommence base of what actions can you take right now in your business to start how can you turn your business on so I 'm really looking forward to to you know getting you out there and recommencing and getting your business up and running immediately and finally we 're going to add in their enhanced values and this is where we look at take advantage of the changes around you around your customers your customers change behaviour and we 're going to go into that and your surprise in the service partners so really really interesting about how you customer changes we 're going to look at why your business may need to pivot and change further depending on what your customer is up to and where they are as I mentioned we look at six phases in the business you 're going to client customer your cash flow your supplier and partners staff technology and business based today we are going to concentrate on the client customer so part two section one client customer we 're going to have a look at how we analyze recommence enhance client customer relationship so discovering your new customer the next section over the next few slides the next few minutes we 're going to run through how both your business expectations and your customers expectations may have changed over the past few months how this reflects on your business and how you can reconnect with your customers and what opportunities for your business are available because we have the customers and without required we don 't_''_631.199 so this is a really really important section to get into while we 're doing it first with in there before revenue we 're doing it before supply chain because we need to get the customer back on board we need to re-engage we need to find new customers and work with in the best way possible in in the current circumstances so where is your business today so the three tags that the three sections we 're going to look at over this sir over this new section where were analyzing our business is preventing other the changes that have occurred in your business we 're going to look at how also the changes that have occurred with into your customer and by that that might be they 're commuting changes there might be the fact that they 're actually still working back at home if you have physical customers that might be that they 've actually enjoyed becoming an online customer to somebody someone is now servicing what you were supplying in an online basis so we occurred with their customer and also how much this impacts your business in a positive or negative way and so we 're going to look at that over the next few slides first up and watching to make sure that you 've got some writing material and pad iPad whatever it might be for your plan because this is where we start we need to take notes we need to create a document to write down your analysis of the business so that you build your plan for success so even though you you 're in this you 've done this write down where you are we need us at the end and I 'm going to explain at the end why so what you look right down where you are now it 's all about where you are now where are you going to go how you 're going to get there but because of the pandemic we need something else on top of that as well so let 's create this document as we move through the next few slides write down what you 've got a got question do your customers understand the changes that have occurred to your business so how will you know your customer how do you understand their needs and once at this door we 're looking at who are your customers so how well do you know your customer and for you some of you in a retail business or through business you may see your same customer in fruit day so you have got to know them you may know their name you may know there are their order they may come in because you do their am sandwich exactly the way they want it with the coffee that they like for many of us also you know others in retail business we will know our customers regularly but it 's not every day and sometime in service business it might be less regularly again but we might have bigger orders or to deal with and we have many many more customers but where are our customers now as you have they have been impacted through this period of time through the lockdown so what has happened to their comeback if the same door are they taking the same canoe are they actually coming back if they 're a an office or business customer have they been in lockdown are they now working from home are there people working from home have a are they work in a different way your supply chain what is happening with that supply chain and how is that going how 's that for them and do they use their business able to service you as a supply truck so are you practically communicating with your with your clients and how are you going to communicate with your clients in the future so we 're going to look at do you have the ability to communicate with your clients right now also we 'll have much of taken mode and mode to go and have a look at your legal contracts in your contractual obligations especially with suppliers you 're dealing with suppliers and you feel that you as you reach that any talk your suppliers then they don 't have the ability to service you anymore their business their individual business may not be on levels may not be able to be lifted to the level that you need especially if you 're looking at growth then now may be the time to have a look at those you know contractual obligations INRI disgusting that 's a much ransom letter the idea now to reduce custom we 're all in a train we have customers you know you might be their customers or their supply train so it 's food good time to have a look at that as well questions do you understand the changes that have occurred to your customer I 'll just touched on that a minute ago what has happened to your customer what is their yeah they 've been in lockdown too so what has happened to that so it 's one thing for them to understand your business to know that you 've got social physical distance in happening to know that you built an online or a delivery service but what 's happened to your customer are they commuting to work do they come in if we look at the city right now less than 20 percent of work from home has been so popular with the big businesses in the city then people don 't want to come back they don 't want to spend the our committee they don 't want to spend the time away from their family they could walk downstairs they could walk into their office space ready so there 's been a whole push back around well maybe I don 't need to be there all the time now does that affect the person who creates the opportunity for them to get to the train station does that affect the person who serves them a coffee on the way out of a translation into their office and the people of certain bunch during the day in the shops that sell when the plows are assured during that particular day or maybe a suit once a week or once a month or whatever it may be it 's a whole roll up in that simply on that one person not going back to work today so what is your customer what is your time when an end a moment you need to start impact on their mind well it will if they 're not there he will if they 're also understanding it will have Devine that may be done but it will if they 're actually working less hours from this money so their their income may have changed therefore their abilities been made Church as I 've said as you walk by triage if you 're nearer how compared a travel you 'll notice it 's not as busy so what what in your business is needed maybe it 's one of your clients maybe you 're a design or a marketing company and one of your major climate no longer has to trade that 's going to affect your revenue you need to find out what your clients are doing so it 's really really important just talking recently to a panel meter that wasn 't crashed thank goodness but to a penetrator and through the pandemic shutdown period instead of doing 8 to 10 cars a day then we 're doing two or three a week and I thought well fair enough none of us were driving so people for longer term repairs but there was no major accidents there was nothing happening and so I thought well how is a parent we know who 's been affected from affect that the travel restrictions has put a business there and once again travel and that 's a whole new corner there or figure you 're servicing that particular part of the world that 's change completely so what changes will happen in the consumer behaviour and how do they affect your business and so write them down get them in because later we 're going to work out how to make take advantage of those consumer changes in our third bit of analysis question is what effect will this have on your business we just touched on that there has your customer behavior change and what can you do to meet their needs so we write down okay what am I going to do to change because like that if my customers change my potential revenue is under threat what other opportunities are there out there so as I said in runner beginning the way you have done your do our business in the future if you can enhance and prep both that 's fantastic but you may not be able to do that so we just need to be really assured around what we 're going to do and where do you find the new customers and is this online and if it is online how do you get online have you got a good online presence and if you don 't don 't worry but now is the time to start that if you don 't have a good online presence you need one the one thing we could have to learn from lockdown is online works for every business and if you 're the local food raw chopped you 're the marketing shop you 're the office wherever you may be your online presence needs to grow in your social presence needs to probe how your current staff capable of dealing with the multiple channels that may now be available enter service or sell to your customer or client so you 've got a look at your staff in the people you 're motivated people off there and what if how good is your staff are able to maybe transitioning into a multiple role rather than just having a single role that was successful for business before do you have the right people it 's time to look at that make sure that you have the team you need to head into the future so you analyze where your business is to that look any current premises is it satisfactory for the layout for the new customer with physical distancing is that a problem for you in that this knot is just not regional shops or service shops we can talk about office buildings we 're going to talk about office space and having enough space in those particular business businesses but then again if half your team is working on style is it is it okay I 've been talking to some businesses that are not going back to office space they 're going to be completely off space off-site in meet once a week in a hired space others are bringing people back in and having to get more space because they need more business and having a look at your current premises and the layout to make sure it works for you as well writing down now you may be in leases you may not be able to transient circumstances immediately but we 're talking about plans in our third section where we 're looking to enhance our business so this is where we bring this back so in our second section we 're discovering the recommend space this is where we are now we 're at a lockdown so what items what actions can you action straightaway what can you do we went look at the customer unique communication how are you connected with new customers are you online Facebook insta Twitter email from our letter box draw what is happening around that whatever that might be well what new business opportunities have been created for you today what is there in front of you that listening to breath and take hold of that you can do right now you can see and go and what other areas of business are available for you to satisfy your customers needs can you multitask chain one are there other people that they deal with is not there maybe it might be competitor who is not open is not really doesn 't have the ability to bring people back their stuff didn 't come back maybe they just closed and it got too hard link never came back so you could take that reply and add it to what you have so these are the opportunities that that can be ahead of us and we 'll have a look I come back to my pad we need to now look at this to continue to create our document but a completely fresh document so that we can know them in a bit later outlining the steps for your business to action now and this is the one we 're going to look at analyze action now this is when we make money today and we need to get back into revenue streams as fast as possible so are you are you connecting with your customers what sort of communication are you do you have electronic and social do you have a database of some form and keeping them informed about your business about how you 've managed to pivot with the restrictions when you 're ready to welcome them back yeah and then what sort of product lines you now have it might be more limited or what sort of product lines even added which means that your customer might come back and take that 's fantastic so you need to be communicating with your with them through a database if you don 't have a database it 's now time to start and you just do well as you go and we talk about that depending on what you do have a little competition or welcome back from a knock-down competition name name email address or phone number and somebody wins a welcome that competition and then you started your database and off you go the online versus physical customer how does it work how should your offerings differ between the online customer in the physical customer have you been able to change your model your business model over the rock down period two or more online so we have seen a food change of retail shops and lifts their online and most retail shops pretty good at online anyway but they 've actually taken that to a new level we 've seen service industries and nearly didn 't have to do online that much they had a nice pretty website but they pick up the phone or email people rather that 's happen to be online now where this big orders coming across fast things company yet the deliveries that are occurring the post office deliveries have quadrupled if not more over the particular period of time and they have you know said thousands and thousands of more articles being transported every day through through all being ordered online so how have you been involved in that and if not you need to create an online service you need to create a selling page you need to create an opportunity for people to find you online with your socials Facebook Twitter whatever it might be and start to become involved in this yeah it 's very it 's a great space yeah the other thing you build give your digital presence and build to look at is what is your customer capacity service for the physical space how many customers can you have in your business at any given point now to supply to enable you to have physical distancing and other peaks and troughs of activities so can you communicate to your customer when 's best for them to come in if you have a peak at half-past eight in the morning you might want to communicate with your customers at 10 o 'clock and twenty to nine Corner nine or ten to nine is a better time for them becoming without a servant quicker and they may change their ways to get your product quicker rather than having to wait outside down the line down the road whatever it may be the question for how many people you can put in your customer is also relevant for businesses whose customers don 't physically walk in for me it 's the newfound knowledge and skills that we 've developed over the shutdown period and allowed you to grow your service ability and your market share so what skills do you have that to be able to reach out and grow your customer base so each of us will chance to grow your customer base and manage when they come through your business so that your current people can manage that inquiry so here 's a chance for you to each time to grow your business see what are we writing down what actions you can take now to make sure that your customer knows you have capacity capacity to service them and capacity to service them you know their their connections and capacity for other product line as well really exciting okay Ari means you know your customer facing opportunities you can change up your customers strategy to match your change needs to gain market share so how do you redefine your customer strategy to take advantage of the shifting customer present preferences how can you sustain your business by shifting your approach in stages to meet the changing change expectation so I don 't want you to rush out and do everything today that 's why we 're taking notes but what can you do step by step the actions you safe get your product lines going restock your businesses get to start back sell a few products but what other steps can you then take as you move forward one other areas can you grow your business and what sort of period of time in a month I 'll be doing X in 3 months probably doing Y in 7 months I 'm doing as we grow our business back also we want to really look at now reconnecting with your old customers as I said your customers may have changed so let 's find out where they are let 's let them know that your back you 've got the ability to talk to them if not this getting a social Facebook help covers a lot of avenues where you can jump into Facebook and you get hold of you know your customers and build and once again if you don 't know much about this then get some of the into your to you who does or employ someone who does you find you know the consultants out there that people who are specialist in this area they business so let 's sit there and they 're not gonna charge you an absolute fortune to get up and running they 're building their businesses and rebuilding take advantage of the fact that they need to work as well so if you 're not sure how to do social posts go out and find somebody who does get them in your business get them going and let 's get your business out there really linking with your customer and introducing you to new customers it 's really really important write down now the actions you can take to get things done now now fantastic you look at on what the most promising marketing opportunities your business for your business and hey how you build an online build a customer trust with your back for your customers so over the last period of time your custom may have lost faith in in retail may may have lost faith in how to buy they may be really nervous about going back into into a an environment where they 're working and mixing with people so I want you to have a your loyalty most people want to be loyal with someone but if you 're not if you haven 't been there for the last six or eight or ten weeks these things change I can get it from Jimmy down the road or I can get it online or I can get it here I 'm gonna need to bridge back in and actually grab grab that and have a look at you know how do you build an online model maybe a hybrid or blended business model so we want to have a look at that as well and write down you know what you can do and what you can action to to move forward also once again have a look at you your service level agreements with your suppliers and your partners and see if there 's anything then in there that can give you an advantage over your competitors sit down talk to them get in first before in competitors have a chat about their business work out where they are the huge thing is we 've been disrupted disruption creates opportunity nothing can be taken to them let 's work together team thank you partners Thank You supply partners let 's work together take 8 I think this I need that can we do it this way can we do it that way what was doesn 't necessary have to be again okay enhance so what changes can you make to grow with touch from a few of those we 're going to look at our customer changes this is where we plan to take advantage of all the future opportunities as a regular customers return albeit with new needs and expectations that 's why we need to understand what they are we need to create a new areas of success for once we 've discovered what these new needs and expectations are we 're going to have to work our business into satisfying them and win their customer in their loyalty technology is going to be hugely important whether you use it now to sell and service for your customers and their clients or you use social platforms and websites to market and promote your goods and services if you don 't you need single business in the new future you can 't ignore the avenues regardless of your business from industry Palmer sighs so we 're going to have a look at that this is your opportunity this is your disruption opportunity to grow your business to grow your revenue to grow your market share to grow your profits once again take a document down write down separate shape looking Mary 's back later opportunities cut learning opportunities so you build your plan for success and here we go what are the long-term changes to your customer base how does this affect your revenue so how will your revenue model change based on the long-term changes to your customer nice what have you got to do to make that a positive change what 's worked and what needs to change so what are your industry relevant options that will be maintained or expanded upon so you 've worked but you need to change because your customers have changed in some way so what 's been great packaging and rocket move and then add to it what 's going you 're going to need needs what your business learn from these changes and take with it moving forward making sure you got the right people making sure you me how to enable your customer now how can you change and change every business to take advantage of these opportunities and its really young so many opportunities that I 'm seeing a fairly cost a lot of people is trying to come back to the old norm and not just cannot stress the old norm is going to be very difficult to to replicate there 's a new norm out there and it 's called opportunity this is we 've got a chance to really jump in if you 've been a new business and you weren 't sure how you can be there 's a huge opportunity you 've been in our business and you 've had all all the trade that 's vulnerable and now you need to better make sure that you reconnect with those particular customers so what are we going to do the next three six twelve months to make sure that you have a viable growing thriving business that what do your customers think of you should you ask them scary prospect a frightening prospect asking your customers and clients to critique you maybe you give them a survey Survey Monkey feedback on the telephone and ask them to trust yeah and no into if their physical customers into a feedback box but it can hurt they can also save your business and create opportunity I highly recommend that you build a little survey for your customer incline and see where they are today you might get some fantastic new ideas from them and some new revenue stream opportunities or some new products that you haven 't got in your business that you need to get in your business because they could grow there as well so here we go writing it down how do you reinvent your business to take advantage of the online worlds of one of the technology opportunities in the future a huge massive but how do you get to people it 's all very good to say out there there 's plenty so you want to be able to get out there how do world yeah change after you online or a hybrid of online how would you sell your products and what would you sell online what could you add to the online side and it is in any industry in any service that this occurs wedding once again whether you 're retail with your food were the only manufacturing whatever you might be yeah might be the guy said the guy he runs the panel burners he needs to look out line now he needs to look at smart because all of these people who suppliers the truck drivers that you know the toys the people who refer to know almost people have trained to be away that they doing things they might not be there anymore so everybody needs to look first engage experience I highly recommend it specialists in the area web developers social media experts bloggers database specialists and learn from them if your expert at your business finding learn from someone who 's expert at this business it 's a bit of a nightmare and a bit of a lot minefield but actually still too hard to learn up and running give them an opportunity to kick-start their business and do the deal with them for doing so you may be surprised just how affordable it is to have somebody work your social media for you and as I said how easy is to become more yourself cannot pay you enough to go into this so where are we for businesses to survive and improve that become successful and prosper we need to be ready for a number of different scenarios we need to create of different plans to ensure we 're ready for future changes we need to react to improve and have some versatility we need to plan the future waves of pandemic I 'd like to say this is done and dusted Australia we 've done extremely well but if we look past our borders Feb 19 is a problem out there in the world and we will not remain in you forever so how do you live what is your business look well even when the next rock barrel comes down or partial lockdown or some of your business suppliers or customers get ill planning what is Plan B what is Plan C and this is where I want you to deal with your notes this is where you come back and how you analyze your business of what happened in that first time what did you react to next time we 're not going to react we 're going to be proactive oh dear it 's lockdown day oh here we go weary we 're proactively putting in plan 1 this is what we 've got to do to our business this is where we are this is how we communicate with our customers this is how we flip online this is how we tell our customers this is how we continue to sell whatever that may be yeah part 2 there 's a partial lockdown people are sick whatever it may be in your business you know these particular one avenues can be written down until you just pull out that plan and away you go take the time now this may not happen the next three six months best likely it 's likely to happen in the next 12 months absolutely again plan for your customer changes we 've been on that today has been about the customer how they 're looking different how you 're looking different what 's been happening so really is fantastic time to have those plans all ready to go and and react to improve the next three six and twelve months so really really important to do that so as I said before you know how your business handles its return through the improvement phase will return will determine your future business so how you handle it will actually determine how you manage your business in the future and how will you go with your customer your performance your reputation we defined your customers your staff your suppliers and your competitors we 'll be watching to see how you do they 'll be watching to see how you pivoted they 'll be watching to see how you improve that we want you to see how you prosper so let 's look at those three phrases and create a blueprint for success for you to return for greater revenue and greater profitability so today I said that to plan we 've focused on the customer as I mentioned earlier we 've got six parts to focus on over the next few weeks we 'll be bringing this little webinars to you a chance to you to analyze to reflect to risk that to revitalize each one of your streamlines and end communications of each area that we 're going to look at so I 'm really excited that today the customer is so important it custom it is whether new revenue major business is going but the disruption to the world allows us to take the opportunity to really get out there and and try to bring some more business so as I said I 've been David Coleman I really appreciate your time today I hope it 's been some takeaways for you through our customer focus webinar today we 'll come

    "text": "hi there my name is david coleman for many years i 've been working with small to medium-sized businesses helping them to prosper grow and thrive the recent uh lockdowns from the covet 19 pandemic has made it very difficult for many many businesses across all facets of business no matter what avenue they may be in whether it be retail food service industry or wherever you may be it has been extraordinarily difficult and hard hit for small to medium businesses so what we 've done today is we 've set up a series of webinars that we 're going to present to you over the next few weeks to help you to readjust to the new normal to how you 're going to have to get your business back up and running we 're going to look at what we 've been doing how we 've been reacting to the changes that have been thrown at us we 're going to look at how we 're going to improve our businesses and get our businesses back running to the best possible speed that they can go right now businesses can prosper how you can revitalize your businesses how you can prosper how you can take advantage of the opportunities that will be in front of you and there will be new opportunities things have changed and we 're going to run through today we 're going to run through an explanation of how the rest of the webinar series is going to work a bit of an introduction and so what we 're going to do is we 're going to focus on certain areas of your business and go through those today in certain areas of your business where we 're going to drive depth around how we 're going to get that particular style of your business back in action and how we 're going to look for opportunity in that particular business to actually actually prosper and move forward so that 's the whole idea of the webinar series that we 've got running over the next few weeks as i said so i 'm going to uh run into a presentation for you for running the chair for you right now okay so as small and medium-sized businesses things are different from only the way we 're running our business three months ago simply three months ago to now things have changed the customers have changed their buying patterns and their travelling patterns the laws and rules have changed there 's legal ramifications to what we 're doing when we 're dealing with people today we will look at how we 're going to analyze take action and plan to get ourselves around and work out where we are today work out what we 've got to do to get ourselves back up and running and plan actions for the future for the next three six and 12 months of how we 're going to successfully create a viable and a viable business that we can take advantage of the opportunities that will be with us as we see so we 're looking at going to take advantage of how things will be done differently over the next you know three six twelve months maybe forever so our three actions that we 're going to look at is how we 're reacting to what and let me help you to build plans to prosper and revitalize your businesses into the future so first up react we 've had to pivot our businesses to the to balance and and get ourselves in ready for the uh for the downturn and and the restrictions that have been put on us by government it 's been a very difficult time for many small to medium businesses where we 've had to spend time in this reaction mode we 've had to scramble to keep ahead of all the changes that have arrived with the pandemic it 's been a very difficult time many of you have to change your business models some of you have gone online which is terrific and develop that service a little bit further some of you have managed to go to a takeaway and delivery style service some of you unfortunately have had to close completely or for a period of time and most of us have impacted our incomes our staff the people that help us work our suppliers and our the people that we deal with on an everyday basis who we help to run their businesses all these connections have been broken and so we need to have a look at how we have reacted to that and move forward into how we can improve and take action to restart those connections restart our business find out as with the lockdown restrictions being lifted work out and take action to get going again and improve our current situation so we 're going to look at each of those avenues where we are how we 're going to take action which actually will suit your particular business we 'll look at some depth around your staffing around your supply chain around your support chain and all the areas that you can actually take immediate action to get going what can you do now to improve the business that we had through the lock down time it might be that you can now sit people in your business your people your your staff members may be able to come back to work you know in some fashion even if it is limited your customers may be able to come into your and then we 'll have a look at how this has affected your people and how this has affected your income and what we 've got to do to get back to a revenue stream that is acceptable and a profit level that is acceptable and what we 've got to do to take advantage so this is this section will be simply let 's get going we 'll then be looking at our prosper section and this is where we 're going to build some plans i 'm really looking forward to this part because getting going will be one thing picking up the pieces and just starting your engines again and absolutely building your businesses to make sure that they work will be something but what is going to happen in the future what is the next 3 6 9 12 15 24 months going to look like for you how are you going to take advantage of the opportunities and there will be opportunities so we 're going to look at your people and how they can react how can you get better i suppose benefit from do you don 't do not need anymore in your business to streamline where you are we 're going to look at the online side if you 've been or had to develop your online this side of your business is probably not going to go away and could become a really serious part of your business if you 're in the delivery section you might have built a delivery section to your business or this delivery online section we 're going to enhance this we 're going to look at how we can marry that new income stream into your current income stream we 're going to dive into your customer where is your customer who is your customer what have they been doing have they changed their buying patterns have they changed their traveling patterns are they your customer anymore have you got an opportunity to pick up other people 's customers so we 're going to drive some depth around those particular subjects and how we 're going to prosper in our business where you can take advantage of the opportunities that will be out there be so we 're going to have a look at some of those ideas get you to do some work on your business and see if we can drive depth in your business to get you going into the future and make it better than it is today so times have changed and we 're looking at you know small business small business is the australian economy and your work your small to medium business out there is the lifeblood to the australian economy and this is really why we 're running this series of webinars because the small business has been impacted so heavily in this pandemic all business has been small business in particular shopping centres are shut down where people go we 're closed holiday and travel destinations are no longer there for us the people that we deal with on a small business that you go through in your local strip area or your local shopping area or your local business each and every one of those businesses have had extraordinarily big restrictions put around them as you have personally as well so we 're going to are necessary to assist you to improve and prosper yeah we 're going to work out what you can do now so i 'm going to work out what you can do now to affect your business and your ability to prosper in the future now 's the time for our small businesses to not only react and improve but also to set up for success whilst things are still moving in that direction it 's now time to change your business model especially if you 're an established business and you 've been doing okay well now is an opportunity to have a look at whether you 're going to be doing it okay it 's the same customer base there and also what else can you do what other revenue stream and avenues can you run down and what else can happen to make you actually um yeah business your better than it was before uh this however is going to require uh required uh extraordinary flexibility on your behalf and on your business and your staff you 're going to have to have some very strong determination the change because when you first change things they don 't work people tend to give them away but i think in this particular world in the times that have changed we need to have some continued persistence around what we 're doing with the ideas that we put in place because we know they will work the general public want to support us they want to support small business however we must make sure that we are a business they actually need and want and in the process we can 't be hoping that they come we have to attract them so we 're going to have a look at a whole lot of different areas where that may be online offline social remarketing and along those particular lines well also though this is where we look into the recommence phase so how we recommend so we 're going to analyze where your business is at today and it will go through the way you can analyze the recommence phase and what we 're going to do to enhance it so we 're going to work out where we get back to work in an operation now right now and then we 're going to look at our plans on creating a more successful business into the future we 're going to analyze where your business is at what has been successful um what hasn 't been successful what can we improve upon and how your business has been impacted and it 's really important to understand where you 're at and what has happened so that you can build and go down the right path of what could happen in into the future what items can you action right now to get your business up and running if we 're going to enhance your business what changes can make you grow how do you take advantage of the changes that are around you and your customers and their change behaviours what are your suppliers and how are they being impacted and what are their change behaviours do they have a change supply chain are they a better or a poorer supplier than they were in the past can you renegotiate your partnership with them not just financially but another more heavily in this time where we all need to have an enhanced business and a growing business and a um a prosperous business your service partners as well yeah the people that we you know we we work with who both service the end client and the customer and this is for people in a service industry who have clients so there 's there 's clients who have may have changed needs their businesses and what they 're doing may suffer so if you some of your clients are business to business style clients then those particular business we need to have an understanding of how they 're going and work our business and change our business model and really study our business model to see if it can affect and move to where their business models of needs are because if another business comes in that has been a client of yours for many years that they come in see new opportunities and pivot and change their business away you may lose that customer so just assuming when we recommence our business that everything 's going to are going to walk through your physical location your same clients are going to be running their businesses the same so that you then just pick their business back up then i think we need to re-look at that things have changed your business has changed your circumstances have changed your staffing has changed your supply management has changed your clients have probably changed in their supply in their service in their clients and their staff and so being small to medium business when people change into business so do ideas and when ideas change possibly business direction can change as well so we really need to have a look at these investigations we need to reach out to both of our customers and our clients and our service partners and our suppliers and find out what 's happening in their business they will be thrilled to pick up and hear their phone hear a phone call from you they 'll be fantastic for you to reach out to them and they 'll again take a sense of where their business is so we 're going to go in and that as well at the end of this webinar and also through the series of webinars that we have coming so to give you some great ideas how to work with each section and partners into the future to enhance your business to revitalize your business and to give you the opportunity to grow your business okay so as i said we 're going to look at uh business improvement and let 's get going we 've come back ahead and locked down the restrictions of being relaxed there still are legal restrictions running around but they have been relaxed and there 's less and less restrictions on us now although we have to stay very careful we have to keep our customers safe we have to keep our staff safe we have to keep our supply chains in tech in check so first our first action is to understand where our current business is where are we now so we had to develop plans around where are we what have we done what are we doing well what have can be improved upon so look at those things where well and what can be improved upon so if you 've pivoted your business to an offline to a service to a delivery to managing uh your customer in another way and you 've done that fairly well let 's develop that so we do that really well simply because you push open your doors doesn 't mean that that needs to go away anymore you may be able to enhance your income stream enhance your revenue enhance your profit and also enhance your customers relationship with you or your clients relationship with you so that you have a better stronger style of client and that could include marketing whether that be local area marketing online marketing social marketing what sort of social tools are you doing how is that working for your particular business and it will change depending on who you are what you 're doing whether your retail whether your service whether your food whatever it might be industry whatever it might be in your area what works for you so we 'll be having a look at that yesterday what you can improve upon we 're really important how we manage our staff and their return back to our businesses many many there 's been so many staff changes those businesses that shut down many many staff have either been stood down or made redundant or terminated for those businesses that that had to close completely and there 's been some really harsh and horrible things that have had to happen for people and we know that people are out there have struggled and we 've had some great government support around job seeker and job keeper bonuses for bass and ability for small business to take loans and deferrals on payments so there 's been a lot of help in certain ways from the government to help everybody and to help small business but as people come back and as the reality of getting back to work as the reality of commuting very interesting at the moment a lot of people are hesitant to come back whether they 're fearful about being in close proximity with other people a number of people who are on reduced hours or reduced income or both are hesitant to of commute many people have been especially office based people have been really happy being at home no commuting hours in their own environment really happy to be working along the zoo meetings or whatever it may be and they 're really reluctant to come back into the environment of the of the office building and we 're going to have to build plans around that because if your business actually relies on your teams to come together and collaborate and share ideas and work together to service your clients and to to service your customers then you need the people to be coming in and to be coming in on the timing that you need to be coming on so i 've heard some different things that people wanted to work really odd hours now that they 're used to this which works for them but you have to see where that works for your business in the retail sense you need to bring people back as well working on their hours working on their safety making sure that you have the ability for physical or social distancing making your staff is safe and bringing them back in we 're going to have a look that when you 've a lot of people always stood down or put on short hours you know you want to see them talking to you and they 're coming back but you need to develop relationships with them many people are in an underlying a little dissatisfied they could say well you know you didn 't really treat me that well even though you were forced to treat me the way you did i don 't feel like i 've been treated that well i 'll come back but i 'm going to find something better so if you don 't want this huge level of staff turnover we need to work out how our staff is this might be involved in having conversation with them understanding where they 're at so we 're going to really go into some great depth around how that works and what we 're going to do around our staff and there 's a whole section on people and we 're going to work out how to they 're sitting and find out what they 're thinking in response to your business really look forward to that so important in all that business this whole lockdown series has been about people in the end our businesses are shut and the people are dispersed we 're dispersed we 're locked down so it 's very very interesting the other thing we 're going to study is your competition how have they gone i 'm sure they 're the same as you but who comes back better really important yeah how do you get back how do you revitalize how do you prosper what are your plans are their customers up for grabs are their clients up for grabs if they don 't pivot change and support quick enough can you fill that gap and so we 're going to have a look at that this is competition this is how you grow your businesses in the adversity of others and this is the way small business and medium business works you 'll quickly maneuver pivot change take advantage but you need to know where you 're going for base so you 're nice and secure so i 'm really keen to have a look at that a little bit further as well because there 's some great opportunities for you um as well so through this section we 're going to gain an understanding of exactly where you are today what you 've got to do so where you are where your business is what 's going well how your staff are how they 're feeling and look at those ideas so that 's you 're going to drive some debt and start thinking about that as we get into the next webinars then when we come back and we look at how do you restart your current business what have you got to do there 's been new laws and rules changed there 's been new said with the social distancing or the physical distancing laws how many people you can have limited numbers of people within a business depending on the business at a certain time and keeping records of people who are coming through your business in some areas whatever it may be what have 's a physical opening what processes need to be put in place hopefully you 've already done those and that you 're across that and that you 're up and running because we started with the lockdown um restrictions being eased but you must be aware of them the whole time so we 're going to go into some of those and we want you to go and check and see what what specifically um specifically is is responsible you have to be responsible for so in your business and make sure that you 've got those covered up because it 's very very important that we do everything on the legal basis through this period where we come out of lockdown because people will be looking government will be looking and making sure that we 're doing things correctly so yeah what steps and actions do you need to take to get going i also want to have a look at and we 're going to have a look at and develop what you can sell online so you 've got your physical sales in your door and then team working with your customers in service industries but what about your online team what about your team understanding how to offer those services online we 've all been remote but those people in business offices have been remote for all this period of time for those pieces of people in retail it 's been more difficult so you can look at the retail physical side and industry physical side of bringing people back but with your service industry you want to have a look at how we 're going in a online or remote style offering how did that work for you what could be enhanced this type of zoom education meeting planning you know the time that can be taken out of travel for customers all of these type of things that can help what you can sell what you can do how to put together you know presentations so you can shoot those presentations down line follow them up with meetings like this and then you know how do you improve your current working style what you did before was probably good what you do in the some time whilst we come out of this working with you to actually get you to identify areas of business that will keep you in action so we 're going to look at all of that as i 've mentioned before we 're going to look at our staffing our stock our customers our supply chain our clients as you restart your business all these things need to be brought back on if you 've been shut you have to restock does your customer come back where are they how do you market to them how do you let them know what do you do to communicate to them so it 's really this sections are understanding the immediate actions you have to take to get going and start turning a revenue dollar so really really very important section and our final section that we 're going to be looking at is how to prosper and revitalize so the third action to revitalize our business we 're going to look at the new opportunities that are out there and what have been you know what new opportunities have been revealed 've managed as i said how you 've managed your workforce and what you can you action and implement new plans around that workforce around staffing so as i 've mentioned before there might be huge opportunities for your people to do the same role in a different way or a different role in a different way into the future to streamline and make each person more valuable and to add more services and add more products or more style or revenue avenues to your business so it 's a really exciting time that we can have a look at all of that once again you know actually sit down plan to build and grow your online offering whether this be through your social media through your website through your customer through uh interactions through video and zoom whatever it may be we 're going to look at how you 're going to to to successfully implement the remote style working um also we 're going to have a look at where your business is sitting currently and how it was impacted with covert and how your reputation was impacted your customer and to your client and find out what they think of you so it 's a really scary prospect we 're going to get you to build some queries and questions back to your customers and your clients to find out how they 're perceiving you in the new normal what do you look like in their eyes i see we 're going to reach out and try and find out what our customers and our clients our supply chain and our operators and our business partners out there how their businesses are going but we also want to see what they think of us in case we need to change how we are change the way that we deal with our customer change our product supply change our service avenues change the way we do things to suit their business so we need to understand how they are perceiving us if they 're perceiving us as the way we were and we haven 't moved pivoted and changed to the new normal then they may bypass us and go somewhere else so here 's your opportunity to an opportunity to plan to get future business so it 's um a real opportunity here to discover how your business is going and forecast to take advantage of the new businesses the new opportunities have been developed through covert and there are plenty so as i said you before we 're going to drive down into six different areas of your business we 're going to drive depth around your client and customer we 're going to look at your cash flow and we all know my goodness it 's been terrible we 've had some great government support but we still know you know to qualify for most of the government support means that your business turnover has dropped considerably so when that government support stops and when the uh lockdowns reduce how do you pick that money back up how do you put that revenue back up so we 're going to spend time in that i mean once again many times i 've mentioned it already supplies partners clients customers all those particular areas how we 're going to work with those particular people as well going to another webinar will be all about staff where they are what they 're doing how we 're going to bring them back some ideas around keeping your staff getting the right staff finding the best stuff we 're going to look at the technology and that 's just not how good is your website we 're going to look at the whole how to do this what to do with your social how to do your marketing where you should be marketing we won 't be showing you what to do but i 'll be talking about generally where you should be and how you should be presenting yourself in which avenues you should be presenting yourself what you 've been doing what you can do in the future and how you build a new revenue stream and keep that going from whatever business you are and even if you 're good

    "text": "morning my name is miss Cassie and today it 's storytime we 're going to do the story of the gingerbread man and I 'm going to tell the story and when I tell the story I want you to follow me and do some of the actions with me all right so it starts like this once upon a time there was an old woman and an old man and they lived together in a little old house but they were sad and the reason why they was sad is because they had no children so the old woman decided one day I 'm going to make a gingerbread boy so she went into the kitchen she got the bowl put your bowl out in front of you she put in the butter she cracked in the egg she poured in the milk she stirred it around she shook in the flour and the ginger and she stood and stood and stood and then she rolled the dough roll roll roll out onto the board and she cut the shape of the gingerbread boy so she cut the head the legs she put in two eyes and three currants on his belly and then she put the gingerbread into the oven and waited soon there was this lovely smell mmm the little old man what 's that cooking and the little old woman said it 's the gingerbread boy she pulled out of the oven and out popped the gingerbread man the little old man in the little old woman was so happy they now had a little gingerbread boy it 's calling the ginger the gingerbread man jumped out of the oven and said oh I can run really fast I can run away from you and the little old woman then the little old man said no no don 't run away from us but the little gingerbread boy ran ran ran ran ran ran ran ran ran and as he ran he sang this rhyme can you do it with me run run as fast as you can you can 't catch me I 'm the gingerbread man and the gingerbread man ran to the paddock where he saw a cow mmm said the cow you can 't_''_185.29 eat me I 've just run away from the old woman and the old man and I can run away from you too and up here n run run run and as he ran he sang run run as fast as you can you can 't catch me I 'm the gingerbread man and he came across a pea we 're quite quite quite said the people youths know good enough to eat and the gingerbread man says me I just run away from the cow and the old man and the old woman and I can run away from you too and off you 're in and as he ran he 's saying he 's run run run as fast as you can you can 't catch me I 'm the gingerbread man and then he came across some farmers in a field the farmers were very hungry because it was lunchtime and they said hmm something smells yummy what 's that and the gingerbread listed gingerbread men hmm gingerbread man you smell good enough to it and the gingerbread man says you 're not gonna eat the cow and the old man and the old woman and I can run away from you too and off he ran and as he ran he sang the wrong run one let 's toss SteriPEN you can 't catch me I 'm the gingerbread man and then he ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and Rena Rena Rena until he came to a river the gingerbread man needed to cross the river but he couldn 't swim and gingerbread men do not get in the water they do not like to get wet a little Fox came along and saw the gingerbread man and said hmm I can help you oh really I went across that river but I can 't swim said the gingerbread man Oh said the Fox why don 't you just hop onto my tail and I 'll swim across the river so the little gingerbread man hopped onto the fox 's tail and they swim and they swim and the gingerbread man says I 'm getting wet so the Fox said why don 't you hop onto my back so the _''_356.48 they swim and nice one and the gingerbread man says oh I 'm getting wet so the Fox said well why don 't you hop on to my ears and the gingerbread man balanced on the fox 's he is and the Fox swim and swim and the gingerbread man says I 'm still getting wet so the box said why don 't you hop on to my nose so the gingerbread man balanced very carefully on the nose of the Fox and the Fox being a very Sly Fox tossed his head into the air and the gingerbread man did a big somersault up into the air and I was the gingerbread man came down the Fox opened his mouth wide and gobbled up the gingerbread man and that was the end of the gingerbread man did you like that story the Fox was very clever the poor gingerbread man was eaten now I think we should play a little game called what 's missing look at all the characters in the gingerbread man 's story I want you to remember the cow the pig the farmers the Fox 're going to close our eyes and I 'm going to make one of them disappear it 's going to go missing all right so close your eyes put both hands over your eyes don 't look something is going to go missing don 't look don 't open your eyes until I say all right okay open your eyes now what 's missing from the story there 's a big space here what was there did you say the cow if you said the cow well done very clever good remembering let 's try another one close your eyes both hands over your eyes no looking all right hmm right open your eyes what 's missing I think there 's something missing from there what was that did you say it 's the box if you did very good remembering one more I 'll try and make this a tricky one close your eyes no looking don 't look okay open your eyes what 's missing did you say the old woman if you did very good you 've got all three parts of our missing story so that for listening to the story of the gingerbread man and thank you for playing a part in our special preschool storytime today goodbye _"

    "text": "welcome our we 're here again for wrestle lesson number eight eight Elia and he does a favorite number of us pirates you know why why is it a favorite because a is an important Potter pieces away which is that treasure enjoy look at the had treasure pieces of eight lots of pieces of eight there that 'd be the old treasure and it 'd be pieces of eight and we 're in lesson agree all right you know you poured and you started you know your bow and you 're after right you know those things so next it was where do you point the bow to get to somewhere you know back in the day yeah I might have been to this before right we didn 't have GPS you know we 'd know that voice screech now you 're going the wrong way you know you got in your car that oh no no no no we endured you know like come on we 're like so we had different we don 't you know wait three basic ways we 'd use for navigation right there right there 's our three main ways we still find our way about a place so what I 'm gonna do is give you a bit of a brief overview of what Eagles is right it 's all right now Pilon alright Pilon well that 's basically no one where you going in the first place right you know we are you know the sewing 's around the place right you know what cowboy you are by weight you different head lands and different markings in the sea like these boys and stuff like that around the city so we 're get out right one of the ways one of the big tools for that okay was me bring closer hey bring narrow we all the old Britain era alright until people call those telescopes but there 's the old bring nearer right so what you did you say no pictures of a pirate see me there maybe look at out that way I still do it that way I can actually talk to you and late see you there like that without sort of it vision any more than be looking for so units all right the difference they you know either they 'll have no shaped and all that I need build over there going that knew his way around would know his way around the place and he work it all out from that you know from the different soybeans and those little signs be marked on maps and stuff that 's see if you track of it right these things would make it all look closer right that 's what I call a bring em here I mean they all bring up me you 're pretty handy little device to have the opening at Mia and like if you couldn 't see land the other thing you could do is actually if you 're close enough to and you can actually track clouds and birds right you see the birds we find or die and at different times of the day and you know what time that was and it clouds like clouds right in the morning clouds there over the land you check that out yourself you know you right in the morning they 're 't they go out to sea alright sateen till which way the clouds are going that 'll tell you which way the land is right depending on what time the day is all right that 's something else we know when you boil it any way around and you know we had things like called trade rooms so the boats when they will traveling around what follow set rules and there 's all people that know the way along that set trade route right and being pirates we are mostly just pickin up other ships right so we want to shoot super travel on the train so we 'd hang around the trade routes and we take him down soon you know piloting was pretty much L mean you know think occasionally you 'd go out further in it you 'd use a thing called dead reckoning right dead reckoning he 's gonna work it out where you going with some gold dead reckoning okay now for that you need to know wave Stoddard alright cuz that 's the main part the magic of an if you go from point know where point a is cuz if you know where you is you can work out where you are going to and how to get there okay so you 'd have to know the direction you were sailing in right the speed and for how long you been doing it and you record all that and you can work it out any map and draw it up right so how do you tell the direction well you something called compass right there 's my little hand compost right nice little brassy number there right that okay and you can see that if you look down there at the property you can see there the dark handle that way right that always points north all right so that 's pointing north at the more and okay and if I look down it there right that I can look down and I 'm if I 'm facing forward basically I 'm hidden east there you see the east and you know I had exact degrees it 's got little degrees around the soil you can work it out and now told shows the degrees out conferences on a ship right we had a trouble ship chocolates meet up this one you see this sorry that that 's it we having a box to protect it and a sitting on thing called gimbal right a gimbal allows it to rock around so it actually stays straight and the thing rocks underneath it right so the exactly staying straight all the time for that round so that way you getting a steady read because if you try to look at a compass and it 's moving around and it 's gonna jiggle about like minded they like that if I move around jiggles right can you see that jiggling about so you don 't get an accurate read yeah but a new box they 're protected and sit in a gimbal you sit that on the on your table and you can make a reading and you can see which way you 're going so that 's good now after you know where the direction you gotta know the speed of the boat now how do you work out the speed of the boat right a log line now look Lloyd alright cuz you 're at the book the log log book great well this is all connected to it there 's a lot of line and look something like that one all right that 's what is it so just a big law you know only think it turns around when you 're all lit right and you 've got a big thing of wood at the end but right there 's tied to and you go to the back of your ship right daddy toss it over okay then you got an hourglass that 's what that is there an hourglass you mix that out right about now guys right it measures 30 seconds okay so what you do you 've got it on with the back of the ship right off the bow the RF gamete sorry they are after the ship they 're sometimes called the Stern Stern western face comes from two because this kind of ships always like that sort of shape when you look at the back of the old sailing ships round shape so that 's 's called a stern you 'll see yourself right so what happens the wooden bed tied to the rope gets tossed over the back then they let go of it for the thirty seconds at a time out the sands it goes through and it takes 30 seconds for all the sands to go down and as they did that right they 'd let the Rope would get pulled out and they get pulled out and the Sailor right it was doing the job of doing it the Rope would have knots in it like that it 's here those knots right so they say already having its fingers on the map and it filled an optin and Calibre 's go through the one two three okay they 're not so cold right that through his hands they were just counted out how many will go up through his hands in 30 seconds right so that would have it and that 's how many knots they were traveling right speed at sea is measured by knots and that 's because I used to actually have not tied into the rope try to trick you right we call things when they are you know so that 's what was knots because we used to count lost we measure the speed okay and these knots these are closer together than what they were they were in the old measurements right they were measured at 47 feet and three inches apart and that would give you a nobody called Mario okay a nautical mile which they call not all right so that 's how that works and you would do that what you would do is you can work out your speed from a hat okay so you know you would travel at 20 knots for in an easterly direction and then you would work out for how long for the last half hour you travel that far and you put it in your little have a little chart so write that with it 's all measured down and you work out how far that is and then you get your map and you 'd mentioned between the two points and you 'd know you 've traveled to about there right and that east the weeks on the map put Bob and you work it out on the lines of the map okay here you go you see this map right so you 'd measure it up so he was heading east that 'll be that way so if I was going that way we just measured up and you 'd line up you say that 's right I 'm about there right very now then you 'd have to check exactly where you were and for that clever blighters that he 'll work it all out and then make these lines of the map you see they 're having bath mats cut lines on it right there called longitude and latitude right so the whole earth is being gridded up not really you 'll really see them right but they greeted him up with a longitudinal attitude they did that very early on ER are you working at all outlets stars and everything like that okay so latitude and longitude how do you tell which is which well the latitude is easy right they are the ones that go up step up remember latitude it 's not spelt like that but it it is like that latitude you call him up the latitude all right and longitude are the ones that go around the other way I go I want to go up and down like that so the latitudes are the cross ones the Lord choose the one bookie go up and down between the poles that 's how you go so how do you work out what letter to do i all right well you do that by using the North Star well we in the North Box is a North Star in the south you would use the Southern Cross but that 's a bit more complicated right you know the Southern Cross we call it the crux right the Southern Cross right you know how its four stars or five stars in fact me a map right can you easy only got four and it 's got like there 's a three close together all right and there 's one further away a long run away like that all right sort of like that if you look at you do is actually go from that one through the middle of those two to that one the long wonderful way and that 's pointing due south right let me use some other stars called the pointers that you work at exactly where the South Pole is right good again that 's more complicated so we just stick it to the North Star is that the one to start and what you do is you can get a read right from that don 't start that how high it is off the horizon to what in degrees you know where you are latitude boys okay all right so that 's it and you can also do it off the Sun you wager how high this Sun is because that 's what it all is this celestial navigation the slice tool beam bodies in the sky like stars in the Sun all right so you do it like that it 's at nothing the North Star so what you do is use a sextant right see the sextant that 's us exit their complicated fitted kit that right you look through capture the Lloyd of it and he line up the star with the Roizen inside the six then right and that gives you a reading in degrees how high it is so if it 's 45 degrees above that till is your right that 's 45 degrees but what happens is the stars they move like the Sun all right okay so you 're still going to do a few more calculations right and some globe people have done a lot of these calculations for you super books to refer to so you can put that figure in but you got to know what your real time in it 's okay what time it is now I need it and how do you know what time it is well you want to know what time it is do you know sorry that 's your long that you are good at it but what so that gives you that talk using latitude you put that in there and you got the chart so you know what day it is and you look at the charts at and that 'll tell you from the North Pole by how many degrees and where you are when you compare them all together right so the longitude for the longitude that 's a bit more tricky right so with that what we do is we have clocks on board really accurate clocks right will keep their box on the gimbal to to keep it from rocking around and shaking them up their things but it 's really important they see the right time so from your whole port which is granny tray we do it from Greenwich you set that up so it 's always running on Greenwich Time all right okay then at midday midday where you are right you take your Sexton okay how do you know what it 's a big day well you take you Sexton right and when it 's the Sun is exactly 90 degrees up all right 90 degrees from that horizon okay because you measure the Sun for the Roizen as well as the star is because Sony 's the star so you do the same thing when it 's 90 degrees up that 's new and Sun read at noon right and what you do is you look at you call right and you tell the time in great okay so if at noon where we are okay it knew where we are if that is three o 'clock greenwich time to time on your clock all right that means you 're at 44 degrees how do I know that well luckily this all happens evenly right so every 15 degrees is an hour that 's how they wear all the time sells out so it all fits together makes it easier things out so every 50 degrees it happened 15 degrees areare you buzzed right so there it is so if it 's noon here three o 'clock at Greenwich that 's three hours three times 15 that 's 45 so you put the 45 the other chart and then you 've got your latitude so you 'll add a to D along which was cross that you see on the map write that all right and you work out where they are and that tells you where you are in the scene right that the Southern Cross and all the gimbals and all that sort of stuff so you got a bit of an idea of how you never get it around finally long that you in level two now you work it out remember the pearls we talked about the cross and all that sort of stuff all right that gives you a bit of idea of how you 'd find your way in the sea I think I 've covered just about everything I was going to occur hours here and all that kind of stuff so I think it 's time I 'm gonna share another little ditty with you right just another little ditty you 're eating this one was written baby you 'll meet your old Shandy singer captain Patrick old Campbell used to love to sing this one all right oh oh used to love to sing this for all their time this one 's a bit of a vanity basic is a bit about me as well but I seem I can manage it too but this is again it 's a foxhole one there 's one good one to work and that if you 're working on look at something in or just so you two sweep on the deck or doing some my daddy 's car that 's on a roll and thing to it like that but irides of sons colcannon silly this one so give it a go see what works maybe you go blow my whistle here you can edit it out later but oh you know we 'll see how we go all right here we go here we go I 'm just gonna sing this one because it 's you can join in

and they should be supported because they certainly haven 't been initiatives from the federal government anyway I 'll be playing a bunch of songs from each of those bands and from my own you enjoy them and hopefully longline shenanigans for Calabria Mexico can continue even without all allowed to get back to the pub which quite frankly I 'm walking to quite a bit [Music] I sleep [Music] I believe I believe it she said she said [Music] you know [Music] you [Music] I [Music] [Music] you [Music] Thanks so that song was play that with the too easy band as to I do this one that one was called you 'll know probably self-evident this song was called tell me the details like this mother maybe he 's just up for the weekend maybe he 's a friend of mine tell me the details [Music] tell me the detail never picked you for rabida I never put you in your bed you can tell me the detail [Music] so ever love me to captain tell me the date [Music] there you go so this song might play a song about the dead rates it 's not a reference to actual military personnel it 's actually a euphemism for empty bottles of wine so many dead Marines having done their duty they would gladly do it again which I assume means you can refill them and reuse them you know that 's the story of that band and this is on our first album which came in 2005 which is actually a very long time ago we 've actually just finished recording a new one anyway this song 's called planting my secrets [Music] I think I laughed myself designate boy where did it fall in the sea he did beat badly she set myself on fire handsome is a politics of desire [Music] [Music] watch [Music] [Music] [Music] over in the gardens got you too [Music] [Music] virtual thanks to you I believe that I 'm contractually obliged to time when I started so I reckon I 'll probably just play about 10 songs and that should probably cover a couple of jokes beta then anyway I might stay on the dead Marines this song was also from the first album called view day this song called only the wedding dress [Music] [Music] [Music] you win [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] so now I might play a song by the front-end loaded and as I mentioned it 's been going for quite some time it 's the same for people like they married to three other people all the time I 'm not gonna make any further comment about that anyway this song most of our songs don 't go very well in the solo acoustic setting that this one might come closer [Music] talk to me [Music] look it 's to the side [Music] [Music] [Music] you get to decide [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah I 'm gonna attempt to play quite an old song from an old and I was in once back in the day called the Impossibles [Music] called sloe gin [Music] she makes slow me without me having some time [Music] oh the blue refugee wind in a winery lipsti see stop [Music] oMG we 've just seen [Music] drinking [Music] you just don 't be mean to me when doing ecstasy [Music] interestingly enough I live with two other bikes there all these issues both indisposed the virus all kicked off we did start making it postings music that we 're making around their respective dining room left coffee tables nice but interests of getting this finished before which we base their tensile revokes the opportunity I thought I might just do and all that happy note I think I should probably play with salt wise to you but this one with Jason water [Music] know exactly what you 're thinking I know exactly how you feel cuz I got wise I 've always up to you baby don 't exactly what you need and I know just what it could be I know what it might have been but then I got wise to you I got my what you [Music] in your [Music] [Music] [Music] well that 's about thirty one more and

    "text": "good morning everyone and uh welcome to bankstown library i 'm going to be talking to you today about some botanical reads that i 've enjoyed recently and some of the appeal characteristics that come from reading different books so many of you are at home and you may have already been accessing our e-resources online through borrowbox and rb digital and or you may have some of these books still from when the library closed that you 've got at home so we 're going to do a series of different book chats about different appeal characteristics of certain genres and how they cross over into other books so um as you can see i 've got some lovely native flowers here and uh these are featured on quite a few book covers that i 've seen recently so botanical reeds are really becoming quite popular and it doesn 't have to do with just australian native plants it can do with other botanical like you know books with garden as a title or flowers or other things so we 're going to talk about a couple of books about those and the appeal characteristics that we call them and i 'll explain to you what the two terms are appeal characteristic is characteristics are basically what you enjoy about the book what is it that appeals to you and there 's many different levels of discussion about um the pace of the book the tone of the book the characters and all those things so if someone asks you what you like about the book sometimes we tell them about the plot and not really about what i liked about the book so botanical for me is an appeal characteristic and in the two books that i 'm talking about they 're actually featured in a element of the book which is also really nice because i have seen some books with botanical on the cover and the story really doesn 't relate to anything whatsoever so you know you just have a look at the book on the blurb on the back and just see what the book is about the crossover is actually to do with what the book is about and some books like one event and that 's something that you can uh read up on at a later time and uh the crossover really is sometimes the author is inspired by a historical event and actually then writes a fictional book about it and it could be one of those fictional you know characters of history and then they 've created a different sideline to their identity so we 're going to talk about those um in these these examples and and you 'll understand what those terms mean okay so we 're going to go to the first example and i 've got it unfortunately the book 's out on loan so i have an image that 's downloaded from our e-library so the titles i 'm talking about um today are actually on our e library i have checked so if it does end up being borrowed you can reserve them and if you are reading them and you 've actually finished with them rather than wait for the end of the loan period just return them straight away and then it can go to the next person with without them first example i 'm talking about is josephine 's garden by stephanie parken who 's actually a new zealander by birth i think she lives in australia and uh this has been inspired by the history of napoleon 's wife josephine and it 's set at the end of the 18th century in the early 19th century france at the time of the french revolution and beyond and josephine who was in a formal life a prisoner rose d and i won 't say the last because it 's french and my french is terrible but she escapes the guillotine when the french revolution occurs and after 10 years she works her way out of her escape into being a socialite and comes to the attention of napoleon bonaparte and creates her own empire through her garden so you can see in the cover there 's um obviously some uh clues to that there 's some wattle and waratah so france and the connection to australia what could that be um so the native plants feature as part of this story because it 's also the time of enlightenment in pacific and they would return with seeds trying to replicate conditions you know for those seeds to germinate and the timing and that was a very difficult task because what grows in australia does not necessarily grow in france so josephine obviously found these scientists who brought back these seeds and sponsored them and was able to grow certain plants which she put into her garden and that was called a garden of wonders by the author so this was part of a status in the time with privileged people in their gardens so the appeal characteristics to me obviously as i mentioned was the botanical theme there 's lots of good plot lines and interesting characters the background of the french revolution napoleon who 's obviously a prominent historical figure himself is actually actually a secondary character in this book and um he it 's really josephine 's story of her in the garden and it 's based on historical fact so stephanie has a compelling writing style that 's the author and she has a strong complex characters so josephine is certainly one of those as the main through the story so this would appeal to history lovers australian history and their relationship with france during the period of scientific enlightenment especially as france missed out on colonising australia um it would appeal to plant and national natural history lovers and anyone that enjoys a well-written and interesting read so it may encourage you to read more about josephine 's garden and crossing over into non-fiction books so i 'm just going to bring up the other book which i actually read afterwards was called napoleon the empress and the artist so what i did was i really wanted to go looking for more information and i went into the non-fiction area of the library and i found a book that told me further about the story so that 's where crossovers can go from fiction into non-fiction and vice versa okay so um basically the crossovers are history historical figures natural history and events of history and the landscape you know between australia described by the scientists and then being back in france and then obviously them collaborating with each other and then obviously with their patrons plant species and science of note so that 's the first first book that i 've featured and the other one is going to be let me see the lost flowers of alice heart so i 'll just bring that picture up it 's a little bit harder to see but again you can see by the cover that there 's lots of really beautiful native flowers on the cover and covers can be very appealing to our readers i i must say working in a library um i remember covers more than i do the titles so that 's just how how different we all are so this story um the lost flowers of alice heart it 's by holly england and she won two awards for this particular book so it is an award winner so it 's about nine-year-old_''_519.039 alice hart and she 's forced to leave she 's been orphaned and she goes to live with her grandmother who runs a native plant farm so she is widowed on her own and she has a whole lot of women workers that work on that farm and basically it 's a story of love and loss and betrayal so you follow alice 's journey as she learns um the most powerful story is is her own story and the differing experience of alice as the central character so it very much deals with the physical landscapes of the different places that alice has lived and the people and the experiences of her life it 's a lot more of a simple story than the other ones far more complex where it 's taken a lot of the historical elements into it whereas this is um more a saga of the family and finding your roots so basically the book would appeal to lovers of good family saga featuring strong women characters like grandmother mother and daughter relationships looking at perseverance and strength and love moving away and coming back to your roots is essential theme of this book and the farm represents the growth of plants but it also very much um is a side um you know sort of theme to the growth of people in in life it 's an engaging read and an emotional it australian author and uh i 'm hoping that she 's going to write again because she 's written lots of good things so basically um in the uh borrow box and borrow box app in audio and ebook that you can download there 's a nice feature at the bottom where you can actually tell a friend about what you 've read if you really liked it so i 've discovered that one recently and that 's a really good feature to have so you could email your friend or your mother you know i really like this book and recommend that to them and put a little blurb in it as well so there are other titles available all those ones that i 've mentioned are available on borrowbox and rb digital so you can access those from our e-resources page cb city slash e-resources and you 'll be asked to put your library card number in and if you have rb digital download both as an app from the app store and set up an account for rb digital if you have any problems call our libraries 9789-9423 okay so that 's the end of my chat for today thanks for watching and we 'll talk again soon bye from the library _"

    "text": "we 're back for another lesson yes it 's less another seven eat that hook you know you were with captain oak now you 'll be stuck to six wouldn 't you but we 're under seven i might even keep going and count my toes who knows have i got twos i 'm not sure we 'll be working that out later but right now we 're up for some more point in school okay so stand like a pirate come on we know all this that we stand like a pirate head up and laugh that 's good give me an r excellent remember port starboard you 'd have that down by that would you bow earth to the back all right remember port close to the port side starboard on this side right what the current today all right and the new stuff we 're doing today is pirate cruise what we were different jobs all that kind of stuff because you know you started learning the ropes you getting the hang of it because we didn 't really obviously all right so you want to know can i do what kind of job is it right you can 't all be captain we could take turns but you know we could all blew that so we 'll do a few of that sort of things but first i 'm going to cover a few words few new words for you so you get in the lingo down right you can speak it all right so mighty mighty that 's a word so mighty is the name for a good friend right almighty you know come over here baby all right that 's your good friend right so it comes from like first mate you know captain first mate so that 's a close bond right the next guy the one closest to you so matey 's something you call your good friends all right so next one is prize all right now a prize isn 't something like you go oh look i want a prize actually prize you do win but that 's what we call our ships the ships we chase and we catch when we capture a ship that 's our prize when 're talking about another ship right so you know we 're talking talking tactics as we go through this way so basically you just approach one ship right when they had like they sailed together and they try to be smart and still together but generally you 'd find one to be a straggler and hang into the back and that 's the one you go for right mostly try and pick them off one at a time you wouldn 't try to take a lot of shapes on there because you take taking on too much more that you can chew right so you pick them off all right you know we 're sort of like the scavengers i see you pick them off the little slow ones and all that kind of stuff for the week all right that 's how it works that 's it so we call that albroize all right now another good one is savvy all right do you savvy that right which means do you understand it all right sally ah he 's got lots of savvy he 's pretty smart that kind that actually comes from a french word like sabre and all that sort of those kind of words comes from the language of france right a lot of piratey words are sort of taken from france the jolly roger you see the old flag here right flag dolly roger right all right roger part of that isn 't roger the name it 's actually like a mix-up of a french word that meant red right because it used to be a jolly red flag right they do that because it was supposed to be scary so it 's blood colored and all that kind of stuff and over years has been adapted and this is like the classic look over here right that kind of stuff we 'll go more into pirate flags when we talk about great pirates over history i 'll go and give you a bit of talk about them we 'll talk about their flags and how flags tend to reflect their personalities and the messages they want to give and all that kind of stuff but we 'll talk about it later because the flag lot of people just surrender right when they see the pirate flag because it 's scary you know and that was the job of the pirate flag all right so another word we 're going to cover now to is sea rover now sea rover is another name for pirates of course to see rulers because you know we weren 't tied to one poor often and we travel about and just land we had a bit of free lifestyle so if you 're in the navy and stuff like that you had to go where you 're told to go and all that kind of stuff but the pirates we could cruise about all over the place make our own choices and all that kind of stuff and that 's why we will see rovers which leads us into the whole idea of the pirates being a democracy right the captain would be voted in not appointed all right oh again in the navy right this is why a lot of people left the navy and come to pirates it was this big class system right you know officers them you know officers could often buy their way in from their family money and stuff like that you know you have the end stone that wasn 't going to inherit anything like that they 'd buy him a captaincy and stuff like that and he laughed at the ship but all that kind of russia that kind of malarkey or they buy him you know be a bolson or something like that like get him in there as a junior officer and stuff so it was very hierarchical and all that kind of stuff but cap is the only sort of rank that just sort of drops down a little bit and then it 's everybody and everybody got to vote on everything right pirates we voted for everything right what direction what prize you 're going to go after all your electronics we 'd have a vote about all that kind of stuff right and we vote for the captain so to become a captain right they would want certain traits you know what would they want you want to be lucky right they want to be good to be good fighters having a good fighter right the only time that captain is solely in charge of things was in battle that 's when he was the one calling all the shots otherwise it was pretty much selected all that kind of stuff like that so had to be good at that brave and all that sort of stuff but basically it was a democracy so everyone would vote on it and we 'd all get even shares pretty much right the captain maybe because more responsibility a couple of officers might get a share and a half or two shares but everything would be doing that even right so everyone would score the same amount of booty and all that kind of stuff and that 's how most pirate ships worked you know so you had to be a good captain otherwise you know you made everybody upset because you 're being rude or you know you 're just giving instructions willy-nilly and not backing it up with anything or you 're taking them off with they just have an election and they bought somebody else in the good side of that is everything being pretty equal is like if we were going to be captured or something like that you could just dress as a normal crew and nobody really stand out over all that kind of stuff because you didn 't have that many finders you just throw off your jacket or whatever other in-signage you had or whatever like that and you just blend in and they wouldn 't know who was the cat and was and it 'd give you a better chance to escape because you know captain would be the first person they got rid of and all that sort of stuff so that sort of made it all worthwhile all the way so some of the other you know and the thing about your roles and your duties on the ship for everybody else is you getting them by you know your experience and what you knew about it and how good you were and things that 's the jobs you got right if you 're good at something you 'd get that as a job right again that didn you do that right you know here 's a broom sweep that that kind of thing right but nope this is all about skills and all that kind of stuff so a real democracy the old piracy so it was a good thing to see so what kind of jobs do we have we heard of the first mate we talked to the first mate too that 's like the second in charge deputy captain kind of thing but pirate ships we didn 't really worry about that again we flattened the curve a bit like that that 's why you know i 've got a parrot as my first mate you know because i was a bit of a joke that kind of stuff that 's the idea of that kind of thing you know first week wasn 't that respected so second in championship was usually a quarter master right called a quarter master right and they 'd be the ones who 'd be in charge when the captain was asleep or that kind of stuff made a lot of choices often in charge of the food and so they were the second in charge of the ship the quartermaster we called him right and uh next after that quartermaster right would be the uh the sailing master right now the sailing master was in charge to navigate and pile on the ship and this is a real hard job and a lot of them could become captains and stuff like that because it was i remember we told you no gps and stuff like that you had to go by the sun and all that and the stars and i 'm gonna do a navigation one later on we 'll talk about all the ways you used to do it nice and pile through the harbors and know where all the shoals were and all that sort of stuff we 'll cover all that but sailing mass that was a really important job really really important sometimes to get a really skilled one you 'd have to sort of shang away one you know you 're changing and you know what chiang mai is ah that 's an old ancient crafty ocean what you do basically is and throwing the back boy you go into the local establishment the old tavern or whatever and you put something in their drinks they went to sleep and you know couldn 't remember where they were and then they wake up day later get up and walk outside there and and go oh why are you here why don 't you become our navigator that 's right so that 's how a lot of solution masters sort of got the job right you sort of you know just squeeze them on there and once they 're on they enjoy themselves right and now who else was there well we talked about the gun crew didn 't we right the gun crew i mean that was a big part of the ship right remember how many ships we had on there remember that we had 10 guns on there right well you need four each gun right so he had the gunners meet next gun captain and all that sort of stuff they had about four guys on there plus the gun monkeys you know the battle monkeys talked about them boy or girl we talked about that job before as well so these are sort of jobs he got on there on the ships right so the next one 's after that right it 's the bolson remember the bolson we talked about the boson that 's like the junior officers right remember the bulls and whistles they 're the ones that do the general business keep things running all the time right they 're the ones that work today guys in charge of all this like different little jobs and stuff like that right so we had basically like four bosons on the beatrice right four bolsons right here because now we talked about watches right so watches are four hours on so if you have a four hour watch you 're on four hours off right four round four off that was the way they sort of worked like that sort of stuff like that so you need two bolsons for each time for each four hour period right because you need a starboard and a port watch right so you have one of each and you have right so we 'd had four bolsons basically four bosons four buzzles whistles all that sort of stuff right they were the sort of junior officers kept things running and making sure you know when the wing chun all that turns out make sure all the jobs would happen at 20 min doing all that sort of stuff so that was a running middle junior offices right next after that we talked about the doctor or the surgeon we call the surgeon hired a surgeon and doctors well they 're not like doctors here at least more things they can do now in those days you know you 'd have a few diseases you could take some stuff for like a castor oil to flush you out that kind of stuff or you 'd have some kind of injury that have to repair and stuff like that and so the surgeon used to also be the ship 's carpenter right because they use the same sort of tools basically and you know that 's why you 'll see like you know we talked about captain hook before hooks guys with so basically the ship 's carpenter was also the doctor right so that saved a bit of time just having one guy to do all those sort of taught their jobs you know so that 's happened there we talked about cooks right we talked about cooks i think that was the last time wouldn 't it last time we talked about cooks right right well cooks they uh we didn 't really have much call for cooks right so i usually be one of the gunners because they 'd have less duties because you don 't want to use the guns all the time they can clean and all that kind of stuff but so cooks ended up being one of the gunners you get double up on some of these jobs the main role is gunner they also do a bit of cooking and stuff like that so they cheer that out when we 're cooking otherwise if you 're just doing the hard tack and stuff like that well not much cooking involved with that is there so we do that kind of stuff and the final is the ship 's musician right you need a musician and all good ships have a musician right on the beatrice we got an old crusty old bugger we call gardner bob gardner ball barry i might even get him in here or something to place a bit of his old little box of stringy boxy thing that he plays all right don 't do that because you know you 'll get your old jig and get us all doing jigs and stuff like that you know this is the kind of thing we want to do on a ship you know doing jigs and then singing and entertainment keeps everybody happy and all that kind of stuff because pirate ships you know you want to keep happy and joyful and stuff like that so we need seven musicians on the ship and that was much valued right ships with a musician was very much valued right so that 's all good now right to keep all our spirits up now why are we up to now all right oh i 'm gonna tell you one more thing about the a shanty right so with the whistle you know we have a singer and we have a musician there and you think oh i like to sing along and i can whistle on oh no you won 't_''_744.16 we don 't whistle on the ship you got that no whistling whistling is bad like we 're superstitious we pirates and we don 't whistle on the ship you got that i didn 't hear you oh here an aye aye aye captain aye aye captain ah no whistling all right cause whistling is like challenging the wind you 've heard the expression whistle up the wind or that 's about a challenge in the wind right and you don 't want to challenge no wind right you just want the wind to be cruising along behind you you don 't want to challenge him or you want to upset them so we go somewhere else and you 've got nowhere near but carmed that 's be calmed as it were too see what be carned means the wind is just stopped and the ship is just sitting there it 's stopping you sailing because these ships had no engine right you only moved forward by the get the patch in the wind in your sails and that pushed you forward that wasn 't there or you know if you got really desperate you get the jolly bolts out and put the ropes on and you 'd be rolling away we did growing before too didn 't we all right but that 's what would happen right so no whistling you don 't want to be upset in that wind now right because that 's some best superstitions maybe we 'll do an episode on superstitions and they 'll say ah that could be interesting as well who knows what 's over the horizon we 'll go online we might said a crow will get find it who knows but we 're going to do another one all right another shanties time for another shanty right and uh this one you 'll guess is like a long all shandy again right a long haul one remember that for doing dogs big jobs right and you can feel the rocky one in ball and pull it all right all right so we have the shandy man right he calls the first verse and that 's what you 're wrestling when you 're doing the verse and then you 've got chorus and everyone 's pulling in the car it 's pulling the cars as we 're hoisting the big main sail all right so imagine you 're hoisting the main tail all right or maybe even this one over there back here right there on the mizzen mast there maybe they were hoisting that one this time i think we did mainstay last time let 's be hoisted in the middle of our series that 's a big sail big heavy boom across there you want to lift up right all right okay that 's actually how we do it all right okay so this one will go we 're making money with this sound rattling winches hole soon we will be home with bound rattle and winches whole and then of course this is a bit using so as rattling winches hoe rattle and winches step and go rattling winches hole all right that 's what you 're doing and you just rock it back and you 're pulling every time you 're doing it and you 're pulling back and all that kind of stuff right you 're getting there and you 're pulling hard so remember when you 're doing this feel that rock with that rock on the shot ship you 're rocking and you 're pulling and you 're singing and you 're getting into the job and that 's how we get it all done quickly and we 'll proper right yeah okay so we 'll go through we 'll send it all right and then we 'll wind up for the day are you ready all right so here we go you just sing those chorus again with me all right that 's how you do it and how you 're doing it we 're pulling the sail up ready to go we 're making money with this set oh i forgot to tell you about the winches what are these winches at a rattlin well the winches are what pulls up the sails all pulleys and all that kind of stuff and they 'd be winching and they rattled in the wind and as you pull them they 'd creak and they 'd rattle and like these guys if you 're in the harbor and you pull it in the anchor and all that kind of stuff well i could hear them so that you 'd actually get here because the water the sound would travel across the water and you could actually hear them now cree i 'm pulling up and you hear the guys singing as they pull them up and that 's what you 're experiencing now that kind of thing right except not ownership but you know you 'll get the imagination to go on to do it but imagine you 're here like this on this hybrid lifting up these beautiful sails on the beaches here right or you 're over here in the thing watching out and watching the crew at work and listening to them seeing all right but i 'm hoping you 're up with me singing along and being so before it gets right in r

of expressions right last two lessons last two weeks right we 've been doing jokes by my old first mate now i didn 't get any feedback whether you wanted that or didn 't want that so if you want him to come back or even have his own special you know first mate wilson telling jokes you make some comments on facebook otherwise he 's still getting repaired by the uh ship 's carpenter right probably get a wooden leg and all that sort of stuff because yeah after the beating he got after those last two jokes he 's a bit like that kind of stuff we could talk about marooning him i tried marooning him

is called don 't fence me in [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] ah that was so pretty oh yeah I was like riding the range Solo say the accordion can be a very sensitive instrument it 's I think it 's just Envy isn 't accordion in Vietnamese something it 's a thing let 's see how we going for time are we going great for time okay so let 's do something else now um oh right we 're gonna do a song by someone else yeah I 'm sure you go to Willie Nelson he 's one of my favorites you know country singer songwriters of all times and and and human what a great human and he he made I 've been not going into this too much so this is a family show but his son Lucas Nelson is um is a delightful young fella and he wrote this song I 'm just going to put the words in here just in case I forget that I have been known to forget words sometimes and this is called turn off the news and this is another one I just thought was really appropriate it 's very soothing song in the key of a lovey [Music] I believe hey I just want to love you mothers are thought to be confuse I don 't need to try to understand baby y 'all get up turn off the news and Billy God just my neighborhood with me we can 't feel it we

there with a different musical tastes on trying to you know broaden my no I reach here my horizons this is a little reggae ish Conant number that I wrote and I thought this also would be appropriate for the times it 's called hold on it 's all about just it 's kind of a song of the earning you missing someone I 'm sure we 're all missing missing some of our friends I might send this one out particularly to any women who are pregnant or have just had a baby because I think this would be a particularly difficult time to be isolated when you can 't have your family around especially to see that that new precious little being that you 've just brought into the world but hold on it might everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] baby hold on [Music] _"

    "text": "hi everyone welcome to the second tutorial for Canterbury bankstown libraries so I 'm gonna be doing some flower drawing today and I hope you can follow along we 're using some techniques that we used last week in the essential techniques workshop so if you head on to the canopy Bankstown library page you will find that tutorial there I hope you enjoy so let 's get started all you need is some pencils and a rubber if you 'd like as well so I 'm just using a normal pencil for the outline we 're going to start with a daisy and I think this is a really really pretty flower to draw it 's very effective and just start and do quite a big one by doing a rigid sort of circle and then in the middle just do a smaller one once you 've done that we 're gonna use our dotting technique so last week in the tutorial I explained to that I 'd love you to revisit it if you haven 't watched that and you 're just following along that 's fine we fill in the smaller circle in the middle and for this just to make it a bit darker I 'm going to use a 3b pencil and just keep working and filling that in with dots make them quite close together just to remove the white and give a center of our flower I don 't know what you call that at the center of a flower some texture and I 've taught these before and I 've really loved the results from everyone so I 'd really love if you participate in these tutorials or you watch them and you 're really happy with your results please feel free to send them through to the Bankstown Canterbury library 's Facebook or even see if you can send it on their website I 'm sure they 'd love to see some of the results as well if not check out my facebook it 's live the dream and send me some of your results I 'll definitely love to see them and even share them so just continue dotting so adding as many dots it 's okay if they sort and it 's creating some texture also doesn 't matter if you go a little bit out of the lines to okay so once you 've done that then we 're gonna start going outwards so we 're gonna be doing it quite dark around here and then we 're going to get lighter as we go to the outside so instead of doing dots on the outside I want to start to do some ovals or circles all the way around and this will imitate a lighter shade just keep filling it up if you 'd like you can pause the video and restart these don 't have to be perfect either so just like that and then as we go in we 're just gonna make those circles smaller just gradually and then we 'll turn into doing some more dots in the middle so we 're just going to slowly go from bigger circles to add dots from the outside to the inside slowly making these smaller and then in two dots so you 'll see how it looks darker in the middle and lighter on the to just create some texture and some more realism to what we draw just keep going if you 've got kids or teenagers especially into drawing definitely see if they 'd like to follow along in this video just because I think this is a really really good skill to learn and it 'll give them more options to create texture and different elements of shading in any drawing that they really do so this technique can be used for many many things and we 'll be covering those in the coming weeks and they 'll be on the canterbury thanks charm library website so just keep going from the outside to the inside where it 's the most dark and just add more of that dotting it 's quite time-consuming as well so if you do a large flower just know that it will take a little bit of time but it is worth it and I 'm not really pressing down any harder or lighter I 'm just making the circles smaller and bunching them together a bit more and then what you can do is just go just to really give that that element of shadow and depth in the middle of a flower okay so I 'm happy with that the next step is we 're going to go and outline our flower so for daisies they have quite long petals so I 'm gonna do is go out give it a little bump like there and bring it back in so we 're going to start thin go a bit wider and then thinner again and there 's really no method to this one just keep adding the outlines you can add some longer ones that overlap with some you can add some shorter ones you can even Google a daisy and maybe copy one off the internet if you 'd like as well so you can choose different starting points and just keep adding those petals and you 'll see it will really really come together especially with the middle already shaded in so I 'm just adding some overlapping just to give it a more natural look we don 't want all of the petals to be the same [Music] [Music] I 'm just follow along with me these drawings are really good gifts for people I know we just recently had Mother 's Day I think every day of the year is definitely a time we can give a little gift so if you do a drawing you might consider sharing it with a friend or a mom or oh grandma or hanging it up on your own wall so just keep adding these pedals I think this is a really beautiful flower and it 's quite simple [Music] and these all don 't have to be perfect either [Music] so just like that they 're just out outlines so what the next technique I really want us to try and I think it 's really really effective when we draw these flowers is blending so we did this in the last tutorial as well please revisit it if you haven 't watched it already I think they have really really essential techniques that you can use in every single drawing that you do we 've already used our dotting we 've adapted that a little bit to suit our flower drawing the petals and this can give you a really really finished look and make our image look almost 3d_._704.58 you 'll see in here around the center of the flower we 've got some little gaps and even along some petals so I just want us to find those and just shade them in quite dark just to add some shadow so don 't have too many this will just fill in the gaps between our petals as well create some depth and you 'll see the pedals that just appear behind some of the others they don 't have too much showing or they have the center of their petal showing in between another flower so I just want us to shade the bottom of that quite dark so you can just outline it and just shade the center of it just like that I just want us to do that to all of them that we see just add some darkness and then we 'll finish this soon we 're just starting off our shading so any petrels behind other ones this is going to be a shadow this is just gonna be the start of our shading we 're gonna have a lot of contrasting this one from light to dark and I think they will look fantastic okay so just like that and then what we 're gonna do is just go in each pedal and just add some not too jagged but just some soft lines there can be different sizes and we 're just creating the creases and the pedals you don 't have to have three in each you can I have two you can have one and this will just give our petals some texture and a realistic look as well if you find some more that need that shading just add that in there and just keep adding these lines not too dark just to all of them you might want to add some little ones at the top I think that looks very effective too [Music] in the next few weeks we 're going to be covering some seascapes and maybe some landscape drawing so just keep tuned for some posts about those and just keep adding these lines to what we 're gonna do now is we 're going to start shading from the outside to the inside so we 're going to have say this is my petal we 're gonna start shading I 'm gonna have darker at the bottom and darker at the top and on the outside so remember our shading is by using our pencil and we 're just in a fast motion going back and forth when you press down for darker and then as we go compress lighter create a lighter tone and then we 'll go back to dark as we come to the edge of our petal again so just like this so we 're gonna have dark on the outsides and on the top it might take a while but this is a really really beautiful way to make our flowers look more real so I 'd really love you to take your time with this you can pause the video or keep going but I 'm gonna just go the whole time and just color in my flower so I 'm just pressing lighter in the middle and and you 'll notice I 'm going in that up and down direction I 'm not going side to side so that is a petal and then I 'm just going to do that with all of mine so the reason we 're going darker in the middle is because that 's going inwards that 's going down to the center of our flower so this makes sense it 'll be a little bit darker and make our creases stand out a little bit more as we shade around the lines that we 've done so I 'm just going to go over them a little bit darker as a shade so I 'm using again a 3b pencil you can use a four B or a 6b or an 8b you can even use a HB if you 'd like I think the higher the number and the B pencil is really really effective in doing this blending technique and that 's just because you get the really really dark tones in there without having to press too hard so you can pause or take your time and we my first petal and I 'm just going back over where I 'd like some of those creases in there just like that so I continue just adding those even the darkest between petals as well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so just like that there 's our Daisy _"

no well they 're all about sort of different things I suppose there 's some like love songs in there there 's some songs about you know relationship bust-ups just the typical sort of stuff really I suppose it 's a bit like therapy songwriting so you you feel an emotion and you write a song about it and all of them pretty much making their own the emotions yeah I yeah this next one let 's see let 's see what you were you where you make of it what do you think about it what you think it 's about it 's cold out once you start and I wrote this song with my friend Luca delsanto and we had a band a few years ago called Lunia and it was electronic house and being sort stuff up on Spotify you can find this song up on Spotify under Lunia and it 's called once you start it 's only a few songs up there yeah so the version Apollo is quite different to this one but this is my this is my acapella version [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I 'm driving dogs outside amigos Jeb 's

that 's Lunia once you start so if anyone 's wondering what I 'm using to do my looping it 's called a TC Helicon voice live touch and it 's got lots of fun little presets in terms of like sound effects and things like that that you can store and then for every song you just need to create the loop fresh from the beginning and then you build a song out of it anyway I 'm gonna do a couple more of those as the set goes on but it 's lots of fun for anyone who likes playing around with sounds and music highly recommend it 's so cool to be able to play this show for you guys oh I haven 't been doing too many gigs I have to say apart from online ones only online ones for the like the last three months so it 's a real treat to to be able to share music maybe possibly able to share it with otherwise so hopefully yeah there 's some some new people seeing my stuff and yeah feel free to get in touch I 've got my links all through Daniel M music Facebook and all the other places you know

a song that I wrote for my to to my good friends who got married after a long long time of being together and you know they like really relationship just kept evolving over time and sometimes I was like oh I don 't know maybe they would make it but then you know something new would happen get to that point of conflict and then they move past it and learn something new about each other and anyway yeah my friend I 've known her since I was three years old she she said that about her partner that he he taught he taught her how to kind of you know like relax and just not not be too uptight and and for her that was a big a massive gift that he has given her over the years and still continues to remind her to do that and I wrote this up for them for their wedding go I 'm babbling on a lot

    "text": "hey guys so today we 're gonna make some buttery parmesan mushroom gnocchi say that you 're fine you 're not really it sounds funny but oh well let 's get going so you just start off we harbor gnocchi so store-bought yoki and there 's about 500 grams here and that 's about four servings so if you don 't have know get home just use 200 grams of any other sort of pass hollow spaghetti new penne a spiral is anything else at jakar I have a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese that I will finish off with a cup of panko crumbs and if you don 't have panko all you can do is guess on the stale bread and put into the oven for about 10 to 20 minutes at about 120 240 degree Celsius and then just crush it up you get that sort of texture I 'll put it into a lot of mixer just to break it up like God I have birju 's to D place the pianist who are amazing my DBS collection if you don 't have no juice that I have 4 tbsp unsalted butter and I 'll be showing you how to use that as well I have two massive portobello mushrooms asparagus you know if you don 't have asparagus just use some peas peas go amazingly last time I have half a brown onion 2 garlic cloves salt and pepper and some time and I 'll be getting some pasta so if your butter is not a room temperature just chucked in your microwave for about five seconds and that should be enough so I 've got about three tablespoons of the butter here and what I 'm gonna do is just gonna mix it up with all my paper till it 's well combined so once that 's done this is what you get nice crumbly mixture of butter and once your panko mix is done just put it into a baking tin with some baking paper and just into your preheated oven for about 10 to 15 minutes just take a look at it every few minutes and mix it around so it Browns across even be you don 't want to be super color to it it needs to be crispy so while this is baking away let 's start on an actual dish [Music] so yes so I sliced mine thick and thin so I 'm just gonna use both but make sure you slice your thinly not like mine but once that 's done we 're gonna do the garlic so look there are so many different ways to peel garlic discard skin off but one of my easiest ways is you just put it there take your knife just hit it a bit take that off same thing just comes off right away look at that that 's super easy and then again slice that look I like sliced garlic cloves if you don 't like that you can just just dice it up a bit if you want but just keep a few pieces because you 're gonna Brown them off in the butter and once that 's done with that you don 't want that going into your pasta then again slice this thinly as well [Music] now if your asparagus asparagus again you can leave it a it 's thin I just want it to look like peas and except it 's not any Peas is it mushrooms garlic onion and asparagus done wallah so on medium heat get your non-stick pan going if you don 't have a non-stick pan that 's fine I should be adding some olive oil and butter in there get to that at about two tablespoons of olive oil and then add your one tablespoon of butter or your remaining butter that you have let it melt away and I don 't really wait for the butter to melt into that I 'm going to add plenty and my garlic [Music] they 're gonna saute that for about five minutes til your audience closed transposon and they also slightly stopped riding up the middle [Music] so after five minutes you can see I need to sign to go Brown your garlic spring brown and nice and golden to that at one yaki [Music] stare around a few times mix it around a few times rather hysterical it so it 's knitting my Neil Keith ran up a little bit here at there 's this happening just put the mushrooms on the top you know slowly stops cook down [Music] so let this sit there for about two minutes or so not for too long you don 't want the bottom to ground too much so after about two then if you can see the new yorky is title ground up spray two balloons and a few had the must be single stop give it a nice mix this is the next five to seven minutes or so keep mixing it occasionally so every two minutes or so just do the mix so halfway through bring your feet to the load and then put this for another two or three minutes mine 's been on here for about three minutes now so I 'll probably do another two rounds of us in five minutes so this has been cooking for the past five minutes you can see how the milky the mushroom the onions garlic everything has a nice and light golden today I 'm gonna add my spices which is my salt and my sign the pepper and the caps and okay do that a nice mix make sure you 're mixing the salt and pepper five through really well [Music] and then to this mixture add about two tablespoons of stop or two tablespoons of virtues [Music] and then add your partisan and mix this around for another minute till the palm is in the tree so plate your pasta and then put some the parsley and the table look you can be as artistic as you want but non-artistic s you want and then you think rum trust me you 'll love it then if you want top it with some for greens and some Parmesan cheese again if you wanted a bit more salty and there you go that 's ready so that was a super easy recipe don 't you think so I agree car B it 's fatty it 'll make you happy and you 'll never ever want to eat anything else so try making that ready

let 's get started starting our practice in sitting Mountain come a little bit towards the front of the chair so there 's space behind you and take your two fists together and place them in between your thighs check between the arches of the feet that you have this same distance apart and the middle toes lines up with the knee and the inner hip bone and under your knee your ankle joint sits right in line with the knee and let your spine grow tall have your chin and chest about a fist distance apart and the crown of the head reaching up for the sky then let your shoulders roll up times because it feels good and then let them rest down in your back and you can rest your hands down on your lap if you 'd like to ground or up if you 'd like to receive and then perhaps close your eyes or let the gaze soften if that feels more comfortable bring your awareness into your body notice how your body feels today what can you feel in your body are there sensations do you feel places connecting with the surface beneath just noticing whatever is present for you today in your body and then noticing your breath how does your breath feel where is your breath flowing to just for a few rounds just simply following your breath with nothing else to do or follow the breath when you 're ready begin to gently open the eyes and come back into this space so it is the difference and then tuck your thumb under your fingers ground your feet into the floor circle your wrists and as in the hell if you 'd like to you can bring your hands up overhead as you exhale changing you inhale circling up and just taking your hands to as high as feels good for you today and exhaling changing direction and coming back down again and then making a prism with your hands with all your fingertips and thumb touching and circle the fingers around in one direction and then changing direction bringing them around the other way and then turn your palm up to the sky and take your left hand up and your right hand down to wherever feels comfortable and inhale tall and exhale start to change the hands over inhale reaching up and down and exhale changing over inhaling reaching up and down the necks hailing changing or even keeping the feet grounded as you move your arms and notice if there 's any sensations in the hand the fingertips [Music] and then gently bring your hands over your heart one on top of the other you know and spread your arms out open your chest as you exhale one arm on top as you wrap yourself up in a hug inhale and open the chest the arms and exhale change the arm that again inhale open the arms and exhale another hug give yourself a little squeeze if you like and inhale open and exhale hug again and this time just hold on in that self-love hug for one more breath and then open your arms inhaling exhaling to bring your hands down to the sides and as you inhale lead with the elbow and lift the elbows out and up and as you exhale lower them down now you can keep your hands closer to you or take them further away the further away you take your hands the heavier it 's gonna feel so that 's like adding resistance so you decide how heavy you want your arms to be today Hayling pressing into the feet to let the arms rise exhale into lower taking one more next half then we 'll bring our hands back to that prism again and let 's start to take the shoulders on a little roll and you can take your hands around the back or on top or in front of your face whatever feels good in your shoulders keep the shoulders fairly still in the shoulder joint here and then let 's change direction go back around the other way breathing in then exhaling keeping the feet grounded in that stable mountain base exhaling in one more time [Music] and then letting the hands come down interlace the fingers and turn the palms forward now here make this about your hands and not so much about your shoulders or upper back pull the thumbs back to your belly and breathe [Music] and then gently unravel their hands and change which pinky was at the bottom to the other one and then press the hands forward again inhale and maybe let the arms rise up if that feels comfortable and you can have the elbows more bent or less bent that 's completely up to you notice where you can feel the breath here maybe into the side ribs next exhale it 's letting the hand slowly return back down take the hands around to your hips now and draw the shoulder blades towards each other and as you do that your elbows are going to come back and let the eyes gaze up here where can you feel it maybe a little bit more in the front body and your exhale breath just releasing out of that position your hands to your thighs take a breath in and then fold forward from the hips now keep your spine long you might want to slide your elbows forward a little onto your thighs notice your breath again here and can you feel breath now into the lower back [Music] it 's almost like the back body is breathing new next inhale press into your feet and lift on up and then from here let 's take a little cow and cat come forward as you inhale raise the sternum and as you exhale curl the tailbone under and come back keep the feet grounded inhale and lengthen the front of the spine exhale and lengthen the back of the spine inhale lengthen the front of the spine and exhale lengthen the back of the spine and again inhaling and exhale and then coming back to sit nice and tall and as you next inhale start to make a circle to the right to the grounded and making your circles as big or as small as you like keep the head in line with this spine one more in this direction and then let 's change direction reversing around the other way now keeping that breath flowing keeping that chin that fist distance apart from the chest and one more circle back into the middle breathe in tall and exhale slide your right hand up your leg and turn your ribs so we 're going to turn belly sternum

in your inhale and then you exhale lift up and over to wall it 's the right press with your feet to bring you back to the center as you know if you want you can change your arms as you go side to side remembering again the further away you take them they 're heavier they 're gonna feel so just deciding if you 'd like to have shoulders cactus a little bit longer maybe one up one down whatever feels right in your shoulders today is exactly what you do with your arms everyone showed us a different to always be true to you you 're unique and special I 'll take one more over to the left [Music] and

was or move it closer cross over at the ankle or maybe you 'll even bring that left ankle up onto the side of the right leg if you do that pull the toes back to protect the knee joint make sure that that bottom leg is secure find the place of your leg that feels comfortable for you today hands your heart and bring your awareness with you notice your connection to the floor here notice the length in the spine the crown reaching up for the Sun softness in the chest and shoulders and face [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] when you 're ready you 're opening softly your eyes letting your hands come down and unravelling early just do the other side keeping the left leg steady begin to explore the options for the right leg maybe crossing over maybe letting the ankle come up onto the side not on the knee but on this line flexing the foot if you choose that option remember to keep the spine tall and the bottom leg in good alignment bring the hands to the hop maybe close the eyes again with the earth beneath your feet the sky above your head and with your heart within hell that gentle rhythm of your breath like this south of the tree the life loss ROI [Music] again when you 're ready gently coming back and unraveling take a breath in to being mounted and just notice the effects and tremors when you 're ready to going to gently extend through the right leg now again you might just do one leg at a time or you might take both out let the knees pop up a little bit pull the toes back and hold the chair of you like as you come forward from the hips make sure your spine is long and the biggest thing to look for here is that you can breathe softly slowly and gently you 're making your way into a shape that feels right and where your breath can flow may be bringing your heads further down your legs and letting the head drop but Owen leave that feels right for you again let your breath be your guide here [Music] the next inhale press your you need come back into sitting Mountain again [Music] and let 's do another forward fold this time we 'll take the left leg first or just stay with the left leg bring the right as well knees are soft we fold from the hips and again just making your way to wherever feels good today for you being sure that if there 's any pressure in your head or chest that you don 't drop your head below your heart fill the back body breathing as you inhale now pressing into your feet and as many breaths as slowly as you need start to rise on up bring your feet back to sitting Mountain again take a breath and then if you 'd like to you can move into a bit more of a comfortable seat so you might like to move back in your chair and let your back rest but don 't forget about the space we need to breathe well so make sure you have space in your spine in your torso if you have a wall behind you could rest your head on the wall like and you might rest your hands up onto your lap now let the eyes gently soften or close and again now start to bring your awareness within notice again the physical sensations of the body maybe they feel a little different now after the class notice again how the breath feels the space that it 's taking up the way it 's flowing within allow your breath once again to become your focus skin it notice the sense of expansion as you inhale and softening as you exhale that sense of growth that sense of release [Music] and just allow your breath to bring about that softness and release in your physical body now letting all the muscles that joins the organs soften as you exhale breath by breath just letting go a little more and a little more [Music] as your body softened your mind also softens the emotions of men and any that do come along just simply flow it away again likely always be clouds no need to follow them I 'll get caught up in them right now facts there 's no need to really can just simply be [Music] so let your breath guide you to that place within it 's quiet still [Music] where there is nothing but peace [Music] and in this place of quiet stillness within you know that you are completely safe completely loved deeply protected so it 's okay here to just let go [Music] it 's okay here to just simply be [Music] just for another moment nothing to do nowhere to go just simply be [Music] simply be [Music] I know it is how it feels to just simply be and remember this feeling know that you can return here whenever you like this place of simply being is yours alone no one else can touch it it 's always accessible and available to you so feel free to come back whenever you like bring your awareness now back to your breath start to let the breath deepen a little bit within the body and as it does just start to follow it back until you become aware of your body you want smore noticing the sensations the connection of your places of your body that are bit more and more when you feel ready to move start to wiggle your fingers and your toes and any other movements that feel right for you you can make those now and whatever way it is that you want to wake up is unique to you so just move organically without too much thinking about it and eventually we will all meet in sitting Mountain but there 's no rush [Music] when you do get to sitting Mountain you can bring your hands up to your heart center and here you might like to just acknowledge yourself for showing up today for being here looking after yourself and let 's acknowledge each other by bowing and saying namaste to each other namaste everybody thank you so much for joining me in that chair over practice I trust you I have a beautiful day I look forward to see you next time namaste bye for now _"

lines so in putting that into a shape we 'll do a square to start with so if you draw a square I recommend using a pencil such as a HB or a 2h or something of the sort these clean just to draw out lines use a ruler if you like but just for practice it doesn 't matter so then we can start adding our lines so we 're gonna follow the direction of the square and we 're going to pretend that the Sun is over here which means this side is going to be lightest so we 're going to start on this side and just start adding those lines almost all the way across they don 't have to be perfect and just keep going just like that next we 're gonna do the same thing and we 're gonna fill in the gaps between these lines just to make it a bit darker as we go to the left so we 're gonna stop maybe about here so just a little bit less than where we were before so add in those lines as well this removes the white which makes it just look darker in itself [Music] essentially we 're just coloring in with line [Music] there we go so the next one we 're just going to do the exact same thing closer to the left [Music] and I 'm not pressing any harder or softer I 'm just adding more lines in there just like that and you notice that we 're starting to go from really light a little bit darker a little bit darker and then it 's going even more dark just because we 're removing the white that 's coming through those lines so I want us to continue choosing the next point you don 't have to do the arrows with practice you 'll just know and just add some more and you 'll notice that there 's barely any more white peeking through the lens don 't have to finish in the exact same spot they can be longer or shorter than the others just as long as you 're filling in those gaps and you can go over other lines too it doesn 't have to be just in between okay so we 've done that one and now we 're going to go one or two more times and just really really make our darkest shade a square is a really good way in the same direction okay this one is hatching so try that in a circle now it 'll be a little bit different and I 'm going to use a different pencil as well to show you the difference between how dark these pencils can actually get going from hate fear a 2h to something like a 4b okay so we 're gonna start again the exact same way we did with the square just with our lines this time we 're going in a moon shape and it 's a moon shape just because of the direction of the circle we want to keep that round shape going so now we 're going to add in our next lines and we 're just going to fill in the gaps you 'll notice that this pencil is already darker than the other one and I 'm not pressing down any harder it 's a really really nice technique really really easy if you want to create shading and shadows in an artwork with limited amount of time to so this is really really good if you don 't want to doing a little sketch out in the street or in a cafe this technique is beautiful and just keep going adding those lines you 'll notice I 'm not doing those arrows just keep going off the original line you did and just start making them shorter and you 'll notice it starts to become darker and which the circle will turn from 2d to essentially 3d just due to the shading okay we 're going to continue adding some smaller ones and then smaller again but you can do after that one is just fine fine tune or just neaten up the edge just by going back around notice we haven 't done much to the other side just because that 's gonna be our lightest point you could go even further across if you 'd like in a round direction however it 's just all about having a go and seeing what looks good personally to you so your lines might be longer or shorter than mine it doesn 't matter it 's just about practicing this technique and seeing how you can go with it so after 'll notice that again black our square the Sun is coming from this direction which is why this side is essentially white so it 's got no shadows on it this means our shadow is gonna follow our dark our dark side and we 're just gonna start with some lines again and we don 't have to do too many and then continuing with that hatching technique adding some shorter lines and then shorter lines again there we go they 're touching I hope you 've learned something from that keep practicing you can use this technique with anything we can use it by drawing a chair a tree you could draw a candle anything in your household for anything or any people that you 're sketching so it 's a really really effective technique and it 's such a beautiful simple one that you can use so we 're going to the next one so our next technique is cross-hatching so similar to hatching we have these lines and I 'm really lacking this pencil it 's a 4b you can use charcoal you can use pen but and easy to create those darkest darker colors so just like hatching we do these lines and then for our cross hatching we 're just crossing over those in the opposite direction so to make a darker shade our lines are going to be really close together as such and then to make a lighter shade we 're just going to increase the distance between those lines and it sort of looks like a net this is meant to look further away because it 's darker and again like hatching the closer the lines together the less white that we will have which means the darker it will look so what you can do with this as well if you 'd like it to be darker go over the top again so you don 't have to be perfect and go in-between you can go over the top add some more and just layer that until you 're really happy with it and I think this is a really really effective technique it 's very quick and it doesn 't have to look too neat as well so if you time or pause this video and then we 'll move on to drawing a square there 's a really really good techniques to practice and use in the following videos that I 'll be sending through to bankstown library they 'll be posting them I 'd love you to comment in the videos if you 've got any pictures of your drawings okay so again like hatching we 're gonna go in the same direction of the square and I 'm not gonna go all the way across just to leave some light in there and that 's really really good just to add some contrast in your image I 'm not pressing down too hard okay and then what we 're gonna do is just start adding some opposite lines and he 's going to be really really close together again they don 't have to be perfect you don 't need to get a ruler and space them out just have a practice okay and now I 'm just gonna create some more contrast and just add some more lines and some more cross hatching so you can to add some more and like hatching I 'm gonna start just going less and less across just to create that gradient it 's our darkest point the lines are gonna be really close together and then they 're just going to slowly go further apart just keep layering them on I really really like this technique and I think is very effective it 's very fast it 's got a really nice texture to it there we go that one is cross-hatching you can always get a rubber and rub out the the outline this is a really cool one to add shadow to as well so similar to hatching just do those lines do some more and then start really close and have those crosses really close together and then move them further apart now we go have a go at that one and pause the video if you 'd like next we 're going to do a circle and a circle is a little bit more challenging as you have to move the cross-hatching angles with the angle of the circle so again we 're going to round so it is going to go around in the direction of a sir also start adding those lines and then we 're just going to cross over just crisscross with that one and just continue adding some more can do some of you here and then just continue making smaller patches along have a play around with this one there 's not really a right or wrong just as long as you create that depth and the difference between the darks and the lights [Music] just adding these patterns in [Music] and then you can find up a stock aside by just going over the outline again okay just continue adding some smaller hatches just around the edge where it would be darker oh my god so that should be our circle again you 'd want to do a shadow start with that hatching technique make sure it 's almost the same color as your outline or your darkest at the bottom and then just add those crosses in as well there we go you can add this to objects I 'm in a garden so you can add a leaf and I would play around drawing some different objects and it 's really effective even just by doing it once you don 't have to overlay sometimes once it 's just enough and you 're just creating that criss-cross effect that 's really really good for creating shadow let 's go in one direction and then just over in the next so I hope that makes sense police have a practice if you 've got any questions pop them in the comments and I 'll try and address them in the next video but we will be using these techniques for our further drawing tutorials such as still laughs drawing will be doing ocean drawing some flower and leaf drawing plenty of options that all of these techniques would go really really well in completing those this one was hatching I mean cross hatching [Applause] a next technique is going to be stippling or dotting I think you may have seen it before where an image has just an insane amount of dots covering the entirety and they managed to create shadow and depth which is our darks hard to do this in a really really large surface area usually small objects or items we will do it with I start by drawing a small square or smaller than we 've done before and this one essentially is where you just create lots and lots and lots of dots you can use pen you can use charcoal pencils really effective I really love using a fine tip felt pen I think that turns out really really really nicely pencils really good too you can fiddle with different colors and different objects as well we 're gonna start with a square though just fill in the majority of the square with some dots and it doesn 't matter if you 've got any lines like that sometimes it happens and this is a really time-consuming one so you don 't have to worry about getting some of those lines in once you 've done that we 'll pretend our sunlight is coming from this side again this is going to be our lighter side which means this will have the least amount of dots on there so we 're 're going to just start adding lots and lots and lots of dots and we 're going to cover as much of the white on the left with dots hopefully you can see that okay [Music] and they don 't have to be perfect either doing quite quickly filling in the space with those dots and you 'll notice that it looks quite dark and that 's because we 're removing the white of the paper and covering it with lots of dots this one is very time-consuming so I 'd use in a larger picture this for smaller bits such as the lid on a teapot maybe maybe the shading on a spoon or a knife and fork might be a door handle or a leaf or the middle of a flower something quite small you can do it on a large surface as well but it just takes a long time because you really have to just keep adding those dots and just continue going along I 'm not pressing the pencil any harder or softer I 'm just continuing to add more dots as we go across spreading those dots out and add less the more dots you have the darker it will look and the less stops you have the lighter it will look this is the time when you can be drawing with me watching the video you can pause it if you like and have a go it 's just really about getting those dots down [Music] I think it looks really beautiful too I think it 's such an effective technique and it 's very soft as well so I 'm going to start maybe spreading those out a little bit more I 'm not going to put the dots as close together which means I 'm doing less but we 're gonna slowly do that so that there 's no really harsh lines it 's going to be a soft gradient from lots of dots to not many and shouldn 't really notice a stopping point I 'm slowly adding less dots and spreading them out a bit [Music] you should start to notice this side being the darker side and this side being the lighter side [Music] continue doing those dots [Music] [Music] once you 've done it with one medium which is one utensil or one I guess objects such as a pencil or a charcoal pencil a piece of charcoal might use pen try with something else so maybe have a go in your own time just at home and just try just with a different medium so I might try with pen next time as well just to get a feel and a bit more practice using different different mediums to create our dotting technique you 'll notice that I 've got a few lines in there that 's just it just happens so just if you do it don 't stress too much if you 'd like you can rub it out but you 've noticed that we go from really dark really close together dots to more spread out dots and I might want to make this darker and I just go over the top maybe press down a little bit harder and just overlay those dots with some more so you can always go back back in and just like hatching and cross-hatching you can 'll notice we 've got our darkest a little bit lighter a bit lighter and then this is our whitest because we have more paper showing through foreshadowing just start at our darkest and just add some more dots just in the direction you 'd like to go and when you 'd like to go lighter if the shadow wants to if you want the shadow to phase out just spread them out until there 's no more there we go so that one is dotting so I think this is a really effective technique it 's really really beautiful you can do it on any object in the house you 'd like anything you 'd like to draw however it is very time-consuming so I really recommend doing it on the smaller objects or items in your artworks however if you 'd like to have a challenge and cover a large surface area go for it I 'd love to see it I 've done that before and spent many hours on drawing a piece of rope but it does turn out beautiful and it is worth it that shading or blending and it 's really really effective I think using a 4 B 5 B 6 B and so on pencil they turn out really really nicely however if all you 've got is a HB or a 2h that 's okay you just won 't get the results of the really really dark the really really light if you use charcoal that 's really effective however it smudges a lot you can get these from a 2 shop they 're called paper stamps or blending sticks they come in many sizes and they 're really really good for just going over the bits instead of using your finger when adding extra blending and softness to your image so if you 've got a pencil I recommend a pencil I don 't recommend the pen as it 's really really hard to blend efficiently with a pen as you can 't press really too much softer with a ballpoint has the same amount of ink really comes out whereas if you use a pencil the softer you press the lighter it 's going to be so I 'm nice because you can get really really dark tones by not pressing too hard and what I want us to do it 's just using the side of our pencil and resting our hand on the paper we 're just gonna use this motion here and press quite dark and just slowly go to the right or left if you 're left-handed and using that motion as you go along slowly lift your pencil off the paper or press down a little bit lighter until there 's barely any color showing on the paper so you 'll notice that 's really really dark going lighter lighter until almost white so I think this is really really beautiful it 's very soft you can go from dark to light to dark you can go from light to dark so just have a go with me watching the video you can pause it if you 'd like so here we 're going from light slowly pressing darker darker again and just continue doing that motion and slowly pressing down until you get that really nice contrast from light to dark you can is really beautiful especially if you 're doing a 3d object where the lightest part of the object is in the middle so if I have a triangle in shade always on the angle of our outline it doesn 't have to be perfect either so I 'm still doing our same motions but in an upward direction instead of a side with directions and then the slowly as we go press lighter lifts the pencil off the page towards the middle you don 't want it to be too dark so lighting that up you can always go back in with the rubber if you 'd like to and then darkest it on the other side start bringing bringing in that shading getting lighter and lighter towards the middle and you 'll see now it looks a bit like a cone you can change the shape of the change the shape if you 're black adding that roundness at the bottom and just coloring that in and you can use a rubber to fine-tune or even lighten little sections of your image as well so we 've just turned is a really really beautiful soft technique using this it 's better for softer pencils especially charcoal it works really really well you might not notice the difference it just blends that out so you don 't have any of that chalking this all those groups and from that I mean little gaps in between you can fill those in nice and softly just by going over with a blending stick you don 't have to use this it 's not essential I usually like to leave it but if you 'd like it to be softer you definitely have a go getting one of these again it 's from a 2.00 shop really really cheap and they 're really effective really good at doing shadows very very very soft and you don 't even need to add any more pencil just like that there we go so I hope you 've learned something from this video we 've done blending we 've done hatching we 've done cross hatching and dotting next week we 'll be doing some still life drawing so I 'll be setting up my own your own and then start adding some of the techniques from this one into our future drawings so please get practicing have a go try your best try with some charcoal with some pencils pen whatever you 've got felt-tip pens really really good for these and there 's many plenty of resources online yeah happy drawing thank you _"

    "text": "come on Doc three hello there good evening everyone we 're here at the Green anchor splash park webinar discussing the concept designs for a really exciting new splash park in green echo I 'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land that we live and work on the durog and eora peoples and pay my respect to their elders past present and emerging my name is Doug melon I 'm in the community engagement team at city of Canterbury Bankstown and I 'm joined by Sharon Gao our graduate digital engagement officer she 's going to be helping things run smoothly behind the scenes Emily Forest is team leader city transformation in a moment she 'll be giving a presentation and Colin Dagger is a Landscape Architect at Council in the city transformation team and he 'll be helping to answer some of your questions so this webinar is part of a series called CB TV keep connected which is one of council 's initiatives to keep us active and connected to each other and to what 's happening locally during the pandemic and the physical distancing tick here we go here 's a bit more information about keep connected that 's one councils website coming up this week we have preschool storytime fitness sessions a virtual art gallery with local artists performances by local singers and even a webinar on saving energy at home you can find out more by searching CB TV or by going to council 's website using the short link CB City so I mentioned that I 'm in the community engagement team and our job is to get feedback with from and partner with community members on projects in your community and one of the ways we do that is through our online feedback portal called have yours this is it here on the screen and right now you can have your say on projects such as

green arrow splash from now until Sunday the 21st of June we 're asking for feedback on concept designs for this new all abilities water splash park for the northeast corner of Roberts Park in green anko next to the sports fields and it 's anticipated to open in lay 2021 it 's a pretty exciting new project and it will be the first free splash park of its kind in Canterbury banks town and it will give kids and families access to high quality water play close to home without the name to travel or pay it 'll have a dream time story about tiddalick the frog '_''_234.57 woven through it and kids will be able to follow tiddalick through the park and learn from the same name this splash park will be great for being active and getting outdoors which we all know is really good for health and well-being it 'll also be a really good place for families to meet up and for kids to play together now what does a splash park include well what does this this project include specifically it includes water play and the slash Park one is a bit more exciting than the other one is a bit calmer than the other and Emily will go through that in a minute it 'll include open space and landscaping upgrades that means trees and terraces and things like that it 'll include seating and shade it 's being designed to be inclusive for all abilities that means people with disabilities it 'll have toilets and change rooms it 'll have an accessible toilet an adult change toilet and a family change room and it 'll have barbecues and picnics shelters too now I 'm gonna show you where it 's going to be in Green acre just gonna add a layer on this map so you can see Waterloo Road shops in Green acre and we go down Waterloo Road a bit you can see that pink section that 's where this splash park is going to be on acacia Avenue and it 's next to the sports fields what 's the timing on this project so on Sunday the 21st we will close the feed back window and then we 'll spend much of the rest of this year working on the the detailed designs for the project construction will begin in early 2021 the splash park will open in late 2021 in time for summer and we 're seeking funding for a dry playground component which Emily will show you Shirley now before we get started I 'd like to take a moment to get to know who 's here I 'm going to share a poll I 'll stop sharing my screen and here comes a poll so on your screen you should see a few questions give those a tick based on which of the below describes you best and I 'll give you 10 or 20 seconds that 's power through this and just ten seconds more and we will wrap up it 's a flash poll five four three two one here we go so we 've got a couple of people who live in or near Green Eko we 've got a bunch of people who are excited about this flash part which is great and we have some people whose families are likely to use the splash park that 's awesome it 's great to have you here I ran through them without showing you so you can see you believe in our near Green acre you 're excited about the splash park or what your family is likely to use this splash park all right so in a moment I 'm going to throw to Emily for the presentation on their concept of designs and during during her presentation you can feel free to ask your own questions or comment on another person 's question and upvote other questions at the bottom of your screen you 'll see a Q&A button that 's if you 're on a desktop and if you 're on a mobile device just have if you can find the Q&A button and it should give you the option to ask a question now I 'm going to ask everyone to please be polite and respectful of everyone in the room today and please also be conscious that we 're here to talk about Green Acres splashback so we 'll keep conversation and questions to those if there are any other projects or issues you 'd like to discuss please feel free to call councils customer service on nine seven zero seven nine thousand maybe after the webinar stay for the good stuff or you can email me in response to the follow-up email I 'll send after this webinar so thanks so much for your help in keeping us on topic now I 'd like to introduce Emily forest over to you looks like Emily 's muted I can 't hear you can you hear me now yes we can hi everyone my name is Emily forest as Doug 's aunt I 'm a landscape architect and arborist and I 've worked for Council for many years and I feel a real connection to the local government area I feel very strongly and very passionately about creating inclusive play spaces I know that 's shared by our mayor and councillors they 've shown significant support and enthusiasm for this project and they 've also allocated significant amounts of grant funding and they 're really excited about creating a landmark feature destination and a quality free water play park that our community really deserves don 't stolen a lot of my thunder in terms of introducing the project so I 'm going to just provide a little bit of background information perhaps around some of the strategies it 's led us to this point in particular Council as an amalgamated entity has had to align a lot of its strategic plans and in particular the the playgrounds and play spaces strategic plan was adopted by council in September 2018 and that looked at all of the the play spaces across the whole of the local government area and looked at where the real needs were where perhaps we had an oversupply and where we had an undersized for our community so a lot of the either tier 1 tier 2 or tier 3 T 1 being the destination regional type play spaces that were deemed for a longer stay so they 'd be provided with a higher level of amenities such as you know toilets and shade and those sorts of things in addition to and sorry this Roberts Park at Green acre and the Green Acres Square she 's it meets those criteria and is a chi level tier one play space another of the the plans has been recently adopted by council in August last year was the an aquatic supporting plant you 'd be aware that Greenacre pool will be closing permanently but also as a bit of an offset to that but also in meeting the recreational needs in the green acre area we did ask the question you know would you be supportive of a free water play park in the green acre area and over 70% of people did agree that that would be supported and welcomed into that area but also why Green acre I mean Green acre is actually a central location within our LGA it 's at George 's Hall it 's another eight kilometres to the east to hit our other boundary at Elwood and about eight kilometres to the south you you make the Georges River in picnic point so the southern boundary of our LGA so green area is really quite centrally a place within our LGA and quite suitable for for this amenity and the other third plan that some quite important too is our CBC D 2028 the community strategic plan which sets out all of the spending and all of the across the different areas so not just the roads rates and rubbish but community facilities and community you know playgrounds and sports fields and so forth so it is supported in that plan as well another really critical guiding document is the New South Wales everyone can play guidelines for inclusive playing now council was an active participant in putting together those guidelines and so indeed was our consultant designers who are working on this project with us some place design group so they were quite instrumental in putting those some that 's document together for the for the have been thoroughly researched and they bring forth three really key principles guiding inclusivity and inclusive play and those are can I get there can i play can I stay those different items can I get there what 's about is it accessible of people to people feel welcome in the park are there good pathways throughout is it accessible is it easy to navigate she 's a good signage can i play when i get there is there something that I can do is there something that my my toddler and my teenage child can can play on recognizing that not everybody can play on everything but there is something there for everybody and can I stay is around what 's the level of comfort that I have when I get to to that play space you know can I is there seating is there shade can I have a drink of water is there toilets for myself and my child so all of those things are part of the lens that we look at when we 're we 're designing so about the site itself the site really became quite obvious that there was a really an ideal space in the northeast corner of the park sorry dug of you are we able to share the the image of the of the one set plan absolutely I 'll just bring that up now get the concept plans here we go this is the one you 're after it 's a master yes yes you can see that okay I can see that now I hope everyone else can alright so this was the site that was chosen it 's bounded by Waterloo Road napoleon road and have anew we do have five residents to the north of the site we have green acre public school which is just shaded by this grey box we have an Early Childhood Center a neighborhood center parking and then there 's some facilities that support the existing sports field so none of those will actually be changed as a result of this project although we have I do identify that there is some potential for future upgrade of the the existing skatepark there in number five so we 're we 're looking is down here in the northeast corner so we 've we 're looking at retaining the existing carpark that 's there and we were able to also gain some funding that 's actually outside of this project we 'll a bit clever with that so we 'll be refurbishing that existing carpark and realign marking to incorporate the accessible car parking spaces that 's nice and level and most level entry into the into the playground itself I 'm also further along acacia Avenue we are able to create sixteen spaces rear to curb so people can also visit there and unload and it 's quite easy access to the play space itself we 're very aware that the that the green anchor public school also utilize the carpark and access their school in the rear gate so that will also still be able to occur from both of those car parks once the new pay space is open okay move on to the next one I don 't have control of this do I know I 'm just gonna switch to a different view if you 'll bear with we go nice to have a little break midstream hmm and over to the next page there you go I 'm not seeing oh my apologies how 's that that 's much better okay great all right so new John we just had a look at the the overall size and now I 'll have a look at the closeup of the the actual arrangement I do have to stress that this is a concept plan so what you 're seeing here is probably the best guess of where things will go and how they 'll be arranged it 's done with a lot of consideration and thought but it 's not the final result so you will you will find that theum the final design will be a little bit different to the arrangement that we 've got here but the fundamentals will be the same we will be designing for the entire play space although I have to say we are not currently funded for the dry play section of the of the play space at the moment we can deliver car parking the amenities the water splash the north it was this is a result of councilors really wanting to invest in very best water play facility and to really give the community there 's the splash park that is high level high quality and as good as anywhere you 'll find comparable in other parts around Sydney and also we want to make sure that the design is ready so that if funding does become available or particularly grant funding that we are ready to go and we can possibly you know put in applications for that in order to deliver the dry plate but we 're certainly designing it all as one but delivering it at this point into two separate stages so do you have control don 't can you go onto the next slide sure all right I just like to go back to Italy dream time story I 'm actually gonna have to call in in a minute through that but I actually was a bit remiss I was supposed to also do a acknowledgement of country and I might just sneak that in now if I can um I 'd also of the land the subject of which we are now meeting we were very excited to incorporate a First Nations story into the design of the park and embed the story in we 've been talking to some of the the local elders it 's a real opportunity for us to not only educate our young local population but to also embed some of the of the magic that is the Dreamtime stories and and the lessons that we can learn from that Colin did you want to add anything onto to this so I know you were very passionate about this particular aspect of the of the park are you sorry just putting my microphone on there you know when we when we integrate First Nations culture into it is the park it 's really important that we we just don 't give it a bit of a brown wash the whole concept of the Dreaming story of tiddly which is a New South Wales based story is about taking that fable for one of a better term and integrating it to every facet of the park so it able to have aboriginal art from the drag nation in the park itself will be able to have a chronological series of interpretive items that will take you through the park so it 's possible for parents to lead the children 's of the park and relate the Dreamtime story to how the park is actually designed and constructed and this is a way that we can celebrate you know our indigenous culture and understand how that fits into country which is the very essence of their foundation fabric and it 's something that as as the landscape architects that 's one of our key action plans is to to promote First Nations culture and interact it to the benefit of the public you may notice also that we 've got the story weaving from the dry play through the wet play as well that doesn 't matter it can actually start at anyway we 've got the beginnings of the storytelling in at the story circle in the of toddlers play area but it does it does also run flow through with the different play elements through the play slide because we 've actually got some images of some of the interpretive type elements that we looking at so the top sort of corner shows sort of a story circle so it 's an opportunity for you know discovery of little elements that can be hidden within different play elements with within the park certainly within the you know the the ground plane or some of the balance beams or totems no this has been designed yet this is all still to be worked through you know in consultation with our First Nations people and probably local children as well it 's really great to get them involved in in the designing of their play space so it 's it 's quite wonderful that we have a rather large and very interested primary school next door and I 'm sure that they would be more than happy to you know be part of that process as well okay so I 'll move on now get down to business with the actual play space itself now I want to just describe the difference between a splash pad and water play is this larger sort of area here is quite a level playing surface it 's a hard stand so concrete but with different colors and different elements of sprays that you know pop-ups are Jets and fountains and different spray effects that happen in this space and in in the middle of course there 's the you know giant feature mega soaking bucket which will have everybody squealing with joy the idea is that the this is quite an active space we find the children typically run through these spaces so you might find that it 's um dominated by the sort of older children so maybe 5 through 12 we want to make sure that there 's also a quiet area that also has no depths of the spouts and the gazes that it 's just offline here just so slightly separated just to the to the east there I 'm in our water play section so this is more of the quiet player and Doug mentioned in his introduction that it 's more about the the quiet play about cause and effect with water so water channels or leaves and so forth like we were used to doing with brothers and sisters and so forth you know racing leads down a a channel sluice gates and that sort of thing little small water water cascades and that is it a slightly lower area so the fall of the land is is so that this water play area is slightly lower and then we 've got a ramp that circles around back up into the active play area I 'm also you 'll notice that these there 's some little almost little brown rectangles sort of around the site we 're looking at those that 's a sorry that 's a shelter that 's a little picnic shelter I was looking at more of these train tracks sorry I don 't have control of the mouse here so it 's a yeah those ones incidental seating sort of samstone type logs that provides internet in incidental seating for parents too I 'm sitting them serve and watch their children and also some grass embankment sitting above so you can look down over the splash pad itself okay just on some of the splash elements we did want some wow factor so we are looking at going for something that 's really spectacular in terms of the the mega bucket who needs one when we can have for all of these different jumps spray elements are proposed for the park so there is quite a variety of different types of fun you can play on your own or you can play spraying your brother or sister it 's you know it 's up to you but they 're generally very active lots of fun lots of different water effects with the splash pad too we are looking at that being predominantly it will be a little bit seasonal we think probably summer and shoulder periods all the operational but it will probably be closed for some time during the winter for servicing we can uncouple those different elements and and service them and change them around and put them back in but the water play because it is from a hand pump operation and children tend not to get our saturated when they 're playing that will be open all what the operational morale will be for in terms of staffing the the water play park it is anticipated that it will be quite popular and we and we do anticipate that we will probably have staff there at least in the in the summer periods when it is quite busy certainly as a help station or somewhere to give out band-aids if we have a you know some Gray 's knees or the help point in terms of the the water quality in the water that 's some cycling through the system itself we are guided by the same rules that guide swimming pools so the New South Wales health guidelines in terms of filtering the water treating the water recycling it through and using UV filtration as well we are going to set up an automatic shutdown and alerts when we do have you know a pollution incident in or an accident within that and it is treated recycle water but potable water so we do have those balanced checks and balances built in Mike move on dunk next one now just I will go through the the I said before designing for the full play experience on the site we wanted to focus the the dry play at the top of the hill this is the sort of the crest of the play space with the hero play element number one right down the south end of the park is what we refer to as a hero element we 're looking at this stage of that being quite a large Twin Towers or series of towers with rope bridge in between and slide and also Giant Swing we know that we have families where there 's multiple children playing at once so we 're looking at different lots of swings so those ones that you 're pointing out there dad 's at number seven they 're actually the more traditional type swings but the Giant Swing is here number two over in this bottom corner and we 've designed those particularly away from the toddler 's play because they tend to be again more active playing on the children all the pathways through here are accessible so prams and wheelchairs can navigate their way through out throughout is similar to the one in bankstown siegen 's where you can wheel a wheelchair onto that and and children are in a chair can actually play alongside able-bodied children we also do believe we 've had a question can we add a flying box flying folks it 's not part of what we 're proposing at the moment background books that suggestion on board they 're always very popular but we do have a couple in the LGA already so we 'll see about that so back to where I was going we 've also at the Peregrine ground trampolines which are great for again you can wheel the wheelchair onto that or somebody who 's got movement issues can also move on to that kind of platform and feel a different sort of sensation I mean Hill slides as well are always very popular and they 're always a great way to to make use of changing land form that you have so scramble wall up the side and then the hill slides over all of this will be putting shade sails so we will do a full path they 're just shown as a as an indication but we do a full analysis so we do get maximum coverage and we do a combination of tree planting particularly on the north and the western sides and in combination with some shade cells as well right moving on next one so I think we 've seen most of those so might go on to the next one which is around materials what do I need to say here we are looking at providing picnic shelters that would cater for big groups as well as small groups we do know that we will have they 'll be quite popular so we are putting them throughout the the playground as well sorry not sorry through the play space so near the equipment near the water play and also down in the kickabout area down the bottom plus there 'll be a lot of incidental seating in terms of the the sandstone logs and walls and so forth we are looking at doing durable surfaces so concrete painted concrete and you know different stones through that to give some sort of that have a sight impairment but they will be wide enough to be accessible and also we need to be able to get our gets into service the playground occasionally so you know having wide enough pathways so that we could run out around service vehicles in typing up of mulch and planting and so forth cleaning emptying bins and so forth bins aren 't shown on this plan yet that is something that we will of course incorporate into the play space but that will come in a much more detailed phase we the last thing to go through is the amenities building and what we 're providing with our amenities so we did some work with the local we consulted with the Watsons women 's group a group of community representatives and we had wonderful conversation with them around you know what was the best way for us to design the amenity building for this type of facility very definitely the message was to have separate male and female toilets which we have done we are also proposing to have wash stations that are external to the toilet hand I can just go over and do that on the outside of the building and still be inside of the parent they don 't have to go inside an enclosed facility in order to wash their hands or feet we also are including a wheelchair accessible bathroom at the end of that block also under the same continuous roof line but in the other building line we 're proposing at the at the end at the front end a kiosk which has beautiful sight lines across the park so that will be a kiosk space where our staff will be based there will probably be a small amount of goods like halal pies and maybe hot chips coffees teas water those sorts of things for sale in nappies as well possibly what a nappies sunscreen those sorts of things that we normally find on the Aquatic Center offer immediately behind that we have changing places amenity which is the adult change facility we our council is one of the first or the first to deliver one of these with in a public place pace with Bankstown city gardens and disabled or those that have continence issues so it 's a hydraulic adult size change tables and the hoist facilities so particularly designed for inclusive eating immediately behind that we have another change change room which is we considered you know what does what does a father do if he 's at this water play park with his daughter and he needs to change her in a ghetto dry and change her in a place that 's um private and secure and that 's what we 're providing this room that that 's people can go in and just close the door change their child and move on family change room behind that we have the the pump and store and that 's accessible directly off some acacia Avenue so through easy access that 's where our chemicals will be stored one thing I didn 't mention up near the nexus point so we 're these two buildings meet we 're actually going to provide for for a street car kind of amenities to come in we don 't think that this facility will be able to support a full-time happen in other parks they 're not always a good business a business to establish so perhaps by introducing coffee cuts at peak times it will be a way to grow or incubate a business or it could be even as social a social enterprise some arrangement that is established there I think that all I 've got I 've covered a fair bit of ground I 'm sure there 's been questions that have come in I haven 't seen what they 're but I suppose some of the key aspects that I 'd like to just reinforce is that it is an inclusive play space the water play park and the dry play we do want people to feel welcome in that space so old and young the more people we have visiting the more eyes are on the playground so there 's less likelihood of crime occurring we have designed this with a safety by design principles and we are fitting out the park with help post and CCTV and a limited amount of lighting about some security lighting but certainly capacity for those to be to to I 'll cover from car parking as well so I know that always comes up as an issue we are maintaining the existing car parking there which is 22 spaces and six of those are going to be accessible on the Acacia street we 've got new car parking of 16 Risha curb any mortally Road over with the neighborhood center we also have 42 spaces before of those are accessible so that 's some 80 car parking spaces that are off street and we 've got about 40 space 50 spaces with the shoulder to curve along the perimeter of the Roberts Park that 's it for me I 've talked a lot so I 'm happy to answer any questions great thank you so much Emily what a fantastic overview and you have been talking about you deserve you deserve a sip of water there we go so I 'll just remind everyone please do feel free to ask some questions we 've got the Q&A function and depending on the device you 're using it might be at the bottom of the screen it 's called had a few questions coming already that we 've touched on for example the Flying Fox the family change room and we touched on safety at night and you 'll also see that colin has made some comments in QA as well we 've got another question they 've said sorry if I missed it how much shade is planned I do want to flag that in some of the in some of the engagement metier we haven 't actually shown the shade that is planned because in the picture it shades the equipment that 's also plant so there 's heaps of shade plant even though it 's not in the pictures and Emily could you elaborate a little bit sure so we always look through a combination of different types of shade obviously we plant trees but they don 't provide instant shade we have to wait a few years for those we do make sure that key elements such as slides face south or west and also have feet on them as well so we do an analysis that shows where the shade will be projected shade of the year so it 's a bit of a moving feast also in the in the splash pad part of the park we will have fixed umbrellas that will be providing shade as well so it 's a combination of different things up in the nexus area there is there is a little bit of shade there but not a lot of seating in that particular area but if there is for example a little bit of a downpour you could run in and you know get some protection from the from the rain about 40 people can fit into that space yeah cool thank you we also have a question about perhaps a comment I 'd love to see some more thought put into the packaging options so that waste doesn 't become an issue sustainability team will be happy to hear that comment and I 'm sure we 'll see it in the results as well we 've got another comment we need more shade and shelters around the splash park because parents will sit all around and most need to keep eyes on kids we 've new question will the will the park be open 7 or will there be closing hours Emily or Colin who 's who 's keen on commenting told me to go would you want to go it 's um it 's not designed to be 24 hours obviously it is open we 're not we 're not going to gauge this it 's we 're not planning at this stage of it being fenced however we can make sure that the the water elements don 't operate after a certain time so we can certainly program those so they 're not operational you know all through the night yeah I mean security lighting that is probably important particularly around the buildings to make sure that it 's not people hanging around in that space but a lot of this will be you know we may sort of need to assess as we go what sort of what sort of what 's happening in the space and and how we need to manage it yeah so does that answer the question yeah I think so thank you and well we 've got screen again so that so that I can show some of the great artist impressions of the of the park that kind of put you on the ground in the splash park and see what it what it looks and feels like here we 've got this is an impression of the splash pad heaps of kids you can see heaps of greenery heaps of space for parents and carers and friends to sit down and watch maybe not get too wet I 'm going to scroll down a bit more to something else on the heavy or safe side here we go this is an example of the water play so we 're seeing kind of quieter play no big splashy things Emily talked about the the floating leaves and there 's even a cute little paper boat in there and this is the the future dry play and you can see we 've got the the hero play element which has a big slide on the left there we 've got a step free flat access for people on wheels and we 've got a couple of slides it looks like it 's stuck on the homepage message yeah I 'm just seeing the homepage you don 't oh yeah how 's that where did I lose you here we go does the this is the dry play we 've got the hero hero play feature on the left some slides in the center and Beckman slides and then clamoring on the wall on the right and did we see above us the water play cool we 've got another question can 't_''_2655.03 we make a splash park with water slides where kids can climb up and slide down I imagine a lot of hard decisions go into what features we put into a splash park like this Emily in Colin can either of you comment on how we choose the equipment and where there 's no water slide it was it was really important to to Marin counselors that we had a water play park that was free and accessible to all so if you start to look at elements that are like that so the larger ones with water slides and so forth they generally have at least sort of 30 to 40 centimeters of water in order for the slide to land in that then you need to start treating it more like a pool you have to have lifeguards on you have to have a significant amount of cost in terms of operational and operational staff so it 's a completely different type of of water play experience I think there are a few of those around obviously the Olympic swimming pool at the at home Bush has got that kind of water play there 's a quote Opia that out in Perryville but they 're both paid spaces and it was very council was really wanting to make sure that this was exists all of our community we have large families and and we you know recognize the fact that you know a day out at a water play park you know you shouldn 't have to cost and I 'm like cool thank you so much Emily and another question here I 'm wondering what features have been integrated to support native wildlife will there be nest boxes and artificial hollows wildcard I 'm privileged to hear our council offers officers talking about planting all the time and I am exposed to a lot of fans of native plantings that are really good for the environment Emily you 're one of those great advocates can you all tell us a bit more well I mean named native plants tend to be the better performers you know if you plant the right plant you know nine times out of ten and natives going to do a better job but I I 'm not hard and fast on though I do like exotic plantings as well so there will be a combination of both within this play space we 're not specifically designing or aiming for this to be to meet that need but there will be native plants throughout so sensory planting is is an important part of an inclusive play space so no different textures with different types of plants and different scents that come with those as well but we 're not specifically planning for it with this play space thank you alright everyone we 're going the questions seem to thanks for that and if you have any more questions please get them in now because otherwise we 're going to finish up in a couple of minutes and I want to finish showing my screen I 'll remind everyone that to have your say on this project please check out CB city have your say and that 's CBD city slash have your say and I 'll follow up with an email with more information about the project and how to get involved in our have your same website after this our feedback window closes on Sunday the 21st of June and then we 'll go into more detail designs with a goal of opening this up late next year in time for summer we had one or two questions come in quickly and we 'll address those before we finish up finish up planning to completed to be to complete the project by the summer of 2021 another question that 's come in can we discuss a basketball court a lot of kids in the area are interested in this spot Emily or Colin are you able to my what I started talking I mentioned that there is an area where there 's an existing skate park over near to further towards waddly Road that skate park is below par it 's not actually well used there is an opportunity to perfect size for a basketball court or to half courts to occupy that space so it is probably something we will recommend as part of the master planning for the entire site but it 's not on a on the delivery program for this particular flash park it 's been identified it 's been flagged but it 's it 's not part of the immediate delivery cool thank you alright with that we are going to finish up thanks so much for coming to this webinar and I hope to see you in person perhaps next time another time soon and do check out CBD city have your say and have your feedback on the project thanks so much everyone and have you night _"

    "text": "how you breathe you ready for some old pine school I do believe we 're up to listen to verse six hahahaha that right we 're ready to go with another lesson in fire in school all right what is your port remember this side your left so it 's a port you starve it is so it very good bow of the ship ha ha ha keep in our ah ah ah now standing off like a pirate good you should know this point now there we go that 's it because we 're walking with a laser a pod we 're stable like on a shaken deck excellent right now in these times of isolation now you 've been noticing a lot of these oak on the Facebook and stuff like that I 've been doing cooking glasses and I thought well maybe we should cover what we ate at sea and talk about a few dishes I won 't be preparing anything this time we could go into a kitchen so every time we don 't really have galleys here a lot of we didn 't know do it on the deck right because well you don 't want fries down below not a lot of room and you know what the boy is almost piece or crew and all the stuff will get stuck down there it actually cooked on top of the day we don 't really have cooks it one person there 'll be one of their duties and all that kind of stuff visit coat was a bit of a luxury and well you know food was a bit of luxury as well really great cuz we wouldn 't have that much moving around you know we 'd have just the basics because back in the days are you we were in the say you at you there 's no fridge right no electricity no fridge no canned goods there no cameras right nothing my cans so things only last as long as it lasted right so you start off with some fresh stuff and you think the fresh stuff cheese and veggies and fresh meats and stuff like that and fish but when they 're run out right you need that ran mean sex um rats again at it rate so you 'd add that for the first bit of the journey but you 're an Aussie journey Wow what else would you have well we used to have it remember a crow and the crows nests right we just have animals on there as well we have the dog I talked about a dog with a training dog right we also had cows for milk right and chickens for eggs right so we 'd add those chickens and eggs for a while and have the milk and that would help supplement outdoor you when we first got out for a while but eventually they need all their food right the cows and the chickens and eat all the chicken and cow food right so then what do you do well we leave the cow and the chicken right so then we have fresh food in the back bit then and then you be down to the basic sorry now basic meals because it 's the three main things right three main things hurry so we 'd have beef that was salted got so hard that some guys out and see would actually carve some up to make a belt buckle right I could make a belt buckle out of it if they needed some money so repairs that 's how I realize right and the other stuff we had they 've got ventually called hard taxi biscuits right well we had sea biscuits right and they like bread like flour and water made of flour and water and sometimes a bit of a dollar and it 'd be cooked a couple of times they cooked a lot really a couple of times they cook it right could take all the moisture out so I mean rock-hard and in the last up to a year solid to eat for up to a year a whole year without that right amazing right already could knock something over you put a nail in with its I 'm doing so alright take out your teeth if you don 't mean looking after your teeth told me Joe you brush your teeth kids right otherwise our death will take your teeth out right ah alright and it eventually get weevils in it which you know not that good we get some weevils from although my dear old airight yeah so you ain 't chocolate what 's a weevils in it he sells best thing here I taste it me I always made sure I tapped me our tack before I eat it right the old ship biscuits get a tap on the side of the boat before you actually need it right and then you mix it with the other staple which would be beer or grog right we have to dream because you know you think water you know bottles water but what it goes off as well on the ship right in the barrels in the barrels slimy and stuff and it 's hard to keep where beer it actually keeps its taste and flavor and lasts a bit longer gets preservatives in it and all that sort of stuff really be wrong now difference we being drug is well beer is purely that beer while you bite out of that beer it your folks might not be around the house do you mind telly at least anyway right and grog well that was actually Roman mix with a bit of beer is a blended so it was used to do take the edge of and they light that warm sometimes cold and all that bad stuff but that was something used to drink more know you 'd mix out with your biscuit to make it a bit soft and all that kind of stuff like that so we got a he 's old and take your teeth out right now you may have noticed in that door yet especially being on there for months it was you don 't get a lot of fruit and veggies yeah nobody 's great yourself in it by it could be after a while and this is with Warren do you end up being a scurvy dog I strike you get scurvy right that 's where the Christian scurvy dog comes from because many sailors end up in scurvy dogs vitamin C vitamin C very important apparently huh CUDA for good for something well fruit I don 't see that 's you need otherwise he 's becoming you know what 's life like a teenager you get fatigue you know then you get spots on your skin a bit more like a teenager I 'm just thinking about this then you get bleeding gums which makes a bit worse then right enough to get the bill even combs you just get weaker and weaker rigor to your teeth fall out and it goes downhill from there you mean more employments died from the scurvy then did from disease shipwreck or fightin all added together alright that 's how bad a screw you want it was really bad so we 're you know so make sure you your greens kids weekly your your greens and your oranges and all that sort of stuff and all those other colors of food other than meat because you 'll get the security which is not good not good you know Captain Cook that 's cook not that whole broke again captain cool but I heard him read sail around these parts down the south we are in the moment right all right he was famous for keeping his crew annoyed looking animal asses and mold and a head void oven so hidden amazin he kept them all annoying as he had troubles with overcrowding because they used to all the cruise ships but I 'm coming from England are you there over chrome because I figured a few would drop off over that way you know with scurvy and all sorts of things but he 's big problem was he kept him on so he had trouble keep them all fed because he had too many crew go figure you can 't win it so you get you ha but you know me normally going up the trumpet oh you know the Caribbean we were doing over there port nothing or mostly I play oh you like my stuff we 're a bit better off so we can jump in and grab all sorts of foods at the time you know we had things Lloyd flamingo right which is a lean black booty right but taste real nice and armadillo right which sounds like tastes a bit like lantern right yeah wells do we have grabbers I wake up noise like teeth ha ha fun do we know locust is we are sea lions and ostriches and ostrich eggs well that 's all grab because Turtles right they taste like chicken you 'll be surprised how many things taste like chicken so we can make all sorts of things like that I used to make a chutney here II get some mangoes right cut them in a bits right you pick them in salt and vinegar right add some garlic right put it away for a while I make a lovely sauce what respect is sauce of my bones the old chutney right so you know these were the things you could do to make a better out there but I 'm gonna teach you a recipe now it 's been in my family since 1712 this is again a recipe when you can actually get some food you can put it in the rest of your unit and it 's call right all family recipes see salmagundi can you read that there so am I gonna be here that 's what it says that 's what the rest of you thing you know so what you do right okay is you chop up some chunks of turtle meat chicken and pork and beef a bit of pigeon and some fish right you marinate that alright all that you marinate it in wine and then your roasted right so you 're so good marinate this means silk right so you just let it soak it in wine for a while and then you shove it the oven to bake or wrap it up show it to the calls ready for your elbow before you 're there like that kind of stuff all right and then that whole mix right you put together with boiled chopped cabbage anchovies pickle erring mango hard-boiled eggs palmat onions and some olives and some grapes right they need to add some pickled chopped vegetables and garlic some chili pepper and it 's a mustard salt pepper and then you serve in a huge mound and it looks something ha ha cuz that 's quite accurate even plated that up you know that expression they all do that all those shifts they break things up right and basically be much much I really together and you get in there you probably knew with yeah so that 's that recipe something you can actually do at home right now probably if you got oats in the cupboard like poori dream because porridge was another staple it last wouldn 't last a year because it get the weevils and it was prone to the insects and the rats and stuff get that stuff but it lasts a very time so it was another good staple you have in the shape it looks like the mid one you 'd have a lot of porridge you go he 's eating we call it per burgoo right burgoo right be you are do basically you got the part so you know what 's cooked in the water hangy-ball about they 're better sold in that kind of stuff and any of that molasses all right yeah it 's a molasses and then if you were the captain or on a special day you might add some nutmeg alright that stays a sweet so you can do that at home II it 's bowl you might have a fruit and sit there eat you part of that and you 'll be a boy I just I 'm alright meet a pilot and you know eat your earrings otherwise it 's Korea scurvy dog hahaha what do you say wait so that 's how you do it so that 's burgoo all right no you know they say an army travels on its doing well it travels on his whole so I 've got no idea what it all has to do with anything I think that means it 's time for a shanty ha ha that was my introduction to the shanty just caught stray into a nap good so the Titans chained here I mean it 's gonna be a fox or family members the fox selects where we all sleep and stuff like that so they 're the social ones we just sing it on their stories or romance and all that sort of stuff it 's not always easy one to learn because I say the first line okay and the second half for the first line gets repeated twice faces it all a ding dong day alright so I 'll go and then it just happens that patterns you will join in after each one right now go through the first verse so you get a bit of a hang with and then we 'll start again and we 'll get down with you ready for that alright great so it 's a big ship sails on that Ali Ali hold with the Tali at Leo the Tali a Leo big ship sayings on the Ali Ali oh oh ding dong day see that so they don 't go to the next verse which is the captain says that never do all right so we do that you 're right for that you can follow me give me an idea captain hahahahaha give me another hour are all cylinders and six guns and all that sort of stuff you ready are you ready to sing with me this big foxhole soon oh we 're doing it and we rock and we enjoy it because we 're having fun this is what we do when our off time you know time you need to have a bit of fun a bit of lightness Sybilla like this there amongst the crew keep things happy alright he 's always saying these songs we say him for work we say him with a pleasure we 're saying uh could I say yeah all right here you go the big ship sails on the Ali le haut the Ali le old Ali Ali the main ship sails on the alley elio all day long day hahaha the captain says that 'll never do that 'll never do that 'll ever do the captain says that 'll never do all day long day yeah the first mate is asleep till her asleep at the killer asleep at the tiller the best mate is asleep at the tiller all day dumb day the way they change and quorum unawares caught of unawares quarter by the where 's the where their change and quarter mother where 's all the dingdong they the big Shing sank to the bottom of the sea the bottom of the sea the bottom of the sea the big ship sank to the right he sucked at the bottom this ie you see we learn things from these songs as well if you 're gonna be organizing the tillow rich is like the steer in right missed Hilary 's other is actually the name of the be at the back that tiller earlier control on the steering alright so if you 're fallen asleep at the tiller looking after the ship you 'd be worried about the weather and hell because you remember this song right oh I can 't fall asleep the weather might change we might be the bottom of the sea I don 't that that 's the way we learned my songs a very tricky that 's another good use of shanties there were really any things like shanties were they are you right I believe so right now against my better judgment it 'd be time for the old man the old first mate Wilson Mary you wanted to do another one of these jokes now if you can think of any reason and it 's good to have reasons on ships that you don 't wanna hear 't want to see many

    "text": "oh you 've been doing some research and that research tells me that it 's time for pirate school number voice ha ha ha we be back for sabor school all right here we go who could give me a big right now who knows there poor from their star retreat apart from their stomach remember your ports are they so e3 Daniel a star bits on this side in your ROI society talk on star bits you steer inside right right power the ship it 's a pointy bit in right the pointy end higher and that 's another in pirate expression the pointy end that 's where it comes from chipping the pointy end is the front of the ship right and the back of the ship is the earth the art there you go down stand and laugh like apart ready legs apart that 's good that 's good and so it 's really hands on it 's very good yeah laughs good job right now quickly to a question people be asking me right they 've been saying to me jolene jolene captain Jolie captain Sully and with every know your Cutlass in your pistol in your cannons but do you have a noise well I do have a secret noise which I keep it a secret position right I have a so well hidden oh there it is it 's but it 's a butter knife in case I have an emergency breakfast is Rory have a nice rounded edge they haven 't put on butter on things and this sides a little bit too rate and rate so I can take cheese and squat out if I want to do it so I had any emergencies or I have to have some breakfast this is there for me otherwise I keep it stored give me special a hiding place all right so just put it away there Oh didn 't go in here we go put it away that 's it in there right and it 's ready whenever I need it ok ah there it is up and all right and then used to can weep I wouldn 't try that at home right because I got extra space in the brain panic blindness but me I got lots of room and it all just goes in there like that so like that 's what we doing there 's always a secret laughs okay give me an hour ah now give me an hour ah right so do we do it now we 're learning the ropes I 'm gonna show you the ropes you 're the expression to show you the ropes it 's another one i 'm expressions that comes from germany all right showing you the ropes because look at the beatrice here right she 's all ropes we call it Riggin their ropes everywhere everything 's controlled by ropes rocks all over the place so we 'll talk about the drops and we 'll you know learn a few things to get you working on the way to be a good shipping all right so have you heard the expression there 's another one of these expressions right now money for old rope you know that 's an old expression your parents might know money for old rope all right there 's a true thing I used to get bits ends a rope to be chopped off things and be lying around the deck and stuff they get a me time together right your time together to keep it for later so like these three is unit three roles here tied together at each end seven guilt angle right so it clicked up all these bits are open you die them together yeah all right and then when you 're in port you 'd go up to a ship builder right ship builder and you go up to a ship builder and you say those you 've built and you Dilys your brother these ropes right you 're just given to him and he grew your money well the ship builder would do with that but those ropes is he pull them all up I write all the little threads of rope and he would use them for choking now choking you see how the Beatrice is made of wood right that 's made of planks going across here so chalk good is what they put in between the pencil would stop the water getting through so they get of rope and then they get pitch which is the soft part of the roles I taro right it 's like that pitch and they coat it with pitch and that 's how they keep the bolt holes from sinking I sell for now okay so that 's why you called money for all wrong but we 've been sailors and you know we got booty of stuff like that and it 's a democracy so we share it up really easy as pie so we don 't really need the money for old rope so we use other things so what I got here I 'm gonna show you a good trick with our old rope right well this is it 's an RF top hitch right now I 'm gonna do an oft hitch now you 've been good sailors you know what your off is many people don 't know they 're off from their elbow but uh you mean earn and learn and so I do my little RF hitch right what happens is I 'm tying up the rope together turn it up so it tight now see then I got one bit of rope right you could use that it 's got these big knots there but you know you could use it that 's me on stage and what else I got right what what else I got is my old me pirate me he 's an Indian part in charge he got to me a little tricky talk to me a little little trick right and in that trick great but that trick is it 's a way you 're turning this rope so you can use it even better right even better so what you do okay is it go ah a vast area scurvy rope huh pull fires now Oh first and then when you pull it apart right so you pull it apart Oh Ananse is gone and you got one bit of rope pretty good neat and pretty useful haha right now I 'm gonna teach you a few knots so first knot I 'm gonna teach you is the slipknot it 's a nice easy one to start with right so you make a look see that and go under and back into the hole again right back into the hole pull it shut and that gives you a loop see that now if I put the other end of the rope dropped it fine the other end of the Rope through there like that now this loop here it 's like a lie sue all right and you could hold on to that and put anything 's tight so it 's a good thing in fact restraining things already want to tie it rope off easily you just loop it over something that pulls tight and then it 's got like okay and then you tie the other end off and winding around something like that all right so it 's a good one to start with a slipknot right now you remember the bow we were talking about the bow right yep well we also got bow lines or a bow lines what 's a bow line well on a boat we don 't call them ropes that much we actually call them mines mostly got lots of different names of roles because there 's it you know it 's like Eskimos got thousands of words with snow apparently you know pirates millions of aims for rope rates of lions is so this is a bow line right so the bow line is like a loop hard loop there you have it you think this goes over the pier of the doctor you just throw it over the top that little loop and it goes over there so if we brought a dolly ball oh there 's little pier there and we want to loop it on the top we 'd have to have a bow line on the end of our rope so what you do if you use your finger with this one so you hold your finger up you wrap it around your finger and that 'll give you a nice little circle a little there yeah that 's a little bit can you see that all right now better rope goes back through there through the hole then under the other bit of rope then back over and then back through the hole all right and you hold onto that bit and that gives you a tiny little bow line Z so if that was the pier I could just hook it on there and it 's not gonna go anywhere so it 's just there so you can get there and you 'll be able to you like you roll up put a cruise in it does set over boom hangs on and the boat will just there and rock around with the toit or whatever the wind and that 's a ballerina good thing about these knots right for pirate nuts and all that says he 'll nuts is it really easy to undo see that quick to undo you got to do that with your knots right they got to be easier to do it 's because the winds and things change really quickly if you cut it there you don 't_''_503.169 this real complicated knot and everything can you cannot do it you 're gonna get really crazy with it you know it 's gonna be cause you all sorts of problems are they that so that 's why they 're easy to undo all right now not all right so read not have your time two bits are open together see two bits are roped together this is the same bit a robocall us but I 'm just using both hands there 's two different bits of rope and if you want to make a circle so left one over there right one into a cross like that all right then it goes under and back over and then the right one goes across again so you got another little cross and it goes back under and over then you got this nice little square there I see that some people call it a square knot we call this a reef knot right so we briefing posed and there is tight as tight all right that ain 't going nowhere that is a reef knot another good not for a sailor all right and again easy to undo see that straight undone it 's gone a reef knot all right so now next thing I 'm gonna show you remember we talked about that it 's saying believe that you know cuz the boy in pins playing pin you can see it there on the end you make that out is this wooden device here right it 's got a bigger lumpy bit on the tire and a tapered bent down the bottom right cuz it goes in things called pin lines along there you see they just get put in these little holes and then all the ropes from the sails get tied down up not on them and then the leftover offers wrapped around it right now that 's so that 's how it works on the ship just like that so it 's all in that way so that 's all over your ship right now understand I 've made and I couldn 't get my own playing pin here at this time being you know in isolation at all so I 'll use my trusty stick again I put a hole in there actually to oles it is made out to big arena but and I 've got a screwdriver cuz it 's other playing pinching see it goes in there that 's the pin line so just sits there like that I 'm gonna at all these with my teeth because me third hand got lost all right okay so it goes in under and then your wrap up in a figure eight all right so it goes up now you just figure eight it around bigger eight that 's it and you do that four times all right I 'm not gonna do a four Titans because I haven 't got a room to do the other bit then and then you coil up the leftover bits a rope that sits over the top whether you 're playing pin all right and then you just do a little hitch which is just underneath just to keep it secure and that is how you tie off a bowling pin all right all right when it 's a blade app you know what means hold on hold on to that don 't believe that builder okay all that order for moment right blade pins also were useful because they heat a battle you know we like to get things over noise in the heat of battle and then we need a billion so we can grab a hold of the play and pin out of that it uses a to clump people over the head of it so it 's very useful device a boolean pin all right yeah well I forgot me wrong way alas not I 'm gonna go out right is your basic sailor 's hitch all right so you 're Tory this is when you 're tying something off to something or eat so it goes over by that right then it goes over the top and that way and then back under through all right just like that that 's your little hitch you pull that and then it 's tight I see that tight as tight as you can get all right no worries that 's perfect little hitch that 's all the knots you really need to know to start off with right there are your basic knot to you pretty much do most of the jobs with all super locks again you saw how easy that was to untie you right remember I was gonna tell you a story all right the story is been down the beach right well southerly hit harine that 's where you see the weather coming up from down there all right and you know they 're having a good time thrown the beach ball around and you don 't run it around all this sort of stuff and suddenly you see a wave about trend that 's a really strong window the sand goes sideways and everyone 's chasing their balls and their umbrella and and they were good oh no what 's going on and it back it up get out of there really quick that 's the so Louie right and that 's how quick it happens just whooshes straight through roses everything away so if you 're on the ship and your sails are the wrong place for the Slover leave it it since that 's tipping your whole world searching around no newer all sorts of things are only towards rocks you need to be on the release those not through first and that 's why little sailor knots are good to use because they 're easy to do and then quick to undo all right now that 's four up to we 're gonna talk about the reading I can give you a bit of an example of the kind of things we call me right cool we call it annoys you know that kind of thing but we have different names for everything you know right so let me ever think about what we 've got okay the stays talked about the stage right now this phase actually go up to the marks right there the big ropes to keep the mast in place alright you see them they call stays pretty obvious really you want the mass to stay there so you call them stays all right yeah and then sails need to be where some new sails need to be raised like these ones need to be raised all right to raise a sale you need a halyard so kind of rope you 're easy all right but these sails here they star up there so you need to lower them down so what do we call them we call them all Downers all right so they hold down the ones we 've got are the sheets now the sheets I used to trim the sails right so the G beer that we so you pull on tight right so the way you trim the senior sales trim in the sails is make them something flap right then they were in the best possible position to catch as much wind as possible right so the way if you 're trimming the sails properly they 'll be nice and tight but I 'll be there catching the wind still the beasts well I don 't know so they fill in with the win but tight at the back right so you don 't want no flappin or that kind of stuff for that and you use the sails together right so you make one big surface that they 're getting by using your sails in the right position so the ones at the front and more pointed straight at the wind right the ones at the back of more towards your direction so they go a bit wider so you get that sort of thing and it pushes you along that that way all the sails working together are better than if you had Beach one say over this way see you for an example right see this one gave us four not and this one gave us three nuts and this will give us three knots right so we tend not to all together in speed because of their sails but if we set them the right place that could be 15 or 20 knots because they 're working where they work better as a group than they do individually right that 's the skill of a sailor who 's working and that 's what you 'll learn as we go along that 's trimming the sails but we had ropes for everything you know we got a bell we ring all the time right I 'll just talking about that another class as well right what 's up on the bottom of the bell a bell rope haha what else do you call it what do we call the ones go to the ship to the shore they called dock lines cuz they go down to the dock right you even got to think called a tiller till the rope right so tiller all rats around the tiller let 's the steer and we 're right before the back there and I 'll hold it still it 's not gonna what about it kweilyn so if you wanted to keep going that one direction you want to go and do something else you can tie it off the tiller off so we just easy straight you just follow that pattern so that 's what we do with the ropes all right okay now why don 't we got next all right I think we 're gonna do I think I 'm gonna talk about trimming the sails and we 've done all that sort of stuff so I think it 's time for us to do another shanty haha very good very good we love a good shanty all right this one is gonna be a short old shanty right what was a short hole Shandy do you remember hi captain okay I got the natural I are a captain if you remember if you don 't remember slap all Chanti right that 's we do with short jabs I remember such and ease of what people 's and time with our work right sure it all is like if we were gonna raise the gym there right it 's only a little sail we need a short one right so it 's quick jaunt so two stopped so the way this one works is I say a line and you say the chorus lines and pull at the same time alright so I 'll just show you through a little bit of it and we 'll go from there you ready soit 's cheering me timbers shiver me soul and then we go you guys go together yo-ho-ho_''_1027.87 and then I go there 's men out there with hats as black that 's cool Chiho Chiho you know yo yo ho heave ho and that 's it so it 's just that I do ho ho so it 's those four things as you 're pulling that for sale okay so we just do it or you can imagine down there that 's where little pulley is and sales going up and so it 's a nice fast think we 're gonna do right are you ready for that come on standing lovely party right now here we go are you ready getting ready to sing one share me timbers shiver me soul yo-ho-ho there man out there and hots as black as coal yo-ho-ho_''_1074.96 and they sail the fuss and hope to blue Yoho evil does he captain a hakufu Wow ho he ho they sail her Avenger brave and bold yo ho ho he ho they came home with a chest full of gold whoa whoa and the sails up what do you think it 's a good one until it tells us or us what we gotta go on a treasure hunt I reckon the last lesson will teach you how to do a treasure hunt hard he 'll be good now we 're almost finished wait one last thing to cover and that is some people are being saying why you don 't you tell some good pirate jokes which I say Oh neither boy that 's terrible terrible right well I 'm thinking name with all the isolation do you think Wilson isn 't me first mate and he 's wanted to come and tell some jokes so I 'm gonna let him have a go this time and if it works out all right we won 't do that end of each episode you can tell a little bar joke and eat see how it goes all right but I

hands coming together take one more with the hands on the belly next Hale and then we 're going to move the hands up to the side ribs and follow the breath into the hand at the side ribs as you in how you 'll feel the breath pushing the ribs out and the hands move outwards as you exhale the hands draw in taking one more breath into over one on each side of your chest near the collarbones and breathing into the hands on the chest you know that gentle lift and gentle lower as you inhale and exhale and take one more round and then we 'll bring the hands back down to the belly for a breath in

from there flexing and extending the wrists letting one big side of the hands reach up and one down don 't forget to breathe and then letting all of the joints of the hands move now and go back to circling your wrist starting to take them up moving every finger bone every bone in all of the hands coming up again through the center inhaling and exhaling going down and then from there we 're gonna interlace the fingers and all the wrists around in like a little figure 8 shape and then just changing direction of that bigger rate going back around the other way now good for the brain then interlace your fingers and press your hands forward relax the shoulders and the upper back and if you want you can take your hands above to the root of the breath perhaps you can feel it into the ribcage here again [Music] and then when you 're ready start to lower your hands back down and take them out to the hips lower back maybe the back of the chair enjoy your shoulder base dealer let your sternum lifts let the eyes gaze up to where the roof meets the wall feel that beautiful expansion on the front side of the torso and the breath flowing into here and then releasing and bringing the hands to the thighs and gently as you inhale coming forward pull with the hands and let the spine come forward and as you exhale coming back inhaling forward keep pressing into your feet as you lean back inhaling forward and exhaling back again coming back to the center pressing the palms together and taking some woodchopping actions now with your hands from one side to the other and you can either keep your torso to the front or add a little rotation if you like but keep the knees or their feet steady and the spine long and the breath center now make a prison with your hands and if you 'd like you can raise them up breathe in tall and as you exhale live the spine up and over towards the right and inhale back to the center and up and over towards the left in the health center keep the spine beautiful and long and again keep those feet pressing down into the floor as you go side to side always working with your breath inhaling and exhaling then gently bring the hands back down to heart center place them down onto your feet and take your left hand across the outside of your right side your right hand might go to the hip lower back or the back of the chair and as you exhale twisting around towards the right feel the inhale growing you tall and the exhale allowing a little bit more space for your twist next time you inhale slowly unwind to the front keep tall and press into your feet as you change sides again that left hand might find your hip your lower back or the chair and spiral from your twist around press the feet down knees are forward you know how to lift

balls of their feet inhale lift the heels exhale the balls of the feet continue this a few more times lifting lifting one more and then from now we 're going to extend the legs out a little bit further in front keep your knee a bit soft if you want and you can take them a bit wider if you like drop the toes towards each other and then open the legs out from the hip joint drop the toes towards each other and then open them out keep your breath flowing working on that rotation of the feet back into sitting Mountain again we 'll keep our left leg where it is and come up to the tippy toe of the right leg or maybe pick your leg up off the ground and take a hold underneath your thigh if you like then you can flex your foot and stretch your foot forward and point and flex your toes a couple of times here just one more and then we 'll slowly lower that back down to the floor and try the other side up to the tippy toe or maybe lifting the leg up off the ground and let 's flex the foot stretch forward and point and flex and point and flex and point and flex and then gently return that back down to the ground take a breath here in sitting Mountain exhale out and then from here

'll change direction breathing around to the sitting Mountain let 's take a breath here then we 're gonna pop our high heels on and we 're going to take a little walk around to the right side of the chair make sure you feel grounded and you 're in sitting Mountain here especially that right leg is in good alignment hold the back of the chair if you like and open your left leg to a v-shape maybe an l-shape or if you 'd like you could extend that leg out did you do that make sure that that whole foot goes on the ground otherwise your knees gonna fall in so press out through the outer edge of your foot the pinky toe side and press into both feet lifting the spine tall for me today I feel better in an l-shape leg so that 's where I 'm going to go but you choose what feels good to you hands can go to the shoulders a little bit away from the body or further away from the body you can reach out through your fingertips like you 're going to touch each war with finger if that feels right for you feel as though the shoulders are going down and out through your fingers and then letting the right hand flip upwards take a big breath in press into your feet and let the left hand come to the chair as the right reaches up for the sky exhale here and inhale and grow tall and then as you exhale come out from the hips and reach out to that right wall like you 're gonna touch it with those fingertips and then bring your forearm to your right side take your left hand and turn the chest and then let your left hand explore either stay at the shoulder or reaching upwards make sure you haven 't collapsed down into the bottom side of the waist the shoulders away from the e3 chafe dharma cross maybe hold your head which feels really nice or extend that arm towards the right wall both legs are strong and grounding down to lift up with you look wherever is comfortable for your head today I know next inhale breath release and come up and we 'll the hand float down gently if your leg is outstretched now walk it back into L shape leg and let 's come back into sitting Mountain take a breath here and a breath out and then we 'll go to the other side so finding sitting mountain now on the left side of the chair left leg is stable hold the back of the chair of you like start to move your legs for your warrior two maybe V maybe ll maybe outstretched remembering that it 's your choice keep the whole foot on the ground wherever you decide to be then let 's explore the arms so perhaps they come to the shoulders or they start to make their way gently away from the body look out over that left middle finger now if that feels nice for you feel as though the arms are soft and yet energized at the same time shoulders it down legs are strong and then we 're gonna flip over that left hand and as me inhale reverse the warrior reaching for the sky and stay for an exhale inhale tall and then forearm to the thigh feel that sense of the chest opening up and let the hand then explore its options maybe it goes to the sky feel that sense of grounding that sense of lifting and then if you want to explore changing the hand to hold the head or reaching out towards that left wall make sure that bottom shoulders away from the ear push into the armed field out there and then on your next inhale releasing through that bottom arm pressing through the feet and making your way back up and let 's say hello to Miki my beautiful cat and exhale release the hand down he loves being on camera let 's walk back around into sitting Mountain and take a breath and that tail then from here let 's start to take both of the legs out a little bit wider apart but checking in that they 're still in our sitting mountain alignment with the ankle under the knee hands to the heart center and as you exhale begin to fold forward now you might hover above the knees or you might let yourself the insides of the thighs feel the spine lengthening maybe pull the elbows towards you to get that little bit of extra length peel the feet pressing into the ground and as you inhale next rising up maybe the arms reached for the sky and exhale they come back down to the heart center let 's walk our feet all the way back in now so the thighs are touching look for that alignment of the middle toe than me and in a hip bone keep your left leg where it is cross your right foot over the ankle and maybe you stay here or bring the knee over the top but if you do that just watch that bottom knee doesn 't fall in right hand to left now as you let the arms find their Eagle arm position they could be back to back palms elbow is touching the hog or the weave around whatever felt good for you there choose that for yourself now and then inhale let the sternum lift as you exhale Bend out from the hips maybe the elbows go over the knee you of the spine lengthen and exhale feel the back of the spine lengthen we 'll do one more lifting and lengthening coming back to sit nice and tall as you inhale and exhale release your arms and let them float down unravel your legs let 's do the same on the other side crossing over at the ankle if you like or perhaps crossing over at the thigh keeping the thighs together making sure that bottom knee doesn 't fall in and this time left goes under right back to back elbows hug or maybe waving around so the palms touch feel the breath lift and lengthen the front of the spine and exhale fold out from the hips inhale lengthening watching that bottom foot is nice and grounded and supporting you from the ground up inhale lengthen and exhale coming up on your inhale and as you exhale releasing those arms letting them float gently back down unravel your leg and then from there bring them back into sitting Mountain and then let 's take the hands to the hips or maybe the lower back or maybe the back your hands either in a square shape or the base of the palms touching behind your back decide again what feels right for you here then the shoulder blades come towards each other the sternum lifts and the gaze might go up to where the roof meets the wall press into your feet and feel the breath into the front of the body that beautiful open space for the breath to flow [Music] and then let 's release our grip and let 's come back into sitting Mountain [Music] and from here take a breath notice the effect now that in how to grow at all and your exhale fold forward to your forearms come to rest on your thighs and you might make a little bit more space if you 'd like for your belly tell the breath into the back of the body done your inhale rising up lid from there back to sitting Mountain if you moved your legs and if you 'd like to come out stretch your legs again pull the toes back ground the heels into the ground pop the knee up and as spine long or maybe letting your hands roll down the legs and letting the spine fold forward but remembering that we need to have space so we can breathe really notice your breath here and if you feel that it 's struggling a little just back off a little you can breathe deeply slowly and softly again just taking another a couple of rounds of breath here [Music] and then as you inhale just gently taking as many breaths as you like start to gently climb back up no rush make your way back into sitting mountain take a breath to notice how you feel now let 's bring our hands into how kini mudra join all the fingers and the thumb tip together this is a water that 's really wonderful the balancing the left and right sides of the brain it 's really good for our memory as well if we forget something we can practice this and it 's said to be helpful in remembering again it 's also very calming there 's nothing to do but just breathe here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it 's maintaining when you 're ready to you can release your hands close the eyes just notice how that feels and then when you 're ready sitting back in the chair a little bit now let this spine relax back but make sure you can still breathe let your feet just rest out wherever is comfortable for you and maybe your hands turn upwards on your lap again you can close your eyes now feel that sensation of just dropping in all the work is done and now it is just time to rest notice the muscles of your body just releasing and softening notice the giant softening the organs maybe noticing as the body softens that the mind the emotions softened to whatever comes in just gently floats away again the energy drops [Music] maybe even the breath itself softens here and becomes light and wispy there is nothing at all to do but just be just simply being and deeply resting [Music] nothing to do nowhere to go just being and just resting [Music] I 'll let you know when it 's time to return when you 're ready start breath start to deepen a little and as it does become aware of your body one small heal the feet on the ground with the back on the chair notice your muscles your joints and when you feel ready start to move your fingers your toes and any other movements that feel organic and natural for you feel free to do those now and we 'll wiggle our way back into sitting mounts and eventually when you get there you can bring your hands to your heart center and bow the eyes towards the heart to acknowledge yourself for showing up and taking care of yourself and let 's acknowledge each other by bowing and saying namaste [Music] thank you so much for joining me in that chair yoga practice I trust you I have a beautiful day I look forward to see you next time namaste bye for now _"

    "text": "good afternoon everyone and welcome along to the secrets of social media marketing workshop my name is jeremy Kozma and I 'm presenting the workshop today on behalf of Canterbury Council economic development department just a reminder if you can please keep your videos switched off we will be recording this webinar and if you don 't wish to do so today 's webinar will run for about an hour and then we 'll have an opportunity to do a question and answer following the session if you have questions please do type them in as you we go through the webinar today and I 'll do my very best to be able to answer these questions as we go we 've got a lot to cover in the next hour as you understand social media is a fairly broad topic but what I want to do is to really give you some specific strategies that you can use to be able to get some marketing results for your small business through using social media I can I just get a thumbs up in the chat box or an okay much so just a little bit of background on myself I 've come from a corporate background so I used to be the oceania managing director of a US owned technology company left the corporate world about 15 years ago and have worked as a business coach since then so my real passion is working with owners of small to medium enterprises to help them achieve what they want out of their business and at the end of the day small business is designed to give us a balance of both cash flow and lifestyle one of the areas in which business owners very often struggle with is the marketing side of things how do we attract the right level of business so I want to talk to you about there today and to make sure that you 're able to strike the right balance in terms of the amount of time and effort that you put in and the results that you actually get back from that so Before we jump into social media I just want to talk to you a little bit about well what is marketing customers what we want to do is we want to have a budget of either time or money that we want to convert into leads or selling opportunities and in order to do this the process of marketing is really all about communication communicating with our client our target clients and also educating them on why we 're the right choice for them so there 's two rules with marketing you might want to write these down number one it 's better to be different than it is to be the best number one it 's better to be different than it is to be the best number two it 's about consistency we need to know how and why we 're different and we need to be able to repeat that message over and over again so this is one of the things that you want to actually have a think about with social media because communication at the end of the day I 've got a definition for this communication is the response that you get and when we think about the process of communication communion means one of thought transference where we take an idea out of our head and we want to transfer it into the heads of one or many other people so if that doesn 't actually occur then we can say communication hasn 't occurred so we want to be able to use social media as a very powerful mechanism to be able to communicate to our target clients and be able to educate them we did a webinar just last week all about branding and when it comes to marketing what 's critical to keep in mind is we need to be very very clear about who we want to get our message out to and the temptation in a startup business very often is we feel like we want to sell to the world we want to sell to everybody we don 't want to limit our options but one of the things to understand is this by actually reducing our target market our perfect client avatar it becomes a lot lot easier for us to be able to market to them and when we look at your ideal target clients psychographics so demographics are very easily measurable traits like age gender ethnicity or geography psychographics comes a lot more down to psychology understanding what goes on inside people 's heads what are the things that they think about what are the things that they worry about and where do they hang out and when we get this sort of a profile on our customers and I 'll talk today about how we do that it then makes it very very easy for us to craft a solution or a message to be able to speak to that audience so one of the things is if we attempt to craft a message that speaks to everybody then we end up speaking to nobody so having a much tighter target market is going to get you a much much better result when it comes to social media something worth remembering is this you can make all sorts of claims about your business and about why you 're the best but what other people say about your business counts for much much more than what you say so we 're going to talk the right way and understanding this a testimonial from a third party is a lot more valuable than us are giving a testimonial about our product so social media has been an absolute revolution for small business because what it 's done is it 's really transformed the way in which we communicate we 've moved from a world which was dominated by traditional media the televisions the newspapers and this was very much a one-to-many model providing very static media very promotional and you know is quite detached the way in which we engaged with the traditional media when we look at what social media has done is it turned every single one of us into a content creator so it 's very much a many-to-many platform it 's very dynamic and conversational people love to participate it 's very easy to share and it 's interactive so social media is simply word of mouth multiplied by a hundred in terms of how fast and how far your business can go we look at traditional marketing a referral I would argue is worth four leads from any other source know to your business they 're going to typically be a great client then going to come in they 're not going to bargain on price they 're typically going to be grateful that you 're actually able to help them out but we can use social media to be able to generate a lot more referrals in a much better way in a much more leveraged way so we 're hoping to get today 's broadcast up on the Canberra Bankstown TV live unfortunately we 've had a technical glitch so we haven 't been able to do that but we will be making and recording available looking back to really what social media has done as it 's given customers a voice and I want to share with you a story about a musician named Dave Carroll and he was travelling by United Airlines in the US and he looked out the window and saw them loading it onto the plane and throwing it and anyhow they broke us and he wasn 't happy and he went and he asked them for compensation and they said no so United breaks guitars he put it out there on social media in four days the United share price dropped 20% costing shareholders over a hundred and eighty million dollars of value this one video had almost twenty million dollar views so one of the secrets to social media is timing but one of the amazing things is when we find the right recipe we can create posts that go viral and a much much more successful than us having to spend amounts of money you see when it comes to marketing you can choose one of two things you can either do a marketing that 's expensive and dumb ya where you take a pile of cash and we 're going to convert it into a pile of opportunities or we can focus on marketing that 's smart and cheap so that is we don 't need to spend a lot of money but we need to use a lot more creativity and that 's what we 're going to talk about today with social media so Australians love social media on average Australians are on social media platform 104 in 2010 Australia was the most dedicated social network user in the world we 're not number one anymore but I think it 's pretty interesting that the average Australian is sitting on social media for an hour and a half every day so what do you think that they 've stopped doing where are they finding this time and for a lot of people what 's happened is has come out of their television time watching budgets and they 're using people that using social media to fill in those slack times and one of the things you need to think about with social media is well if we can get people 's eyeballs if we can get their attention if we can get them engaged and involved with us that presents us with a big opportunity to be able to market our brands and our businesses so we could easily run a three day workshop on social media we haven 't got three days we 've got one hour so we really want to talk about the couple of key platforms that are going to make a difference about Facebook we 'll talk about Instagram we 'll talk about LinkedIn as well these are the ones that you really want to focus on there are some other social media platforms out there I think the challenge for small business owners is really finding the time to generate a return on investment it 's very easy to spend a lot of time on social media and not to get a great result or outcome so what we want to do is to figure out how do we invest our time in the best possible way when we look at Australia there 's over 15 million unique Facebook accounts there 's 14 and a half million users on YouTube every month 5 million on Instagram a couple of other social media platforms like tumblr LinkedIn Twitter and also Pinterest but what you see is that 60% of people access social media every day or most days and over 3 of people will check their social media over 5 times a day so it 's out there it 's happening what we need to do is to figure out which platforms I 'll share with you the recipe for coming up with a strategy by the way at the end of today if you would like a copy of the slides we 're also going to give you an option to do that via the feedback survey now when it comes to the different social media platforms you also need to have a think about well what 's the right language to be able to use because the platform 's all come from different places you know Facebook was originally Mark Zuckerberg invented it as a way to keep up to date with other people in college so Facebook is very much a friendly platform it 's all about family and you know the sort of post we 'd see on Facebook is people saying hi to their friends talking about well here I am eating Donuts Instagram arose as initially as a program to be able to take digital camera photos and put fancy filters on them and then publish it to Facebook so Instagram is a lot more of a visual medium and really more artistic photos but it about that YouTube is the second most popular search engine in the world for a moment YouTube is the second most popular search engine in the world and yes it is a social media platform specifically around video based content LinkedIn is basically Facebook for business an online recipe sorry an online resume but this is a very powerful business-to-business development and I 'm gonna give you some of my key LinkedIn strategies today because that 's I think the number one platform for business-to-business generation and we 'll also talk about Facebook Pinterest is simply about collecting what we call pin boards of amazing images so it 's a bit like Instagram but it 's easier to be able to organize content together and share that with others tic toc is something is taking off massively with the teens at the moment and there 's lots of online dancing and very short little video clips under 30 seconds on tic toc and twitter used to be a monster in in social media but these days it 's really only good for keeping up with celebrities and politicians and then 're actually doing across these platforms what we 'll also typically see at different types of memes and a meme is a visual form of communication comprising both an image and text to be able to communicate an important point so there are tools out there like HootSuite that will allow you to schedule posts and post them across a whole bunch of platforms all at once I think you need to be quite careful with using these however because the same language doesn 't necessarily translate on the different platforms so you need to make sure that you 're communicating in an appropriate way with the platform that you 're using if you want to get great results so when we look at the use of social media organizations and businesses really think about as an opportunity for public relations how do we get our news to the marketplace how do we prove that we 're a legitimate business organization how do we market and sell our products create brand awareness and also do a little bit of reputation management so organizations have an agenda with social media to 't start Facebook as a community service it 's a publicly owned company and its number one intent is to be able to actually generate revenue and the way in which it does that is by selling advertising so a study a little while ago that said that we sell our souls to Facebook for about 13 dollars a year so that is because we 're not willing to pay 13 dollars a year to have an account on Facebook Facebook has to make that up through collecting our personal information and using that to market products and services to us individuals and and people say that Facebook knows more about you than you know about you and as we saw through the Cambridge analytical thing that happened in the US and the election it 's amazing how much these social media platforms do know about us we typically want to use that as a mechanism to stay in touch to fill up time a little bit of entertainment to share some of what we 're doing to have some conversations to organize events and sometimes there 's another mechanism so we 're here we have some competing I guess interests but the key with both of these is about understanding how we use social media to communicate to get the result that we 're looking for so when it comes to socially enabling your business this is the recipe that I would recommend number one we really want to start with having some sort of a basic website we want to think about creating a blog and we want to work at building an email list and the reason for this is these are timeless marketing strategies you know one of the challenges with social media is you 're only one post away from actually having your business account blocked you don 't own the information on there or in fact you 're passing all of that intellectual property across do across to these social media platforms Facebook is the largest media organization in the world and they create zero of the media themselves we then want to go and create our free business pages on Facebook on Google Maps and also on LinkedIn so this is a first little miniature website when you think about a website it 's pretty much like having a billboard in a forest yeah you can have the world 's best billboard but if there 's nobody walking past it is it doing you any good so the third step is we want to on our website install a Google Analytics pixel so that we can track how people find our website how long they stay there what pages they look at and also our Facebook or LinkedIn tracking pixels and the reasons why these are so important as it gives us a profile on who 's visiting our website it allows us to determine who our avatar is and then we can create what 's called mirror or matching audiences which becomes very very powerful for us to be able to market to more of our ideal customers businesses that say Jeremy I don 't want to get on social media because people might start saying bad things about my business well here 's the thing they 're gonna say those things whether you 're there or not so customer service inquiries as really moments of opportunity for you to be able to step up and handle some of these conversations that will need to be had in fact feedback via social media will reveal key business issues to you and whether you are delivering on your promises and organization or not when it comes to Facebook these days it 's a lot of successful businesses are setting up communities where they 're bringing together their top clients and people who like their products and allowing people to have conversations but just a word of warning for if you 're setting up these communities is that you can set them up with good intentions and they can rapidly run off the rails why because people will start pushing the boundaries or saying things they shouldn 't and to manage a community is actually quite resource intensive so I wouldn 't suggest if the startup businesses but those further down the track may be worth having a look at we 're going to talk about the different types of content we can create and put out there on social media like I talked what is the right content that 's appropriate that 's going to help us achieve our goals so be able to stay in touch what 's happening out there in the world we can log on every day and we can have a look but there 's also some great third-party software tools that will allow us to really measure our social media reach as well as what what other people are saying about the about our company and our products next point is about video and a lot of people are shy about video and they think that they need to get professional video actually created well one of the things is in our pockets these days we all have a video production studio and if you 're willing to be put yourself out there as the face of the business and put some video posts in your social media they get lots more engagement than any other type of post and yes there is a little bit of an embarrassment about you might possibly stuff it up but at the end of the day video is the highest content such as for example blogs podcasts and another reason for getting on social media is you know when Google 's determining your search engine ranking search engine optimization social media activity is one of the factors that it definitely takes into account when it 's deciding where you 're going to appear in the search engine rankings so it 's a very simple seven step process to getting started on social media number one select your strategy so we 're going to talk about how do we figure out what our strategy is do we want to create awareness do we want to be able to create loyalty do we want to be able to bring in new customers secondly we want to select the appropriate platforms and my suggestion is start with just one or two first social media is a marathon it 's not a sprint you see the temptation many people have is they 're going to jump in and they think I 'm going to post we 're going to start this I 'm going to post twice a day every day and without a 't get the results that they 're looking for the second step is with social media with any platform spend a lot more time listening before you actually start speaking because you want to get a feel for the culture of the platform that you 're on what people are talking out about and this is if you you know there 's the secret with social media is you really want to add value you want to educate and if you sell you want to sell softly so as we move into a new social media platform take some time to really just hang out on there and see what others are talking about and understand that success leaves Clues so look at who 's being most successful at doing what you 'd like to do and get some ideas from them number three is thinking about communities and understand that every single one of your ideal clients is already doing business with another business out there and they 're already part of some community so we want to look at how do we engage with those right sorts of 're going to talk about content generation how are we engaging conversations and then the last two steps the first five steps are all about figuring it out steps six and seven are simply about fine tuning and turning up the volume and when you you go through social media in this way it 's going to allow you to generate a return on investment so Facebook makes it very very easy for you to set up a company page and then once you 've done that we can very easily invite everybody who were already connected to once we run out of all those immediate connections the question is how am I going to add more connections beyond there and the secret at the end of the day is number one we want to be able to share great content when we share great content that people like the people comment on engage with and share as well that will give us in front of more and more people a much better off collaborating that is finding other people on social media businesses on social media to collaborate with buying followers there are how do we say third-party companies that will give you a promise they say we 'll get you 200 followers for your business page in 3 days if you pay us X dollars now the problem with that is many of those accounts are actually fake and when you understand the way in which social media works if you have for example a hundred connections and you put a piece of content out there on social media what will happen is the platform will first test it on five to seven people that you 're connected with if none of those five to seven people like it or comment on it then it says the platform says this piece of content is obviously not relevant so it doesn 't show it to all of your other connections so when you buy followers they 're probably fake accounts they don 't know you they don 't care about you and what this means is that when you put posts out there they won 't go anywhere near as far as they ought to so a small engaged we always want to stay on brand and share relevant content and remember I said social media is about conversations so the more that we can actually get people engaged with what we 're doing you know in the latest example of this is Facebook Facebook life where we can live stream video direct from our mobile phone we can see who 's actually coming in and sharing the conversation with us we can see the likes the dislikes little comments and this is once again being able to live share experiences with people 85% of Facebook users consume video content with the sound off so if you 're pushing video content out on Facebook it makes sense to think about using a subtitling service like rev re V comm that will go and put subtitles on your videos for you now the reason why people are consuming it with the sound off very often a lot of people social media is actually something they do in the bathroom when it comes to video on social media you know you 've got to understand that the big social media platforms can to keep you on the platform as long as possible so if you put a video on YouTube and you share that on Facebook that 's going to get nowhere near the level of promotion through the Facebook network as if you took that same video and uploaded it to Facebook so if you 've got video content you 're best off natively uploading it onto the platforms just last week Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook shops is now live so with your business page you can now put products up there and directly sell products from your Facebook page the fees are going to be low because again what Facebook is looking to do through this is not so much to make money from merchants but to make money from eyeballs yeah they understand what you 're looking at and they will market all sorts of other products to you through that Instagram initially started out as a competitor to Facebook and it was bought out by Facebook and the platform 's basically sit side by side and they integrate very well so whereas Facebook is more of Instagram is very much more a visual platform and you 'll notice that especially with Instagram if you 've got a business that 's quite visual in terms of the products that you deliver then Instagram can be an amazing platform to get your message out there so one example of a business that has done really well out of this so it started with the bushfires and someone thought how do I help the farmers so they came up with this initiative called buy from the bush created this hashtag and created a website and basically this was a this was a good news initiative so the and this is social media is public relations at the end of the day when you come up with these sorts of initiatives that add value it 's not just people in the social network that will get involved it 's very often people in the real media world who will get out there and help market this so this buy from the bush hash hash tag which has been going for just over six months now is now over two hundred made in regional Australia they promote them by their webpage and they do very very well out of this and they use both an Instagram and a Facebook strategy so it is possible to set up when you do put a post on Instagram to immediately publish it to Facebook as well and this provides you a little bit more leverage across the platforms however I think you just need to be careful with Instagram and look at how do we make our posts as pretty as possible now the greatest compliment anyone can give is other people will get great ideas from what you do so I wanted to now show you another business that saw this and thought well that 's a great idea I 'm going to do something similar but I 'm gonna create a wedding registry specific for sourcing products from regional Australia and we 're gonna partner with rural aid so with the gifts that you put that you want your wedding guests to buy for you part of that you can also ask for them to give a donation to rural aid once of these different websites and Facebook pages and you can get some ideas on what they 've done to be able to promote their businesses and causes and when you do it right social media doesn 't need to cost a lot of money alright so there 's a question there in terms of isn 't worth boosting my posts on Facebook and the answer is absolutely may be mentioned earlier when we put a post out there it 's not going to go to all of our contacts or friends the distribution or reach will be based on the level of interaction that the post has however we can boost the post and the boost especially when it comes to business pages these days with business pages you don 't get a very large reach so boosting a post will simply increase the number of people that 's put in front of but it will also enable you to be able to put the post in front of people who you 're not already connected with with marketing we 've always got to look at testing and measuring what what results did we get what did it cost and is it working another Facebook phenomenon who 's just absolutely taken off during this covert crisis is a comedian called net and he 's made he 's also a cook and he started creating these videos around how do you cook end-of-days Bolognese and chili con can 't_''_1930.23 go outside they 're very explicit so there but he 's he 's very funny at the same time so he started out as using YouTube as the platform and you can see on YouTube he 's got almost 180,000 people subscribed to his channel so every time he releases a new video they actually get a little notice in Facebook sorry in YouTube but the real synergy comes when we start combining these platforms so taking that across to Facebook he 's got 1.2 million followers on Facebook now so every time he 's releasing a video he puts it on he puts it on YouTube he shares it on Facebook and it 's just gone absolutely viral and the same thing goes with for example blog posts with your website a blog and to develop relevant SEO friendly content on your website using the keywords you want to be known for and then we use social media as a mechanism to be able to promote it out there to more people an example of pinterest so searching Pinterest for fitness so Pinterest is a little bit like Instagram in terms of it 's very visually rich there 's all sorts of in [Music] infographics and quick tips on how to get started and it allows us to also to be able to create pin boards of or collections of images that we really like Pinterest is a social media platform that 's really quite popular more with ladies than men and again if you 've got a visual based product it may make sense for you to have a think about Pinterest as an additional mechanism for developing an other audience so when it comes to business-to-business Linkedin there 's over 600 million professionals on LinkedIn and 80% of these are decision-makers so I wanted to share with you a few tips for how do you build a effective LinkedIn you understand how now you can actually do a lot of business development on LinkedIn without having to subscribe to a paid account the paid account simply gives you a few more features it 'll allow you to be able to see who 's been viewing your profile and to be able to actually send inbox messages to people I want to set share with you a few keys to building a good profile and a lot of people miss this when you join with LinkedIn it 's important you have number one a professional headshot number two you see that banner image behind the photo this is a again a free opportunity for you to be able to provide in three to five seconds enough information for people to understand what it is that you do one of the critical bits of information however is the job title and many people make the mistake they 'll put here director okay and this job title is actually one of the critical pieces of information for search engine optimisation for your profile so instead of putting your job title instead focus you solve what are some of us illusions that you offer and then you want to make sure that you write a fairly reasonable description of who you are and what you do in the About section Linton also provides you the ability to be able to put your different job titles there what you do so you can see here I 'm not just a CEO or chief enthusiasm officer for repor leadership and leadership trainer I also do quite a bit of work on keynote speaking so you 'll notice I 've got those as two separate position descriptions and I 've collected a whole suite of different testimonials on each one of these one of the great things this enables you to do is to again build business credibility and I 'll talk a little bit about how we go about doing some business to business development through LinkedIn it 's really important on your profile as well to get some testimonials and if you don 't have any testimonials to begin with my suggestion is have a think about who you who give some testimonials to social media so if you know some people who you 've been in business with provide them with testimonials and they 're very likely to write you one in return the other great way to get testimonials is to look for those moments of opportunity when you have a customer come to you and say Jeremy that that was awesome thank you so much and this is where we say you 're welcome but you know what I 'm working really hard to get a couple of testimonials would you be willing to help me with testimonial and here 's the thing people will say yes but very often they won 't follow through so what you 've got to do is to say is to actually write the testimonial for them so if they don 't want to say yes Jeremy I 'll write you a testimonial so that 's great if there were three things that you would mention in there what would they be in your own words okay then I could take that and I could type that up and send that across to people so building testimonials the other thing that gets your testimonials is going out there and doing great work and what you do when you deliver great value then you 'll tend to get testimonials back in return without even having to ask for them but this is all about social proof when it comes to posting on LinkedIn we want to where we can find ways to be able to engage with our audience so we want to think about number one being on brand in social media we use these things called hash tags and hash tags allow us to follow specific topics within LinkedIn and so for example you can see in the post on the Left I use the hash tag leadership in action so there 's a bunch of people who follow that hashtag and if enough people so they will actually see that post without necessarily being connected to me LinkedIn also has editors that go through and when they see good posts they will promote them again LinkedIn like Facebook their objective is to maximize the amount of time that you spend on the platform out there had over four thousand three hundred and ninety nine views it had three comments and it had sixty people liked it another type of post you can actually do is an offer post so you can see on the right-hand side here I put an offer download a bulletproof confidence builder tool detailing three secret ingredients and ten ease and easy steps to empower your brain supercharge your thinking and enable effortless bulletproof confidence whenever you need it once a copy comment bulletproof below and I 'll send you the link so this was just some text and an image and you can see there were 24 likes and 54 people put in there send me that information so each one of those 54 is a specific sales opportunity when someone asks you for information it means they 're interested you also on LinkedIn want to think about creating some content or some articles and while traditionally you post these on your blog so if you put them up on LinkedIn as articles then again LinkedIn is much more likely to promote them so you can see a have had over 20,000 views each and the one on the left the why 85% of employees are ready to leave again The Sydney Morning Herald picked up on that one they saw my a school that I put on LinkedIn they came to me they said Jeremy it 's a great article do you mind if we put it in the newsletter and the answer obviously was absolutely you 're welcome to so this is a little bit about being a thought leader in the industry that you 're a part of so when it comes to building followers on social media or if you 're starting out obviously we connect with people that we know first second step is to email the people you know and ask them to connect with you we want to make sure that we take time to like and interact with other people 's posts yeah if you 're just pushing media out there why should anyone else who like and comment on your post if you 're not liking and commenting on their posts you know there are some great groups on to business owners and business are reaching out and asking for help so again with those sorts of forums join those groups and add value and as you do that you start to become known and people will connect with you create a promotional special offer see and see here that a lady by the name of Tupperware Sally has created a new business page and she 's actually created a little offer so she 's giving away a baking and snack center and if you want to win the set you need to click on the link share my page and put a comment on it with your favourite product so that 's one example of a little low cost promotion that can potentially help you to build some followers for your page and like before I mentioned never buy followers so what the users want from you when surveyed on what users really want most from with companies on social media the number one thing they wanted was discounts number two things was they loved giveaways or competitions but there 's very powerful tool within the pages that to manage events so from online webinars to meetups in person so it 's a very powerful tool to do that to provide product information information about our brand and also to run feedback forums remember social media as a conversation so don 't always be talking instead think about social media as a mechanism to listen and to get feedback from real-world customers on what they really most want from you moving forward you can see Facebook now this is a fairly new feature as well actually has offers so if on your business page you put a you put an offer Facebook now has a specific section in there where you can go and look for offers in your area so they 've obviously seen the business model of Groupon and they want to think about well again how do we stop people going off platform to get offers and instead look after the people who are staying on platform you know what the toughest thing with social media is you say I 'm gonna post something every Tuesday and then you get to Cheers day go and say I 'm lacking inspiration so one of the secrets to social media is we need to get a little bit creative and to get into a creator space takes a little bit of time and a little bit of effort so my suggestion is you actually want to create a social media calendar we want to sit down maybe with a glass of red wine could be a glass of orange juice but to sit down and really brainstorm what sort of content can we create and the best content at the end of the day is something that 's really really relevant to what 's going on right now and you 'll notice that a lot of the headlines and the media at the moment and advertising it 's all about covert nine team why because that 's top of everybody 's mind there 's a tool that 's part of Google called google.com slash alerts and you can put in their specific keywords so for example I 've got one on my name so once a week if anyone mentions Jeremy Carter on a blog on social little email which summarizes what 's going on and I also use this to follow other topics that will give me ideas about things that I might want to talk about on social media if we go back and we look at some of the topics related to your product or service so let 's say for example an accountant so we could talk about business activity statements we could talk about tax planning we could talk about structuring of companies so what we want to do and in the handouts for today by the way you get a template that will help you in doing this so we want to list all the topics and then we want to think about well what are some of the what 's the appropriate way to talk about this so we could have a rent what frustrates me as an accountant the number one thing that frustrates me if a number of business owners who come and talk to me and their accountant hasn 't educated them on really what the numbers mean in their business so a rant is very powerful for discussion on social media but we 're going to make sure that we 're talking about something related to the product or service that we offer a question and answer is a great way to get engaged on social media people love when they can put their questions up to be answered we could post a specific way to solve a problem a case study a useful tool so all of these things are very powerful and when we got to where we can is to make sure we really take advantage of the visual part of social media so you can see on the right hand side the know your lemons campaign which is a very powerful way to educate the marketplace on some of the things to be aware of in terms of early changes and breast cancer there was a one of the top bun social media campaigns from 2019 it 's done right your marketplace will do a lot of the work for you yeah it 's very this is a fun that 's interactive it 's clear and it makes it simple for people more powerful that someone shares your content then you have to pay for that content to be shared so once we 've created all of those different pieces of content what we want to do is to sit down and in one session basically schedule two to three months of content in advance and all you really need is if you came up with one piece of content a week okay and on top of that you found a way to share someone else 's content or found some other ways to engage so there was two or three social media interactions from your company per week you would be streets ahead of everybody else out there and if you 've already defined the topics it makes it a lot easier you know I 'm gonna have to worry about what am I going to talk about because it 's already planned you just need to step up and actually talk about it of course with different businesses there 's different times of the year that are really important so with accountants it becomes the you know there 's the want to make sure we avoid dead zones and for a lot of companies in Australia basically from after the Melbourne Cup until Australia Day people aren 't paying a lot of attention about about new business but I know for other businesses that 's their busiest time of year so we really want to make sure that we 're talking when people are listening and this is another secret to understand that we need to also be posting at the right time now there 's some of the social media gurus out there who say you should be posting 20 times a day and you know in reality the data shows that there 's really and this is a this was an experiment about how many social media posts per week will generate you how many visits to your website so if you 're doing eight social media posts a month which is two a week that 's going to generate you about four visitors to your website you can see there that moving to twelve you 're still really not generating any more visitors so you 'll get you don 't need to post every day if you could post find a way to post something twice a week you 'll be headed in the right direction and it doesn 't always have to be a big piece of content you know there 's in terms of memes there 's something called a meme generator where you can very quickly select a quick image what a headline along with it and punch it out there is a very quick way to communicate to your client base we also want to have a think about when is the right time to put our posts out there because there 's what 's called the golden hour in first aid and you know after something happens after a trauma occurs we 've got now to save somebody 's life and the same thing goes with your social media post if you put it out there and no one engages with with your post within the first hour it will die so you can see here that really the times between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. are the best time for when the best times have been proven to be Tuesday Wednesday mornings around 10 a.m. because what the secret is if you want people to interact with your post very very quickly now I know some people they will actually partner up with other businesses and they 'll all post at the same time and they will share and like and comment on each other 's posts and this will enable the content to go a lot a lot further when it comes to engagement mark zuckerberg in 2018 understand that you know he 's really focused on retaining people on the platform and to do that he needs to make sure that the content that they see is relevant to them and it used to be if you created a business page and people followed that page and you put a post out there pretty much everyone would see it Facebook 's come up with a new algorithms if you 've got a business page and you 're putting posts out there that people aren 't reacting to or comment on then they 're getting through to very very few more and more about that two-way conversation through social media it 's not about what you 've got to say it 's about finding ways to engage people in a informative and educational way you know in fact I would call the economy that we 're at the moment is called edutainment yeah a combination of education and entertainment you put those two things together you can create great results this is an example of a social media campaign by Marvel when they were launching ant-man and instead of putting up massive billboards all over town what they did was they put these miniature ones and they put a challenge out there to people to go and find them would you rather pay to install a tiny billboard like this or a large billboard at 5,000 a month this wasn 't a great viral marketing campaign where again people went out there they found these they followed the clues they found these billboards and then they shared them all over social media for the brand so I understand as business owners there 's a lot we 've got to do way of doing what you have to do in terms of service delivery looking after your clients so as we move through social media we need to make sure we test and measure what we 're doing it 's good to actually keep a little scorecard to be able to measure our results to measure your progress in terms of the number of followers the number of interactions the number of leads that you generate from social media to look at what 's working for other people and to test new initiatives and you know optimization is just about you 'll find a sweet spot and you repeat what works and you stop doing what doesn 't work what you also want to do is to build a great business you need a great team and to have a great social media presence requires you to have a great social media team so I want you to think about potentially building a a social media marketing team and it doesn 't need to cost the earth you know there 's agencies that will come in and do it for you do it all well there 's no need to spend anywhere near that amount there 's um what 's called the gig economy so to get people to generate content for you to write articles to create memes to come up with ideas there 's a website called Fiverr and this is all about it used to be when it started if you wanted anything done for five dollars then you could do that but this is a great way to start thinking about how can I get some pieces of my social media actually out sourced and created for me because again you want to create all of your content and blocks to make it easy so let 's say you were recording some videos my suggestion is record all the video content at once go and find yourself a video editor on Fiverr and they will put it all into their little chunks that you can put out there and share with the marketplace advertising on social media social media platforms are there to make a profit and they do make it easy to get into advertising they so you 'll notice once you create a business page Facebook will continue to come up time and again and say do you want to boost this post so it gets through to more users and understand this is quick and doesn 't typically it 's quick and it 's easy but it 's not great value the back end of Facebook the advertising engine is just incredibly powerful in terms of being able to target people and my suggestion here when you 're looking at advertising on social media is consider getting an expert to help you because what you 've got to be able to do too is generate a return on investment so in terms of measuring and testing you can see down the bottom there there 's a little graphic around well a full marketing campaign might cost us a dollar a click to run a Facebook ad if we 're smart we 're not just going to send that to our website we 're going to send it to a landing page so a landing page is basically a one-page website that says do you then create videos that we remark it back to them so we might send a value video which gets people to fill out a survey which locks people in to our calendar to actually have a conversation so we can see right through this process here we can we can see what it 's costing us to get to a one-to-one conversation and the calendar or to be able to generate a client out of this and you know again Google AdWords as well it 's easy to spend money but if you don 't are not targeting the right audience what you 'll tend to do is generate a lot of leads that really aren 't relevant now I don 't know if you 've ever noticed that use visit a website and then suddenly their ads follow you around the internet wherever you go and this is something called retargeting which again if you 're looking into marketing it 's a very very powerful tool to make sure that you know understand if someone visits your website they 're probably thinking about it but not ready to buy way to stay in contact with these customers and to continue to market to them and this can greatly increase your return on investment with the marketing that you do so we covered a lot of content today and understand that knowledge is not power it 's only when we put knowledge into action that it becomes powerful so if you don 't do anything different then typically we go backwards many people do little things in their business and you know they end up just to maintain the status quo but if you want to create a better future you need to think about doing some things that you haven 't done before or potentially being a business that you haven 't_''_3464.24 been before and this is about either changing what you do or the way in which you put yourself out there to the marketplace and this is one of the great things with social media because we can do this very rapidly and very quickly so it 's easy after this webinar to go back and get distracted but what I 'd really like you to do we covered here and think about well what are the top three things that I can put into action in the next seven days based upon this because here 's the thing if you don 't do it in the next week it won 't happen at all there 's also a feedback survey I 'll just put the link back up here again and if you can complete that then you can complete that survey then you can download a copy of the slides and also the resources that I mentioned with the content creator and the social media calendar and once you hit submit on that survey it 'll give you the link to be able to download that if you 'd like more information my contact details are there and also on that feedback form there is the option if you 'd like to opt in for a one-to-one conversation we can have a little chat about your business and how to get social media working well for you I 'd like to thank Kendra banks town economic development department for sponsoring this webinar and making it and this is the first of hopefully a few more webinars to come to support local business owners so in the survey we 'd love if you could tell us what topics you would like to see in the future to support you as business owners the council also asked me to mention the fact that they 've just released some new business grants specifically for cafes and restaurants to assist them in marketing to bring their customers back after this period of shutdown so you can find more information about that on the canterbury bankstown website or by emailing the email address business cb city NSW govt you if you enjoyed today we 'd love if you could put a word out there on social media using the hashtag keep connected CB TV and this wraps up our first first series of webinars but hopefully we 'll be able to announce more in the near future so thank you all for coming today really appreciate you taking the time out of your day _"

    "text": "breaks are you pee yes it 's time for pirate school number four ah happy right we 're back and we 're still learning how to be good for pirates but friendly like hahaha I need some more bills I could ship beer test right in these times of isolation it 's a really really cool cuz I can 't get comfortable so I 'm going the old-fashioned way of on Facebook and stuff like that and on CB TV haha so you tune in find out all these secrets held it be a cedar team come work for me or maybe some other player in you know around the place you know maybe there 's a part is impressive girl from you know we 'll see what happens but anyway now what do we learn about today I think we just better start with the basics again just so it 's a little always in your head right get it in your noggin right so Aaron what sound we make come on everybody remember we 're gonna try and shiver these Timbers come on give them a go to now who remembers how to stand like a pirate all right hands on hips in the air and laugh do you mean already captain why are you say that remember I you means yes yes we 've covered that last week didn 't we hahaha yes just get them and avast hold still oh good job now who remembers their port through this starboard right ma 'am but port this idea star beside port we see you on the same on this one the other side of the harbour is where you 're loading in and this dear inside that 'sa starving right and the front that 's the bow down there that 's up right now last week last week we talked about cannons you know that fire in the big guns exciting stuff but it was kind a bit longer to cut out the bit about the actual cannon shells the things we for her I talked about the round shot right a bit say was about that saw ease you know with a 6 pounder and all that kind of stuff right but basically there 's lots a pirate we got three basic ones are used around shot right which is for long distances and for tech and land and stuff where you got to smash things up and all that cast off but from the actual job right for our actual job when we 're trying to get a ship the to use the most right are the chain a ball and the grape and canister right there the to use a great big canister and the chain and ball because again remember we got a fast ship and we hang around the showers we catch up to him by surprise we come in from behind them when they go into the window we chase up after we kind of down right so we want to get as close as we can do it right and we want them to stuck so we can border them and then we can get all their treasure because if we use the round chunk we sink them all the treasure goes the bottom of the sea ain 't go doing us is it because we don 't think we bell or anything like that I got a little borrow we do four legs and things are you go down and get it all with submarines a lot kind of rubbish nobody on either moving to here we 've just got the old-fashioned way you 're bordering the ship and steel and everything up and then taken off of leaving them to get there on the way home right that 's how we do it so what we do is we get them there into the wind we catch them as where we can then the shells like the call the chain and ball they 're like two shells together but they held together they were like with a chain or or a little bar right okay chain and bar I should have said before that 's a chain and bar okay so what happens when the kids try to have a can they spin them and go and I 'll hit right they can take it out on Mars because they wrap around the Marcel you might pull it over then crack it or they can go through sales do sort of spots them for their progress I and the same sort of thing for the calluses it 's start with a chain the ball try and hit the X nails and whatever storm down giving troubles you might even hit the wheel destroy that wheel you do all sorts of damage with that thing cause it 's spinning around nobody knows where you just gonna you don 't have to be so accurate you do well that it 's a good job by that now the graven Casto is pretty much you know grapes make a little seeds in it you 're gonna see degree that so he crushed down the seed to come out it 's the same idea right so it 's a canister full of small bits of metal and all sorts of stuff with a narrow balls and we do the balls okay so what happens when we close we fire that and it rips everything apart because it just spreads out up and it goes through and throat shreds on the sales and other stuff and why they 're in shock that 's of how we do it which leads me to today 's tool we 're talking about today 's tool is my flip mark pistol right here we go a flintlock pistol that 's it alright you can see it there a flintlock pistol is today 's tool gonna examine because that 's what we use now a flintlock pistol this is I 've just got one with me today right just one but normally I 'd carry what 's called a brace brace means alright is enough you carry too many more you clunky because again we 're in and out quick right we don 't go over to the ship right you don 't want to have too many and they can only throw one shot at a time they don 't like those model things like you see you on tell you where they just shoot all at allyou these one two get one shot right and they 're not real accurate lee 's either right because they don 't have rifling in them okay the modern guns have these rifle and it makes them more accurate these they 're pretty quick and I 'm running forward so two shots and I 'm pretty much down then I 'm able to cut us alright that 's what a cutlass is for that 's our main tool of colors remember the Cutlass that 's it there so I 've got no arm the pistols there the brace of them there I need fire and ice sorry even though they 're not Packard the good thing about them not having rifling right is that we can make our own shop okay so we can build down the lid it a little molds we make the little balls and go with them right and we in the powder you make around part powder so we 're still sufficient right so we don 't have to pop off to the shop to get them and all this kinda get the fancy loads and all that my stuff we can do all our old stuff okay and that 's when you 're out in the sea you you 're a pirate after all you you 're not really gonna drop at a shop way there that patch is very familiar but we don 't do we know so this is it right so flintlock two words what do they mean well basically a flint is a really hard stone and then people use of the fire fire you get it off metal and you 'd start a fire it gets sparks when the bed of the foot hits the metal the spark so the old days I used to like fire as I might be out there in India flint rock anymore in the spark and come on it 's really hard storm and so that 's the way it works right and lock it 's a mechanism like the locks on your house and all that kind of stuff and locks where you get into in water channels and what casa so luck is just a type of mechanism so free block cuz it 's a lot with plate if you look at this right that 's getting calls that 's my flintlock you see now that back half it right see just sticking out their top there that 's a bit can undo and I can replace the flame when it gets a bit small entirely right that and then it hits good this cause Ephesian this thing here right so it hits that and that 's what causes the spark into the pan this is this there and that is where the powder goes to ignite and then it goes and so that 's why it 's called the pan so we 've got the expression flash in the pan right so if I was to click it and it just flashed and didn 't fire that 's a flash depends on the short lived and all that kind of stuff that 's where that expression comes from flashing up in also when you 're loading you put in a half like that see that 's half cocked that 's full right so when it 's half property you don 't want to go when it 's half talk coughed so that 's expression no don 't go off half-cocked well that 's what it is you don 't want to go half because you 're still loading it and probably won 't spark enough and all that sort of stuff right so how big a loaded well a lot of these ones right people have things called a power the horn and a bag of shells they 'd have the holes and I would just do the fill up with all powder and I got the rammer and all that sand they should put the shells and Ram it down that kind of thing then aborting but that takes a bit of time so me harina I use the way that 's common amongst on the other life because I get it mostly I 'm gonna go in with the two one 's loaded okay but if I needed away mergency I 've got a few of these in my person right spray it away now there 's a little tact got a shell in them right got a bullet in it they 're real round bullet and enough powder to firing okay so I 've got these little patches with paper and stuff free so what I do is I by the end of that put a little 'll put it in them in there I get the rammer I shove it down right after Rama it 's down there then it 's ready to go you do a full clock and you can fire right that 's how we load it okay that 's a lot quicker so I do that if I need an emergency doing that so you remember that 's how it goes now when you 've got it loaded how do you fire it okay so it 's fully cocked now ready to go so this one because you see the shape of it it doesn 't have a brown handle like that and you see those guys down here or like this and like a stuff this one actually follows the length of your arm right so you can hold your arm up straight up to your eye and you should look down your arm and that 's how you name it like that so people ready thank you for you that way that 's how you see where it 's going to all so it 's like that fine I won by that kind of thing but that 's how it works right so that 's a flintlock pistol another one of our great tools all right now interesting enough I put the gun down there so don 't trouble we do thanks because we gonna be doing out jumping around bit suited right we don 't you don 't put around crop and pistols everywhere oh that 's the other thing when you 're at sea and stuff like that you probably wouldn 't have you gone loaded right like the paper in the wadding will keep it jammed in there a bit right when you 're in emergency but you don 't want to have it just sitting there it might go off we get wet too that 's what I think you look after your guns right you want to keep them dry keep the powder dry and all you know it about keep the power to draw it 's another one keep it the powder dry you don 't get it wet all right because there 's no good to your way because you don 't want gun and look after it you don 't eclis between all that kind of stuff that 's why pretty much for two shots thing on that things aren 't working we leave again right we don 't need to be there if it 's things are we gonna do too much work we don 't want to be there where pirates we 're not working then we just do our jobs and we get out of there right and that 's the other reason why I 've not got time don 't these little power okay using steroids because as a sailor right you 're not working all the time we do ships same as anything else but when you 're not on shift rate so your towers are nose kind of thing a girl sleepin right to make a whole 24 hours but there that one eight hours you 're off what do you do with your time you know you 're on a ship you can 't_''_641.61 do much you can 't go out and shop skate do nothing so you you know you 're saying and you like and I make these shells and do that so I 'm ready to fight when comes that 's why right now we had a few words a few phrases or you know or some of you know when your parents have definitely know that also let 's go a few more of them enough to tell you that came from pirate and shipping and all those though you so cut and run you heard about cutting and running well that 's pretty much as it sounds right so we 're talking about creeping up on those ships if the ship was a tank like this right like to be interested in there and and go right they saw us coming up behind and there 's a solar parry there and I got no time you get there and grow up takes a wild game that girl and I 'll show you that in a minute to is we 're gonna do angle reason in a minute takes you a while you know so what they do is they cut and run then they cut the rope to the anchor and run comes for right so what else will we got hard and fast that 's another good one hard and fast you heard about hard and fast rules right rules you can 't change well that comes from when you run aground like if you don 't know where you can win sometimes you know what you might go in where it 's too shallow right if you havin a good idea grass that 's somebody that measures the height of the the bottom of the sea to the top of the water I had a relative that did that you know all right hey captain Freddy 's meanwhile saturate anyway right so you don 't want them because you want to know when they have you those mats but if somebody 's done a bad job of it or it 's a place that nobody 's been sometimes you can run aground right and what happens is if you float they 're not really hard and you run aground well you get stuck and it 's called getting stuck hard and forests and forest as we can 't getting off then but that 's where that comes from a hard and forest right and the other one I 'm gonna do today is point down I 'm sure your parents are told you to pipe down or maybe your grandparents II point down in there point down well that is pretty much what it sounds like as well because point remember our point the bosun 's whistle great remember that right well end of the day right end of the day when the night watches take it over and all that sort of stuff and it 's depending what happened this avulsion does the last point of the day which is H which is pipe it up down which really means go down the event turn the lights off and go to sleep and be quiet so that 's what it is that 's where it comes from point down is actually the old shipit words and we parts to it as well so point down that 's pretty good very good okay now you know it 's still the same with sailors right we still tend to trick you okay so it 's easy to learn that 's a good they better learn a pirate now because it 's pretty easy to remember because even though Moodle ships you 've been out on the beach and seen those boats out to sea the big ones the big container ships and stuff like that the big flavors big oil tankers you see them out there when you look out next time you 're on the headlines I saw you look at me see those ball train well there 's three basic sciences a cover those and better arrange in the sizes bear the three basic categories they have there right so there 's handy size so that 's a smaller size right cuz it 's handy for going up and down the coast and dump it into smaller poppers and it could drop smaller loads off and on Tessa so it 's handy easy to go right makes sense handy size we want to port next size up this sounds more technical its Panamax mmm sounds like a big technical word in it actually what it means is the Panama Canal which is like in America 's ago the two bits of the Americas and it goes off through the thin bit right in Panama and they cut through so both can go through there and then wrapping all the way around down the bottom alright so they call that Panamax because if any bigger than Panamax you can 't do it that way you have to go around the bone so what do they call the big ships ago rather but they call them Pig size because the bottom is called the Cape so you 've got to go round looking so they came toys make six to them and how easy that remember you can impress your teachers with that because it sounds really technical sounds like you 'd know a lot and this is part now right we 're gonna cover something to do with the wind because pirate is all about the wind isn 't it right okay now you know we talk poor and starving all that set-asides but there 's other ways I defer to the champagne and then reverse of the illegal inside of a ship but that doesn 't stay the same as in your left and your right okay but it stays the same about how you work it out okay so the windward side of the ship is only the winds coming from all right so if the winds coming towards us like this that side of the ship is the windward side right that 's blowing across this that way that 's the windward side and this side of the ship where the winds going to that 's the leeward side right so Lee wins where the winds go to we know is where it 's coming from so if you 're gonna come to it we 're in a dolly ball pull up the side we 'd want to get on the leeward side because the big boat would protect us and we wouldn 't be banging it against the scene all the time right and we just float with the ship because we on the leeward side so that 's how you get in the ship from a jolly-boat right now only tied right you and the toy to go the same way so that 'll you would tie you it 's going that way all right so where the tides going in and the winds going across the air towards a harbor that 's how you would tie all right what else is there there 's the the leash all right all right the leash or again so if we sail in the B interest right you see the B interest here you see the shores over that side if the winds come from this side that would be the leash outside it 's a side of the harbor right that 's the way the way the winds going to right that 's where it is the leisure and that 's the side you got to watch out for right because the winds gonna push you across towards it so you can watch out for rocks and exactly in case you get pushed across too close to the rocks and that 's how you know when you 're gonna tack and all that kind of stuff because you know you want to tack away the cage but you know that 's what yeah you 'd have a guy in that one oh yeah well let the crow 's nest remember that right and you have somebody out here on the front keeping an eye on it making sure you weren 't gonna run into anything right would tell you that everything but that 's silly we 're just all right so you want to be careful about Lily you would sure and you might have heard the expression lately you know give me some leeway on that you know which means give me a bit of room on a no like a star or leeway is how far you 'll slide that way with the wind right so again if you say you learn that way you get pushed along though anyways how far you going to go before you don 't attack they go back the other way you determine or head back that way across the wind so gonna get washed in there or if you put an anchor in the leeway is how far you would get pushed across by the the leeway is how much you would go across it you wouldn 't want to have a really long anchor low rope on because you could watch onto the shore somewhere so if you 're in somewhere close you 'd want short anchor rope that has a father time to get out longer and all that stuff but the leeway is how far you rock that was in force alright so you 've learned some more okay now we 're up to some more SH and Ian you say again oh I 'm sorry but let me say it sea shanties is how we work all right that 's how we work so we have different types of sea shanties right there 's five different types were gonna cover to talk about right now so I 'm only gonna sing one I don 't even you various is joy but it gives you the idea of why we sing them and all that sort of stocky so there 's the short hauls bones right so they 're quick and fast for jobs are quick we 'd sing along to it of rhythm because you 're hosting one of those like the gym or something small so we 'd sing that song right makes it work it easy when you 're sing a song right or a long-haul song would be if we 're gonna raise a big heavy sail with a master all the way up if you 're long and that slow has breaks in it right because I 'd be doing that cut off the next one is the captain right that capstan one which I 'll cover a bit more in minutes we 're gonna sing a captain when I read that 's what we 're gonna go with I 'll tell you what a captain is it 's really the device you raise the anchor with re and it 's a big slow job right so you need breaks in that so it 's a kind of call and response he tied one with break something like that so we 're gonna do that one now because we haven 't tried one of them really before we just talked about it a bit to move that now Fox will one is basically part of the way you okay so that 's when you go back and you know I was saying before you all that time what do you do we like to sing songs all right we like to sing songs that 's what I do right so we sit in a few songs and they 're all happy ones and battle features and love and just funny right daddy the ones you when you stand on that kind of thing that right that 's what you do with a folk swing and the other type of Waylon songs and they disdain depressing because been a waiter is dang depress me you know you 're a less smelly oil my self you down the bullet for heaters and you 're probably gonna get eaten by a whale so they 're all about grief horror stuff then whale is a winter so we don 't really worry about them in Pirates because we 're having so the full pirates good job right now I 'm a captain what is it captain right well castles how you make sense to you there so it 's a big thing in the middle you see those bits of wood right they actually get pulled out so you just see the squats there and the Rope goes around it we put those in there we got a different man on all of them right and then the man by that alright look sideways this is the right way see you get on them and you push and you walk around in a circle right she just walk arounds I 've got this bit of rope stick here that we used last week right so like it 's jumped in and you 're walking around like that tube lift it up but you need to do it everybody in time okay because if one person pushing the other on stands there that ain 't gonna work it 's not gonna go round except with each other they 're gonna fight you know the stakes we talked about that on the boats you know so you need me when we 're together so how do we do that we see all right this one has a rest in it so you saying it riff so I 'll just go through the first verse right do that and then you can have a go so you call and response so I go come on me say you fellows and follow the sea and then I yell and this is what the both of you do we go to me way-hey both a man down and that 's where we push it alright now please pay attention and listen to me oh give me some time to blow the man down way-hey oh the man down alright so whenever I do the cut we go through the course together so that 's the to me way-hey both men down to me is a call to action then way hey brother man down and then it 's give me some time don 't blow the man down wait hey boy let 's go pushing and rest in between right so when you do that a bit of a break so we go around around circles circles once you finish the first right we should be you to do right okay so when I 'm singing the chorus bits the way hey roll the man down and I 'll give me some time to grow luminaire basically to blow the down minutes that 's your minutes all right using them out loud you get a better stick right it could be a with the spoon or anything pretend you 're pushing and I want you to go around in circles oh yeah are we singing okay me I 'm just gonna go there but 10 I 'm going around in circles because if I turn around that 's pretty rude stuff you don 't want to see the back of me obey you and see the back an old pirate school thing but then again you wouldn 't have to click on if you want to do that which is Ohio know why you 're doing there anyway if you still want to be a pirate this is what I do so we 're not the captain right now we 're pushing but we 're doing it and tie him with a song all right can young fellows and follow the sea to me way-hey both our man down now please pay attention listen to me give me some tied up oh the man down I hope all right join us my friend as we head out to sea to me way-hey blows our man town your spirit just put your sights nothing and sites you will see hey blow though man huh wait hey blow that mentor oh they stickers this Taylor 's issuing those are old to me hey go the Manta will all scurvy pirates we 're having a ball ha ha ha will be some trying to blow the man down hey blow the man down oh just a little Hobbit and lava detector will sprawl to me hey blow the man down I 'm telling wrong draft lies over us all Oh give me some time to blow the man down way they blow the man down and Yankees up pretty good eh and if you 've got a bigger job well horses right that was just a short version couple of ours is just to give you the idea if and hit your head your parents get upset with us that wouldn 't work out right would it cause we 're a few more pirate things to go remember if we were a hoped pirate we don 't have that many but we don 't anyway that mean you 've heard about the captain you 've learned about me pestle you have like a little bit of that kind of balls it 's all about tactics so you learn it as we go along eventually you 're gonna know all this stuff and you 'll just walk straight up to any ship and say car oh hey be a student of the good captain we can sleep but for now we 're gonna stop so a fire stairs because it 's time to finish high RNA I 'm gonna fight me down [Music] [Laughter] _"

    "text": "hi i 'm nick fury and this is number five in a series of six circus skills videos for canterbury bankstown city council this is advanced juggling this is for people that might have already done some circus skills and be curious about where you take them from there or some of the more advanced tricks that you can do and so in this little short three four minute video i 'm going to work with different objects that you can balance and and juggle scarves clubs rings and as well as that show you some more advanced tricks that you can do with balls as well so here we go i 'm going to reiterate the process of learning to juggle that i outlined in video number two only this time instead of using balls i 'm going to use scarves so here 's the first step you start with your hand down by your side i hope you can see that i 'm going to go back a little bit so you can see it better and you take the scarf across your body to the opposite shoulder flick with your wrist like this flick catch ah by the way sorry i 'm just gonna say you probably don 't have chiffon scarves at home but you can use like a light fabric is will work like silk will work or even you know like a big tissue is actually fine as well so as i said you take the scarf across your body over to the opposite shoulder you flick it up in the air and then you catch it with a sort of downward movement like this like you 're catching flies and then that hand takes it takes it around and then throws it up across the body and this hand catches it like this and so you get this movement going now just note that the fingers are pointing down and the wrists are up okay so you don 't catch it like that you catch it like that with that sort of downward sort of catching flies movement and you practice that and again as with the juggling with the balls you try and make that movement as smooth and as graceful as scarf for a long long time before you actually really get it sort of smooth and accurate so that 's step one here 's step two two scarves and same as juggling with balls the next thing and the key in fact to this is this movement that we call throw throw catch catch throw throw catch catch again throw throw catch catch note how the two scarves cross over one another they you know throw from left hand to right hand right hand to left hand like that they go you know a bit higher than your head maybe and you do that and then you stop and then you do it again and you stop and then you do it again and so the advantage of scarves of course is that they float more slowly so it 's easy to catch them and so you can pretty quickly move on to three and again the process is the same we did this with balls and we 're going to do this with scars where you start with two in your dominant hand and you 're just going to floor and not even worry about catching them okay because the hardest thing is actually just releasing them in rhythm so one two three drop drop drop that 's what you do and just do that 10 times to get that release working properly again throw throw throw drop drop drop again throw throw throw oops oh i even caught it i didn 't even realize i was doing throw throw throw drop drop drop okay all right and once you 've done it a few times it 's pretty easy to go oh okay i 'm gonna catch that one and and then away you go before you know it you 're juggling three scarves and there 's all sorts of variations you can do alrighty so that 's juggling scarves now lots of people really want to juggle clubs clubs and the way to do it is once but you 've got to be able to juggle balls before you can juggle clubs obviously but um the systematic way into doing it is well firstly to practice with just the club itself and get that movement going so middle it 's not like you hold it right up the end and try and spin it like that that 's never going to work but you hold it sort of in the middle and just flick it with your wrist so and again take the time to enjoy just practicing that and doing it just a little bit better every time a little bit softer and when that spin is kind of comfortable then try it from one hand to the other and what you 'll find of course is again your left hand is a lot further behind than your right hand so you 're actually going to have to practice it more with your left hand and you can see you can see how my hand the difference between my left and my right my right 's pretty confident my left is less so but in in practicing this thing because i 've got to get my left hand up to the same standard as my right hand and so it develops some ampy dexterity it empowers your left hand you 'll be surprised at what you left hand learns as well so once you 've done it in your left hand lots uh then you go from side to side okay just in a kind of systematic way like this and again you just work on smoothness and rhythm and flow and can you hear how that 's sort of making a clunk every time it hits my hands try and make it so that it barely makes a sound and that will contribute towards making it much smoother so when you 've got that then you get another another two balls and um you just throw the club in so you 're juggling two balls and one plumb and then you move on to two clubs and one ball and then you move on to three clubs and then you 're off the other thing that jugglers use a lot uh is a ring and in exactly the same way the same process just practice throwing the ring up and catching it a few times and also practice it with the other hand and then throwing it from side to side in that way again that it 's traveling in uh and then when you know you can achieve that confidently you bring in uh two balls and one ring there you go uh and then if you 're really keen how about a ball a club and a ring away you go and then there 's a whole bunch of tricks you can do after that that 's probably getting ahead of ourselves now okay uh there you go that 's uh advanced juggling things i 'm going to do one more thing for you and that is a routine of three balls just to see just to show you uh where you can go with three balls so you 've done throw through catch catch you 've thrown the third one in and you 've managed to nail a cascade juggle that 's called a cascade by the way all right so what about a trick watch watch the red one keep your eye on the red one okay just watch that as it sort of travels around in the flight path and now i 'm going to throw it over the top the top see it goes over the top this way and then the other way and then backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards and then you can get them all going over the top in one direction like that or they may be all going over the top in the opposite direction and then you turn them all in the opposite direction and you 've got a sort of reverse juggle happening you know okay uh all right now here 's a good one i love this it 's this sort of two up one down pattern which kind of surprises people but actually what it is is juggling two balls in one hand like that at the same time and then at the same time this other hand the left hand is just throwing the ball up like that pretty simple so you 've got to practice this bit in one hand and notice too that um i 'm juggling like the yellow one is on my right hand side and my red one is on my left hand side and they stay there they sort of jump those components together and there 's that two up one ball one down pattern which then leads into a whole lot of other things like this one and uh crossing them over in mid-air like this and oh this whole lot of these ones which are kind of yeah oops illusion juggling things and dropping them is half the fun um okay just a couple more i 'll just do that again that was what i was trying to show you and then it leads into that and then this and all sorts of other things and you know anyway there you go there 's a couple of things more than a couple of things to work on good luck see you later for the last one coming soon you _"

    "text": "come to another day with cooking with instant no screw that let 's just make a coconut creme flan super easy slightly dense but super creamy satisfying all your needs during isolation which is getting fat then we 're gonna add our coconut milk which is three quarter cups but make sure guys that your coconut milk is completely mixed in so the cream and the water is completely mixed in so it 's not separated then to finish it off add in your condensed milk now if you don 't want to add any dairy make sure you can use coconut condensed milk which is fine in specialty stores but also you could just make it with coconut milk and honey or maple syrup do so once your caramel 's ready put that into your molds um i think my moles about four centimeters across um he has no idea what the size of his dish is so once your caramel is done give it a bit of a swallow before it completely sets i 've done mine it 's one of those here 's what i prepared earlier actually style your mixture i have another here 's what i prepared earlier on um got my mixture going so i 'm just going to let this sit at room temperature for about 15-20 minutes so it sets really well while that 's happening boil your water get your oven going um and i 'll show you the next step but before we go with the caramel so i like mine to be slightly bitter because the mixture is quite sweet with the condensed milk and the coconut milk unless you 're using plain milk so i like mine to be a tad bitter what you can do is use a wooden spoon while your caramel has been made to just put some poke and get some of that in there let it cool for about a few seconds and taste it if you like it to be better go for this sort of dark amber color if not go for a sort of a lighter shade but this really works well with the sweet coconut mixture so that has set completely yeah that 's how you want it to 'm just we 'll keep that in mind i use this as like a roasting slash everything tin at the moment it 's kind of gone i don 't know what i made in there but i made something okay so what we 're gonna do now is we 're gonna pour our mixture pour in our boiling water and take this just under halfway that 's just the sugar just cracking up because it 's cold and you 're adding something hot in there now yeah so that 's just under halfway now it 's in there preheated oven at 150 degrees celsius and we 're going to leave it in there for about 30 minutes before we start checking it every 5 to 10 minutes to make sure it has the perfect water one eternity later we 're going to do a quick check of this now [Music] so it 's been 40 minutes yeah that needs about another 10 to 15 minutes probably 20. so we 'll check this every 10 minutes now hey guys it 's been another 10 minutes let 's have a look oh another 10 minutes and round it up to an hour and then we 'll take them out one hour later so guys it 's been an hour now so let 's switch it off and take these babies out so let me show you again if i take it out on how it looks and how it 's meant to look when you take it out you can see the slide wobble in there that 's what you need so before the first like before the last 10 minutes we 've had a first look at it it was massive wobble now let 's do that very slight wobble so what 's gonna happen now is that this will continue cooking so carefully because it 's super hot take it out let it sit at room temperature for about 20 to 30 minutes before you put it back into the fridge or you put it in the fridge till it completely cools down overnight so that was the recipe for the coconut creme flan and i don 't know why i did that accent but i just felt like doing you have to do is mix the ingredients put it into a bowl put in that bitter caramel if you need or super sweet caramel whatever where you decide to go bake it 30 minutes make sure you check it for a wobble and then check it every 10 minutes for an hour and take it out when it has a slight wobble cool it fridge it ah i want to eat one now um and then using a really sharp knife just go against the glass to i mean the ramekin to loosen it and then flop it over onto a dish or just eat it out really whatever whatever you prefer because it 's amazing clogs your arteries with all the coconut milk i just got an email but anyways try that out let me know like comment subscribe do all the things you do on instagram and follow me see you next time bye _"

    "text": "hello there I 'm Charlotte rose and thank you to Canterbury banks Town Council for hosting me on their platform today it 's really great to be part of the Kidd connected program I think everybody needs a bit of music right now since there 's not a lot going on otherwise and I 'm really excited to play some originals to you guys so I 'm gonna start off with a bit of a light happy one because you know it 's a light happy kind of a day it 's called wonder and ironically it 's about feeling lost and some not so happy things but it sounds happy [Music] to be light in a world it didn 't counting every out volume each spice through [Music] tiny people [Music] dancing running circles leading out like the seams party mom but we really feel so different your Louise she 's dressed just like boy [Music] hi joy [Music] Oh no one touch me [Music] in this world sometimes the light shades of light [Music] heeey [Music] Oh No [Music] Oh this time [Music] [Music] me [Music] Oh [Music] we 're hanging out for so long I am a folk singer-songwriter from Sydney and I 've been spending my days in isolation I feel like that 's how we 're gonna differentiate ourselves when we come out it 'll be like I 'm Charlotte I have blue eyes and in isolation I did this but I 've been spending my days learning how to play the banjo and I wish I could do a song for you but it doesn 't quite at my level of skill sound that good without a band yet so I will just have to do with some other kind of finger picking kind of stuff so this next song is it 's about it 's called better than I it 's an original and it 's about being left behind feeling like you 're being left behind like your partner 's better at getting over things or better at arguing than you or whatever just there you feel like you 're not as good at some things that was very eloquent all right I fell asleep to the sound of the way the when I work my house was in like [Music] hold it I could see was shining clears the day guess it 's true what they say all of my possessions began to float away on the lonely broken brick and stone I keep my head high try not to Travis you gone by we keep going round disappointed afraid type that you 're better swimmer than I [Music] I try to find myself in the debris but this river never slow down just for me [Music] upon its oil frame the house looks lonely Oh I keep my head I try not to drown us you gone by we keep going round there 's a point at every time thank you a basement I Oh your baby [Music] [Music] I keep my eye try not to dress yoga by we keep disappointed every time then your you 've always been [Music] always got to put a flourish at the end right alrighty this next one 's a cover that everybody should know a bit of a sing-along so get your vocal cords ready do your warmups I really like this a pub or a party or just hanging out in your room a good one especially road trips am i right ok when I wake up yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be the girl who wakes up next to you when I go out yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be the girl who goes along with you when I call them yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be the girl comes back home to you if I Haven yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna go over into you I could walk 500 miles in the I put over 500 more just to beat the girl who walks a thousand miles to fall down any or thought oh and I 'm working yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be the girls working hard for you when the money comes and for the work I do I 'll pass almost every penny off to you if I get drunk yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be oh yeah I know I 'm gonna be I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more just to be the girl who walked a thousand miles to fall down at your door but I but if a hundred I thought I thought I died [Music] when I 'm lonely yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be the girls only without you when I 'm dreaming yeah I know I 'm gonna dream I 'm gonna dream about the times that I 'm with you when I come home yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be the girl kansai home do when I go yeah I know I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be the girl that 's gonna I 'm gonna be the girls with you hi would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more just to be the girl the what the thousand miles fall down on any road oh I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 mark just to be the girl who what the thousand miles to fall down at that one needs someone cheering it 's really odd playing a set and having no one cheer I know that sounds terribly narcissistic of me but I feel like it 's a way to break up each song rather than than just flowing on to each other so I 'll just pretend you 're all cheering at home all righty this next one is a lot of fun I 'm a you know like I said I 'm a folk singer and folk singers songwriters we write a lot of sad songs and this one 's not sad so it 's quite an achievement for me it 's called for the mean time [Music] I never saw you in my life thought oh we are destined to be friends until this power oh how I wish the darts let me take the burden of that time and they party [Music] sometimes things a lot for me say I love my dogs get in the way based on my [Music] they look at me that night I love shining you 're right the kind of loop that I played one time steel is way for to me [Music] and recycle these before we found ourselves [Music] me I only had [Music] I love designing your eyes the kind of Lupin a faizon we both know you have to go likewise I say sunny for to me now I don 't know just what has changed why my mind feels rearranged but I swear this time it 's a play to take your bags and sing like why do we games bad days time why 'd you come back [Music] way the stars from the night you 'll join them on your flight and I 'll keep on looking [Music] every part we stumbled up they didn 't about towns is only for the me [Music] we are you look nice [Music] funny time please say it 's a need for to me [Music] I hope it 's only for me [Music] [Music] so yeah that 's a happy one this next one is actually also a happy one they 're about the same the same guy the same relationship so I guess I you could say it 's going pretty well she was like but why are you thinking about Canberra it 's so dagi and I feel like canva is not dagi anymore cuz there 's so many students there all my friends really love it like getting away from the city but still having that kind of metropolis but yeah it 's called going to Canberra it 's about doing a midnight drive to Canberra from Sydney just for love in the name of love and actually this is one that I do with my band the fallen Robins you can check us out if you like [Music] by some high watching blurry trees pass by it 's midnight just start in the drop down in town on dude could there I found something that I think just might be worth the time I 'm going came and hit a stop and the umpire and now he doesn 't care if it takes me all night I 'm going to Cambridge see what I can find I 'm not my PC going almost 140 play and not school tailor singing harmonies posture trapeze in the lake Lord have never to I 'm going I don 't care if it takes me on I 'm doing never see what I can find I 'm gonna figure out what am I for many times I made the drive with my hopes up in the sky now I know that every Turner goes right oh and I 'll keep going back down I only wanna try listening to the best thing in my company a fire here see what I can find in this part of my and all he don 't hear me online see what I 'm gonna sodomite I 'm gonna figure out yeah oh thank you I have an audience now the child Nick still screamed I feel like that counts right alrighty so now I 'm going to do a very graceful swapping of instruments which with my home set up isn 't the greatest bear with me one moment and then we got to pray that this one stayed in tune ah good enough some people are gonna kill me for saying good enough so I haven 't been playing the electric guitar too long I can do anything you want to do with an acoustic guitar but I was drawn in because this guitar is just so pretty and I 've been listening to a lot of Triple J and you know it 's it 's it 's nice to experiment with different styles so I got this electric guitar thinking I would experiment with different styles but really all I 've done is play the same stuffs but with an electric guitar so this song here is an original that I wrote while I was travelling through Europe and I just gone to Iceland where there 's beautiful mountains and ocean and it 's very rugged and ended up in Rome doing a nursing course long story but after Iceland going to Rome where it 's all concrete and similar to Sydney but with way more history obviously but similar to here I just missed the mountains so this song 's about getting back to the mountains [Music] [Music] if I were to fly like the birds on I would I ever see your gain up for traded buildings for the mountains the sea feeling like my wings have died understood I would like the cityscape where nothing ever grows give me one by race that 's all I need and I were chasing the sunset all [Music] if I were to fly like the birds on high would I ever see you again traded buildings for the mountains in the sea would you follow me on my [Music] if I fly like the birds on high what do we ever see you 're gay if I traded buildings for the mountains in the sea yeah would you follow me on my way but you follow me on my would you follow me on my way would you find me on my would you follow me Am I little shorty little shorty some yeah alrighty so this next one is a cover and it 's like a pop party song I 've always seen it that way but now listening to it back while we 're in isolation I actually think it 's quite pertinent to the situation at least it describes how I feel I 'm not the most positive person I 'm been wearing on me and this pretty much sums it up although let 's not get too negative it 's still just a banger so sing along if you know the words picking my way through the darkness guided by a beating heart I can 't tell where the journey will end but I know where to start say that I 'm too young to understand they say I 'm caught up in tree I will pass me by if I don 't open up my eyes that 's fine by me so wake me up when it 's all over when I 'm wiser and I 'm older all this time I was finding myself and I didn 't know I was lost I try carrying the weight of but I only have two obey the chance to travel the world but I don 't have any place I wish that I could stay forever this young not afraid to close my eyes life 's a game made for everyone and love is the prize so wake me up when it 's all over when I 'm wiser and and I didn 't know I was lost I didn 't know I was lost [Music] I didn 't know didn 't know I was lost I didn 't know what was loathe didn 't know I was lost [Music] alrighty one more change of instruments uno momento I 'm most awkward person in the world when doing anything ok so let me just check my little sense list here pretty good I 've got two more songs for you guys they 're both originals so stick around the first one this first one I 'm gonna play it 's actually a song that it 's written by me but I gave it to my band the fallen Robins we were supposed to release an EP and it got completely decimated all of our plans and our festivals and our gigs and interviews and everything they were all cancelled so we had to postpone so the EP hasn 't seen the light of day yet I 'm gonna play you this song it was the first song I ever wrote and it 's the very first song on the EP you like it [Music] got a full tank of gas but it 's all the way go anywhere will do just as long as he stop talking take the collet stick it very very close as fast as you can these tight [Music] past those places were made [Music] what brings you tonight [Music] little ones ahead all these twists entitled ends for this test all our decisions [Music] are you gay wipe away lovey this attorneys just fatigued [Music] hey hey [Music] Evon [Music] things we should [Music] Oh well thank you very much for sticking around if you have to this point and thank you again

    "text": "[Music] it 's time for some more pirating school lesson number three that 'd be right we 're back to learn some more about the wonderful world of pirating and all those little skills you can have to give you a good job in banking and insurance and all those other kinds of the jobs where pilogen 's is really taken care of they love a good pillager in those ones right so what are we gonna do well let 's just refresh our memories a couple of things quickly first okay so how do we stand like a piratey remember and it 's on our lips that 's right legs apart very good and then we 're rocking on the ship ah that right now we look up to the side and we laugh [Laughter] good job give me an r that 'd be it give us another good good right now who can remember their port from their style but remember that 's your port the left side where we load starboard that 's the steering side where the rudder goes down right that 's the right side the back turning full swoop there it 's yard i love that one do you give me an r r give me another all right we 've got the r down back shall we you know patch i uh psychologically mess it with my own head there oh you 're going to be crazy to be a pirate but it 's good fun have we weren 't good at the neighbours yet give us a heart and wake up the neighbors ready neighbors say hi good job okay now i 'm going to teach you some more words you 're all going what else do we say as pirates i 'm going to teach you a few words at the beginning of this class and we 'll do this over each class a few little part words so you can get more like speaking like a pirate so you speak proper like me probably that 's beautiful we 're all in this together all right so when we say hello to what do we say we say ahoy there okay usually because one time you were yelling from a ship you just go hoy there shipmate that 's saying hello all right now when we start these classes i go a virus there you know what that means it means hold still stop what you 're doing all right that 's what it is that 's why i say a virus there because pay attention to me right so embarrassed so now when your teachers if they watching this as well learn about what a virus means they might go a virus there you go i know what he means now a virus there means stop what you 're doing all right okay now we also i say i you hear me say i that means yes right so when you go aye aye captain you 're going yes yes captain because i 'm important then you want to be really attending say oh sorry captain ah that 'd be right give me another captain aye aye captain good job i like it when you get that that 's good all right what else is there believe that that 's another one all right believe that means hold on wait pins right we use them on ships they hold the sails in place and all that kind of stuff but i 'll go over that later i 'll show you a bullion piano now you tie off a ship and i i tell was saying all the ropes and all that kind of stuff so we 'll do that later so play that means all that right now now another b word is booty do you know what booty is that be our treasure that 's right we call it now booty you remember the song all right black sheep have you got any booty my booty is our treasure oh you 're all with search and treasure and booty all right one last word that 's me jolly roger the jolly roger you see i 've changed the shot a little bit here today so you can see me jolly roger fully all right there it is jolly roger be our flag one of the pirates have their own jolly roger and you can tell bits about what the pirate is by the look of your jolly roger okay bones and the whole kind of pirate head on the top of the patch right but they have all sorts of manner of things on them all different pirates because they 've got all different personalities and as we go along i might even do a whole session on pirate flags over here just to explain which ones they are so we 'll cover that later maybe all right so now finished with as word so now we 're going to talk about firing the big gun all right we 're talking about tools each time with that so the big guns right now so you know what i mean by big gun right okay all right pirate ships have these cannons all right i think this picture you see that see that cannon there right very good big cannons we have on this high you know these cannons get up to 42 pounds right 42 pounders now pounders might seem a bit strange to you because uh well pounds is the old measuring way okay when they say 42 pounds 42 pounds is actually the size of the cannonball size of the cannonball that could take you right so 42 pounder is a big ball and that 's a big cannon and you know you remember my ship over here it 's only a little chip all right so i don 't do that a lot of parties didn 't so i have six pounders online right you know four or five on each side okay and we have them sitting on top of the deck too you know that not not down below you know you see those on with it they 've got their little things that open up and all that kind of stuff we don 't have that in this ship because it 's only small so we have the cannons on the deck and we cover them with canvas right when it 's not on you know when it 's not being used they 're just from the weather we keep them covered up with canvas and stuff like that for that as you can just see on the back there there 's some in the back you just see the bit of canvas them covered over on the next one we don 't have them down below because you know we gotta have somewhere to sleep ourselves right and we want something for our booty right so there 's not enough room so we just have them on the deck sitting on the deck hide in there that kind of stuff and you can see they sit on carriages right they sit on these carriages and i got these ropes that hold them all in place and stuff like that you see the ropes there very important i 'll explain all that and the carriages they got wheels that 's weird too isn 't it why they got wheels different sorts of stuff you know so we 'll just cover that now the cannon right it 's made out of brass right not on because i 'm rust brass doesn 't rust so much right it 's also a lot lighter than i end so we do that cannonballs now they 're made of iron because you know they 're not made of lead like you know like balls you shoot at each are made i think because you know think about it they 're going through wood you 're trying to sink a ship right you don 't want to be doing late through that you 've got stuff and and you know if you 're attacking land you wanted to go through bricks and stuff you know you can 't_''_391.039 do that with leads so the cannonballs themselves are orient and you know a six pound ball is about that size all right that 's about six pounds right it 's about three just under three kilos in your new measurements right but six pounder that 's the kind of ship i 've got and the crew of these jumps you know you got your master gunner and gunners mate they were looking after the guns and doing them by the work and then in charge of them you 've got the gun captain and then the other guy you 've got is a good mock as a gun monkey or the powder monkey as we call him all right which is one of these other jobs that you were talking so i 'll go on over what you do for that all right now so what happens all right first up you need powder right the powder what happens with the powder now we just don 't have it lying around all over the ship okay because you know you know get wet they wouldn 't be able to use it nothing worse it 's a wet powder and it 'll explode is it and then there 's other times if you don 't treat it right it 'll explode anyway right so the powder came in canvas bags like this only bigger right so you needed half as much powder is the weight of the ball all right so the ball being about three kilos so but you need about a kilo or just under a kilo and a half right of uh powder right to go in to make the gun shoot proper that 's how much power you 'd use right so it 'd be a bag of that size a bag of sugar just a bit bigger than a bag of sugar right so that 's would you do with this it 'll be stored in one room right the powder room that 's where it 'll be kept in the powder room makes sense really doesn 't it not like powder in your nose actually powder there you pound your nose this is a blob in your face crazy crazy now the powder room is where we get the powder right and there 'll be one going right whose job would be to be in the powder room only one nobody else would enter it all right he 'd bring it to the door and he 'd hand it over to the powder monkey which is the job i was telling down and the powder monkey would take that and he would run back to the gunner and he 'd give it to him and then he 'd run back and get another one and go to the next girl and that 's what the power when you do they 'd run around delivering the powder to everybody that 's what they call the powder monkey right because they scurry all over the ship carrying but why would they only have one person in the powder room well that 's because of static electricity right have you ever got on a carpet right you 've got your shoes on and you scurry your foot really fast right really fast all right you get there you 're ready really fast and then he 's touched somebody and a spark comes out and he goes oh it gives a bit of a sting well that 's static electricity all right it 's formed by two surfaces rubbing together and it creates electricity all right and so if a spark went off in the powder room and take the whole place out you get blown up so you don 't want to do that yeah no no so they dress in special clothes that were just not frictiony you know like because like a jumper wool you wouldn 't wear one of those in there it 'd be cotton shirts all the time and all that kind of stuff loose fitting cotton shirts or something like that but so they weren 't rubbing on anything see it goes 's why when you put your socks in the drawer they stick together that 's static electricity ah so you 're learning things there and you wouldn 't be wearing shoes you 'd have bare feet like we 're talking about before because you don 't want to be sliding that and you 're inside your feet at all no you wouldn 't be sliding your feet you 'd be walking like this all right you heard the expression step lively well that 's where it comes from in there you 're stepping lively because you don 't want to slam drag your feet you start dragging your feet the whole place goes up with a bit of static electricity so good reason to step lively so next time you step lively you do it you might blow up we 'll see you all right so powder monkey he rushes back with the canvas bag back to the gunners all right all right i 've made just for you and i 've done some little instructions i 'm gonna put up on the facebook my friends over there oh you to put up little instructions on how to make these so i made this little cannon right out of household items little tube here the gun all right it 's got a back bit there right there you can see that where the ropes all go through the little torch all at the bottom touch all the bottom there like that and it 's on a card all right so that way i can explain to you how we would load the gun and then we 're gonna have a go at it all right we can have some go ah but not this one because it 's too small but we 'll just pretend we 've got a gun and we 'll go about the whole process about loading and firing the gun which should be fun right all right good i think i need an eye captain aye aye captain oh yeah that 's it give me an eye good job all right so what happens next besides the cannon falling over there all right here we go so he comes back the gun 's sitting there away so it 's all there waiting to go so on the crew first thing they do is they get the powder they put it in then they got a rammer so it 's a long stick with a blunt end on it right they push it down to the sound right down to the end pack back again right then they get a bit of water a bit of cloth and they put them in there they put that round all the way down there it is right then they get a cannonball right and now six pounders would be loose you don 't have them until they 're tight because you don 't get them stuck right so loose so they have a roll down sort of you put another bit of water in there and that 'll be tapped in and be ready to go then the gutter captain right he would come up and see the little olive out there the touch hole there right he 's got a spike and he jabs that in there right to bust the little bag that 's in there so you would tip you 'd have a horn and you tip that one with a little bit of powder into the top and then it 's ready to go all right then they 'd get on those ropes and they 've got pulleys at the front there right and then pull on the rope and the cannon would move up to the side of the boat and just sit there inside the boat all right then it 's ready to go then the gunner the captain 's gonna captain there right he would aim the thing so they work out exactly where they want to go is it ready right and then you come back with a thing called a stick long stick about this long called a slow match right now slow matches we 'll call that because they burnt slow ah we 're pretty clever aren 't we just call things where they are good job anyway look so it 'd be about that so he 's that size would take an hour to burn right about a foot per hour which is that 's close to a and what they would do is until the government was ready and i knew where they want to fight they already aim and then they go fire and he would stick that into the hole and that would ignite the gunpowder and it would fire all right and that 's where the expression fiery the hole comes through by the way when the fire goes in firing oh that 's where that comes from all right so when that happens two things would happen right first the gun bullet the gun the shell would just fire out the wire at your target right but the gun itself would rocket backwards until the ropes caught it and stopped all right that 's what the ropes are there for all right because if the rope i mean the gun kept going look off the other side and smash the other side one of the people you 've been thinking yourself that 'd be very embarrassing very embarrassing wouldn 't it you know all right other embarrassing things that 's why you put wadding in front of the ball because if the ship right so it 's gonna put water on top just to stop it from rolling out doesn 't do anything else but keep it fast in there right okay so when it rolls back that 's when you can clean the gun all right so what happens then is they get what something called a worm which is a long stick with a squiggly bit on it and you 're in there and you 're screwed in there to get all the bits of water out because you don 't want anything stuck in there because you don 't want anything hitting there and stopping the ball from traveling because it 'll all explode you 've gone better behind it don 't blow up in your face and that 's always embarrassing too and you lose your head nothing worse than going to a party without a head ain 't nothing worse a little bit of patch surgery there all right okay so you do that with the worm then it 's hot right it 's hot you don 't want to put gunpowder into a hot gun so you you 've got another stick with a mop on the end basically a little sponge on the end so you stick that in the bucket and you shove that down there to cool the guns it cools it all down you 're washing out the last bits of gunpowder that 's it and then you 're ready to lower it again and you do all that all over again it fires again and that 's how the gun works all right so what we 're gonna do now is if you go get a broom or something i 've got this thing because that it looks like a sponge so i can use that as a sponge this end even though it 's plastic and it 's got this wiggly bit there so that 's like the wormy bit for us as well so i 'm going to fire in the big gun can you do that with me i said can you do that with me give me an eye captain i already captained that 's right give me an hour now stand and laugh like a pirate good you 're good all right there you 're ready are you ready my friends all right here we go so we 're gonna do the first thing is we 're getting the powder we got the powder okay we 've got the powder from the gun monkey all right put it in the thing now get the rammer push it down push push that 's it enough got the warden push it down push it down quick get the ball it 's rolling down there that 's it good another bit of wood are you ready quick pull the ropes again rice pack quick quick quick quick we gotta get another with me get the worm get the worm get the worm good job now the sponge dip it in the bucket dip in the bucket all right sponge sponge very good very good quick the bottom powder grab it down ram it down good job the one good job good job all right now cut them all down without a counter bubble pick it alright shut it down good job a lot more warming are you ready pull ropes we went so close one more time it 's rushed back there are you ready quick quick quick get the worm now sponge good job sponge sponge like a maniac go on sponge like a maniac we 're gonna get it clean are you ready quick the powder thank you power power ah warning down the walling what are you ready ah what are we gonna do the ball i forgot the ball quick get it all throw the ball down go quick a bit of a wedding pull it up we 're there quick come on come on captain we gotta hit it this time quick adjust are you ready we 're lighting ready i aim fire in the hope we sunk it give you something good job ah what a crew what a gun monkey what a crew holy ass give yourselves a big good job that is firing the big gun that is almost begun look at that look at that carriage see the wheels are bigger in the front and the little so it can roll back like that see that imagine that flying across the and see the instructions you make it yourself that tube is like from one of those paper towel thingies here easy easy peasy you make smaller ones with toilet bowls so apparently everybody 's got lots of those so that 's a good thing all right now i want to cover one more thing and then we 'll sing a new sea shanny all right hold off the press hot off the press all right all right so somebody commented to me about pirates with hooks they said oh are you a real pirate you haven 't_''_1080.96 got a hawk i said hawks are only for clumsy pirates all right clumsy virus i mean the famous one is that captain hook how did he lose his hand reaching into a crocodile 's mouth and then he was surprised he lost it what an idiot what an idiot no smart pirate as a hook supposed to have hooks people lose our hands especially the workers in there doing the things i thought they might lose their hand and they 'll replace it with a hook but most of the guys that the famous pirates no no no i 've got hooks none of them they don 't lose their hands they 're too damn clever all right so parts of the hooks you wouldn 't want to might teach in your class because look we 're up to class three right three i can totally teach after the last ten if i had oak we 'd only be doing six it wouldn 't work with it 10 is obviously the right number i don 't know what they 're doing hooks no hands yes go with me with hans air and give us a big standing love like a part good job all right now we 're having to go at our new shiny now this one 's a long one long one all right but a lot of shadies are like call and response all right so the main guy sings the verse and then you do the chorus or you do i do a line and you say the last bit of halloween and that kind of stuff this one it 's sort of like that but it 's then a different line all right and then it 's got the chorus which is repeated which is also three lines the same and then a different line so you 'll be able to follow it pretty easy so after you heard the first line you can sing the other lines and you go back and rewind this do it again even maybe i you know there 's lots of things you can do with it so let 's let 's have a go with it right so it goes what shall we do with a sleepy pirate and then we still using that three times what should we do with a sleepy pirate what should we do with a sleepy pirate and then we go early in the morning all right so what should we do with a sleepy pirate what should we do with a sleepy part what should we do with a sleepy pirate early in the morning and the chorus goes ooh wake him up ooh wait gotta wake him up what came up early in the morning so you 're ready and then i 'll you ready for that all right here we go what shall we do with a sleepy pirate what shall we do with a sleepy pirate what shall we sue with

    "text": "I 'm Nick Fury and this is the fourth of a series of six service skills video is brought to you by Canterbury bankstown City Council I 've never done this before I 'm doing a striptease for you today we 're doing hula hoops yes I 've got a confession to make I 'm actually rakhnann who lives it 's not my strong suit but I know a couple of things and I 'll do my best to demonstrate here we go I 'm actually doing it which is for me really good that 's probably what will happen to you in your first couple of attempts ah yes so that 's hula hooping um I like feather balancing unlike juggling there 's not particularly any kind of logical steps to doing the hula hooping it 's very much a kind of feel thing but let me get started it 's it 's easier to start off with a small ring sometimes kids come to workshops and they struggle with the big hoops but a smaller thing you can get going around your fingers that sort of just gives of it works that make sense to you so this is how I get started you you know hang the hoop coming on the hook and then take it up here and then just give it a push see how does that just like goes right and if I just give it a little nudge with my fingers you know suddenly it 's it 's just going it 's going and it 's going it 's going and it 's going it 's going and if you do with a small hoop that 's pretty easy ah okay if you are okay about doing that you can move on to a bigger hoop you 've probably only got one hoop at home anyway but if you can find something you know if you 're frustrated with doing with a big hoop then a smaller one is better and around the hand is a good way of just kind of figuring out how what the feeling of it is and the thing is that when you first start sorry Mike your arms around with great big movements like this but if they barely move at all like just move enough to keep the hoop just going around so just a little nudge you know and you saw me as I before when I was doing the hoop around my waist I was whacking my waist my hips around that 's because I 'm not actually no good at doing your loops but like I say you see people who are really good and then just do this really slice with with with their hips and so you can practice that principle around your hand like that and here 's a challenge for you if you are doing around your hand it 's easy to go fast probably break your arm in the process but it 's much harder to go slower so see how slow you can go if you watch the hoop as it goes around you 're deeply Tai 's yourself probably okay so there you go now the next variation on this with us being hoop is to be able to change and so I 've got one hand working pretty well and here 's the technique for 't just be able to do that but how do you do that how do you work up to it well it 's there we go so here 's the step-by-step way to work up to doing a hand swap with all loop here guys so take the your other hand and stick it on your upper arm like that and then slowly slide your hand down as the hoop continues spinning and just slide it down until you 've got two hands inside the hoop and then you just take the first hand out I thought you could slide it down a bit more quickly than that so so same thing again I 'm gonna keep the hip going and then slide the arm down and change hands like that so there you go have a crack at that that 's one loop trick alright once you 've done that that the next thing in the progression in terms of easiest the hardest is around your neck surprisingly and you can do it like this where you you bend over like this I hope you can see me I like up and down knees taking you up and down like this in the hoop just kind of goes around and again it 's it 's actually pretty easy to do it but just kind of slowly okay so here we go that it 's all sort of other things you can do with hoops with when you can throw it along a along a road or a piece of grass and you put a backspin on it and then it 'll roll back to you sometimes I get kids to jump through it you you 're always trying to once you can do a trick you 're always trying to sort stretch yourself and do a bit more so for example if I was doing the hoop around the hand trick can I do the hoop around the hand trick and if my hat up in the air at the same time and you know if I can do that can I get that the hoop spinning around for my hat lifting up in the air and hopping up and down as well so that starts the trick I that 's sort of an interesting performance thing if you want to impress somebody at the party there 's a hula hoop lying around all right so finally the round the here 's one yeah it 's the same you know as in with the hand the getting this getting started is half the battle really so what you want to do is maybe lean across to one side and with this hand give it a flick so that it gets a bit of speed up so watch this here we go holding like this and then I 'm gonna push it with this hand and hopefully get started here we go okay and so as you can see I 'm really working pretty hard to keep this hoop going but as I get better as I get some more relaxed I don 't need to do less and then it slides and so again as you did with the balancing well you know I got 20 turns that time maybe I 'm gonna try for 30 next time or 40 so again you know to keep stretching yourself stretching other tricks you can do are spinning them it 's really fun spinning them for longer periods it 's good fun too I 'll leave that to you good luck see you later you _"

workout will be a 30-second intervals we 'll be going through a total body workout minimal cardio not too much cardio mostly resistance we 'll have short rests in between each exercise and we 're going to go through three rounds together okay so we 'll do a little bit of a warm-up at the start three rounds of 30-second intervals with a short break in between please follow along if you need to have any rest throughout the workout please do so there is no need to continue on pushing yourself unnecessarily or out of your bounds or what you feel this within your limits and as always of course if you have any injuries or illnesses please make sure you are feeling okay before you start this workout and have any GP clearance prior to do any exercise just like you would if you were in the gym okay we want to get you hopefully that won 't be too far away a couple of props if you have some cans lying around they 're about a half a kilo each so feel free to improvise so about half kilo cans we 'll be using those some of our weights if you have weights feel free to use those as well you want to go a little bit heavier something like dishwashing liquid I 'll let you get creative okay everybody 's thinking out of the box at this point in time so run with it be creative get as heavier as light as you like you can also use no weights and just use your body weight okay you 'll still be working out you 'll still be getting that heart rate up make sure whatever you choose though preferably not made out of glass and is safe okay we don 't want any unnecessary injuries okay like I said before making sure you 're training within your limits there is always options for you two to downgrade if you need if you 're feeling like anything is he 's putting you out I mentioned but a chair may also be be handy if you for balance for some of us what 's in our lunches okay so I will try to do correct 30-second times I do apologize if I do some sort of trainer time there and it goes a little bit longer probably won 't because I 'm doing the workout as well she 's on the other foot so uh I think that 's everything let 's get done with some water okay so we 're just going to do

    "text": "a very surveyed numbers hit be talking first of all school in pirate school and hahahaha I need be lesson number two are y 'all ready for some old school all right I think we should stop with a big heart you can be louder than they 've already said you want to sweep these Timbers around the give me an hour that 's better we just want to scare the neighbors let 's wake them all up they 're all dozing in their jobs in what good from home let 's wake him all out with me give me an hour good job and son excellent now you can remember how we stand like a pirate hinari who remembers all right for you to part with some balanced okay remember we 're all fit on the sea now who remembers it for this target you remember right it 's the front of the ship the porch that 's the soil where we load in on the port side and over here this is where the right bow that 's the pointy end and the arm Stuart the artists at about gold alright cuz you know as you becoming a pirate what you no longer the sartorial elegance person like me you think are you one of them like well what kind of things do we got hats Oh CY engines there it is see how it 's three points for you sailors like these three pointed at because they got a point at the front right and you know at sea you 're in the wind it 's all about the wind you 're sailing into the wind don 't winds blow in there point because the windows each side of it rolls down the way yeah and the flat side blower enough all the time if you had another big probably right blow it off be watched baby born away all right we trying to go in the fishing line and it 's gonna be done with it right I want this pointing out so that 's it I 'd say hotel a true sailor he 's got the pointy bit at the front right cuz he 's out there at the front looking at the water come what about Footwear I know you cry what a valve would wear that 's right son well Footwear you probably think uh something like this these are in fact my captain 's boots right nice the leather beef start of things nice funky heel and you 're kicking people all right good stuff all right but don 't much use for your average sailor good for the captain first mate Boston maybe but other than that I 'm not even the boss and he 's gonna do him a favor it 'll work all these ropes he can 't do that in big chunky boots right also on a boat you 're always waiting the whole time your way right ways a crash at all for there it 's on the deck just watch them through a little booth so get really really slippery you 'd be slipping off the neck all the time I 'll actually get more glue crews and rollerball classes like this to train people I 'm gonna do swish them straight off the boat all the time oh you went the whole time you 're you were drawing you right it 's when you 're asleep down below right because you called up in your bunk and your body temperature 18 the heat that you generate it dries any clothes I 'll find them all in your drawing you go out so I express your when again rest of the time your wick that 's it that 's our wax all right so now what else have you got the patch that 's that 's one cover for today Yankee the back you see this many pirates you might have noticed we 're a batch it 's a dangerous sort of place for eyeballs out and see ya yes you know this when there 's a wood that can come and get you how baskets going around the sake I straight boats and compasses all sorts of things you get poked with or even no guys are just couples you were there coffee left this food and oh my goodness happens but one thing you might not realize is so important right now can actually see out of that eye here all right they can especially at night right if you go out tonight at annoyed you can test this okay or if you 're watching this at night now don 't do a darkroom right what happens if you can see there 's like a little bit of line there but if you come on both your eyes and then hold open for the Royal and then open them again it takes a while for your eyes to adjust to the darkness and light and see that half light again so you make way around it all looks like a your trip over right but if so what happens is if you get a flash of light in those lights you 're totally disoriented in the dark you think you 're ages to adjust but what happens because when were you firing your pistols or the guns we get a big flash of light okay because let 's Boise is asleep okay I 'll talk about pistols and cannons and another one but as I hit there 's a flash of Lloyd okay and you lose your vision because you got all this light on air for when it flashes and then you will swap it over and that allow it 'll be ready for the darkness and this one will get readjusted okay so you can adjust the backwards and forth all right that 's what some pirates do because a dark color all right not me of course no no I 'm blind in both eyes ha ha all right then what I 'm gonna teach you now is out of road with Johnny port what 's up Johnny don 't you say well it 's a rowing baldness oh not long ball you have long bolts at the soil ership but they 're for bigger ships spoil a ship jolly ball they call him that 's what the name is and this one the bitterest isn 't that huge it 's only about 100 tons rate so we have a jolly bolts on how so like that so they will have about eight to twelve rowers you know and they roll one on this how you I 'm gonna teach you add a row or bolt okay are you ready fat 's two rolls now both rolls after Rowan time can you tell me what would happen if you didn 't ruin toy him can you imagine think about for a moment if this side road faster than that saw what would happen you 'd go around in circles and what happens if you 're all rolled legally pigley poking each other with sticks about must be first crew that 's right so I 'm gonna teach you how to roll together oh yeah one big happy group all right so what I want you to do is put your arms out here and this is what we call the first position all right your arms are straight out and ready all right now all right that 's where the oil is out fully extended into the water okay you got that that 's one now when we pull your back towards us that 's pushing the oil through the waters the waters portion of back so that 's how we get to move okay so we go from one to two oh you 're there we 're at the full need to lift the ore out of the water so we push it down and the other end because it 's not a goes up and that other it ends out of the water and then we push it forward into position for two gets back into position then we drop it back in the water if I lived in our arms up here so go down that way and that 's back to one man so you got that so one is in the water that 's two we push it down three back forward for a back in the water one all right so we just walk our way through that slowly hurry or roll away you do it slowly if we 're walking through it we won 't put on water and we gave you and that can 't leave that it 's another class altogether all right are you ready 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 stop there right very good very good you all got that together all right you got the whole idea so as we go they me to say pick it up pick it up let me know faster and that 'll get us something quicker you know we 're like if you were gonna go to another ship and capture the bodies and all that and we creep up on them slowly and then we when that last burst of speed you will go pick it up pick it up go faster and faster so what we 'll do is we 'll go through that again alright stay a nice sunny even with me in those positions so remember that 's in the water we pull back we push it down to get the oar out we push it forward to get back a position back in the water that 's how it goes all right we 're gonna do that again and then when I say the speed all right now already I said are we already very good at the back there very good okay ready one two three four four four four four did you see that come on stand and laugh like a bird good job you 've rolled the jolly-boat bed rest do you remember what type of sugar was the-- remember we call it a Topsail schooners right well if you think about it schooner you know actually comes to a Scottish word schooner alright and Scoon when you used to get a rock and skim it across the top of the border do you know that that 's a school and that 's how the sails askew was over the water really quickly like that 's where the name comes to now you see the Regan I 'm a schooner goes reporter off remember for ear off there so then point it back that way the other way you see sales is like the top one here because that 's why it 's a tonsil schooner and that 's your square Riggins you see how they go spear across and they got these yards here in the sealers stick up there and a we can catch like that so those big ones like the barracks you see and all that with the big square rings right they 're better for way out at sea light because that all win the GATS and further and faster I can say on her right now but being a pirate I 'd like to hang around the shores and be quick and all that better stuff so that 's why a spoon is good right because there 's nothing a boat or he doesn 't need as many crew and you got 60 on here me 12 guns the fiery okay but oil is really a memorable and is just as fast into the wind as a way which isn 't the case with these the big colors alright they struggle so I can get them going in the win and creep up by them and then I can catch them really easy I 'll scoot along there and catch them in that 's how we catch them right that 's how I can get a big ship with my little fella in the B interests that 's why it makes a good for her and ship and this one being a Topsail schooners got the advantage of I can go out and see and use those whales to get a bit so it 's a perfect pirate ship the old Topsail schooners so it 's a good thing to be having throw the things you can have about the ship I 'll tell you two more things about the ship buried and that 's easy there you see that you just see it going up there like that I 'm who you make it out that photo they call the ratlines there those big rope ladder everything 's you see on the side you and I call the rat audience cuz people rat up them to go and do with the jobs that ever happen that 's why they call them the ratlines I thought the top there 's a crow 's nest I go heard of the crow 's nest before as a very piratey thing a cruelness I swear the lookout stance stands up there and all that kind of stuff right the web malarkey all right but you know why it 's called the crow 's nest because they used to actually have crows that 's right they stick Chrome 's with him because they didn 't have stars and compasses and by the time of the day and by where they were longitude and latitude and they read it 's not the Sun and all that sort of stuff re they used to do what all these calculations worked out and sometimes I just didn 't know if those lay there because nobody had been there before so they take a crow with him when they thought they might be near land they let the crow gold from the crow 's nest I don 't fly away all right just flowing away and if there was land in from are you straight there and they would just follow it because that 's where the expression comes as the crow flies which is the straightest place between two points because a fly crow would rise straight to that point and that 's where that expression comfortable and that 's why they had to be here if of course the croak didn 't finally I don 't come back to the ship but a park up there on the crumbles desk and the old guy up there I 'd and cabling constant even have a pic and all that kind of stuff it 's gonna slap and it slapped me back gonna be all that kind of malarkey we 'd all laugh but but that 's why it 's interesting stuff right now what else was there gonna cover I was gonna talk to you now about some equipment all right I 've got lots of a quick power I talked about like tell us goals and compasses all that kind of stuff but this time I 'm gonna talk to you about me Cutlass alright what 's a Cutlass Cutlass is a pirate sword right now now it 's different to a lot of soldiery you can see it 's short it 's got a curved braid got a basket there I did protect your hands from all that stuff but why do pirates like these swords there 's the lots of reasons all right one is it a Manny right because they 're strong they 're good for cutting ropes cooking all those ropes oh it 's a camera so you want to cut through or even go on land you want to bury your treasure and you gonna cut through underbrush you could use just a cut through because it 's big of strong all right it 's also because it 's curved that you can have it down below low no that 's good for close quarters if you guys swing from one boat to the other you don 't want one of those big heavy swords are gonna get your own you want to cut this because easy it come with like that so it 's very handy sort of saw the old colors that 's what he could even if you just want to tell somebody to be quiet and don 't want to really hurt him you slacker with this all you know right because it 's got a nice flat side you get hit across the top just the way come up you know all these reasons to the Cutlass was an important but important part of being a sailor okay cuz that many uses not just fighting lots of uses as a tool very anything that got this so that other mamby-pamby swords the other advantage and its really conveys to you because we 're in pirate school is because they 're easy to learn right not a lot of sorry NSYNC oh it 's trash like that so he comes at you with a little rapier so a digital slash and the breaks off your what all right that 's how it works cutlasses that 's the sword of appointment okay I think we 've almost finished for this week in the pirate school next week I 'm thinking about talking about the big guns our cannons I will show you how to load and fire the big gun it 'll be representative horn because I won 't have any big guns here in me little pirate bay down below but oh we going over the kind of things and we can talk we gonna have us a bit of a go out and I 'm gonna show me the kind of things you 'd have to do because remember one of the jobs you could have is a good monkey all right powder monkey is one of those start or young miss just start Murray so go over the being a powder monkey and we 'll go out of either be gone and all that 's all next week 's lesson must lots of other facts and facts and interesting bits of pieces possible things of chandi 's I 'm gonna do a new shiny I got a few new ones are that we can see but right now we might do barbar black ship to finish off with our you 're with me for Baba black ship give me an hour ah alright are you ready baa baa black sheep have you any buddy yes sir my word three bags okay one for that for the Dame and one for the cabin boy that drove me insane give me a bite good job now stand in love wait for it ha ha ha that 's it bodies we 're off for another week but I always say you know again next week when Captain Luke and Celia bring you burning school I already [Music] you _"

    "text": "hi everybody it 's Megan from Canterbury Bankstown leisure and aquatics today I 'm going to show you some boxing technique going through our stance where we place our arms nice strong core for most of those boxing even a little bit of padding and how we 've had when we 're in a boxing class so that for those of you who may be familiar unfamiliar sorry with a boxing class don 't feel intimidated to get in there get in and give it a go hopefully the skills that you might learn today just to understand well that you feel comfortable enough to get in there and all for those who just want to touch up on some of their skills so before we proceed any further please make sure if you are feeling unwell or if you have any injuries as always we want to look after our bodies before we can get back into an actual boxing class so please make sure you 're training with care don 't overdo it don 't feel like you 're pressuring yourself to your body to do anything it have a look at some of those knees so first of all we 've got our southpaw or Orthodox so southpaw is for the lefties which is me would be your left side dominant Orthodox would be for your right sides or NAT people doesn 't necessarily mean that a left-handed people are going to be south pause speaking for myself I 'm a lefty but I have a strong side dominant for boxing so I 'll just give you the via idea of your boxing stance so if for example we 're going to go Orthodox so right side dominant we 're going to have our left foot in France so it 's opposite if you 're a southpaw and your left side is your strong side you will have your left foot back but for this example we 'll go Orthodox so right side dominant right it 's my strong side I 've got my left foot in front both feet facing forward and I 'm nice and evenly balanced weight it 's not necessarily leaning on that front leg or on the back leg nice and evenly facing forward hips are square okay so ox always without our arms up through our boxing now jab is going to be we come okay so our job comes down in front our cross is our strong side when we go into that cross you want to make sure boxing is not just arms its whole body okay so we 've got our jab cross driving straight out into that punch jab cross jab cross so I 'm not just moving my arms I 'm working my whole body I 'm getting a lot of power from my glute when I keep driving through and my back foot pivoting on the ground okay so jab driving that are mounting cross cross jab cross okay drive that think about punching from the hip bringing that hip into the punch jab cross jab cross you 'll get a lot more power pivoting on that back foot and snapping the hip through okay nice strong core the whole time iraq we 've got our jab cross so I 'm boxing right now as an Orthodox my job is my left my weak arm start with your weak hand jab cross driving through that punch okay moving into well our hooks for example okay without hooks we want to make sure our arms at 90 degrees with a 90 degree angle you don 't want to swing out and open up too wide okay you 'll only hurt the shoulder over even the wrist okay also with our recently mentioned nice loose grip okay try not to squeeze too tight it 'll be hard to do also try and relax the shoulders all right relaxing those shoulders are always nice and loose without boxing and our padding all right so jab cross for example hook hook keeping our box below our shoulders we don 't want to be hooking up above the head okay we don 't want to get any injuries okay keeping a nice strong core again I 'm pivoting alright pop that front hip forward cross driving that hip through leaving on the back foot Sammy that uppercut okay we 've got a nice strong punch driving up the center 90 degrees try to swing out wide okay you don 't risks like this you want to come underneath the pad which will be coming down on top up this Center 90 degrees so these are our uppercuts okay sometimes you might also have fast unders difference between our unders there 's a nice fast little cardio punches and uppercuts uppercuts and hooks throughout cow punch alright so we 've got our unders and out other cuts okay big difference between those two punches alright so we 've got our jab cross jab cross okay one thread jab crosses we 've got our hooks keeping our arm 90 degrees try and keep your wrist or your arm wrist switched on okay so we want to have our wrist this way just switch on those forearm muscles to protect the rest in elbow all right put our hooks and put out uppercuts good uppercuts probably just underneath the chin the whole time we 're keeping a nice strong core and remember it 's not just arms all right also with our punches coming over my back foot right now not pure being I 'm losing half of my power goes before my up in the air sorry I 'm not getting that glute power okay so no I 'm not able to drive through the punch no matter how hard I try as soon as I add that pivot in the back foot I get a lot more power and the other thing I just want to give you a quick idea about boxing is one thing to learn he 's you 're new to a boxing class padding can seem even more daunting so just think your pistol boxing he feels still boxing okay so you 're nice and loose you 've got your boxing stance that mirror images your your back whoever 's boxing so if your boxer is the southpaw even if you 're ready you 'll have to switch over and match them okay so your feet if they 've got their left foot in front you 'll have your left foot in front so your mirror image so between you you 'll have a square up between your feet on the floor all right and padding nice and light nice and loose through the shoulders jab cross pad goes 20 all right you don 't want to stand still like this getting hit okay nice and loose shoulders strong core 20% all right they 're still meeting in 2000 the way look at 80% so everybody gonna die like this alright you want to go to 20% you 're nice and relaxed you 've got your boxing stance nice strong core you 're ready to take those punches standing still on flex dancer just taking those punches you could risk getting an injury and if you 've ever if you 've ever box to someone that 's holding still go move your nose it 's not that same feeling back so just think relax the shoulders nice strong core you 're moving with your boxer as a powder alright so you brought your boxing moves all right and you 've got your patty very similar hooks coming around on those pads again master encore keep your elbows tucked in you don 't want to hold them at me like this keep them nice and protected not strong cool and then you 've got your uppercuts coming down you could kind of get your arm thrown back if they 've got a nice strong punch all right by you maybe even 20% of the way you 're protecting your shoulder you 're protecting your body boxers enjoying it a lot more and yeah you 'll have a lot more fun so I hope you 've enjoyed it hope it 's quite a few things up for you and I 'll see you there in the next boxing class so we can you _"

    "text": "hi everybody this is Nick Fury and this is the second of six circus skills videos brought to you by Andrew Council in this video I am Bishop a and going to attempt to teach you to juggle three balls in about three minutes so let 's get down to it take a ball what you 're going to do is throw it from your right hand to your left hand like this so what 's happening there is that my hands making circles and the ball is tracing out a figure eight path now I 'm trying to get the ball to travel straight across my body and I 'm trying to make that as smooth as I possibly can it 's an underhanded scooping motion see this hand is makers makes a circle catches it actually catches it up here it goes around and gets through there and throws it so catching it up there goes around and throws it up and this one and catches it also up high goes around and throws it like so and then you continue if you can make your wrists really do this for quite some time and as you can see I 'm doing it easily and well but you 'll find that your non-dominant hand will throw erratically and your dominant hand will throw much more accurately so you have to get your non-dominant hand up to speed by just practicing the good news is that this is like very kind of meditative it 's like doing Tai Chi and after a while you sort of slip into this zone that 's very focused and very pleasing now as I say you could to set for a long time but we 've only got a short time so I 'm gonna move on to two balls he is the secret of juggling it 's this throw throw catch catch do they get throw throw catch catch again and again and again and watch how the balls are crossing over see how my the ball is going from my right hand to my left hand the yellow ball is going to go from my right hand to my left hand left hand to my right hand the balls go about them to land accurately in that position there so as if as if you 're carrying a tray and again if I flying straight across your body and you 'll find that when you have a go at it because I mean I 've been doing it for decades but when you first attempt it the balls will probably go all over the place but if you focus your mind on trying to get that hand to throw straight if you do in this systematic way you 'll be able to hone it down and sharpen your accuracy and you 'll be surprised at how quickly you 'll be able to do that so that 's it oh the other thing you say to yourself as you do it too to get it right is you say in your mind you go throw throw catch catch you it that 'll help throw throw catch catch you say that in your mind as you do it so again turn off the video get outside practice it practice so safe social distancing as you do it and then come back now I for the last half an hour and you 've come back so now I want to try and explain to you how three ball juggling works because half of the battle is actually understanding it lots of people come to me and they say I can juggle watch me and they get two balls like this and they do do this see how the balls are going around in a circle very different from this and the thing is that you get trapped in that pattern of doing things and it 's really hard to break out of it and juggling is not that at all it 's where the balls cross over from hand to hand so now watch this okay I went downstairs install my mum 's washing up gloves so that 's two just to illustrate so this is how jumping works you start with the ball in your dominant hand for most people that 's right hand but if you 're left-handed you start with two balls in your left hand if your right hand you just you start with two balls in your right hand one ball goes up and when it goes up gets up to the top like that as you do throw throw this one catches but before the second one comes down you throw the third one so the third one goes up and then the fourth one as the third one 's coming down and so it falls into this pattern where you 've got one ball up in the air and you 've got two balls sort of in your hands at different stages so that 's what you want to get going and that 's how it works that 's the mechanism of it so it 'll help you to just kind of do this for awhile and you figure it out because if you understand it in your mind it 'll it goes a long way towards helping you achieve it alright once you 've understood it there 's one last step that you 've got to take and it 's this it 's where you throw the balls up in the air just to release them because we are all we often get fixated on catching on trying to release them accurately so you 're going to do this you 're gonna go throw it throw it throw drop drop drop don 't even try to catch them throw throw throw drop drop drop with a smooth release throw throw throw drop like this throw throw okay just try this throw throw throw okay alrighty so I like like I say do that a lot practice a lot and once you start to you know kind of do that a few times you you 'll realize the potential to catch those balls and keep your juggle going so I 'm gonna just move these out of the way for a second boof and here we go so you 've gone throw throw catch catch throw throw catch catch and then you 've thrown the third one in try throwing catch catch and stop again throw throw catch catch and stop and then you sort of think okay I 've got time to throw that third one before the second one get comes down I throw and catch it and then you 're away and off you I showed you before see it is really kind of one ball in the air and two balls in my hand at any one time and I 'm still doing that motion that you learned whilst juggling one ball so the hands are going round in circles okay good luck practice is really fun that 's that really the secret if you enjoy your practice if you enjoy practicing then you know it feels good and it 's fun and you want to do it more and the more you do it then the better you get and so the better you get the more you want to practice and then it kind of starts to spiral around good luck I hope you enjoy it go for it you _"

    "text": "hi everybody in Canterbury Bankstown my name is Nick Fury and like you I 've been in lockdown there for long time longer than I can remember I 've figured out that sitting on the couch eating pizza all day is not really that much fun makes me feel kind of bloated not great so I 'm determined to use my time constructively and to that end I thought we could do circus skills you know circus skills are really good for you for lots of reasons they help you reduce stress they help you balance both sides of the brain at the same time the good for balance and coordination concentration mental perseverance if you can master circus skills like juggling particularly or still walking with unicycling those kind of things you can just about do anything because they teach you how to learn they 're learning about learning so for lots of reasons circus skills are really good for you and they 're fun and you can impress your friends so I 'm going to be doing a block of six seven three four minute videos each dealing do a bit of warm-up ball stuff today and in juggling hoop hula hooping hat tricks balancing sticks on your nose and and more over the course of this series of six okay what do you need well for this one you just need one thing and that is a ball voila if you 've got a tennis ball that works if you 've got a beanbag that 's pretty good you could even just roll up a pair of socks and that would be fine too if it 's got a bit of weight in it that 's that 's helpful okay here 's the first thing what are you going to do is simply throw the ball up in the air is gonna come down again you 're going to catch it sounds simple but you 'll be amazed at how much fun that simple thing is here we go see how I 'm enjoying myself I 'm the great thing about throwing a ball after the years like watching it go up and why should it come down it 's very satisfying to put your hands there lots of people don 't know I teach circus skills in shopping centers and festivals and there 's so many people that kept like this like flapping a duck know if you play cricket the first thing they 'll tell you is that you make your hands into the shape of a cup to catch see that and furthermore when a ball is coming to you before you actually catch it your hands are traveling away from the ball so that when the ball comes in it lands so smoothly and softly and doesn 't hurt your hands so if I throw the ball up in the air it 's like that like that so that 's something that looks pretty simple but actually takes lots of time to practice the master anyway here 's the first thing I want you to try and that is to just throw the ball up in the air and clap before it comes down here we go trick number one it 's pretty simple yeah that 's what it is ball up clap so it comes down if you get pretty good at it 's probably my limit I think alright next trick is throw the ball up and catch it in the head ready hat is on my head ball goes up there pet comes off catch him in the head wow great trick you 'll impress people at parties if you do that I gave up then if you can throw the ball up and catch it in the Hat try maybe throwing it I 'm dealing and then catching me in your head under Lake Oh like that Wow okay or even I live the other leg and catching it in the head yeah oh then you can just throw it under one leg and then under the other leg one leg okay so I mean simple tricks they 're just warm-ups these are just like really for having fun and getting excited about it burn dead tricks you can progress from there go around the back oh I got it caught up in my jacket try it again behind the back yes or flick it up you sure though see that see what I 'm doing I I flick here 's a good one try this where you hold the ball in your hand directly above your elbow and then I 'm gonna release the ball at the same time as I open my elbow out and it bounces off the elbow I catch it looks great which is bigger oh how good is that oh this one is a beauty I hope I get this right it 's this right up near spin around in circles if you think all of those tricks are a bit easy try this one are you here we go I did it great okay that 's about all I 've got for this little short video so I hope you 've enjoyed that don 't practice them they 're just kind of fun to do and you 'll make up your own tricks as well so have a go at doing that and you 'll see you again bye you _"

    "text": "hi everyone my name 's Maria you may remember me from the morning classes of pump and yoga I 'm really excited to be here and doing this today for you today 's demonstration is about a push-up your favorite exercise and mine and given that we have a push-up challenge coming up I know that for you this is going to be very beneficial so first of all thank you so very much I 'm making the time to be here with me to watch this demonstration this is going to be a little bit technical but I I do hope to break it down for you give you some options that will be a little bit you 've made feel comfortable and a little better you want may want to challenge yourself but with any exercise please remember but really you need to use some common sense listen to your body because this is really we don 't know you we don 't know your situation so if it doesn 't feel good the rule is you just don 't do it and honestly when you 're working 'm actually we 've got please space around you to work in safely liking if you 're working inside imagine something that you 're going to be comfortable in telling some order to stay hydrated we need to make sure that you look up to you and today my workout is going to be very much explaining what the push-up is all about I mean why do pushup who wants to do a push-up a push-up is an absolutely functional multifunctional exercise it works 70 percent of your body at least on a lot of the major and minor muscles it is a strength it is a coordination it is an ability it is a power exercise that you can do it for many many purposes as a warm up as a cool-down it 's part of your conditioning and it 's part of any type of workout and really it 's all about where you are with your pushup now I 'm going to go through a couple of options for you there are countless ways to do a push-up and in this demonstration today we don 't have what is turned a military push-up of a very standard push-up that you see a lot of and basically it means that we 're going to have our hands in a certain position in our feelings of position so come down with me to the floor so I 'm gonna turn onto the side so you can see what I 'm doing it so first of all we want to make sure that our knees so that your teeth with the puck this is my kick with the puck okay I 'm gonna make sure that our shoulders are sitting back well away from our ears because we want that scapular engaged because once your schedule is engaged that means that your body will know to send that message to the brain to engage your abdominals it 's quite kinda like two for the price of one so coming down to the floor our first option and this is kinda like a beginner level if you 're not sure where to go or maybe pregnant as well this is a good option is to have our hands much wider then way you will see that one elbow is one up in my shoulders and my hands are facing you and my fingers are spread out that is ideally where you would want your hand and our position to be when you are starting your push up okay so back to the side follow me back down to the floor my hands a lot of my shoulders my knees into the path of a nice long spine and I 'm looking at my imaginary clock in front of me that is 12 o 'clock it 's not lunchtime so stay with me so here is my imaginary pocket I 've got a long spine I put my cappuccino on my back it won 't spill I 'm gonna you don 't want my pop you still so my coffee is on my back my doubles are engaged and now what I 'm going to simply do is take my nose to the floor and straight back up so that 's from the side now let me show you from the front nothing strange with my position nice towards the wall and down to the floor my elbow is below my shoulder and I 'll tell you why that is like that you have any shoulder concerns any income twitches of twinges keep that elbow with a little bit higher or parallel if you want to go a little bit deeper and make that push up harder when you drop that elbow let me show you coming back to the floor so we have our hands wider than our shoulders so I want to go a little bit easy today because I 'm not feeling very well and there 's my option but I 'm thinking no I do feel pretty good I want to work a little bit harder then I take it in a little bit deeper and that 's the beauty going to push up you can make it as easy or as hard as you want to so that it 's kind like a base level push-up but I know that you do want to improve your fitness and your strength so I 'm going to show you how you can do that let 's get a little we take the Mexican white hands okay they 'll be lined up with my shoulder palms facing forward fingers spread out I 'm going to take my hands it straight down to the floor and then I 'm going to slide my feet straight back my feet stay on the full and I 'll explain why in a minute and I 'm going to drop straight down to the pool and then straight back up did you see that coming me on to the side Mexican wave hands nice strong straight back either looking ahead abdominals engage drop my hands to the pool eyes at 12 o 'clock slide money back my feet on the floor most of the pool straight back up step in but this up up if you need to so that 's a little bit more advanced now you notice that on both of those push up options my feet on the forum and I 'll tell you why as soon as we lift our feet off the floor to do a push up we actually hyper extend our back and what that means is that you we want our back in a neutral spine when our back dips in a push-up position down core muscles cannot be gauge safely which means you 're not really working your dominance so we want to make sure that like lemonade to eliminate that issue put our feet on the floor we 're done was engaged your back is safe you 're looking good option three I know you want to do this one how many football Mexican my pant here we go second one is one my hands in step up I decided to do I haven 't yet but let 's do one more so you can see from the right what it looks like Mexico my pants come down to the knees drop my hands to the floor slide my feet back onto the toes nose to the floor step it in but this will pop up in YouTube so I 've shown you three options today push-up form or pause push up on the knees and push up through the toes which one do you do when what that really depends on you how you is all about however what is important that in every type of work of it it 's possible include some form of strength training remember the push-up works your triceps your chest back extensor muscles abdominals as well as the deeper abdominal muscles that we don 't see from the outside but we know they 're there it can help to strengthen your pelvic floor remember to turn it on help us strengthen your your glutes strong glutes help to support your back and one more thing that 's really really important please breathe breathe through those movements when you breathe your body uses that oxygen to supply to your muscles so that you stay safe well I hope this demonstration today has been a benefit to you I 'm very grateful for this opportunity to present it to you I really am looking forward to teaching passes back at the center so from me Maria going out to have an amazing amazing day thank you _"

here I 'm around my neck it 's called the bosun 's whistle you see that volson 's whistle are that beer OE now the bowl said he 's the one that gets you to do a little job so I wanted to around a place and when you 're on a ship it 's no easy that 's a c e crashing and way he 's blowing over the place so things of random noises so sometimes you can 't get their attention so that 's why the bolson has a whistle to get the attention of everybody so when I blow this I 'll be getting your attention so you 'll go to your help for that radio okay great now this school ain 't like every other school okay because in other schools they say you be quiet school in pirate schools we like to be loud or I eat I would you be so loud it mom and dad out so I know what the hell 's going on alright they 're working at home let 's disturb her a bit of what happened something we all know easy sort of are in school but let 's start by talking about what noise is a pirate like to eat when we just sitting around we didn 't watch we make a noise well what should we do we go you know it yeah essentially we go ah can you do that with me please ah great you know the expression shiver me timbers alright it 's a noble priority expression used to say all what are you man and you know it essentially means the timbers themselves when a shipper run into another ship the Timbers would shiver I think this shape Timbers shiver and they creak to make a hell of a lot of noise not what I want you to do it old it 's be so loud that you make the shadow Timbers around you sure can you do that with me oh you ready give me an hour oh I think not all right give me another are ah now give me an AR are are very good very good right now we 're gonna talk about how you stand like a pirate all right very important so people know your part by the way you stand and hold yourself okay now pirates we stand with our legs apart right you can 't see my feet but I show you my feet are there otherwise I 'll be tumbling over all over the place okay it 's very hard on the boat but okay your feet are apart about shoulder width the reason that is is so you got a rock with it so you do that with me now rocking backwards and forwards that 's way rock and rockin that 's what a boat does okay it rocks your rock with it if your feet will close together what what happened everyone put their feet together that 's it you go over there you put your feet together you ready okay now Rock what Oh you fall over don 't you that 's why we have our feet apart alright you 're for your part so you 're wrong with a boat now you put your hands on your hips like that right cuz you 're proud and you are for you to nothing that I look up into the sky like that any laughs ah are you right can you do that with me area all of you even you up the back okay try to pretend you 're not interested are you ready good job let 's go on to your port from your starboard do you know what port and starboard on oh you don 't do you know what left and my left hand you 're probably going the other way over that side because you 're on the opposite side of me all right it 's a very confusing thing and that 's my right side okay but let 's see we don 't call them left and right cuz we say right but you are now all the time would be pretty confusing when I 'd be really using our you be confusing and very very confusing I 'm confused right now alright so what it is we paid port and starboard now starter that happened because that was a steer inside of the ship all right they had the big or at the back and he used to be on the starboard side so it was a steer inside was a Starman and because it was on that side but you always used to lied on the left-hand side the ship which was the port side the ship because it was a face in the port of the ship right and that 's you left your port there and if you look at the ships today when you are loaded up real ships I mean most of them today will still be loaded up on the left-hand side the port sorry though right now so that 's the left of the ship and the right of the ship alright so if I 'm saying to you everybody age at the port side we 'd all go over the left side okay so we go over to my house the left side okay if I 'm face go away you let me buy that so we 're all run over this side the left side and I say alright but if I wanted the front of the ship I 'd say everybody up to the bow that 's the pointy end you can see it my big ship here the pointy end of the ship that 's the bow and I back in as a good backwards word that it 's a word for the back what sounds like an act right sailors don 't trick you like that they call something that 's what it is right they don 't try to get it 's what it is that 's the ARF to the ship right so if you were learning on a ship right by the bolsa magic tree training you up where you really go we get you on the ship we call the bolson whistle all right yeah we get to the ship and we 'd have you run it around we do yell out everybody the port so everybody rushed over the port side everybody 's a star but I never shop on the starboard side bow of the ship anyone we 're on the front and I 'll have to anyone runs behind a back alright and now you 'd be run around all over the place and then be instructions and if you got it wrong do you know what would happen to know what would happen a little dog would come out and me pee on the backside that 's true I used to take a dog with him I know I know training them and then you went the wrong place the dogged no cuz a spot dog nip you on

    "text": "in the last four weeks since I address council the world our country our state and our city have changed the impact of coronavirus on our health and economy has been devastating as a husband father and a son I fully understand your concerns and the serious impacts on your day-to-day living concerns about your family your job your finances your health as the mayor of New South Wales largest council I want to assure you we are dealing with the crisis and following the advice from the Prime Minister and the chief health officer in fact I am proud to say our council has been quite proactive in implementing our own initiatives as well as following their recommendations some of the decisions we have taken have been quite difficult but they 've been taken to protect our community our staff and your loved ones my priority will always be to ensure essential services such as collecting your bins fixing our roads and maintaining parks continues as for those needy who rely on our Meals on Wheels delivery service I haven 't forgotten you and you will be looked after our facilities like our pools libraries and the learn to swim program for those who need to borrow or return books we are setting up a Click Collect program we 've also closed our fields to group and sports activities including weddings and prayer gatherings these harsh measures were taken for your safety and they will return to normal once this crisis is over in recent days we 've held critical planning meetings for what lies ahead and today I can announce an 18-point action plan which will be rolled out over the coming days and weeks councils plan aims to provide some relief and support to our community our businesses and our staff effective immediately Council will refund all credit fees to anyone who cancels their use of one of our facilities like our sporting fields our meeting rooms and halls because of social distancing restrictions similarly for those organisations that are paid upfront we have shut you down you will also be looked after community organizations that have received grants and who are unable to deliver their events will be given a 12-month extension to allow these events already has the compassionate hardship policy in place but I have asked the general manager to review our policy with a focus on providing temporary relief to those in need I 'll also be calling on the premier to make special provision in the next round of stimulus funding to assist those genuine hardship cases cover the interest on deferred rates I recognize it isn 't just our residents that need support during these difficult times but our small businesses the local milk bar the delicatessen or the cake shop our city has in excess of 4,000 small operators and one of the largest casual workforces throughout the state from today council will waive footway dining fees and defer mandatory fire and food inspection payments for 6 months I 've also asked the general manager to identify any other fees and charges that could be waived or deferred as I walk around the city desperate store owners are telling me they are losing sales and customers every day for that reason I have allocated an initial 250 thousand dollars to go towards a smart city smart business grant scheme which some business owners forced to close their doors have spoken to me about land tax I can give them an assurance I will reach out to the New South Wales premier to implement a tax stimulus package which includes a review of some areas of land tax as we 've seen recently with the drought and bushfires governments are there to help but it is community the grassroots that been together to get the job done we all have a role to play in supporting and caring for those in need especially our frail and elderly who are most at risk it could be helping them with their groceries and medicine I left to the shops helping a parent with their kids or a simple phone call to check if they 're okay I want council to lead the way so I am instigating a community cares initiative this will initially start with a call out to the community for volunteers and we 'll use all our usual communication channels council has also secured the use of a special number 3 corona which we will use as our hotline furthermore to keep you socially connected and engaged it could see council hosting live events on Facebook and provide some much-needed stimulus for our local artists and performers in doing so many of you conduct your council business online but for those who don 't have the technology I have asked the general manager to roll out extra resources within a designated space in our building this will allow meetings and appointments to happen electronically and I know some of you don 't have the internet or computers so I 've asked council to make arrangements for you to use ours simply call us and we will organise it these measures are in line with safety sensing requirements and for your health and well-being on that note we have thrown extra resources into keeping your city clean last week we deployed for extra teams to wipe down key community buildings and facilities in high use locations I know we can 't clean every asset we have but it is a visual reminder we must all do our part to keep safe as your mayor my priorities you the residents but I fellow councils their health and safety and well-being is also a priority and I know they are equally concerned today I announce that any staff member including casuals who are unable to work due to covered 19 and myself isolate will be paid up to two weeks and special leave for those casuals affected by the closure of our aquatics facilities we will pay you your forward rostered hours until the end of term 1 but I know there is more we can do to support you I have made contact with various community organizations including those that provide help to the elderly and disabled and who are in desperate need of casual support workers we will connect our casuals to these and other organizations in our city and offer them your skills and services counselors also commence training and redeployment of staff including casuals to ensure key services are maintained our truck drivers are learning how to operate waste trucks and we 've put in place measures to so key staff can work remotely or at home we want an agile and flexible workforce for whatever lies ahead internally stopped all non-essential travel training and face-to-face meetings any costs incurred because of cancellations that can 't_''_446.18 be recovered will be covered by council and reflected in a budget these are unprecedented times and we have only just started this journey how long it will take and what we what it will cost nobody knows to deliver the critically important care package alone will be at least five million dollars for this reason I 've asked the general manager to prepare a special coronavirus budget to capture these and any future costs he will also review council 's grants and sponsorship policy together with the rates hardship policy with the view to assist those in need financially and otherwise this quarterly budget review will be presented to our next council meeting over the coming days and weeks we will continue to review and implement measures in line with the guidelines from the prime minister and the chief health officer now more than ever we must work together we will get through this and we will be a better community and a better council finally I want to thank the staff most difficult times I really _"

for joining us tonight for the online version of the 2022 australia day awards the decision to change the format of the delivery of the event from in person to online was not taken lightly however due

to acknowledge our 2022 ambassador karen jones mrs jones is a highly regarded educational leader and local resident mrs jones began her career as a special education teacher in 1982 and has been strongly committed to public education since with a particular focus on aboriginal education mrs jones has held the position of principal at wyoming public school and terrigal public school before

lives of many local students karen has kindly recorded her ambassador speech so please enjoy it as always when we come together we pay respects and acknowledge the traditional custodians and today i pay heartfelt respects to their dark and young for their continuing care and nurturing of this country as well as community for tens of thousands of years as a proud annual woman a visitor to these traditional dark and young lands i pay respects to elders past and present and also recognize those who join us to build a socially just australian society for all like everyone here i stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before me and i pay tribute to them each and every day i 'm pleased to share with you my thoughts on this theme it is a day of great challenge for me crossroads of australian society a chance to seize the opportunity to move forward together building with a sense of knowledge understanding and greater insight into the incredibly diverse communities that thrived prior to 1788 with more than 300 traditional languages spoken across this land australia has always been a country of diversity and i encourage you to continue learning about the history of this country your local area a history of more than 65 000 years the longest continuous culture in the world australia day is the official national day of australia observed annually on the 26th of january it marks the 1788 landing of the first fleet at sydney cove and the raising of the union flag by arthur phillip following days of exploration of port jackson in new south wales it is for this reason the moment of british colonisation or as some people refer to it that it is a challenge for me and certainly commits me to continue to reflect today is also the chance to rethink our identity as a nation and work towards a future fueled by the vibrancy of cultures across australia today strength of first nations people we need to be more open about our history for us to reconcile in australia we need to keep telling our stories with truth and honesty of what has happened we have to be honest with ourselves about the good and the bad for this is a fundamental test of our social goals and our national will our ability to say to ourselves and the rest of the world that australia is a first-rate social democracy that we are what we should be truly the land of the fair go and the better chance there is no more basics test of how seriously we mean these things it is a test of our self-knowledge of how well we know the country on which we live how well we know our history how well we recognize the fact that as complex as our history is that we need to learn from that history to create a better future the message should be that there is nothing to fear or lose in the recognition of historical truth or the extension of social justice or the deepening of everything to gain just as australians living in the relatively narrow and insular australia of the 1960s imagined a culturally diverse worldly and open australia and in a generation turn many of those ideas into reality so we can turn the goals of reconciliation into result reality if these things offer hope so does the fact that this generation of australians is better informed about the history of the nation more so than any generation before people are beginning to more generally appreciate the depth and diversity of aboriginal and torres strait islander cultures people are beginning to learn what first nations peoples have known for many thousands of years how to live without physical environment ever so gradually people are learning how to see australia through aboriginal eyes beginning to recognize the wisdom contained in their epic stories and how much we have lost by living so far apart australia day means different things to different people and everyone is encouraged to acknowledge australia day in a day that 's meaningful for them i acknowledge the significant contribution that everyone makes to our nation from our first nations people to our newest citizens who now call australia home australia day 2022 is a time to recognize the resilience of all australians and to focus on what we can achieve when we move forward as a community and a unified nation regardless of our origins or our past it 's a day for australians from all backgrounds and communities to come together share stories embrace our diversity celebrate our unity and challenge ourselves on how we can create a better future this australia day the community is encouraged to reflect respect and celebrate our

time that dick person as the initial administrator was appointed i was appointed the initial acting ceo that time i 'm doing this video because i want to try and inform the community of what 's happened over the last 12 months it is 12 months almost to the day since stick person and i arrived to the central coast council i 'm not going to look backwards at what caused everything the commissioner for the public inquiry is going to no doubt do a very good job of looking at what actually happened and reporting on that what i want to take you through in this video is exactly what 's happened once the financial crisis hit us and dick person and i were appointed and how we 've moved things forward it 's a tale that you might find quite exciting in one sense but hopefully you can see through it the stress through this is not about trying to gain sympathy for the organisation but i want the council the community to understand exactly what we have been through the organisation did respond well and with the help of the unions we have been able to achieve what we set out to achieve but it has been a journey that has been caused in a long way by the initial decisions that the state government made so the journey begins on the 27th of july last year this is when the council adopted the operational plan for the year 20 to 21. that budget showed a deficit of 13 million dollars a figure that i want you to keep in mind for later on we only go forward two months to the 6th of october when the council actually announced that it was facing an immediate and serious liquidity issue they put in place by the 13th of october 100-day action plan now that 100-day action plan being blunt did not cut it it tinkered around the edges but it did not in any way look at taking away the costs that forward and another week later when the council was unable to make the payroll it announced to the media and the world that it was unable to pay its staff there was an extraordinary meeting held and which was to determine if restricted funds could be used to actually fund the payroll and the councils were unable to come to a majority solution in that council meeting the next day the government announced that it would provide the council with 6.2 million which was in fact a financial assistant grant that was being advanced and either being paid early to meet the payroll expenses and put some contributions towards overdue payments to suppliers and creditors and so on and the minister also issued the council with a show cause letter which gave them six days to respond to a notice of suspension a week later the council considered a report on the 100-day action plan which was an update to show where they were proposing to make savings which was largely around restricting overtime not replacement of staff and so on but there were no serious attempts to actually reduce actually commenced as the chief financial officer this turned out to be a great move because natalia had had experience being a member of one of the large accounting firms in her past and having also worked for banks she was able to actually immediately grasp the situation and was able to help me upon my appointment four days later on the 2nd of november dick person and myself actually arrived at the council and i had a conversation with the office of local government at which time a decision was made that we had to seek commercial bank loans to support the recovery in other words there would be no bailout from the state government this decision by government sitting pace the course of actions we then had to follow in a normal restructuring for an organization that 's gone into receivership they generally speaking here a couple of options one the shareholders tip more money in or they go to the banks for loans and the third option is they could be bought out or another investor comes in in the case of the council where there is state government had decided they weren 't going to tip money into it so we only had one course of option left to us which was to go to the banks at that same time we had to send out an email to our suppliers and creditors to bison that we couldn 't meet the current payment terms and that would be we would be delaying payment for up to four weeks this was because we did not have sufficient working capital at the time to be able to pay wages and creditors the council was suspended and we moved into the first thing we had to do was in fact meet with the unions so dick person and i met with the unions and we talked about the need to restructure and reduce staff numbers from that point onwards there were regular meetings with the unions over the next six weeks after christmas to progress the restructure so pretty much every month every week sorry and the month we were dealing with uh unions and talking to staff consistently to keep them in the frame this the finance staff our emails out which talked about we will need to delay the terms but the big thing that hit us unexpectedly was on the 5th of november i 'll call it bankex of which we had a loan of about 107 million with we got a notice of default because in their wisdom the government by removing the council triggered one of the conditions in the loan document which is a change of management because of that and because of the adverse publicity this bank legally was requesting that loan be repaid at the same time we were having to consider the need to talk to another other banks because the cfo and i realized that we needed some short-term finance immediately so we approached bank y so another bank to finance councils working capital the cash reserves and look at some of our maturing debt and capital expenditure and we managed to negotiate a loan from them with a draw down date of the 17th of november so on the 17th of november we actually got a further 50 million which enabled us to now pay the creditors and is that this would last us until christmas and that we would need a further 100 million in order to restructure the organization and get us through to a situation where we could actually recover the business met with the unions on the 12th of november where we actually started the consultation and we talked about the restructure so the executive the directors were asked to reduce their cost structures by approximately 15 the corporate area took out over 50 percent of the of the numbers that we needed to to actually achieve we also realize from developing the long-term financial plan that we would need to go and talk to ipart now approaching ipad on the 17th november we explained the council 's position that we were in a liquidity crisis we did require some extra income and that we would need a temp a srv for 10 years so we applied for a 10-year term for the special rate variation in order to make our plan for the banking industry work we put in place by the 22nd of november the cfo myself put a package together for 70 million we needed an srv increase we were looking at an asset sales program of approximately 60 million and with that we would require a further million in order to fund all that development and to repay a number of the externally restricted reserves on the 19th we actually were successfully able to conclude the negotiations that have been ongoing with bank x which was the bank i reminded which was wanting to take away the 107 million so we we nailed that one down and that meant we no longer had to uh worry about that particular loan we didn 't have to worry about the 50 million line so we had two loans locked away uh providing we were able to deliver the goods our problem now was really around the 100 million dollars we needed for the final loan before that we put in place um i had a video where i talked to the staff and i actually described some of the errors back at the former at when the councils were merged i described the the fact that it was an error by staff for the restricted versus the unrestricted cash that was available to the entity but it was pointed out to me by one of the staff that this was actually a change in the accounting policy for 2016. and that that had been sort of dictated to us by the auditors external auditors at the time and therefore it was under audits advice not an error that started the discussion that we had with the auditor general over whether or not the restricted funds were legitimate versus the unrestricted cash that was being shown and that was an argument that was ultimately resolved by the new south wales audit in their favor despite the council having a legal opinion from a tier one law firm saying unequivocally that we were right second december we also had the quarterly report for september come through and we 'd extended the 13 million loss that was projected in the original budget we extended that out to 115 million loss that was our forecasted loss for the end of the year but that did include 45 volt million for restructuring costs which is where that loss was showing a projected at about 70 million dollars excluding the 45. so we were comparing 70 million with what only two or three months earlier they were actually talking about a 13 million loss we then moved on to more meetings with the unions and we actually were successful they worked with us and at the end of the day we were able to achieve things the first area that we were removing stuff was from the management layers so we took out over 40 percent of our second tier and our third tiers of management we then had to look at the bank line so on the 7th of december the large bank that was the only banker we could deal with left out of the four majors they sent through their projected long-term financial plan for us which included the loans so they had a view about our cost structure and our revenue side which they wanted us to agree to so we actually put together the proposal and on the 7th of december we were looking reasonably positive about how things would go forward and that the loan application had progressed to the highest level of authorization and had to be sent to the risk department now that 's an unusual thing to happen councils borrow from banks all the time and that 's just generally done through as you would go to your normal bank that 's generally done through your bank manager or through your through the loan department it doesn 't actually go through what 's called the risk department because they assess all the risks of the organization and they access they assess the capability of their entity to be able to recover the money should the entity the organization go into get itself into difficulty so we actually had a meeting on the 15th of december where the cfo and myself met via a teams meeting with about six members of the eight member risk committee for this particular bank there was a two-hour odd meeting and we went through our full long-term financial plan what we had agreed with the unions the downsizing structures what we 'd already achieved what we 're in the process of doing and the been asked to do in order to get a loan so on the 15th of december natalia cowley the cfo myself met with the bank including their risk department that risk department consists of eight people of which there were six members on the team 's discussion it was a very robust discussion and it was entirely focused on what we were doing and they were assessing our capability to actually deliver what we said we were going to do fortunately we had already got some miles under the belt so to speak we had already got a large number of changes made and we could quite clearly point to the fact we had our sales underway and other things progressing we received on the 17th of december draft legal advice from clayton utz about the liquidity crisis and the use of restricted funds this effectively finalized the earlier work that they had looked at which was determined that there was no fraud or corruption present in the organisation 's financial collapse later on the same day banks said advised us that the loan could not be progressed because of of support from the state government by 3 45 the following day and this was because the risk department was closing for christmas on that friday we go to the friday which was the 18th and remember that the bank closed from our point of view of the risk area at 4 pm that same day in the morning i was unable to get hold of the head of olg or the minister for local government we left messages but there was no response i ended up phoning the minister for planning and public spaces the honourable rob stokes who i happen to have his private mobile number who actually answered it and explained the seriousness of the situation to him that unless i could get this letter signed by minister of the crown then i would be needing to close the business down inform creditors and staff that we would not be able to pay wages and creditors come the 1st of january to his credit we did receive that letter of support signed and at 2 38 on the 18th we were actually able to send that to resolved at 3 o 'clock to accept the loan to finance the working capital the cash reserves and some of the capital expenditure and we actually got the drawdown of the money now i do want to point out that one of the conditions of this loan again was very different to what happens in any other situation so i think i said it was secured against cash flow and most other councils in this case the bank was not interested in securing it against the cash flow they actually asked for hard assets so to give you some examples of the assets that we gave to the bank as security one example was the boat ramp and car park that 's summerland point another example was the peninsula leisure centre water park and another example would be the butcherway boardwalk jetty amongst a whole range of other assets that the bank took security over so friday before christmas we finally had got ourselves locked in and i do think that the government really underestimated when they made the decision that we needed to go and seek commercial loans the actually achieve that it was daunting it was very very hard on the staff and there are a lot of people who were quite badly hurt and families hurt by what they had to go through particularly the reputation and the staff out on the street being accosted and abused by rate payers i can understand why but a lot of this i don 't believe was necessary if the agencies of government had actually worked in a more coordinated fashion so that was the situation leading into christmas following the christmas break back in back in the office on the 12th of january we commenced the internal consultation as per the local government industrial award with all our over the major staff reductions that had to take place so this involved extensive discussions being held with unions and staff trying to get and being successful and getting a successful outcome but that 's those were ongoing for the next three months or so the administrator also issued their three monthly report and the administrator at the time mr dick person also resolved to hold a constitutional referendum for the government elections on the 8th of february council resolved to apply to ipar for a 15 one-off permanent special rate increase that was to satisfy the revenue side for the banks in terms of the loan on the 21st of february a senior executive a second-tier executive of this particular bank arrived at our front door here at the central coast with two staff for a meeting with natalia cowley and myself at this point in time we were a little unconcerned what they were here for because almost unheard of is such a senior executive fronting up to a to a customer what he wanted to meet with us over was to one assure himself that uh we were well down on progress going forward with what we agreed to do which we were able to show him but he also turned to us and said and i won 't get his words exactly right but he said i want to congratulate in front of yourself and the cfo the two staff people i 've got with me he said without your client manager the risk team was against manager who 's in front of you argued with the risk team that they could not the bank could not let this organization fail it had to support them so he took this extraordinary step of coming to us to actually say that the client manager got this over the line so if you could think about the stress that the organization was suffering when it was having these close calls from time to time but i think it was an amazing thing that that bank did by coming to see us and actually telling us that story we also that time received on the 24th of february the final clayton ut 's legal and financial forensic review report which concluded quite strongly that there was absolutely no broader corruption and also that we were correct with some of our concerns with the policy changes that have been made by the auditors in the past we actually then had the meeting with the central coast council and the auditor general over this prior period era this issue that occurred at merger which effectively said that at the time one view without doubt that the 100 the 90 odd million dollars that was sitting in unrestricted cash was legitimate under the local government act it was not legitimate and our legal advice clearly demonstrated unequivocally having seen the crown 's advice that we were correct but nonetheless the auditor general chose to qualify the accounts later on at their wish the sale of assets proceeding the tranche 2 came through on the 8th of march and the administrator at the time approved those for sale as i said the clayton utes had given us the legal advice on the validity of the voluntary policy and we were able to refute the author general we had draft device at that stage the new cfo david farmer fortunately started then and david farmer brought an awful lot of experience with councils that had been in difficulty had been administered at an administration and it was i was delighted to see that he was able to be appointed and to replace me as the acting ceo and as i said he brought a wealth of experience and he has a sound hand and a issues not quite as bad as this but certainly issues that required government intervention and the final report was sent by the administrator to the government and to the community and then on the 26th of april the new south wales government announced a public inquiry at the central coast council 's financial situation and they set the terms of reference about that time bank y which was the bank that gave us 50 million dollars earlier started to be concerned and they started requesting financials to confirm our financial stability and these requests were repeated monthly from them so effectively at this point in time we had three banks we were having to satisfy we were also having to report to deepai in the office of local government and we were also trying to make the cases to ipad for water and sewer and to continue the current rate structure which was about to commence as soon as i got in so the load on the finance team at that stage was immense and bear in mind that it was reduced by close to 30 percent in terms of 15 special rate variation for three years only they apparently did not accept the fact that we were under conditions from the bank to show a 10-year financial plan with that rate increase in it so only gave us three years which technically put us in breach of that loan agreement which is why after i was appointed sometime in april that i actually resolved that we are going to go back and ask for that to be continued on with the supporting evidence of course we then requested meetings with various members of the state government and we the first meeting has been was postponed with greg piper which directory talk about the ipads sorry talk about the order general situation because it seems unreasonable when you have a dispute between a tier one legal law firm and the author general 's advice from the crown which was not without doubt so it was a maybe there is no third party the only option we had to avoid that was to go into litigation and it just did not make sense to waste both rate payers and or taxpayers restructured and consolidated all the costs into the 2021 year which meant we were starting off the new year if you like with a clean slate and that budget was the compliant one with banks said i also just want to point out at that time a journalist recently expressed dismay that the council made staff redundant and then they intended to recruit if i part agreed to increase the fees and charges in the water and sewer area i 'd have to say the journalists clearly did not understand that the council just has to adjust its cost structure to its revenue streams which is exactly what the council and the previous ceo did not do in 2018-19 when i part reduced the income by 39. so of course if the council does get more revenue as we have requested then it will employ more staff to deliver the extra service this is just a simple case of the council matching its expenditure to the revenue but the alarmist approach really doesn 't help in terms of telling exactly the story of what happened so yeah we completed the and the uh cfo catali cowley have kept a strong handle on things and our quarter result that we have applied a quarter result which was june came out at the end of september which is more the september monthly report showed us that we were traveling ahead of budget so we were doing better than budget we have agreed that we are going to do financial reporting on a monthly basis we have also commissioned an independent review of the water and sewer operations to tell us how the to give us an indication how we might manage water and sewer into the future i 've also wanted a meeting with minister dominello over i parts proposed changes to the water sewer and drainage charges and i have to say to the amenities for an administrator to ask to meet with a minister when they represent 350 000 people it was surprising that uh minister dominello 's office declined and in fact their response was from the department not even from the minister himself so at this point of time what i want to say is that uh we well probably the most major restructure that any council has ever had to do in australian history it has been successfully completed under commercial conditions meeting commercial bank requirements i think one of the comments that i will point out to the commissioner for the public inquiry it would have been much more helpful if the various government agencies had talked to each other throughout this process because they were asking and demanding from us different things at different times which were conflicting with somebody else 's request but notwithstanding that the staff have done an outstanding job at this time to get us through to this position and i 'm very confident with the new ceo and so on there that uh they will actually keep us going right out into the future so we do have to keep maintaining this discipline and we have asked ipart for extra revenue for water and sewer and we have asked ipart to keep the current rate structure both of those are required to ensure compliance that the commercial agreements we have with the banks to fund us through for the next want to remind you of is one we have applied to our partner for a continuation of the current rate structure the second thing is we have applied to ipad for an increase in the water and sewer fees and charges both of those are required to make sure that our long-term financial plan which is a key ingredient for the banks the integrity is maintained with that locked in we then can look forward to a very very secure future going forward we have some high caliber staff including the ceo and the cfo and i believe that with them in charge you will not see any formal repeat of what we 've been through up till now so finally could you please put your submission in give your views on what you think should happen what you think we should do we do value that input and we will take notice of it but it is as i said a clear choice for the community and if we do not receive the funding then we will need to think about some alternative options thank you you _"

    "text": "[Music] the townships of edelong and your minor are located at the entrance to brisbane water on the southern end of the central coast prior to rail and road travel edelong was the gateway to gosford with all trade to and from the area transiting brisbane water on boat and barge exiting the central coast by a sometimes treacherous channel across the box edge holes the traditional custardians of the estuary were the dark and young people it 's reasonable to conclude that their relationship with the processes that shape the estuary was relatively harmonious for several thousand years brisbane water was first explored by europeans in 1789 shortly after establishing the penal settlement at port jackson on the 10th of june 1789 in his diary captain john hunter described somewhat prophetically the perils of the entrance to brisbane water noting that at low tide with a suddenly swell it was impossible to navigate unbeknownst to captain hunter this heralded the first salvo in a conflict between humans and coastal processes which continues to this day this presentation provides an overview of the long history of coastal protection works along of brisbane water and provides an introduction to the amino ocean beach erosion management project which seeks to develop a holistic and integrated strategy to guide future actions in this area yamana and ocean beach are situated on the southern edge of the huawei same plane the huawei sand plane is a relatively young geological feature having formed through a process of progradation over the past four to six thousand years as sea levels rose to their approximate level this southern edge of the sand plain is characterized by sandy beaches and a series of near-shore shoals which are constantly moving under the forces of tidal currents waves and wind it is the dynamic nature of this system which frames our constant battle with nature as demonstrated by this graphic we can see the movement of sand onto the shoal through waves the movement of sand towards the beach by waves and tidal currents the movement of sand into the estuary via flood tides longshore transport of sand probably both ways on your minor in ocean beach and possibly only one way on edelong beach disrupted longshore transport the movement ebb tides the cross shaw movement of sandby waves possibly only one way at edelong the loss to deep water near booker bay via flood tides and the alien loss of sand [Music] prior to the completion of the huawei rail tunnel in 1888 access to gosford from sydney was almost exclusively by water this meant that nearly all trade had to cross the bar at the entrance to brisbane water in those days nature had the upper hand because vessels were underpowered and hard to maneuver in tight areas and it is therefore not surprising that there were many grounding on half-tied rocks and the beaches seafarers apparently understood the difficulties and risks for the most part and would time their entry or exit with the correct type notwithstanding there were frequent calls to dredge the entrance and blow up half-tied rocks calls for dredging persist to this day and there are still people that would like authorities to entertain the idea of blowing up half-tied rocks or implementing significant engineering solutions such as training walls the opening of the huawei rail tunnels will shout out an intensification of destination for sydney siders and as such this was one of the areas where expansion occurred first everyone wanted to be near the water and thus a proverbial line in the sand was drawn between fixed urban infrastructure and the austrian beaches unfortunately this line was too far forward and did not account for the dynamic nature of coastal environments sand dunes are like shock absorbers they expand and contract in response to short-term processes like tides and daily weather conditions and longer-term climate pattern coastal erosion is a natural process eroded beaches are not broken nor are they indicative of the failure of management notwithstanding it 's important to understand the cycles of erosion in a given environment to empower effective planning and management coastal erosion only becomes an issue in instances where humans build static infrastructure within the dynamic part of a beach or estuary foreshore since the line in the sand was drawn coastal erosion has featured in the lives of generations of residents at yamana and hedlong this has resulted in a series of reactive measures to fix problems when they arise usually in response to construction of a temporary geo-container seawall along a 100 metre stretch of ocean beach near edelong point in 2015. unfortunately ad hoc protection works are often implemented under intense political and community scrutiny without enough planning and design work and as a result often have undesirable impacts which can lead to further ad-hoc works this highlights the importance of taking a holistic approach to management of this area built on a detailed understanding of the coastal processes at play [Music] the first attempt to stabilize the foreshore of edelong beach in the vicinity of picnic parade was undertaken in the 1940s when minor works were constructed to address localized erosion of beach this was complemented by some beach nourishment during the early 1950s severe erosion of edelong beach began near picnic parade resulted in the installation of approximately 400 metres of rock protection along that foreshore additionally the esplanade collapsed in the vicinity of baron joey road and this was repaired and then protected with rocks it is possible that the erosion event was in part driven by an east coast low which impacted the area on the 5th of was implemented involving the placement of approximately 20 thousand cubic metres of sand on ed long beach between picnic parade and snapper road in an apparent attempt to maximise the retention of this sand four low-level rock grooms were also constructed along this section of beach also in 1967 a section of the esplanade between kurung street and bangla street was reinstated and protected with rock armoring likely having been damaged during severe storms experienced in the winter and spring of 1967 [Music] the early 70s was characterized by stormy conditions with several large events on the record including a continental low between 22 to 25 july 1971 affecting the entire coast of southeast queensland and new south wales producing an east-southeast swell with significant wave heights of 5.4 metres tropical cyclone daisy from 10 to 13 february 1972 which affected the coast from yeppoon to sent from new south wales the infamous storms of 1974 which to this day provide the design storm benchmark for coastal engineering work not surprisingly there was a significant amount of ad-hoc coaster protection works within the area during the 1970s commencing with the street in 1972 along with the construction of additional rock armoring and two large groins at at long point to combat subsequent downdrift erosion three additional groins were constructed between kurang street and lagoon street in 1973 and chasing the downdrift additional rock armoring was placed between lagoon street and bengal street from 1974 to 1977. a significant amount of works have been undertaken in the 40-year period from 1980 much of the work over the last decade has focused on replacing aging infrastructure in the early 1980s foreshore reclamation between bangalore street and beech street was completed and the foreshore was armored with rock this completed foreshore armoring between edelong point and beech street which began in the 1960s this was coupled with a large beach nourishment campaign involving the movement of approximately fifty two thousand cubic metres of sand from the shoals onto edlong beach approximately two-thirds of this sand was used to create a series of sand groins in an attempt to divert the floodplaid channel and prolong the longevity of the nourishment during the 1980s the importance of dune vegetation was formally recognised and a program this day in 1999 a further fifteen thousand cubic metres of sand was placed on edelong beach coming from the excavations of the basement to the mantra development in 2012 the rock armouring along the foreshore between bangalow street and beach street was renewed and a further 30 000 cubic metres of sand was placed on edelong beach from the headlong shoals ongoing sand nourishment is required to protect the landscape reserve wall to protect european and aboriginal heritage items further to this the community has an expectation that there will be a usable beach during those title conditions in 2014 the foreshore along lance webb reserve was armed with rock replacing works implemented in the late 1960s [Music] in 2015 following a significant coastal storm a temporary jail container sea wall was constructed to protect the esplanade at barron joey road additionally a program of beach scraping was implemented between ocean beach surf life saving club and edelong point which was ongoing for many months until the beach started to recover [Music] history has taught us that if we as a community wish to maintain our line in the there will be impacts because the ultimate underlying intention of coastal protection works is to change natural processes to mitigate risk to property and infrastructure or perceived negative changes to sandy foreshores an eroded beach is not broken it 's simply in a phase which humans find less desirable central coast council has a desire to develop and implement a holistic management strategy for this location informed by a better understanding of coastal processes making it more proactive and less confrontational with nature there will still be impacts however by developing a better understanding and appreciation for the natural forces shaping the area and council will be better able to see and articulate unavoidable impacts the intention is to work closely with community to enable integrated management of multiple issues ranging from maintenance of the navigation channel to beach nourishment to protection of assets and infrastructure the amino ocean beach erosion management strategy will provide the framework enabling this proactive approach to be realised the program has involved intensive investigations of the morpho dynamics of the box edge holes and associated beaches the feasibility of beach nourishment to improve beach the esplanade and adjacent infrastructure triggers for implementing actions are tied to various parameters including the depth and width of the entrance channel tidal prisms and beach volumes implementing the strategy will require ongoing monitoring of the sedimentary system so that works can be planned and carried out before major issues manifest this will also facilitate improved communication between council the community and other key stakeholders broken is a unique and beautiful environment and it 's a paramount importance that the preservation of the natural environment is front and center in our shared strategies to manage this area you _"

    "text": "talk about all things birds how to identify them and how to record them on the amazing aussie backyard bird count app which is free to download uh webinar will also be recorded so if you aren 't able to stay for the whole recording or if you have any friends that you think might like to watch it later we can always share the link later on and before we go any further i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet and pay our respects to the elders past and present it 's a very special week on the calendar national bird week um it 's a great week to raise awareness of birds in australia and some of the threatened species and what we can all do to look after them and some of the conservation efforts that are happening to look after our birds around australia and also it 's really a great way for people to get together and share their knowledge birds share their sightings and yeah just spend 20 minutes a day getting out into your backyard sit quietly and enjoy listening to birds and recording them and noticing other things that you might see which is also great for mental health and well-being as well so along the way during the web webinar if you have any questions or comments feel free to use the chat option in uh zoom and also the q a option and be really great so we 'd like to make this as interactive as possible so if you have any comments or questions for our special guests also be great if you could just put a comment of where you 're tuning in from and if there 's out if there are any birds that you can hear or see in your backyard at the moment that would be really interesting for us to see as we move along as well uh so we 've got some special guests joining us today one of them is tuning in from newcastle i believe who 's mick roderick who is a woodland birds for biodiversity project coordinator with bird life australia and bird life australia is also running the aussie backyard bird lives in a great part of the world and lots of woodland birds to enjoy and experience in the hunter valley and uh he has done a lot of research and field work with regent honey eaters and swift parrots over the years so we 'll cut to him in a few minutes i also have jed field who 's on the uh the board of the uh central coast wetlands pioneer dairy trust here and he 'll be here to tell us all about the special site here and what we can see and how it 's managed and how people can come along and visit and get involved and we also have alan benson from the central coast group of birdie new south wales who 's a local bird watching expert and has spent a lot of time traveling around australia and the world bird watching twitching so um before we go on too much further i 'd like to um talk about the app so this week it 's really easy for people all around australia to upload sightings and recordings of birds that they see in or reserve and you can either do that through the aussie backyard bird count app which as i said is free to download and you can also if you don 't have a phone or an ability to um access or download apps you can also go to the website um the backyard bird count website which we have the link for at the end of the webinar we can put up on the screen so uh yeah i 'd like to introduce mick roderick can you hear me mick i can nick how are you going oh beautiful yeah i 'm really good thanks um so just to start off a little bit about yourself if that 's okay um firstly do you have a favorite bird i would have to say region honey it otherwise i 'll get in a bit of trouble but uh my other favorite bird would have to be the gould 's petrol oh wow yeah an endangered sea bird that um there 's two subspecies and one of those subspecies until recently only bred on the islands off port stephens just in just work in recent times putting some nest boxes on broughton island and yeah we had some great success so yeah good petrol and regen honey half and half fantastic and uh you also are lucky enough to uh make burning uh your career in your profession now so and not just quickly how did you get into birding or bird watching and the outdoors and nature in general it 's a good question a lot of people assume that i sort of grew up in a bird watching family but that wasn 't really their case my family was certainly you know we did bush walk somewhere in camping and things like that it wasn 't until university when i studied ecology within an environmental management degree that i really clicked with nature and particularly birdwatching a few of the mates at uni instead of going surfing we went burger watching and you know we had rivalry between the different field guides and it was heaps of fun and you know from there i 've just managed to somehow make um birding sort of massaged birding into my career so 've mentioned today uh is right in the middle of national bird week and we 've got a big focus on the aussie backyard bird count so uh be great if you could tell us a little bit about it and just quickly explain how easy it is for everyone to uh get involved and um take part in it yeah sure no no worries well i 'll start sharing my screen and talking you through it yeah that 'd be fantastic all right so yeah so even though i am mostly involved with threatened woodland birds i 'm really excited to to help promote the bird camp because it 's a really fantastic wave for for people who aren 't normally bird watchers to become bird watchers for a week people like myself and and nick and alan you know we 're out there um submitting bird lists uh most of the year maybe all of the year but this week is really all about trying to get other people involved and you know if if the interest does spark then you 're certainly more than welcome to to can submit lists in in other ways outside of the backyard bird count but so the backyard burke as we know is happening this week um we 're up to you know thursday so we 're we 're sort of past the half way mark um just a brief bit of background about bird life australia so we 're one of australia 's largest not-for-profit conservation organizations uh about 120 years old and we 've got an enormous membership and and supporter base of around 180 000 people so we 're we 're very active in seeking the support of the community in the work that we do we have 33 branches and special interest groups spread around the country and the central coast is certainly a great supporter of of bird life 's work so really with the aims of the backyard burkha is to do like a like i mentioned before to engage the broader community um to participate in in bird watching uh we all think bird watching is great uh but it isn 't just about bird watching it 's really about experiencing the birds and a list either it 's also about what the birds are doing it 's a great way of observing nature um if we try to do this with frogs or bats or something it 'll be really difficult but birds herds are diurnal birds are awake during the day and they occur in every habitat so in other words birds are always around us so it 's a really great way of contributing to citizen sciences by getting involved with things such as the bird count and over time as all these records come in it does become valuable data that bird life australia can use to to actually see what 's going on in our backyards with with with our birds and so yep it 's it sits within bird work suburb week happens in about the third or fourth week of october each year that 's deliberate so october in australia is a really important month for birds because it 's it 's a time when our resident birds are breeding but it 's also a time when the spring migrants have returned from being up north to really exciting time for for birds and bird watchers so as nick has mentioned uh to get involved it 's as simple as downloading a free app or you can also enter records on a on our website and one of the beauties of the the backyard bird app is that it has a built-in uh like almost a field guide function so if you 're not sure about what you 're what you 're looking at you can plug in a few clues to arrive at an identification so there 's just a couple of screen grabs there of what the the app looks like so you basically download the app you get started uh you can see there 's a button there for for the field guide um and then it 's really just a matter of choosing a place to enter your 20-minute survey it doesn 't necessarily have to be your backyard you can go to a local park you can go to your local patch of bush um but it 's yeah so it 's it 's 20 minutes that 's deliberate so the fact same period of time means that we can actually compare information across the country and you just fill in a few fields there one of those is actually asks you about your booting experience as well to whether you 're a novice or whether you 're an advanced birder as you 're going to type in the names of birds as soon as you start tapping on the letters um names will start coming up so you never will actually have to uh write out the entire name of a bird so once you if you wanted to select australian magpie you can see there you need to i mean really probably mig is probably enough and then macbook will come up and you just click on that goes into the list and this is a screenshot of the field guide section so if you 're not sure you just sort of um plug in some variables about the size of the bird the shape of the birds and colors and then at the end there 'll be some you know a bird will pop up and hopefully that 's 's also some information there about about that species to help you um confirm or otherwise if that 's the bird that you 've seen or heard then you move through to the submit screen um submit the list and you 're away so it 's it 's that simple uh there is actually a youtube uh how-to video online uh for for people who aren 't sure how to how to do all this um i 'm not an app person at all but uh yeah i can i can function this one and the bird data apps they 're actually very very easy so if i can do it anyone can do it really just some some really brief um background to what 's happened in recent years so so last year we had nearly 3.4 million birds counted across australia in the backyard bird count and nearly 90 000 people apart so as as always we 're trying to beat um last year 's record i think we 've got 2.7 million in 2018 um so yeah so each year we 're trying to do the last the 2.6 million mark for birds submitted so far um it probably comes as no surprise that rainbow lori keats noisy miners and and magpies round out the top three um and that in new south wales we also have things like sulphur crested cockatoos uh but i should say that 2020 let 's face it there 's absolutely nothing normal about 2020 uh but with the with the the impacts of the fires which have happened since the last bird count and also the impacts of the rains that we 've got in late summer and we could actually see some very different results this year so it 's really important that we get as many lists as possible submitted and i 've just i 've just went to the live stats and quickly grabbed a couple of postcodes there so there 's gosford and wyong postcodes so between between then we 've got about 540 odd lists submitted already and about um yeah eight and a half thousand um sightings so that 's fantastic uh and there 's still plenty of time to get in and submit some promote the boo account and yeah looking forward to some questions and yeah back to you nick yeah yeah and as i mentioned again i 've had quite a few comments from people over the last few days that 's um how much people have enjoyed just sitting outside and taking 20 minutes out of their day to sit down and quietly uh take in the birds that they can hear and see and actually notice things that are around and if you do it um each day of the week and you might get addicted to it and keep doing it all year round be careful yeah also you 'll uh you 'll notice changes as well if you do it at different times a day or different days of the week depending on the weather or other things um special birds just happened to be flying over um i had a white bellied seagull flying over my house so that 's a good one for my backyard at least um from yesterday all right uh thank you mick we 'll uh introduce our next guest now his name heavily involved here at central coast wetlands for a long time uh in a voluntary capacity and um yeah we 're lucky to have him today to uh thanks tell us a lot more about the site here so i guess before i talk about the sites um because we 're all talking about birds today and um you can probably tell that i love birds and like talking about birds so um firstly jed are you a birder or a bird watcher i love watching birds and i love when you 're still somewhere and the birds come to you and this site is a great site for bird watching because it 's the public accessible areas make it so easy to see so many species and a range of different species because the variety of habitat we have out here yeah fantastic and do you have a favorite bird at all yourself uh it probably varies depending on the season i had a glimpse of the blue face honey eater a couple of weeks ago that 's special for me i love seeing that blue flash yeah yeah that 's right yeah it 's always exciting to see them that 's right so can you tell us a little bit more about central coast wetlands it 's history obviously uh uh 100 years or so ago was uh started as a dairy yeah that 's right tell us a bit more about that it 's got a really intensive agriculture history um this reserve so it was previously a dairy farm and it came into government ownership around the year 2000 and at that time the reserve was considered for um recreation and coastal environmental protection and those two things are really important here and they go hand in hand and and the there 's currently a board that 's looking after the day-to-day management of the land um this site is um extremely a range of niche habitats so we 've got behind us the dairy swamp which is a large freshwater wetland one of the only examples of this kind of habitat in the central coast in terms of um cattle we have grazing the edges and that 's actually really important because it maintains that that don 't like timbered woodlands they like the open wetland vista because i can see their predators and also we have we support a lot of threatened species including raptors and just recently i 'm as in months ago i had a powerful hour in one of our riparian corridors and that goes to show what we 're doing out here is working and we 're doing a lot out here and that 's reliant a lot on volunteers um yeah with tree planting projects and and management prescriptions to make sure this place is is here for the wildlife yeah fantastic so also know that um many many thousands of trees have been planted here over the 20 years yeah um and some of those have been planted specifically for particular birds absolutely um so um thousands hundreds of thousands in fact 200 000 trees approximately have been planted out here over the last 15 years only the last 15 years this place was was basically paddocks with a couple of remnant trees around and now we 've got living and breathing forests and we 've got species _''_1024.88 before in european history so that 's really exciting yeah and fantastic that you know we 're in tug rights um my viewers might occasionally hear trains going past here and we 're really close to tigre westfields for example and maybe some viewers don 't know that the site is here but it 's very special and lucky to have it right here and also um is the wetland here open to the public to come along and visit it is it 's open seven days a week um so we 're located um between wang river and the tuggerah railway station so access is from south tacoma road um yeah we 've we 're under a gazebo here this is an awesome elevated space to look over the dairy swamp and look at the water birds we um we 've got a number of walking trails around here and picnic facilities so it 's a great place to come out here bring your app and log your sightings um because that that information too really informs helps inform the management of this site and how we 're restoring fantastic and uh definitely have been a lot of really rare and amazing birds turn up here over the years that have got a lot of uh people from central coast and even sydney coming in people see the flock here they really do from newcastle to sydney um because we do have some rare visitors like the black neck stalked and that 's when it 's here it 's the tallest bird on the wetland it 's it 's over a metre tall it stands out um and that species comes from northern areas of australia so to have that down here um it is special yeah and it shows that with the habitat here is really important yeah it 's amazing to come and watch them here and i 've seen one out here um catching eels and gulping them down holes yeah yeah that 's right and the white-bellied seagulls love um this open wetland too because they they 're hunting for the eels and and there 's plenty in here as we 've been here today we 've heard some splashing around yeah probably hills lots uh with the trees have been planted so you said around about 200 000 trees and that 's all been done by volunteers yeah that 's right um so everything is being done by volunteers i 'm a volunteer here and we 're still going we 're so our habitat restoration is focused on creek lines and buffering those creek lines getting the stock out of the creek lines and planting trees along those corridors which is increasing habitat connectivity but also providing a range of habitat that support um not just wetland birds but but species that like forested wetlands yeah and a lot of that water is obviously flowing through suburban areas certainly industrial areas of tuggerance yes this site benefits the whole catchment it 's filtering water and providing water quality yeah exactly so it 's improving the water quality in tugra lakes and wang river as well as locally right here on site that 's right all right thanks jed that was fantastic what we 'd like to do now is uh screen a video so a couple of years ago central coast council put together recorded here in the past uh critically endangered species um that mick roderick mentioned earlier as well and um one of the main reasons that some of the species of trees were planted here such as the swamp mahogany was because they 're a winter flowering tree that benefits the region honey if they visit the central coast in winter so we can uh pass over to that video now with um ash and our technical crew in the background there and we 'll listen to look there 's one oh look at their amazing colors [Music] the beautiful regent honeyeater was once a common sight in the forest and woodlands of south east australia however they are now listed as critically endangered the regent honey has declined because of habitat loss on the table and slopes of new south wales because of the loss of habitat everything 's cramming for the same small amount of resources the forest surrounding tiger lakes provide important habitat and a winter food source for region honey eaters and swift parrots this is one of the reasons the lakes has been designated a key wetlands tugra have been working hard to create new habitat for these special birds they set up a nursery we collect the seed on site we collected seeds from 49 different plants grew them on site then planted those seedlings in and over 110 000 trees and shrubs have been planted on this side planting trees also stabilizes the soil and reduces storm water runoff this new forest at tugra is helping to improve the water quality in tigra lakes the wild plant community nursery specialises in the supply of local provenance plants from the central coast with the aim of putting those plants back in the local bush land taronga zoo has been breeding region honeyeaters to boost the population in the wild the captive breed and relief program here at taronga has been going since 2008 and we 've released 295 birds into the wild so after we release them they 're monitored by a group of volunteers if the regent honeyed a population is to recover we need more habitat and we need to learn more about where the birds go we can all do our bit wild plant community nursery join a land care group take part in the regent honeyeater surveys for more information download central coast council 's multi-touch books from itunes all right so a great video there to give us a bit more of an overview of the wetlands and especially those drone shots there really give you an idea of the size of the land here and just how many trees have been planted you can see all the trees especially on the creek lines there which um yeah as jed said are really fantastic for habitat not only for i guess the target species i 've planted for but then all kinds of animals that um move in afterwards as well from insects to birds and mammals all right so we 'll move on now to our next guest alan benson from the central coast group of birdie new south wales who 's a very knowledgeable experienced and well well-traveled birder i think he 's traveled probably to every corner of australia pretty much to see as many different birds as he can and over his lifetime he 's seen nick 860 big 8006 okay i wouldn 't want to sell you a shot there uh and i 'm sure you 've got lots of amazing stories and uh adventures that have uh you 've experienced along the way with you know with your family and friends and do you have any particular favorite experiences or birds well um as you said i 've been to a lot of places in australia and it 's been an experience to go to some of those remote places and uh just as an example i saw my 600th bird on christmas island sorry on iron ranger in cape york my 700th in no circle runway around now 700th and christmas on my 800th was in western australia so i 've been to ashmore reef i 've been a kangaroo and i 've been to lord how long i 've been in norfolk i 've been to torres strait i 've been to lots and lots of interesting places so it 's amazing where building takes you yeah fantastic and uh on the central coast we 've got um a lot of different if you put in a little bit bit of effort you you could see you know over 250 species that 's right and um lots of different habitats have any particular favorite burning spots on the central coast yeah um my favorite sporting spot on the on the central coast is is the rta reserve which is uh which is a land care area uh just the other side of the expressway off arimber creek road it 's a mixture of rainforest and more open forests and some wonderful birds turn up there from time to time and the landcare group do a fantastic job as well and you 've asked everyone else what their favorite bird is so i 'm going to say it 's the male region bowerbird so even though that 's not an uncommon bird and i 'd say it six seven times a year it takes my breath away every time i see it it 's just a spectacular bird of of black and yellow and black on gold it 's um it 's just a wonderful bird and that 's one of the places the rta reserve for example but no this is another favorite spot of mine it 's a great spot to come over the years there 's been some rarities turn up here as you mentioned before some of the rarer waiters like wood sandpipers and pectoral sandpipers etc but we get some good birds here and it 's it 's an easy place to burden there 's a variety of habitats here as well yeah so um while we 've been speaking here today on the webinar um you 've been looking around at what birds are around here and doing a aussie backyard bird count so um also while we talk if we have the chance uh ash in the background here um can put up some photos of some of the birds we 'll talk about quickly so is there anything interesting that you 've seen out here in the last 20 minutes um we 've seen a white-bellied seagull which was nice um uh i 've topped my pigeon flew into the end of the fig trees behind us the big birds are calling in there we stack of pelicans out there there 's a black swan with two signets um the striped honey calling there 's a coal calling which we 'll we 'll talk about later i gather yeah you want to put the shot of the cargo up sure um ash has a shot of a eastern coal or a common cold as people sometimes call them um yeah so they 're a very very noisy springtime visitor uh people they drive people crazy because they seem to pull day and night they 've become relatively more common on the coast because they 're a cuckoo which means they 're a parasite and they lay their eggs in other birds nests and the common bird that they parasite are waddle birds and little bottle birds and they 've become more common on the coast as as people have you know put grevilias and and other flowering trees into their gardens and they 're quite aggressive honey eaters and and so they 've become more common and therefore the coals have become more common as well okay the other visitor we get is the channel it 's got this huge bill and it makes this really raucous call as well and interestingly enough it 's become more common on the central coast as well because it 's most common bird that is parasites as pipe carawangs now in times going back we never used to get pied carawangs on the coast in winter but in summer sorry so as the privets become more prolific and the and the uh carolings feed on the privet then we 're getting more uh channel milk cookers on the coast as well um we 've got plenty of cormorants here we 've got shots of corn yes we 've got a little black corner and the great corner that we have often seen on the fence over there but they 're not sitting there right now but i 've seen both today said that that 's an interesting bird and um jeb mentioned the black neck stalk which is a really um spectacular bird and there seems to be a a pair hanging around the coast at the moment which is good maybe don 't they used to breed back in the twenties uh their ranges has um gone further north they breed up in hexam and tommy and places like that in the hunter hopefully they might they might breed down here as well so that that would be nice it 's interesting with global warming that we 're actually seeing more species on the coast than we used to see and the example of that is the osprey and they were a rare bird 20 years ago now we 've got about seven or eight pairs breeding on the coast um often on council property you 'll be pleased to know such as at mariner stadium at the year in a uh works depot where and they built a special platform council builders special platform for them at um at mariners and also a special platform at the works depot they 're also at south king king campus series treatment works in the sum up further north as well yeah actually when i look at the uh nest on riley 's island in prison water yesterday there was two osprey sydney on top of that so so 's very hard to see a long way away and it was seven o 'clock at night but uh they were sitting there that night from that sunset so hopefully they 've become more common we 're also getting birds like brahminy kites which we didn 't which which are still relatively rare on the coast but they 've been soldered regularly this year we never used to get them at all uh noisy pitter was a bird we only used to get it in in autumn they 're a very spectacular bird if you can see those they 're a rain forest bird now they 're breeding on the central coast so you know it 's as things warm up we 're seeing a different range of birds and maybe that 's the story of the black neck stalks as well that they 'll um you know they 'll come down here and breed which would be would be fantastic yeah definitely and you have a picture of a pelican there ash we 've got lots of pelicans there there 's about 10 or 15 roosting over there um they have the pelican feeding at um at the entrance and that keeps them around because they get fit every day uh i said there 's a black swan here as well and what 's interesting with uh the black swans is that the tugra lake system is counted as what 's called a kbi key biodiversity area and the reason for that is two percent of the world 's population of black swans can be on tugboat lake at any given time there can be up to six or eight thousand on the tug relax system when conditions are right and the other reason is there 's two percent of the world 's population of chestnut teal on tuggerah lake system as well so that 's a really important um area for natural area and as you 're well aware the little turns are going to nest again this year we hope and they 're they 're a vulnerable bird and council also puts a lot of effort into protecting those birds um building a fence to so that they don 't get disturbed by their nesting and monitoring and we 're there they 've just started arriving the last couple weeks so looking forward to some breeding happening there yeah i saw 50 in breeding plumage yesterday and there 's some courtship behaviour going on so despite the disturbance of the dredging and everything else that 's happened with the channel being opened and opened and closed and opened again hopefully they will breathe there yeah definitely and so for people watching um that like to get a little bit more involved they 'll find out more about birds on the central coast or where to find them or you know how to identify bird if they see it in their backyard if they get a photo or a video recording can you tell us a bit more about the central coast um central coast bird is a very active group we have a monthly meeting at the progress hall at tuggerah where we have a guest speaker etc etc uh we do have uh two outings a month a half day half day in a full day outing four camp outs a year where we go to this weekend for example um if you 're just a little bit curious about what goes on we do have a facebook page which has got about 550 members and the photographers post their photos on it and the sightings get posted on it and it 's a good way to keep in touch if you do want to become part of the facebook site please follow the directions and answer all the questions otherwise you won 't be on it um if you 're interested in birds the simple way is to buy a bird guide there but there 's a number of good bird guides around there about 50 and it 's it 's when you 're new to birding and you don 't know what you 're looking it 's a lot of fun going through a bird guide to saying and then when you actually find it 's a nice feeling of satisfaction that you 've identified it rather than somebody else said it is said what it is um pair of binoculars is a good idea and you can spend from 150 to 3 000 you pay for but if you are beginning to bidding to birdie you 're only spending three thousand dollars on a pair of binoculars but they they are really useful to pick up the field marks and the what of the birds that um that you see fantastic and uh so it 's also great for potentially beginners to go along to some of the outings that you have not only so you can learn how to get to and where to go at particular sites but also you know get to talk to people and help uh identify them and ask questions as well yep and that 's right um you know when you learn the good sites to go by yourself the two you get a bit of a guide of how of how to identify the birds now learn some of the bird calls which is a really important aspect of birding modern birding these days is about bird photography um diesel cameras have become relatively cheap going back in the days of slide films you you 'll be selective of how many pictures you take these photo so it adds a whole new dimension to bird watching or birding and a lot of our uh now good bird watchers have come to bird watching through or being birding through photography and uh and and the photographers do the same thing the twitches do they 're trying to get a photo of every bird or they 're trying to get the optimal photo of a of a particular species yeah fantastic there 's so much so many different avenues of birding as well and i 've also got the the new south wales twitch-a-thon coming up next weekend as well so that 's another way for people to get involved for the uh not only the keen twitches but also people who just like to get out and have a relaxing couple of hours but burning those different sections of the race there 's the full-on twitch-a-thon the 30-hour one which is taken very seriously but as you said there 's also the more relaxed it 's basically a fundraising activity um and and this year the funds are going to um uh do some more studies region which is the rock warbler or the rock warbler which occurs in an area on the sandstone area and and we do get them on the central coast they 're not common but they 're but you can find them uh and they 're a very cute little bird uh in a very restricted habitat so a bird that could be under pressure if if it gets overdeveloped but that 's that 's why that 's why the funds are going to that yeah awesome all right do we have any questions that have come through recently ash or annie nothing new no okay well if anyone does have any uh feel free to send them through shortly we 're about to wrap it up but um before we finish i just like to remind everyone uh to get out there and do some birding 20 minutes is not long to take you can do it in your lunch break you can do it before work or after work or now with daylight savings it 's great you can even you can even do away having dinner on the do your bird counting during national bird work you can obviously do it any time of year through other apps the ebird app or the bird dart app which are free to download as well and they 're also great to look up you can look up where certain birds have been found which helps you to go and find new interesting places as well so also like to thank the photographers i had some local photographers sent through some beautiful photos that ash has shared while alan 's been speaking so i 'd like to thank daniel mcewen christina port uh jared sadly jeff white nicola marcovina and warren chad for sending through and letting us use those photos and uh hope everyone enjoyed watching our webinar today and hopefully learnt something new and uh yeah hope to see you out and about birding on the central coast shortly thanks for watching thanks for listening thanks everyone _"

    "text": "hey i 'm ashley from central coast council and today i 'd love to share with you our progress as we embark on the development of a new coastal management program for the tugra lakes estuary i would firstly like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land and the waters that form the tugger lakes catchment because this waterway has been such a valued place for the dark and young people who 've lived here for over 40 000 years and it continues to be a special place for everyone in our community today the unfortunate reality is that human development around the lakes has had a negative impact on the health of this ecosystem and overcoming these issues is going to be a long-term project that requires collaboration from everyone including all of the different government agencies and the community the land that flows into tugra lakes is owned and managed by heaps of different stakeholders including the government and different organizations and private land holders and this does add complexity to managing the lakes but central coast council are really stepping up to take a leading role opportunity at the moment to revise our long-term strategy for managing the lakes and it 's very important to us that this is a joint process involving the community and to all of our partners in a way that allows us to be open to learning together and using those learnings to co-create clear realistic visions and action plans to guide us forward here 's a really quick map that i put together just to give context to all of the different lakes and rivers and creeks and the land as well that together forms the tugger lakes estuary system and we refer to this as the catchment because all of the water that falls onto the land anywhere in this region is caught and will eventually make its way into the lakes either through runoff down into groundwater or even through our stormwater drain system i think it 's really important to note here that um the tuggera lakes area is located in the centre of new south wales fastest growing corridor between sydney and newcastle and the regional plan forecasts that the central coast population is going to 2036. tuggerah lakes catchment has been identified by the state government as one of the best places to accommodate future growth and this development pressure does have the potential to reduce the natural ability of the catchment to absorb and treat excess runoff in the way that nature intended and this could potentially result in some unacceptable impacts to the health of our lakes if not managed properly and that makes it really important for us to work really hard now with all of levels of government and the community to ensure that our forward planning is really solid so we 're developing a new coastal management program that will replace the current existing estuary management plan which has been established since 2006. developing this new plan is a mandatory requirement of the 2016 coastal management act but it 's also just something that we really want to do and i want to note here that while we 're developing the new program we 're also still working really hard at the same time to deliver the actions in the existing plan so so far 86 of the actions identified ongoing and this has been funded by over 30 million dollars in australian government grants the key achievements that we 've been able to get from this is includes 50 kilometers of stream rehabilitation 374 hectares of wetland conservation and 29 hectares of salt marsh rehabilitation and all of this has resulted in the health of the estuaries really improving with 56 of our sites showing an improvement and 13 remaining stable and that 's over the last nine year period the process of developing these new coastal management programs is a really great opportunity for us to work with you the community to establish a clear shared vision for what we all want the future to look like and the result will be a nice action plan that sets us on a path towards collectively achieving that vision the development of that plan is going to take into consideration the ecological health and the coastal threats as well as the community values and it 's really important to us that we find a balance between the environmental outcomes and the social and economic outcomes for our region an important quality and ecological health standards based on realistic expectations you can see here that the process is a five stage process and so right now we 've just finished stage one and we 're about to move into stage two you might be wondering as far as funding goes what the plan is and the good news is that there 's a lot of really great opportunities available that cover both the preparation and the implementation of the new management plan including so the new south wales government has a coastal and serious grants program and that 's typically allocated on a two-to-one basis so council would only need to provide one-third of that funding it 's actually really good news this week um it 's just been announced that our funding submission for that grant program was successful so central coast council have just been awarded 644 thousand dollars to complete stages two and three of developing the coastal management plan and this funding is really greatly appreciated because it 's going to be a major benefit to support us in the really important work that we 're doing we 're also really excited to announce that we 've just published the first stage of the process which is the scoping study and so this identifies the purpose and it maps out a series of forward planning tasks to allow us to fill key knowledge gaps that we need to gather the information that we need in order to establish a really effective and implementable coastal management plan we did a risk assessment a first pass risk assessment to identify and prioritize the key issues and threats to tuggerah lakes and to assess different management arrangements this information was then used to create the ford plan which recommends the different studies and assessments and reports that are about to be undertaken in the upcoming stages of developing the new plan the highest priority studies will help us to look at water quality of the incoming water and set some water quality targets for future development it will also allow us to refine what we know about the coastal processes in the entrance channel and how these relate to the rest of the lakes as well as to document the that that can be properly considered including in light of any potential future risks associated with sea level rise where we plan to pull all of this information together to look at the community use and values as well as the threats to the estuary and our opportunities to make a really positive impact and all of this will guide us when we review the management options and decide together on the best way to move forward a host of studies of tuggerah lakes have repeatedly concluded that the bulk of inflow into tugger lakes is from water catchment runoff so the oceanic influence through the entrance channel is actually quite limited and we know that we really need to focus on sustainable catchment management in order to improve the health of the lake we also know that the entrance channel is of particular interest to the community so a revised entrance management strategy is proposed in stage three another issue of environmental concern is the loss of sea grass and the abundance of seagrass and macroalgal wrath is also concerning to the community so a review of rack management is also proposed for stage three interestingly the influence of groundwater particularly as a pathway for nutrient contamination is something that 's recently being explored through a university-funded grant and the preliminary results really justify further exploration of this including the viability of any potential treatment options you may be aware that last year the state government created an independent expert panel in response to the community concern over water quality and that expert panel were asked to examine all of the different sources of information related to the management of water quality in the lakes um so they 've now produced a report it contains 52 recommendations and central coast council we 've really warmly welcomed this report and we 've really genuinely put effort into holistically integrating these findings into this and future stages of the development of the new plan so of the 52 recommendations 44 of them are considered to be the partly or fully achievable within the scope of the development of our new plan with consideration of our current resourcing capacity and our financial situation 16 of those recommendations have been identified as appropriate to progress them in a really timely manner i really encourage you to read the full expert panel report if you haven 't already um it 's available to download from our website the your voice outpost page and in the final appendix of our scoping study you 'll find a table that we 've created which summarizes all of the recommendations and themes them and numbers them in a way that allows us to more easily integrate them into our planning process both the expert panel and us central coast council have really invited the community to share what you value and consider to success to look like for our waterway and to begin the process of building transparency and trust and respect and we 're really committed to working with the community to explore these values and to co-create clear realistic and measurable actions so that we can work together towards that shared future and so phase one of our engagement was highly successful so we had over 3 900 people visit our project page and 1168 responses to our survey we also had over 350 people enter a series of focus groups and the insights that we gain from this are so valuable and they 've very much been taken into consideration as we 've developed that phase one scoping study and also in the development of our community and stakeholder engagement strategy and all of these are available for you to download from the your voice outpost website including the results that we 've published of the key findings of that community consultation so i really do encourage you to jump on and check that out thank you so much to everyone who has provided input so far your insights are genuinely so highly valued and taken into consideration if you would like to get involved and haven 't already we would love to hear from you it 's really important to us that this coastal management program development process reflects the values and preferences of our community so we invite you to register to join the pool of candidates for focus groups or to register just to keep um in touch as we progress through the different stages of developing the plan and we will our coast website um in as we move into the next stage so thank you again to everyone who has contributed so far and i really do look forward to keeping you updated as we move along this journey together thank you _"

    "text": "all right um so yes thank you thanks stuart thanks will thanks everyone for coming um so i yes i 'll be covering off on what we 've learned about water quality and it 's and the ecological health of tuggery lakes and a lot of this will be relating to the previous presentations you 've seen on on the catchment and also the um the entrance and hydrodynamics of of the lake system so first of all i 'll just overview of the aim so um what we were trying to do was really understand the nature of the tugboat system and how how it 's changed over time and how how that sort of really controls or determines our experience of the lakes and an important part of that is to understand how climatic variations so the seasonal patterns in rainfall and wind and etc as well as things like la nina and el nino and even longer period climatic variations what sort of impact they have on lake water quality and the ecological processes we 're also obviously interested on how the the the condition of the the main pollutant sources in the lake were and how they impacted on water quality of course what causes rack and and ooze problems in the lake and then how these vary in space and time around the lake um and then of course what the management options for the raqqa news were in the in the near shore of the lake given the analysis of those um factors that that impact on these so the approach taken was to um was to review all of the existing literature on the lake so all of those you know that that huge uh list of reports that you 're aware of but also um i undertook quite a lot of new analysis of existing water quality data and rain and also climatic data to um to try to answer some of these these questions based on um what was out there and so that that included a data set which was more than 10 years old so it gave an opportunity to um to really sort of tease out some of these problems so but of course the challenges we 've to um you know the the past decade or two so we were we had we struggled looking back in time to um how the the lakes were um were well obviously before european settlement but also during the times when when um there were a lot less people and a lot less developing in the catchment so i 'll just start off by giving a uh sort of an overview overview of the key attributes of the tug relation and to i 'll preface this section by saying that tugger lakes is quite a unique lake system it 's a it 's obviously one of those the biggest lake systems in new south wales but it 's it has a lot of um physical and ecological attributes that make it stand out is is quite unique it 's you know it 's bordered by um lake macquarie to the south and then to to the the mile lakes and and wallace lakes to the north um all of these lakes are unique in their own way so there is no whilst they share some common attributes they really are one of the key defining attributes is it 's it 's very shallow it 's a broad basin open to and exposed to winds from all directions and that that is that is really a defining physical attribute of the lake it has a fairly con as you 've heard in in previous nights it has a constrained entrance that 's prone to closing or becoming constricted during extended bright dry periods and that leads to tidal exchange being very limited to approximately one percent of the lake volume per day the water levels in the lake they don 't vary much on a on a diurnal or a daily cycle but more over a fortnightly tidal cycle due to spring and neat neat tides and also in response to rainfall and evaporation and due to wind forcing and i 'm sure that dave has outlined all of that but those things actually really impact on water quality dynamics and also the the overall experience that people have of the lake um the fresh water flows are really dominated by floods from the major creeks so if you quantify the lakes on an annual basis it 's really dominated by rimba creek wyoming creek and wallara creek most of that water is actually transported out into the ocean it tends to skate over the lake basin because it 's fresh and the lake is usually salty so the less dense fresh water sort of forms a lens which is transported out there 's also uh a lot of groundwater inputs that we we 're starting to learn about from the fringing catchments the low-lying um wetlands and fringing sands and these are potentially very important um those fringing wetlands and salt mash habitats due to the water level variation they 're really integral parts of the of the lake ecosystem um and the it the lakes really support a very extensive sea grass habitat one of the largest and most extensive in new south wales and these these seagrasses um support diverse fish and bird life um so i 'll just move on to a little bit of detail about the influence of climate the as i alluded to before the lake water quality and ecology is is really one inter-annual and decadal variation in rainfall temperature and wind these things if we look at all of the water quality data that we have and analyze that as a function of time either either month or or years we can see very strong patterns and as everyone will be aware the those sort of the the cycles of el nino and la nina which occur over five to ten year cycles um have really very marked effect on the sort of uh weather that we see along the coast of new south wales in particular and that 's that 's no different in toggl lakes but on top of that we have these what we call decadal um variation in in climate which is i 've i 've hear i 've sort of highlighted the influence of the inter interdecadal pacific oscillation it 's a climatic phenomenon which interacts with that el nino la nina to create extended dry periods and extended periods of flood dominated conditions so these these sort of things really influence the way the lake system functions and angus just to just to be clear that long yeah so so you know 20 to 40 years long so we see so for example we see um in in the in the climatic record of of the of new south wales we see what what what are called flood dominated and drought dominated periods so for example in the first part of the the 20th century we were in the midst of a um a drought dominated period up until the up until the the late 1940s and then we we switched into a a flood dominated period so you know there was that was the time when you know the 1950s floods the major 1960s floods in the 1970s and the 80s we we had a much higher frequency of large flood events during that period after that we switched over into a um what you know a drought dominated period um which meant that the frequency and magnitude of floods diminished it 's not to say that there weren 't you know very large rainfall rainfall events it just meant that they just occurred less frequently and that 's been observed in in rainfall records means in terms of you know being on the ground in in um in places like tuggerah lakes due to the due to the the the you know the influence of these climatic cycles of the rain temperature and wind the the sort of things that you your you experience the environmental conditions you experience around the lake um such as rack and ooze accumulations they 're very different from year to year and they you know it may come and go at various places it you know may appear in a place for a couple of years and and then disappear so from from the analysis of the available data that we 've we 've we 've got to hand um we believe that that these this variation is in part in large part driven by these climatic cycles and this obviously leads to a major major challenge because these climatic cycles interact have interacted with the incremental modification of the catchment since european settlement and that really complicates our interpretation of anecdotal accounts of late condition over time so we have to we have to nuance or we the you know what the what the reports are of uh you know prawn catches and fish catches back in the 1920s we have to think back and and um or that has to be looked at in the context of what the the the the climate was at the time or the or the weather weather and climate was at the time so just to touch on you know notwithstanding that with what we did in is part of this was to have a look at available anecdotal evidence and historical photos to try to get an idea of what the lake look like before it 's it be you know in before its current state so in in the in the 1940s we were in the middle of this this phase of growth of agriculture and forestry largely within the rural catchment there was there was you know sort of small urban developments um springing up around the lake and in this photo you can see a 1941 aerial from the from the war years of the long jetty region so the road neck work was in but so this the the clearing of the the wider catchment for agriculture and forestry greatly increased the sediment and nutrient loads via the main creeks into the main lake basin um but the system itself the lake system itself was probably you know relatively uh close to what what it would have been in pure pre-european times so you can see that along the long jetty shoreline or that those shallow the shallows of the long jetty shoreline they were they were dominated by clean sands and exposed to um strong tidal or wind currents along there and that 's that 's that 's evidenced by these sand ridges this is all under the water so the water is very clear um and you can see that the longevity shoreline um near shore is is dominated by sand most the seagrass and macker algae were really um they were they dominated the lake the shallow lake basins so they were growing in much deep water deeper water because of the clearer water allowed light to enable them to establish there and of course the at that stage these the shorelines was you know one of the key attributes of the system at the time from the 1960s to pr present that was really marked by really intense urban development of the lake fringes so that greatly increased the sediment and nutrient loads um to those those fringing or initial areas and and what what we witnessed was a rapid increase in ecological impacts so um excuse me so we saw the the the cumulative impacts of catchment erosion and sediment to the lake basin caused much higher turbidity or cloudiness of the water that reduced the light penetration through the water and caused the seagrass to migrate into those shallow regions so now we have in 2020 all of those shallow shoals are now colonized by seagrass and macroalgae that increase in urbanization has really greatly increased the nutrient inputs to that nearshore zone and one of the features is that virtually every street has a stormwater drain discharging into the initial zone and and you basically so every um every every small rainfall event runs off and discharges nutrient-rich and sediment-rich water into the into that initial zone and well sorry the um the presence of seagrass and maca algae has effectively created the barrier between the the lake basin and the near shore zone so these these be these two zones of the lake have become decoupled as we say so that the water doesn 't really exchange freely um between the two zones and that that creates a sort of a a stagnant water pool along that that that zone so that tends to trap all of this this urban storm water and really is is one of the major causes of poor water quality issues the other factor is or the other major thing that 's happened is that shorelines have been greatly modified in recent years so most significantly probably especially in this part of the lake during the the the uh chugger lakes restoration project when when there was an effort to dredge the macro algae and seagrass from this zone and that dredge spoil was used to create these um artificial shorelines so essentially this is give this pretty much at the moment i 'll move on to the influence of the entrance or to assess this issue we utilized that 15-year data set that i alluded to at the beginning um and i had a look at we were able to um have a look at uh the the the water quality dynamics during the periods when the entrance was well and truly open so title exchange was good and and and compare it with times when the uh entrance was effectively closed it closed or effectively closed such as from mid to 2018 to the um the flood in early 2020 yes anyway so during the open entrance conditions um ocean ocean exchange is in that that entrance channel shown in this picture is quite good so it causes that to be dominated by oceanic water as as people will be well aware the tidal exchange in the lake basin is is considerably less and it it causes just a gradually increase in salinity over monthly time scales but there 's really no measurable impact on any other water quality parameters such as turbidity or nutrients and the reason for this is because wind driven says resuspension of lakes lake sediments lake basin outside of those you know brief flood times sorry angus wind driven resuspension um just make sure we understand what that you 're referring to there oh okay so so what i 'm referring to there is is due i i i said before how wide open the lake basins um are so basically any of the prevailing strong winds um set up quite large wind waves on on the lake and people will be well familiar with this in the afternoon over on a windy nor 'easter or south easter the waves on the main lake basin become quite large relatively large and because the lake basin is quite shallow that wave energy tends to stir up the bed the the sediments at the bottom of the lake and that causes turbidity or cloudiness in the water but it also creates um it also increases nutrient concentrations and also things like microalgae concentrations so that process of what we call wind driven resuspension is really the the main as we would measure it in that lake basin and i would and and i 'll i i told lake basin and that that nearshore zone um people will be probably well aware of the fact that on a windy day um the near shore zone can be quite clear whilst out in the lake basin it 's you know very clear and calm whilst on the lake basin it 's quite um there 's large waves and the water is very cloudy that 's that basically is um due to that decoupling and the dampening effect of the sea grass and the rack barriers on that wave energy and due to due to that effect the tidal exchange through the entrance really does not influence the water quality um in the near shore zone um and and we have quite a quite a dece you know large data set to demonstrate that um and during this period it 's um lake monmour is is considerably fresher than the other lakes and i i will um and that 's only due that 's only since the pumping of the monmouth power station ceased so uh that that basically is due to the fact that the um the budgie boy sort of uh couple the lakes in terms of water quality and without that and again just to be clear but in that statement when you say is fresher does is that basically saying less salty it 's not not about water quality but about salt is that yes thank you stewart yes so um i 'm trying to be too breaky yeah so it 's less less salty so basically it 's the um it 's not as affected by tidal exchange as the other lakes um so it 's not as it 's the the input of salt from the ocean is less in lake monmourer during that period during the closed entrance period what we saw in the data was that lake levels increase in salinity decreases so the lake becomes fresher in response to just incremental inputs of rainfall and creek flows and during this period the conditions in lake monmour become very similar to the other lakes um so move on to rack and ooze around the lakes so everyone will probably be well familiar with you know the various issues and the way this like to do here is to sort of really highlight some of the the main physical forcing attributes or factors that affect the way you know the the things that we see around the lake in terms of these things so the first thing is shoreline aspect that is which way which direction the shoreline faces and the wind climate and in wind climate i mean the direction and winds wind wind direction and strength those those two factors really determine [Music] strongly determine the localized susceptibility to poor water quality rack accumulation and ooze development around the lake so in these two examples um you can see in in shoreline that faces that faces due south east as in this photo on the left it 's open to a lot of wave energy from those strong southeast winds so the and what that happened what that tends to do is to really force the rack up onto the shoreline as opposed to shorelines that that are much more protected from wave energy the way the rack tends to accumulate um in the water against the shoreline so and one and strength varies seasonally and interannually so again going back to that slider showed climatic controls the the the nature of this this um this forcing factor as we say um varies in time and and and um so in some years you know you we might have a prevalence of of nor east wind really strong north winds that will affect those shorelines that um are are exposed to those winds um in a different way to the other ones and advice and that and vice versa for the southeast uh we will use where source winds predominate um obviously the shoreline gradient plays a really important role in in terms of whether material is trapped against it trapped in the water as in the right hand photo or whether or not it 's forced up onto the shoreline in the left-hand photo the other thing is that the if we look at the wind wave energy for any particular shoreline averaged over a long period of time that that really determines whether the sediments at on the beach and and under in in that sort of shallow part 's sandy or muddy so again if if the shoreline tends to be a lot more protected from all of the major winds finer sediment tends to accumulate there it 's just basically because there 's less energy to to push that sediment into the into the water and um it so it tends to settle out there that 's and so that really is one of the major um that that is one of the major factors as to whether or not we sort of see oohs developing in a particular shoreline so um yeah some some some shorelines such as along berkeley vale have a have a on average much less wind wave energy and therefore they 're much more susceptible to ooze development so briefly on to ooze and what it is um i preface this by saying not all sediments that we find along the shorelines of lakes and estuary qualify zoos organic rich muds or you know fine sediments they 're they 're very much a normal part of estrogen ecosystems however in in in those sort of sys in those parts of tuggerah where that the system is out of balance um so oohs in those in that context really what we 've what we 've analyzed or there 's been is there 's studies that have analyzed the um the con the the composition of this material and it 's basically made up of fine sediments and clays and sands and very fine sediments um a lot of organic matter um and that the that that organic matter is sourced from things like algae macro algae that lettuce weed that you might see um and other forms of microalgae such as microscopic algae in the water sea grass rack and also leaf litter from from storm water and but it 's this algal derived material which is really what makes the youth smelly um and what we found is that or what what what the data show is that the seagrass rack only really comprises about 15 of those ooze sediments on average um that 's not to that 's really and i 'll just uh stress that that 's just the the ooze sediments themselves it 's not the the the rack to those sediments so looking at the ooze formation one and the major contributing factors stagnant water um due to that decoupling effect between the near shore and the lake basin is a major factor so the and and that 's caused by the um you know the accumulation of rack is you know in those sort of offshore almost like reefs of rack but also the growth of maca algae um and that tends to what what that tends to do is actually trap the storm water as you see in this photo here along the berkeley vale shoreline you can see that this cloudy storm water after a small rain event has been trapped in this small area in here that stuff is really nutrient rich and stimulates the growth of that that algae in that in that part of the system um the the effectiveness of those barriers in terms of decoupling the near shore and the basin um is also really highly affected by water levels so obviously when the water level is low um the barriers become much more effective and it tends to trap shore when the lake level is higher there 's much greater exchange between the new shore and lake basin so that nutrient-rich stormwater from from all of those stormwater strains along the um the near shore it tends to become very concentrated in the near shore zone during periods when when you have an effective barrier and stagnation of the water and those nutrients stimulate the growth of algae which is a major contributor to the formation of this smelly black ooze as opposed to the normal sort of uh muddy sediment and we we also have emerging evidence that groundwater inputs may be a significant source of nutrients in some location and i 'll note that um graham ham can ask a question about this in relation to the sewage treatment plant um up up near canton beach uh and i would agree with graham 's question there i think that is in a region where there is evidence of groundwater inputs to the system so it 's it 's one of those uh it 's potentially um a significant source um we don 't really know enough about 's just some really preliminary data and evidence around this so leading on from all of that to some management recommendations that came out of our review the the expert panel really endorses and supports the idea of strategic rack harvesting so the idea of this is to really sort of analyze the nature of the shorelines in with regards to all of those factors that i was um outlining before you know the shoreline aspect um the the the um and the wind wave energy and how that impacts on uh water exchange um so the idea here is to really sort of work with nature and work with the climate or the seasonal variation winds to improve the circulation and flushing along that nearshore zone so get to really move that that nutrient-rich stormwater into the lake basin where it becomes diluted improve rack harvesting methods and and explore new methods through upgraded machinery and and innovative techniques to clear the rack more efficiently and rapidly um strategies to reduce that nutrient-rich stormwater input from all of the the various stormwater drains and this can be done through know um minimizing the amount of nutrients that actually go into the stormwater drains in the streets so you know not washing your car on a on your concrete driveway but rather on your lawn maybe using you know sort of nutrient low nutrient detergents etc and then looking at sort of stormwater treatment zones so so um uh these sort of things i 've included a picture of a a stormwater treatment zone that was created over in the longest shoreline uh by central coast council you know these ideas have been able to understanding that you can 't you can 't stop all of the nutrients and sediment coming off the landscape so then we have to actually try try to treat that so there are innovative ways of or emerging ways of doing that obviously given the really huge area of urbanized shoreline this is hugely costly but nonetheless and also exploring opportunities to redec redirect some of the stormwater flows from those fringing urban catchments into the main creek channels so rimba creek and wyoming creek and and so that those nutrients end up in the they get concentrated in that usual zone and another thing is to is to continue to try to improve the resilience and function of the initial zone so uh that that photo is is an example of of an attempt to do that various attempts to regrade the shoreline rehabilitate salt marsh uh other examples um and i think there 's a there 's there 's room for improved monitoring of late conditions and also the the performance of management initiatives um there 's through a um the new emerging generation of smart sensors so to limit to limited loggers so that allow you to actually have it uh observe uh water quality in real time um the the and and also through the um continued employment of citizen science um you know there 's some really great data sets that have been collected by various citizen groups around the lake um which really help us understand where the um the main hot spots are in terms of pollutant generation and and you know um degradation within the lake but also that again citizen science can help through emerging technologies on localized conditions all of this information really helps us to better understand the nature of the problems because i guess i would make the point that while we 've tried to really analyze the available data and and i think we 've come up with some very strong conclusions there are there 's still a lot we don 't really understand about how the system works and so in ongoing monitoring i think is essential and you know as part of that really that this information and this sort of pro process really needs to continue to engage the community i think there 's there 's a there 's a huge role to sort of for the community to play in terms of in helping us helping you know scientists like myself and the expert panel better understand the lake but also to to improve the the the the understanding within the community of how the lakes function and what a unique system um they live on and enjoy so at that i 'll stop rabbiting on and and hand it over back over to stuart and yes thanks um lots of good uh comments and questions coming in there so i want to dive straight in and just on that last comment you made about community engagement and and community being able to provide information i can i can see one individual who 'd be very keen to provide information about rack management um just in in chat today not mentioning any names dave eaton but um look fair fair point i want to go to that as a first question just because we sort of ended there and there 's some people have been asking tonight and people have been talking the whole year about what do we mean by rack harvesting and is harvesting a good thing and how do we know you 've talked about tonight improved harvesting could you just talk a little bit more about what you mean um about that what what does what do you think rack harvesting looks like and um and you know for some it 's a controversial thing so could you just talk about that a bit more sure um so i 'll i 'll start by the lake system you know we we have a shallow lake system which supports the as i said one of the largest um [Music] one of the largest seagrass stands along the coast of new south wales rack is uh is a you know a consequence of having sea grass so um and it plays an ecological function but we recognize also that due to a combination of um uh shoreline modification and and other factors the rack isn 't really um being distributed like it was naturally so there is a there is definitely a role um and for rack harvesting so rack harvesting is is basically the collection of rack and and um and export of exporting that rack out of the lake system um so that 's traditionally been done by the the the you know the the harvester that moves around the lake um and also in in in other times by the use of a truck saw which is a you know sort of a sort of a waterborne type of tractor um but essentially it when i say when i allude to strategic harvesting we create first of all we create some areas of the lake where rack is allowed to accumulate and and form its natural function so tugra bay to the northern in between arimba creek and and wyoming creek on the western side of the lake is is has been identified as one of these rack reserves it 's not causing any problem um whereas whereas say for example along other shorelines like berkeley vale or long jetty there is there is it 's obviously causing a problem due to that decoupling and barrier effect um so the aim with the strategic harvesting of that rack is to move into those is to harvest rack from there and reduce that barrier effect when that shoreline is more likely to be influenced by winds that will force water currents along that shoreline and therefore mix you know create the uh uh the or sorry dilute that 's that you know that nutrient rich water from the storm water channels into the lake basin so it 's really about working strategically through the season um with with nature to sort of maximize the um uh there 's comments coming in and again this reflects questions gathered recently and and throughout the whole process again it 's the it 's the seemingly self-evident connection between an open entrance and and cleaner water there 's question here tonight about it it seems to locals that when the entrance has been open for a while the water looks feels cleaner and but i mean you 've talked a little bit about that i 'm interested can you talk a bit more about the connection between entrance being open not open and and water quality can you just sort of unpack that a little bit more um well i guess yeah it 's it um obviously as i said um you know around the entrance and in that entrance channel up as far as the bridge and perhaps beyond an open entrance will definite you know definitely influences water quality the water on a on an incoming tide and a high tide that water is largely oceanic um as for the for the rest of the lake as i say the data suggests that that other factors of water quality that you would measure on a day-to-day basis it 's it 's it 's def i mean the the only measurable thing that we see in the data is a gradual increase in salinity within the lake basin whilst the entrance is open the the um the sort of water quality that you see on any particular shoreline whether it be canton beach um you know um long jetty or berkeley vale or tumbi that really has more to do with you know the how the winds and rainfall and lake level has been over the preceding um two to three months so for example if we look at the if we look at the water level since the the entrance opened [Music] due to the big flood in early 2020 the water level has been much higher than it was prior to that so that barrier effect that i was talking about that decouples the basin from the initial zone was much less during that period so you will you 'll probably around the lake you 're much less likely to see um those sort of during that time so are you saying then i think you are that if the lake level is a little higher when the lake level is a little higher that decoupling is less the shoreline water looks a little cleaner or is a little cleaner is that yeah yeah so if you look if you know you think there 's there 's there 's the barrier and here 's the water level when the water level is low uh the the water inside the barrier is you know is trapped and stagnant um and when the water level rises there 's there 's greater opportunity for some exchange with the lake basin between that barrier so what i 'm saying and what i 'm saying that it that is um [Music] you know there are a lot of factors at play and those factors vary around the uh around the lake you know and and and certainly you know the the sort of that that spring nape title um forcing that um that causes the lack level to to vary over a fortnightly period the and david can step in really relates to how efficient the entrance is at that time so if the entrance is very constrained that fortnightly tide is going to be less than if it 's really open david would you like to step in there i guess my opinion on that is a bit mixed because obviously when you when the thing 's completely closed you don 't you don 't get any fortnightly tired it seems like there 's a real sort of sweet spot where uh where you will get that variation where it 's enhanced um if an entrance is like incredibly open you don 't get that that variation um right it 's a it 's a you know if you want to get technical about it it 's not as tight or pumping and the the more the more um constrained the entrance is the more that tidal pumping effect will be seen but there 's a limit to that if you close off the entrance too much then you don 't you don 't get that so if it 's you know if it 's completely closed of course mean i guess that i i was trying to oversimplify things and um but it really goes to my point that you know what we observe around the lake is is due to a complex interaction of lots of different factors okay um and the thing i noticed tonight and i 've seen you know various presentations from you over the years but it 's it struck me really for the first time maybe i haven 't been paying close enough attention your picture from the past the 1920s or whenever it was the um the the water was clear water quality was good the lake the entrance was natural and it 's never really struck me before and there 's a lot of concern about training the lake in order to improve water quality and it 's just struck me tonight that um in the past the the the entrance has been untrained and yet the water quality quality was was good then so make of that what you will but that 's my own realization um just from a little bit of information um the entrance was completely photo was taken there was a period for about two to three years i think david winter was completely closed in the early 40s so essentially what we were looking at in that 1940s photo is the system in in a very different or alternate state it 's it 's it 's sort of the the the the culmination of or the the combination of various pressures um in subsequent decades has caused you know a fundamental shift in the system states so that the turbidity in the lake bracing is increased so the seagrass has moved up in all of those things like described yeah yeah okay so interesting um some comments again this has been an issue that 's come up a bit and again tonight is is the power station you you briefly touched on the power station its closure and the impact has been some questions about has it has has that changed the thermal properties has that had any impact on the seagrass um what do we know about that has there been any impact has the closure of the power station had any impact as i said it has definitely the the shutting down of that circulation um you know due to the cooling water intake from lake mamur and and um uh you know discharged to budgie roy that has tended to um decouple manmore from from budgie roy in terms of um exchange somewhat so that as i said uh man more has become less salty whilst whilst the whilst the entrance is open in terms of other water quality properties there 's there 's really not enough evidence [Music] to suggest that there has been yeah well it 's really inconclusive um i i reviewed the um in terms of uh you know pollutants like sediment uh contamination there was a cardinal report done in 2014 uh that looked at sediments in in various in the ash dam and in in in various parts of the system close to the to the power station and i think they are they found that all contaminants were below the guidelines for the protection of aquatic ecosystems with the exception of one um one instance of higher copper so that was you know and know there 's evidence from um from lake macquarie that you know shows contamination um but uh yes there 's again there 's no real evidence from one more so i think there 's there there has been in the past there has been issues with water quality in that in that cooling water channel um and certainly that that was highlighted as an issue okay all right good thanks and i 'm just turning my eye more to these questions and i know um tony 's been very patiently over three nights um asking questions and seems he 's he 's asking what seems to be a self-evident thing that if the entrance is open doesn 't that mean we get more nutrients um and and rack and stuff flushed out of the lake it just it seems that it feels logical um so again what would you how would you respond to that um well i guess this might be probably a question for david i think you know i think i would sort of start by saying you know due to the the trapping effect of you that you know tidal flushing is far less or efficient or even non-existent along a lot a lot much of that shoreline um you know tends to be the the flushing effects tends to be disproportionately skewed towards the the the lake water the water in the lake basin therefore it 's not it 's not really having the sort of impacts that we would like it to have along you know the parts of the lake that we you know mostly interact with all right david do you want to add to that i don 't know well i guess i guess it you know it comes back to this point of it only the titan typical title range only being a couple of centimeters in inside say tog relax and um unless unless it 's it 's scout out you might get up to eight centimeters or something like that after a big flood it 's still not a huge exchange so we 're only we 're only looking maybe up to three maybe five percent in in best conditions so um you know the question is about going around on around the near shore and um based on your observations angus my understanding is that that 's it 's not enough and uh stuff that i 've seen from you know looking at the way that the the lake changes during a flood it just seems to dominate everything the amount of volume that 's getting exchanged coming off the catchment and then going through out through the entrance after a flood is is much larger and more dramatic than what we get on each tide yeah um thanks so i just um there 's some questions from earlier on and i just want to make sure we get to them uh there 's a number of people asking in in a number of ways about things flowing in and i don 't know angus the extent you know we heard from nicole the other night about the catchment issues and and these are relevant to that but people are talking about um nutrients get into the lake through leaking sewers from the from the sewer works someone else has mentioned kangyangi the you know the the creeks um how significant are these ultimately to issues of water quality these sorts of things well um all of them you know any any point sources i think are very very important and so you know discharges of uh you know i mean stormwater trains or a point source you know that um but but things i think the groundwater i think as as i alluded to in the presentation groundwater is a really potentially a very significant issue because that is is a major pathway of pollutants into the lake especially um during you know times outside of floods so we know that in the 80s and early 90s there was a there was a huge issue with macro algae blooms along canton beach um that were documented um that was that was found to be due to the leakage of that at the time canton 's canton beach was on septics um so and it 's uh it those macro algae blooms were found to be associated with the the leakage of nutrient which septic effluent through those those very permeable sands and into the initial zone know understanding where those groundwater pathways are i just sort of make the point um you know going back to what david said as well if you look at the you know the wider catchment the vast bulk of on an on an annual basis on a yearly basis the vast bulk of material that comes in into the lake system occurs during these large floods and it tends to most of it tends to skate out through the entrance and out into the into the ocean a certain amount is obviously retained in the lake basin um and then that 's distributed i 'm very quickly mixed by by these wind waves um uh and you know wind-driven currents um and then that material is then sort of reworked but it 's in terms of what we observe for most of the time through the year it 's it 's these smaller inputs these little pulses of nutrient-rich or pollutant-rich groundwater and stormwater um you know and discharges they that 's really what makes the difference okay thank you um and there are some questions uh and this is um i just wonder if you have an opinion um given the planned future developments but what do you think is the connection between how planning is is done might be done could be done and the sorts of things you 're seeing as impacts on water quality how do you how do you see those are you able to comment on that um well i think that um probably harks back to this idea that those various management strategies we want to really want to try to design our urban landscapes in a way to um to minimize the generation of pollutants so you know water sensitive urban designs you know sort of permeable um stormwater drains and and i would say that probably avoid the situation where we have you know urban developments discharging into that nearshore zone so really discharging into the creeks is probably via you know appropriate treatment devices is probably the only way i can see of minimizing the impacts of urban development into the future okay um [Music] sure that 's fine um and i don 't know will or dave well i there 's two others that came earlier in the piece i thought i 'm interested to hear angus 's answer to him one was around if we fixed it if we fixed up the ground water for sure angus do you think you might go back to bringing the seagrass in the middle just one of greg 's how was cursed before or do you think you know it 's pretty hard to recover to what we 've got now i think there 's a lot of there 's a lot of resistance you know it 's it 's one of those um to going back to that way because what we 've got now is the sediment the the fine sediment that 's accumulated in that lake basin is stirred up on every wind event and that that turbidity just basically means that there 's not enough light for the sea grass to move down into that lake basin it 's hard to get back very hard to get back it 's one it 's what we call you know there 's been a state shift in the system to another and it 's very you know you 've got to push the ball back over this big hill for it to actually fall into that other state but it 's um but that 's not to say that we can 't improve we can 't strive for a for a much more healthy uh version of what we have at present so and that 's that 's where the you know that those you know the strategic rack harvesting and all these other things that we 've been talking about all right and there was another question along the same lines it was early in the piece with regards to um harvesting of rack and and councilwork on rack and everything else what would you suggest individuals could do to assist in improving the lakefront or actively promoting better lake frontage and the way they 're working right now um i think that uh well i think that you know there is i think there 's you know if uh that what 's subscription to the this concept of strategic rack harvesting and and you know citizen science know if we can uh you know report that back to council to to help that strategic rack harvesting plan um evolve in real time um so that that 's one thing probably you know um [Music] i think a certain amount uh you know this is probably i think there 's a certain amount of um acceptance of the lake the you know the beast that it is so so that you know the acceptance of iraq and and you know that we will never actually get to a sort of a we 'll never get back to the 1940s or pre-1940s one so the lake is is full of seagrass that is you know that is a provides an ecological function it 's a very valuable ecological function iraq is part of that so there are certain you know i think there 's a certain amount of acceptance of the lake uh the unique features of the lake which would help so that would help you know people be sort of more supportive of um of you know the the the directions or that strategic rack management issue i i know that i 'm not answering those your question in terms of what they can they can do on there for sure i think there 's you know i think there 's i think everyone has to um promote this idea of of of a natural foreshore that and allow the so you know the promotion of low gradient shorelines natural salt marsh accommodating accommodating um water level variation within that lake margin so not trying to sort of you know uh you know mow right up to the lake edge you know just having that buffer zone that is it belongs to the lake um reducing every you know everyone within those those fringing catchments um really working hard to reduce the you know pollutants nutrients and sediments going into the um stormwater system all of those things will help it 's it 's it 's a i think that you know i always quite you know i was banging on about this being a death by a thousand cuts you know we all we 're everyone is contributing a small bit to the overall problem the impacts um thanks angus so there 's a question from jane about potential or concern about pollutants um in the uh arimbo creek catchment um do you know much about that have you seen seen anything to be concerned about there or any impact on the lake um no i 'm sorry i don 't i don 't really have any information at hand sorry yeah but i 'm happy i 'm happy to look further into that it might be something that nicole would be better off two nights ago we talked about the ash dams and the metals coming off and there was a lot of concern and i know angus you probably know that some of that better than others is the metal pollution from the ash jams a concern is it a high impact is it something we need to you know be active about no look well i mean as i said i the only information i have to go off is that cardinal report that um from 2014 none of the samples taken there were you know red flags um there was there possibly that there were um some responses in the in the comments you know observing algal blooms in vicinity and i did notice in the cardinal report that there were elevated concentration of nutrients um associated with sediments and water quality in the in there so there is potentially you know an issue due to that nutrients and and algal blooms medals have done i mean at this point um it 's not to say i unfortunately the cardinal report didn 't really give um a detailed map of the sample location so i really couldn 't it was and and there were very few samples taken so it 's very hard to make a you know very sort of educated assessment there 's some you 're being given some advice of what to read there in in chat um so that 's some pointers there 's also i noticed a question about sea level rise and i don 't know if there 's that 's anything you 've considered projecting forward what could be the impact on water quality of sea level rise is that something that you 've pondered 've we 've really comprehensively assessed i know that from the coastal inundation mapping um we could well end up with the second entrance after the budgie roy sandmas um i i said david you might want to step in here but i know that um david hansley 's sea level uh coastal inundation mapping shows that uh essentially becoming a second entrance there obviou i mean i would i would say that probably what we 're looking at is is a system that becomes um more more saline more more ocean dominated um obviously you know uh the you know all of those dynamics of the nearshore zone will probably um change significantly um yeah david do you want to add anything i might jump in and say so if you were here two nights ago you 'd know the we talked a lot about development in the catchment and if you if you 're asking what are the biggest threats to water quality in the catchment and he had climate change you know and development i i think we would probably lean towards the fact that we 're development in the catchment that unless that 's done you know and managed well the next 15 20 30 years as the number suggests um climate change is just an extra pressure stressor on top of everything else yeah so we 've you know that 's that 's really not kicking until in 2070 2080 20 2100 that that 's when the pressure kicking where 's development central coast is is kicking now you know and it 's really but 2050 um a much bigger impact yeah yeah that 's that 's right it 's um there 's going to be much bigger changes associated with what will 's talking about in the interim um i 'm just going through my list of questions that are appearing uh is there anything else jumped out at you dave or will have you seen anything while angus has been talking i 'm just like myself i think most of the things i 've i 've seen that sort of um had my interest you 've picked up already or other people are picked up yeah looking at the time it 's uh up in any case having a little look through now um yeah so folks i think um i think i 'm gonna uh wrap it up there um i hope that 's been useful thanks for your thanks your your energetic comments there that 's been you know it 's really quite interesting to see just how much um knowledge and interest is there and um thanks angus also for your your excellent presentation that was i i learned somethings again despite having seen it before um so i don 't know if you 've got anything to say i guess the question i might ask real is where to from here for the report or the panel for all of that stuff and and so i 'll say a few things just to wrap up here one i i 'll say that just so everyone else is aware what we did in within the panel is we would uh each week challenge each other to prove each other wrong right so we got towards the end there where dave would come in and and lay out his thesis and we would as best as we could try to find how we thought he was wrong and what evidence did he have to back that up and we did the same thing with angus and the same thing with nicole the same thing with stewart so we were trying to find our own holes and we know that none of this is perfect but what we tried to put together was the most comprehensive uh pathway we could find that we all trusted in so and where we didn 't know we identified that these are gaps and we think they should be um worked on and you know we have laid those out so that 's as far as we could take it with the information we had at hand and i hope that was helpful i hope that we were able to you know this the whole idea of these three nights was to to talk about where we were coming from the information we 've had and and how people that care when we it 's obvious how passionate you guys are about the system um that doesn 't have to end here the conversation we 've made a um a recommendation that there 's many things happen one that that the multitude of recommendations we have are taken up and ideally they 're taken up immediately within parts of the coastal management program by local government and by state government through a number of programs they 've got running and a shared responsibility but also through the community so we 're really trying to make sure that we 're sharing the load through everyone and and as i 've said both tonight we 've also recommended that um there 's a independent group brought in to to try to bring people together again and have a conversation based on science that will guide that through i spell comm is really a comment before about well what about the town planners and the engineers and you know and they all have to be in the room and you know certainly one of the things we said in our report was the stormwater group has to be in the room and they have to be looking at what no way that planning can take the planning proceeds and not put them back into the environment you know where people care so i i do and i think the rest of the panel encourages people in this room to to continue to ride on the cage and continue to seek for some of these recommendations to be implemented i i certainly will be uh and hopefully we 'll hear more about that soon uh so so i 'll just wrap up by i guess this is you know i think the last time i 'll sit in front of you as an expert panel chair so thank you on behalf of the panel we we are really grateful that people show up to these things to begin with i mean who knows when we put this out if you 're even going to come so i know it 's your week night thanks for coming thanks for being really eager and active um we 'll try to make sure that all the information is out there if you don 't have something less know there are no hard copies there we haven 't_''_4446.32 i don 't have a card copy it 's all just electronics you could get it printed somewhere but we don 't have one now and uh but hopefully there will be a summary report coming out which which may be too small for someone like you gary but it it it may be helpful for others and we do we are hoping to print some of those it 's sort of 20 page summary documents of everything in there and so thanks for everyone involved and uh and i hope you have a lovely night and hopefully we can make a difference on tiger lake so um back to you thanks everyone it 's been terrific and i guess that is well we haven 't really been a panel for eight months now but that 's that 's probably the last time we can even pretend to be the panel so thank you everyone it 's been an honor and privilege _"

    "text": "so welcome uh thank you for making time on a tuesday night this week to come and join in our conversation uh about the tiger legs extra panel report so we were i 'm will lamar on the chair of the tiger legs expert panel and we were commissioned by minister kane back in june of last year with six months to deliver a report on tuglinx 's extra panel and we did our utmost to try to get all the scientific information together and where we could get as much information from the community on how uh well what was the priority for them what was background information what evidence did we have in the community that we could support what we were doing and we spoke to many of you and so thank you all for that input we 've tried to include that in the report and then we made our summary and recommendations which came which we submitted back at the end of the year so that was december 31st last year and that was uh released publicly a couple of months ago now people have and we took it upon ourselves as the expert panel members to be very interested in getting feedback on that one of the things you 'd notice in our report is the commentary on trying to build up the knowledge and expectations of how table legs should be done as a community and it shouldn 't be people in a ivy tower telling you know the community how things are done and we wanted that to really roll through this report so we 've produced a report and this was the first time we could actually go out and speak to everybody so we very much want to see this as a conversation tonight um trying to provide some background and details of what we were thinking in the report and why we wrote what we did uh answer any questions that people may have related to some of those specifics and then try to work through where this might go and where this might end up the it 's important for us to note that the expert panel is finished we were we 're all independents we 're not have nothing to do i have nothing to do with government i 'm i 'm a university academic professor at university new south wales and so once we 're done we submit a report we the best we can do is advocate for the change in the report and part of that is creating some transparency around what we 're doing and hoping that others will also see some value in what we 've done and try to encourage that change to happen so we 've because the report is very big um and we spent a lot of time trying to pull it all together we thought it was best to provide these seminars into three main topics and and that 's why tonight is just one the topics and really just to make sure we had enough time to cover what was in it and i imagine we 'll see a few of you on multiple nights this week but i 'm here as the chair we 've got uh the rest of the panel so stuart waters is is organizing running the night and keeping everyone on activities throughout the process dave rainwright is here you can see dave um dave really led the investigations on the entrance work and how we should understand what the entrance is doing and what uh the previous stage had said nicole romillo is here nicole has done and led up most of the work on the catchment and so how does the the uh catchment process and what 's happened with catchment development influenced water quality in the lake and jean fossett is here another member of the panel and shell really worked with us on understanding the community engagement community perspective and the um the role of trying to bring everyone together in this process i think that 's everyone that 's here from the panel and uh with that i 'll hand back to you stuart nicole i wonder you might just um give us a bit of background on you before oh sure right so i 'm an environmental engineer um i work at bnt um and bmt bmt is an engineering environmental engineering consultancy i think um yeah so private consultancy it stands for british maritime parent organization it 's a uk based um yeah and i think and so my area of expected expertise is total water cycle management planning and water sensitive urban design yeah so that 's just a bit about me i like kayaking as well and love love my waterways all right so just um get back into it um so the key aim i guess of the review was to answer the following questions that i have up here what are the current catchment pressures on water quality what are the future catchment pressures on water quality what catchment management measures have been implemented and how effective have they been and this question really relates to the implementation of recommendations in the tugra lakes estuary management plan lastly i was looking to see if there are any key knowledge gaps noting that the review focuses on the present understanding and as stuart mentioned and will not have mentioned not new assessment um to investigate these questions i reviewed a lot of information including technical and scientific studies for the whole of the catchment while also specifically looking at two catchment developed catchment draining directly to the lake and also the porters creek wetland catchment which is a developing catchment draining to sensitive and highly valued porters creek wetland prior to discharge to the wyong river and tuggerah lakes i also reviewed community comments about key issues and concerns in the catchment through the interactive mapping using social pinpoint as well as some online zoom meetings now can i just interrupt the sorry i 'm just absolutely i 'm still seeing your first slide have you moved on no now i have okay that 's right just wasn 't perfect thanks thanks for the reminder um so for existing catchment pressures the key findings indicated that there 's been widespread changes to the natural catchment through clearing of vegetation and rural urban industrial land uses which have increased flows and pollutant loads directly impacting on water quality in tuggery lakes uh urban storm water is a key contributor to the poor water quality in the lakes as well as existing wetland degradation through you know altered flow regimes and pollutant loads wetlands are really important natural water quality treatment buffers to as habitat flood mitigation and groundwater recharge the impact of stormwater from urban areas fringing the lake has had a significant impact on water quality in those near shore areas and and this is really because impervious areas are directly connected to the lake by stormwater drains and open channels which flow with with flows and high pollutant loads directly flowing to that neutral area of the lake these pollutants get trapped initial areas because of rack build up which essentially prevents mixing with late waters and can cause issues such as eutrophication and the formation of black ooze historical clearing of the catchment and stock access has led to accelerated bank erosion with stream bank erosion estimated contribute to contribute up to double the sediment loads generated by the catchment and this just demonstrates the importance of managing stream bank erosion for managing sediment loads in the catchment in terms of the key future catchment pressures to water quality in the lakes we 've got planned population growth over 40 000 homes in the region by 2036 this presents key future pressures to water quality if not managed appropriately and altering natural hydrology which can impact on waterway and wetland health we found planning controls do not ensure that water quality will be maintained or improved um only drinking water catchments require that these objectives be met and current planning controls uh look like they may result in increased loads furthermore in some developments it looks like treatment recommendations in the development control plan are not being implemented poor erosion and sediment control practices so the large areas of planned development within the catchment present a key future pressure to water quality from poor erosion and sediment control practices during the construction phase and this has been identified from council and community feedback handover of poorly functioning stormwater quality treatment devices to counsel so this results in poor water quality outcomes and can also require expensive rectification works of treatment devices there 's limited council funding and resources to maintain new treatment assets so council 's currently stretched as it is to maintain existing assets so um and let alone the the many new ones that will be required for future development and to rectify existing issues also single stormwater quality treatment under current planning controls so this is an issue because as mentioned previously storm water from urban areas fringing the lake has been identified to have a significant impact on water quality in those near shore areas so development has potential to worsen the fringing water quality and eutrophication and the ooze issues in terms of catchment management measures and the effectiveness council has undertaken a number of catchment management actions to address like water quality as recommended in that estuary management plan um you 've probably all seen information on what 's been done on council 's website via their social pinpoint mapping they 've also documented it in a recent implementation summary report if you haven 't seen that i recommend you get on their website and have a have a look um just some examples that they 've undertaken extensive stream bank rehabilitation salt marsh rehabilitation and construction a bunch of constructed wetlands and gross gluten traps and a community education program which they 've done lots of stuff with so yeah there 's a lot going on and they 've undertaken a lot through waterway report cards which provide a really good overview of how the tuggera lakes and individual catchments are responding however it 's difficult to directly correlate this to the performance of the individual actions undertaken throughout the catchment so this is a key gap that 's been identified in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of management actions on water quality there 's been limited monitoring or modelling undertaken to quantify the effectiveness of those individual actions in terms of reduction in pollutant loads apart from gross pollutant traps another key cap that was identified is quantifying sustainable pollutant load targets for the catchment so that 's that is essentially what pollutant loads generated from the catchment will result in acceptable waterway health for both the lake uh lake health for the can and for the community and the environment and lastly the influence of groundwater on lake water quality particularly those near shore areas was another key gap identified overall a key study finding was that effective catchment management is really crucial for improving water quality in tugra lakes and it 's worth noting that this conclusion was also received so lastly i 'll just run through some of the key recommendations adopting and maintain or improve existing conditions target for all future development so that means developers are required to ensure that pollutant loads following development are either maintained at the current levels or improved on currently as mentioned this is only a requirement only a requirement in drinking water catchments while we don 't know what the sustainable catchment load targets are this ensures that current water quality is at minimum maintained or improved despite future development pressures uh introducing planning controls for single dwelling developments so this is particularly targeting development or redevelopment fringing the lake that 's directly connected to the lake such as granny flat extensions or knock down rebuilds that significantly increase the impervious area and therefore the flows and pollutant loads that are directly flowing to new short areas of the lakes and which can cause issues such as eutrophication and black ooze measures such as reducing and disconnecting impervious errors installing rainwater tanks and rain gardens are just some examples of possible management measures the stormwater levy should be reinstated to means that council have a large influx of new assets to maintain and maintenance of assets is so important to ensure that the treatment measures are performing at optimum levels to protect water quality improved education and enforcement of best practice erosion and sediment control so as mentioned there 's large areas of future development in the catchment and this makes it important to ensure that erosion and sediment control practices prevent sediment from entering the waterways where it can impact on water quality and some other sea grass poor erosion and sediment control as mentioned can also cause water quality treatment assets to fail improving development assessment requirements so this recommendation 's about ensuring that stormwater quality treatment assets the new developments effect is effectively designed and constructed so that assets are handed over in good condition so it may include requirements such as having construction hold points and sign off from certified professionals such as engineers that specialize in stormwater quality that propose management actions have been undertaken as per approved plans um it 's also about having uh requirements for sufficient bonds to be secured from developers once they 're handed over worsted or water sensitive urban design capacity building in council this is about ensuring that council staff have the appropriate skills to review and approve stormwater quality treatment assets through the development approval process and provide ongoing maintenance once handed over to council implementing a stormwater management plan for porters creek catchment to ensure that the wetland is protected from future development identifying pollutant hot spots to target treatment in existing urban areas as well as monitoring the effectiveness of management actions and treatment measures to help do these last two things we 've recommended that citizen science be used that is getting the community involved as much as possible and helping to monitor water quality and identify pollution hot spots for treatment measures as well as monitoring the effectiveness of management actions um implemented to address the issues the aim of this citizen science is um to foster collaboration and promote shared learnings and local knowledge between uh council and the community um and and last but not least uh is introducing an environmental levy to help fund and implement recommendations so this has an important funding mechanism rather than only relying on state government grants just to ensure we get on-ground actions implemented so that 's a bit of a summary of my findings shall i hand back to you um stuart should i stop sharing or um uh stay sharing that 's fine because we might we might be able to refer to some of that so yep no worries thanks nicole that 's that 's good that 's that was useful um so so there have been a couple of comments isn 't there sorry yes there 's a bit of a chat there and that 's that 's fine i 'll i 've just been taking a few notes as you talking so i 'll come to that in a minute i just want to first come to a couple of things that we 've gathered over the last few weeks just to honor the input that that we 've picked up of late um and it 's actually reflected just in the chat as well so some people have been are concerned about the ash dam related to the don 't know if you to what extent did did we the panel look into that what did we learn anything we can say or and add to that yeah sure so we did identify that um the monmora ashdam or um kalonga lake is not lined and therefore that there may be potential for contaminants to leach into the ground water um an adjacent dj synthrolic system this was included in our conceptual model illustrating the catchment pressures um i actually have it here on hand to show you there um we also noted community concerns were raised about the monmour and the vale point ash jams so the vale point ashdan is outside of the catchment but the concerns were that um and that were acknowledged was that because the ash dam isn 't lying that the contaminants might be leaching into the groundwater system and making their way to the lake system um as part of a the lake water quality investigation um another expert panel man member angus reviewed studies um on the impact of the power stations on lake water quality uh he found that and the sediment they 're mostly bound up and they 're not having a significant impact on lake water quality or the ecological health i think you can probably talk to his findings a bit further during that late water quality session i also found the latest publicly available audit of the site um which was undertaken in 2017 that was for the menmora ashtan while it wasn 't specific it was it was an audit of i think 10 sites altogether including that it did it did indicate 80 compliance with current requirements um but uh as mentioned it didn 't specify what was compliant where there wasn 't any high risk non-compliances and it did mention that most of them had been resolved or were being resolved a review of the area of photography around the lake did identify some stands of dead trees around the mamura ashdam and lake and next to lake mamura but these have been these were attributed to mine subsidence um it was a mine substance event that en caused an influx of salt water or saline water into a freshwater wetland habitat wasn 't attributed to the contamination in the system from the ashdan it was um also recognized the work that was being undertaken at that time by the state government um inquiry looking into the adequacy of current regulations ensuring that best practice management was being undertaken and what the risks associated with inadequate remediation were including community and environmental health impacts so essentially we recommended that that be looked at and the findings would be considered further in the coastal management plan good all right thanks um just as you 're talking through all of those things it 's one of the things that really stands out in this whole this whole issue is the the complexity and the number of inputs and things that have impacts on on the lake system it 's it 's quite extraordinary um so thank you um another one that that certainly came up through the initial concert consultation period and has come up against recent weeks is um and i don 't know to what extent you looked into this specifically in detail is the the rail maintenance facility at kangiangi and are concerned about that so i don 't know if we looked at that at all yeah look i do recall that that was brought up i think there were concerns from memory um about the impacts on water quality from um the construction phase and poor erosion and sediment control and um also on going into the operational phase there were a few other site specific locations that the community had concerned about for asian sediment control and water quality treatment like golf courses and the like um speaking to council unfortunately i didn 't get any um much site-specific information um but speaking to council it was apparent that um that they have limited resources to undertake proactive audits um of things in the catchment such as erosion and sediment control and um you know the private sites the compliance stormwater quality compliance on private sites the only thing that they have the resources to really proactively audit are um the on-site sewage treatment plants not treatment plants household sort of sewage um sewage systems so i think they ordered something like 400 a year and they sort stretched in terms of resources to undertake proactive compliance auditing um despite that they did note and it is important that if the community does see anything affecting water quality in the catchment that they notify council because then council are required to follow up and investigate those possible pollution sources so that is an avenue but i think it really does suggest that our recommendation for our funding mechanism like the stormwater levy um or environmental levy here can be used to to help fund some more proactive um auditing of the catchments in terms of innovation and sediment control practices and stormwater treatment on private sites and the like yeah sure thanks thanks that 's that 's good um uh so i 'm just looking in chat um and i 'm i nice to see people are answering questions amongst yourselves so we are not the only expert i don 't have to shut up so that 's good and um also if any of the other panel members want to jump in at any time on any of this um feel free if there 's anything you you 're if there 's a burning question that you picked up so student i might take the opportunity then to say that there 's a couple of things here the big picture for us uh in this to you know where we 're trying to seek feedback is that the we have uh fairly and squarely pointed our finger at the catchment and the uh issues with water sense of urban design and how they relate to water quality in the catchment and water quality in the lakes and so this is a a fundamental uh i guess underpinning thesis that we look at here that the the poor quality water the the water coil that is generating most of our concerns in the lake is coming from from the catchment and the the surrounding area and this is where if we want to fix it if we want to get ahead of this problem and and noting the large amount of development that the system is under we need we recommend that something needs to be done about that right and this is very important for our the is a way forward we believe there is a way forward to address the key problems in the in the legs but they require us to point our finger away from the entrance and towards the actual source of the problem right and that is a pretty fundamental shift and and you know it 's really important for us i think to make sure that that is um explained well and people understand why we we think that 's so important and enlighten you know what we learned about the process if possible thanks will um which brings me to uh another set of issues which you know certainly um became clear to us as panel through the process and people have been asking some questions about that throughout as well which is the development pressures and a question to you and nicole and anyone else um from that would be how concerned do we think we we should be about future development how big an issue do we think that is um i don 't know what what do you think what do you think nicole and the future does that mean yeah well i i think that that 's that 's a really big pressure um you know i think that the results from from the study showed that development pressures and increasing you know those impervious areas and um the pollutants generated from them can potentially have an impact because it will result in with current planning measures increase pollutant loads to the lakes if planning controls aren 't improved and i think that 's really what we 're suggesting in our report that there are ways that we can improve perhaps um incorporate more planning controls for development and make sure that um that development planning controls are actually implemented on the ground um another another um thing that was mentioned is sometimes i think that those requirements in the development control plan can be contested by developers and perhaps it 's got more force to include it in what 's the plan that sits above it um help me out lep thank you yeah the local environment plan for um yeah so that that it can be enforced by council more easily and not be 's difficult but i think it you know it could be done but it will be challenging um one of the challenges i 'm seeing reflected in the comments that are coming in tonight um in response to your presentation is is really about who 's paying for this we 've talked about as a panel our recommendations a couple of levies and i know that that um residents are under some pressure in the central coast um so it is an issue isn 't it so i wonder what message maybe will or and nicole um [Music] given that people are obviously concerned and about the cost of all these and given that we think the catchment 's really important and given that we 've talked about levies what a message to people around that do you think well there 's a few um broad comments and a few specific comments that we 've put inside our recommendations more broadly we have um i think very explicitly say that council cannot bear the burden for everything that 's um fostered upon them and there is going to need to very difficult for council to manage the extent of um tasks that are put upon them without having ongoing funding for these things so if we in one hand want to have um clean water and we want to have a healthy ecosystem um we need to then manage it where is the port coming from and how can we maintain that so we know that council has done a fair bit of work on installing really innovative what a sense of urban design but that comes at a fairly large cost so how do we manage that in the future so we have said yes it has to be managed or the share of the problem has to be managed by state government as well as by um local government and if the community does so desire to have something similar to what they see elsewhere then we need to find an ongoing way to fund that and that is the sort of things that we see in in most other councils around around the uh the coastline they have environmental levies and you can see what they do mid coast those monies are are well spent and the community supports them they become ongoing things if that is if this is what we want then the community has to decide that that is what they were willing to pay for if not then we have to be you know cognizant that that won 't happen then it it the money does not come from nowhere so i mean we 're trying to balance both those things and what would what we recommend is that we need a a joint vision so we need the community to come on board and say well what is the vision and how we 're going to get there and it 's not it can 't_''_1861.679 be based on on gotcha politics and we can 't try as has happened before of having forums where one group 's young and another group what they should do and everyone has the right answer we 've come into this very much i mean we 're hosting this tonight with the idea that we can put out what we have and have a conversation about it know if any other panel members got anything to add to that if not that 's fine um so there 's a couple comments coming up tonight uh about about those homes and you touched on it nicole you you covered this but um the the actions and the activities in the homes the near shore uh residences the things like sewer seepage um people putting stuff on their gardens you know fertilizers or or poisons or that sort of thing um i don 't know to what extent this we we see this as an issue um in terms of water quality do you want to add anything to what you 've already said about that yeah um i think it it 's definitely an issue what happens um on on private sites especially you know homes surrounding the lakes because as mentioned you know the urban stormwater is a is a real key issue in those areas things like fertilizers are a key pollutant of concern if they 're not used appropriately like they 've got high concentrations of nutrients in there and they 're available nutrients so lake and causing you know issues such as eutrophication which can then you know lead to um dissolved oxygen issues when they decompose and and the ooze issues um so you know whatever you know every bit counts and whatever um individuals can do on on their own sites to to help manage the impacts um of urban stormwater and water quality on the lakes you know every bit counts so um it is important and i think nutrients from fertilizers and um you know i guess long clippings and the like um is important to manage especially in those near shore areas but everywhere really because you consider urban storm water is generally connected to a waterway of some some description so um even if it doesn 't reach to the lake it might just be your local waterway that it affects and i gather um that that things like sewer treatment um sewer control is better than it used to be is that right um i 'm speaking from my ignorance here but uh um yeah what 's the story there i think historically um are you talking lot of um um on-site series trip um on-site households sewage plants before it was largely sewered so that sort of removed some of the catchment pressures there from from septic systems and the like um impacting on water quality in the lakes um so now most of the region is sowed um there i think less pressures from that surrounding the lakes um however we do have aging uh infrastructure for the um sewage systems and and and the like and development pressures which can result in in more wet weather overflows and um i guess that 's a concern that 's sort of something that council needs to manage in um with at a development and they also have that um compliance their auditing system i guess that they go on on site where they know that there is on-site systems and make sure that they 're complying with that license requirements okay um good uh so i 'm trying to keep an eye on questions that are sorry i can 't see the chat i 've been trying to find it i 'm trying to find i i 'm not sure if i stopped sharing my screen i 'd be able to see it but i just maybe have no view of it at all um there 's a comment about uh regeneration of salt marsh and other habitats around the around the lake as a as part of improving runoff quality and water quality to what extent what did we see in around that stuff um to can you add anything there um if you want nicole yeah sure i think a couple of things is too one is that the water quality in the lakes is scheduled that that specifically uh as the discussion for the forum is the day after tomorrow is that right i think that 's thursday night um but i 'm happy to touch on it here and i think you know there 's a couple of things happening i can see a lot of the posts about uh iraq and rack management and yes we 've made some very specific and many comments about rack management within the report and one of the the big findings for us and it think is is important and needs to be brought out is that we are getting a lot of our poor water quality into the system around the edges particularly within the groundwater coming in from uh the local urban area and there 's many sources for that it 's it 's mostly all human based but as that comes in it 's seeping into the face and that is causing that what we 're talking about the who made the comment john made the comment earlier about the algae on the on the foreshore and that is a really you know quite a big issue for the community something that needs to be to be addressed when we say the quality of the water is is not overly poor that 's largely not that air we 're talking about we 're talking about the large area in the middle of the basin which is seemingly disconnected in many ways from that around the foreshore and this is what we wanted to go into some detail with on thursday but it 's that you know originally we had um seagrasses all the system kicked up those seagrasses moved more to the edge we 're very strong on the edge and it created this sort of um what we call bimodal two two different heads of this lake system one on the edges that is full of algae you know high nutrients and a real problem that we got to fix and then another one in the middle that is not anywhere as near as uh as unsightly and poor so it 's managing that and that 's not there is no easy fix for that now the water on the edge is not gonna mix with the inside um with just a simple fix we know that and so that 's where we 've really been focused on what can we do for that and that that 's i don 't know how much you want to talk about here um stuart but certainly on thursday that 's the focus of the discussion yeah yeah yeah sure um so yes if you 're interested come back thursday and and angus will be talking in some detail about that um what else questions that are arising there because you know i 've basically tapped into what we 've picked up in the in the lead up around the catchment specifically um i wonder while we 're looking um well there 's there are some questions about have we talked to council um and i guess you know the bigger question there is where to for for the report what happens next what 's our role do we have a role so you 're probably the best person to to speak to those sorts of questions so as i started off tonight saying that we uh when we submitted our report our expert pattern was formally ceased to exist uh and even tonight we 're here as just a group of of a collective individuals who are interested in getting feedback and expanding this conversation so uh we do not exist as of now and the the all that exists is the report itself so we are i am advocating for these um i guess the actions recommendations to be taken up and there 's a few key ways that can happen one happen uh two is is getting the support of others and having them advocate for change and saying that you know what we 've recommended is is worth trying and going forward with uh and then you know the next stage beyond that is taking it to the individuals and we see that one the things that council is doing now councils all up and down the state now are running is a thing called the coastal management program and this means that council has to um go through what and set what are the priorities and then how they will fund to look after those priorities over the next 10 years and part of that is getting the big scope of what council and the community want to do and work together and then bringing that through this this process that is called the coastal management program towards an outcome and we 're really hoping at every stage of that process that council and state government and federal government will consider the recommendations in our report and we 're advocating for them but we can 't force anything upon as much as we can really offer right now yeah yeah um there are you know a bunch of questions that are probably um pertinent to others who 'll be interested on thursday night about about things around the water and the rack um so we 're probably best to to respond to those when we 've got that group of people in the room and we 've got angus who can speak directly to them um unless there 's anything uh obvious there that any that nicola will you want to jump on to well you know dave has made the point time and time again that uh we need alternative strategies for managing uh the particular edge of the leaks uh i think dave you would notice in our report we were favorable for you know doing these things and having community engagement we we just know that it 's not going to work with just one person doing it right and we want to create a way to upscale that to it to the entire lake and we need a way that um the community can get involvement will then turbocharge everyone to do the right thing and that really has to be led between fisheries and council and others and education as you say so we i think we 've very explicitly commented on that in the in our work um it 's just trying to get it across the entirety of the lake so everyone is engaged in doing the right thing and everyone can can effectively do it we 're all on the same page with that so that 's that 's been something we 've really tried to um well i hope that comes across in the report thanks will um so there 's a comment on the news of those government response uh john we 're still waiting on a formal response so uh we we haven 't had one yet i 'm aware that uh the process is uh ongoing so what 's happening from what i 've been told and i 'll tell you everything i know is that council is and i think people would have seen this they 're putting together their first stage of their scoping reported understand they will identify the actions that they may or may not take up you know based on our recommendations and and that 's completely up to them to do so and then my understanding is once that has happened then the state government will look at what remaining actions are there and they 'll decide what may or not be taken up and and beyond that all i can do is advocate for change in the background and say you know they asked us to do this we 've asked the community we 're hoping that the community feels like you know we 've done uh mostly the right thing here and you know and so let 's roll this out across what it really is for them um that 's one of the downsides of being an independent uh group john is that we are independent so we can completely make our own minds up but then we have no uh control of of uh yeah if they take it up at all yeah yes and i guess my part of the report was was very much advocating has to be in this together because while ever we 're standing apart pointing at each other um you know we will get what we 've got so you know i 'm strongly suggesting that that collectively the community council state government find ways um to do some science together to do some learning together to work out how the lake works together lots of good theories out there but what i 've seen is everyone 's there are many different theories and it 's about testing together and learning together i think is the the future of the lake system got to learn how to do it together um okay and stewart mayor does that my final comment on that is that my biggest fear is that this will just be seen as another report right and we 've we 've tried to write it in a way that it wouldn 't be that that it would be a lie in the sand upon which we would say some very um strong feelings of strong science to support what we 've done and so this is the science we if everyone agrees that the science is supported by the community something should happen and my concern is that this report just gets put on the shelf you know and then we 've all just wasted our time right and so part of these sort of process part of tonight is trying to understand well is it is there not a lot of noise about it because everyone 's happy with it right because they think oh that 's generally okay or is it not a noise because there 's cobalt and a million other things happening and you know we we want to do these things to try to get some feedback so we know where we 're at with you know some of the things we 've been talking about and then if you disagree can we have a conversation about it and um to generate some energy to start for us all to advocate because as will says the panel doesn 't exist anymore so we can 't advocate as a panel we can only advocate as individuals i don 't live there um so why would there 's a couple of questions coming up about the the entrance now tomorrow night is is the session when we 're really going into detail um on that so uh you know i i recommend well it 's treated in some detail in the report absolutely david 's done a good job on that and we will be summarizing that um tomorrow what 's the high level message dave around the the entrance and make sure you 're unmuted the high level message is don 't train it that 's the main that 's the main recommendation don 't think that this is going to be a silver bullet that 's going to fix it it hasn 't worked in other systems and um yeah that 's about it okay good and if you want to dive deeper into that um join us tomorrow dave will be talking to the why that position you know where it comes from and what 's the what 's the research behind it because i know that 's that 's obviously through the consultation process that was the issue uh around which we that and rack and ooze um [Music] so there 's a question there from tony about the amount of sediment i don 't know does the panel have any idea as to the amount of sediment that enters from the catchment and nicole you touched on sediments i think you 're saying erosion is a major source can we say anything more about that um that 's right so um essentially erosion is a major source can be up to double the the catchment loads um council has put in a lot of um [Music] sort of bank stabilization works and rehab works to try and address that in the catchment um i we do have a model conceptual model to sort of estimate the sediment loads um off of the catchment uh but i couldn 't tell you off the top of my head what that says and um i think that you know we could also be um getting further collecting further data to better inform that model as well thanks and i think well angus can talk that there was a bunch of work done uh what how on you know large flows a lot of it does short circuit and go straight to the ocean and it was more of a concern on the moderate to smaller flows where we 're getting the most accumulation of sediment within the lake as it matures um all right i believe help me hear panel members that we 've sort of covered most of the big things that are coming out which are particularly related to catchment as i say there 's a bunch of other questions um uh there have been some some questions nicole both tonight and previously about heavy metals and again we 're back to the um ash dams and the power stations and uh and again this might be an angus water quality thing but is anything coming into what do we know do we know anything about heavy metals from those catchment sources um look um not particularly not specifically um you know catchment metals um can come from urban storm water from various different sources um um well i did see a note about um metals being monitored in lakes uh in i think angus looked at those uh monitoring reports but i think a quick look showed that some of the reports that he referenced that looked at ecological assessments of impacts from power stations were around 1992 i 'm not sure if there 's been anything more recent okay all right so perhaps angus has a has more to add to that now one of the things is that if you have metals you know let 's we also call them cations heavy metals in the water column when they hit salty water they immediately flocculate out right they precipitate is the word and that means they go from being soluble in the water to insoluble in the water which means that they end up building up in the sediments and that process over time means they don 't travel very far but you do get large loads in in the sediment and that typically has bigger issues for animals that eat the sediments or when we disturb the sediments and that is that is the big concern is you know how does that move to the food chain what and and everything else you know sort of associated with that what um there was a comment uh stuart early a couple ago that i just i thought it was about education yes yes value of education and look we we we hope that we emphasize that appropriately enough in the report we also believe education in the in the broader sense of the entire community taking up education within schools that education within the community but an engagement within the community you know one of the things that we really were hoping to come out as a recommendation is for something to be like what is the water quality in the lake today you know on on the abc in the morning they talk about what the uh waves are and you know what is it where the wind 's blowing or rain is going on but can can someone tell you yes the water coin the lake today is seven and the metals are low and the water quality the ph is high and everyone 's uh you know it looks great um we don 't get enough what we can see the lake watercolor is pretty good and so we like to be able to educate both on the processes but also on what 's happening today you know what do we learn what are people doing around the river around the lake banks that are really perceived by the community as being something valuable that we need to share and um what is going the best way of managing the education on rack removal or the entrance or the catchment and how do we think that the catchment is is influencing these are things that we have been trying to encourage and uh i guess disseminate as much as possible all right thanks will um uh so turn uh michael 's asking about sawdust i 've i remember references to sawdust from the power stations and again we might not be the right people um to talk to that i don 't know i don 't know yeah i mean i guess angus and katie were really there yeah they went very deep down these roads and i wouldn 't want to take that from them be we 'll be looking really at what 's going on in in the in the water in the lake and on that foreshore the rack and etc um i will say maybe those two that you know we were limited by information that was available all right so we did not conduct any scientific studies ourselves uh you know and that is a real a real thing so some of these issues we highlighted as we just don 't know because there is no information on it and that is something that we then recommend that if we think it 's important to go out and do that there was a commentary about the second entrance and you know we we gave our our thoughts about the value of the second answers but we were very explicit saying that that we don 't see that there was any and dave can talk this better than anyone but then we didn 't see any particular study that that had uh simulated what happened with the entrance so we didn 't have data we didn 't have numbers in front of that permeated through everything we did if we didn 't know and we thought was important we did recommend that it should be done but we just didn 't want to recommend more studies to do more studies you know that 's that 's not what we 're trying to achieve here if i can just if i can just butt in there for a second stewart sean faucet here sorry my camera and my internet 's really terrible tonight um but what was quite um what was quite pleasing is that there and i guess this goes back to everything that you started this evening with stuart and that is that for the community uh council the gov other levels of government state federal governments together to move forward to protect the lakes we need to do it with um the basis of honesty and trust and and sensible conversations and i guess one of the good things that um our panel has come across is that the lakes have been studied in more depth than most lakes or coastal lagoons anywhere in the world and we have a it 's not like we 're poking in the dark here and we also have the value of hindsight looking at what other things have happened in other lake systems or lagoon systems when people have said for example the water quality is terrible let 's train the entrance and so we can we have real live studies that are going on every single day um lake macquarie illawarra uh you know and that the peel harvey street where we can look back and say well actually that was their response and look how dreadful that has turned out but one of the things that i 'm all quite impressed about is um and negatively impressed about is the distrust between what has been done and the general community 's consensus about what the problems are and i have heard for years uh generally the community saying that council council are covering up stuff council don 't know what they 're doing and council have got no clue well actually um it 's been quite um encouraging to see all the studies that have been done and council have never we do not want the entrance to be trained now find me all the answers to tell me that it doesn 't need to be trained so um i think that that should be encouraging for all of the community to know that the studies that have been done have asked a question and then they 've gone out in search of the answer and they 've come up with an answer and i 'm sure that if the community really were put in the seat of most of those council officers or even the councillors themselves or state government and said okay here 's all the studies at hand what 's your silver bullet and as dave wayne wright said earlier the entrance is not the silver bullet and and i can tell you that it 's an easy fix it 's quick it 's easy it 's relatively cheap compared to actually what needs to go on and that is a whole heap of catchment management um and so it 's it 's it 's great for me as a panel member to sit down and and know really solid and it 's not it 's not covering up anything um and and we can be confident about the recommendations in which we put forward not just to the council not just to the state government but also to the community because this is a community asset that need to uh work together all levels of government and the community work together to make sure that the lakes are protected and maintained for future generations thanks man that 's that 's good um yeah thanks can i i 'm just seeing a a comment here from john how do we get community people to work together to address the issues do we need a sociologist um i guess that 's that 's my area of of work and it 's actually it 's it 's not as hard as we might think i think the fear of working together is greater than than the experience of working together you know once we get in the once we get together with some good process and start listening to each other then magic can happen you know i i know so i think we have to take a step towards each other with some good process and you know council through its cnp is is moving in that direction there 's there 's time this stuff doesn 't have to happen overnight but over time i think we all will get better at having these conversations and certainly that 's what i am continuing to advocate for there 's ways that we can learn with each other and from each other and you know be smart together but we 're fully capable of it and i 've got a lot of confidence that with the right process in place which that 's that 's where the community will get _"

    "text": "uh thank you everyone for joining again for those who came last night thanks for coming back for those who are just joining us for the first time thanks for coming and sparing some of your time on uh on a week night to talk about tugger lakes and the report that we 've delivered this um follows a process where we submitted well we were asked to join a expert panel i was asked to chair a panel and then i was asked to form a panel of experts so we chose the uh the best experts we had in the state they were independent and we got everyone together and looked at how we could address the main issues around toggle lakes doing so we then as i hope many of you be aware we went out to the community of course during covert is always challenging but we did get a lot of feedback and and a lot of that feedback helps drive where we spent the majority of our time doing this work and uh that really got broken down in the end to the working catchment and the catchment work that we spoke about last night with nicole and the entrance which we 'll speak about tonight led by david rainwright who 's here today and uh and then tomorrow the final focus was the water quality itself so apologies for those who heard this last night but the the aim for the conversations we 're having here is really to try to make sure that if there are any questions about our report that we can get that feedback back to us it was some really good feedback last night um and to also let people know where we 're at and to try to close some of the loop of you know we went out we asked you how we tried to take that on board for what we did and then what we did in the report to respond to that um so it was it 's it 's on the chair stuart 's going to facilitate for tonight and you 're a really big part of uh of tonight and how this all goes so we are as an expert panel will the day that we submitted our report which was back in december 31st and this uh from this point forward we have been like like you advocating uh for change and advocating for our recommendations to be taken up but we felt it 's really important to come back together and have this conversation so i 'm happy to open the discussion tonight and i maybe just add that uh so my background i am a professor at the university of new south wales i spend my my life i spent the last 25 years studying estuaries i lead a research team uh in engineering and focused on estrogen engineering and estrogen water quality and watercolor dynamics hydrodynamics hydrology and looking at how these systems work now how they have in the past and how they continue to operate in the future and i 've done a number of these projects looking at systems just like this and then again of course in integral lags i 've had some experience so with that i 'll hand back over to stuart and we 'll start the festivities tonight i might engineer so i 'm trained as a civil engineer and to become a coastal engineer traditionally you do post graduate i 've got a phd in coastal engineering and i 've been working for about 25 years most of that is a consultant and i do a lot of stuff in estuaries that overlaps with will will 's skill set as well but one of the things that i do focus heavily on and my phd was on is coastal entrances so um in coastal engineering funnily enough we 're working a lot with the way that water interacts with pieces of soil now or rocks and uh that 's gonna that 's a lot of the focus of what i 'm talking about tonight oh my my key interest was how is um how does sand move about in the entrance and how does it affect the way that waters get in and out of the lake and so that 's my key area of interest now there 's an underpinning question that we 're looking at answering as part of this and it 's a it 's a like angus who 's going to be speaking tomorrow night and that 's are there changes that we can make that will effectively improve water quality like have it have a significant effect but so much so that it 'd be you know cost effective to to implement those actions as i said i 'm interested a lot in the entrance the overall effect of flushing and also mixing of water in between the different lakes so this lake system uh as everybody here should know um three systems for from south to north that 's uh tugra budgie way and manmora now stuart mentioned the word research uh when he was introducing we didn 't so much do research our effort was mainly a peer review that 's the way that i saw it as part of that you have to assess all of the information that 's out there look at all of the studies that have been done um so we didn 't do new modeling we did i did little bits of analysis here and there just to check up the numbers of what i was how i felt about it but we didn 't so much do new studies new research we weren 't developing new information now we dug back uh historically i i 'm pretty fastidious about a lot of this stuff the first detailed technical more or less modern piece of work that was done on tuggerah lakes is back in 1970 so there was a large study that was done uh during the 1970s it was delivered in 1979 um but it 's a long interest in the intergovernmental panel or something the first of a long list of different panels that have looked at this system um but that 's not to say that we haven 't considered stuff that 's even more historical so i think there 'd be a number of people here that are familiar with the book um tugra lakes way back when that 's something that we uh many of the panel members had a good look through i certainly did i had a look to see what people had said about the entrance in the past and uh so we we 've got uh um you know old reports from fisheries inspectors and that sort of thing that they 're fairly enlightening the other thing and this is where the experience and expertise comes in is we we had a good look at what other systems are in the state similar we 're really looking at comparing apples with apples here so some people might say oh well why can 't we just train it because you know it does such a good job at the brunswick river or uh you know port stephens is really nice and clean why can 't this be nice and clean this is fundamentally a different system than those two systems we are looking at a shallow lake now people will argue about whether you 're going to call it a lake or a lagoon in my point of view i don 't care it 's a shallow water body that 's fairly extensive to me it 's most similar to lake illawarra when i think about the systems that are that are present in new south wales um other similar systems uh lake macquarie it 's a there 's other things like other ones like wallace lake so the kind of similar type of size um same sort of environment tides and waves that they 're exposed to so we have to consider that behaviour too and see what 's happened with those systems after they 've been trained for example so um as i said i 'm an engineer um our terms of reference from what i remember was science focused so engineering 's very much an applied science as a couple of our guests here tonight mentioned it 's all we 're all about solving problems and getting things done providing answers not just providing looking at information and working out new knowledge for new knowledge 's sake we actually want to provide stuff that 's useful and it was mentioned that we get a uh a bad rap because sometimes engineers do things that they 're less useful than they should be and when you 're working in civil engineering and coastal entrances big environmental systems like lakes such as this the potential to do irreversible damage is definitely there okay importantly and uh assigned it 's a bit of a limitation of the work that we 've done we didn 't focus on flooding i 've got a fair amount of expertise in flooding and the way floods are managed in new south wales it comes path of the course when you 're talking about coastal entrances so i 've snuck in a little bit about flooding there but we have to realize and i don 't want to um i don 't want to preempt a study that 's being done in parallel or almost in parallel on behalf of council at the moment by manly hydraulics laboratory which is looking at different ways of managing uh flooding and how the entrance might be managed so the stuff that we 've done we can 't we can 't sort of manage this entrance for a single issue like water quality even though that is what we have been asked to look at water quality when a decision is made about it other things have to be considered we 've got to consider flooding we 've got to consider things like tourism okay 're dealing with the issue of water quality these are the key findings i 've got two slides of key findings enjoy tugboat lakes is a system that is naturally opened and closed uh like many shallow lakes in the new south wales coast um naturally they are what we call icoles for one of a better acronym icole stands for intermittently closed or open lake or lagoon so it 's trying to cover all bases there um it 's a fairly large icon uh compared to a lot that we have on the new south wales coast there are four um much smaller icons to the south of here in the old gosford lga um wambral avoca cochrane and terrigal they 're kind of a different beast in this they close much more frequently when they 're left to their own devices this uh system probably opened or sorry closed completely around 10 times uh in 100 years between 1880 and 1980 so um definitely closed but its tendency is to be open the majority of the time and that 's uh when it 's open it has a has bucked the trend with this because it 's been relatively wide open uh with an entrance flying out through the center of the bar at um right at the entrance to the ocean uh but during normal times there 's a tendency for the uh the the spit on the northern side um we can just see it i don 't know if you can see my screen you can just see it over on the right hand side of this image to grow south and constrain the channel right against the southern side of karagi point now during normal times as well and this is definitely shown in this figure there is a disconnect around the fringe of the lake particularly you see tugra lake here where the water in the middle is not mixing with the water around the sides and that is uh something which uh you know my esteemed colleagues which will probably talk about this more tomorrow night has to do with the barrier of vegetation that develops here the water is kept fairly stagnant around the outside of the lake here when when but you can get conditions like wind or a big flood can actually overcome it and that breaks down and then you get nicer mixing inside the nearshore it becomes a real problem if you 've got for example stormwater discharging right into that area because stormwater contains a lot of nasties and if they are trapped in that area and they don 't get to go anywhere you can end up with a situation that is fairly pure true as i was saying you know winds can actually clear some of this stuff away catchment floods also have the ability to lift up some of the um the detritus that 's around the outside of the lake and uh waves can push it up a lot on adjacent to the shoreline so you can get a deposition of what we call rack around the outsides of the lake the ideal is that that rack is able to wash up onto the foreshore and dry out but unfortunately it doesn 't happen around a lot of areas of the lake they 've modified some of the foreshores and um and um this is not my area of expertise but i 'll give you a bit of a you know precursor to what might be spoken about tomorrow night mixing between the lakes um so the gap at uh tukley um and the one between uh monmour and budgie boy to the north of the budgie voice sand bass that 's quite limited so they 're narrow gaps particularly between monmour and budgie boy that gap between mum more and budgie boy is quite constrained uh it was dredged in the 1960s when the monmouth power station was put in um that was to allow the circulating flow uh you know you 've got an intake for the power station and an outlet and uh that that actually the in intake was from one more and the outlet was into budgie voice needed to be a way of balancing that flow and they dredged the channel through there so the flight could move more effectively talking of the budgie way sand mass the uh information we have from uh studies that have been by done by coastal geomorphologists which is another is that that big sand mess was is the what we call a an old tidal delta and there was once an entrance directly to the ocean from buchi boy um there 's a bit written in the report about that and where it might have sat and that type of thing that people can can read about if they 're interested um but all of the information points to that not having been the case for the last fifteen hundred to two thousand years this is a direct open continuously open entrance between the ocean and budgie roy lake there are plenty of uh sort of eyewitness of the accounts that we 've come up against that have said that uh from time to time particularly um say in the first half of last century there was over-topping waves over the barrier between the ocean at budgie boy lake so that 's something that has happened but is the best knowledge that we can get is there 's not been a permanent entrance that could be sustained for a long period of time for the last 1500 to 2000 lot of people have looked at training the entrance in the last 40 years um can i just ask by training the entrance some of us myself included aren 't always clear about what that means so training the okay training the entrance has to do with building breakwaters okay so most effectively you do it with twin breakwaters one on each side in new south wales the classic approach has been to build those two walls between 100 and 150 meters apart the spacing between the breakwaters is very important you need to make sure that when the tide is ebbing so when the tide is flowing out of the lake it 's strong enough to clear sand from the entrance otherwise sand obviously can move back in and it will clog up again so there are constraints on how wide you can put training walls apart uh combine also combined with training you 'll often have internal walls which join to the breakwaters and uh strictly speaking they are called training walls um so these are present say if you know the system to the north if you uh breakwaters at lake macquarie and inside the blacksmith 's breakwater which is the northern one there is a long training wall that stretches between there and the bridge at swansea so that 's uh that 's what the idea of training is the intention is to make sure that you keep the channel at a particular location and that the channel remains clear of sand and doesn 't shallow up um training entrances to icols is really problematic particularly these large ones okay and many studies have looked into this some of them have been modeling studies well most of them have actually had some aspect of modelling some of them have been based on uh what has happened in other locations what 's our experience like in new south wales um some of them have gone included dredging so we 've looked at training and also dredging so if we dredge to minus two and a half meters this is what the impact 's going to be if we dredge to minus three if we dredge to minus six so that 's six meters below mean sea level people that have written these reads like a who 's who of coastal engineers that have been in practice in new south wales over the last 30 to 40 years now overwhelmingly and it 's not 100 everybody 's saying the same thing but there is an overwhelming tendency in these reports to say no the reason is the reasons they give is that it 's expensive the positive impacts that people talk about in terms of getting better tidal exchange and therefore better mixing of water quality are not really there so we might be looking at increasing from say one to two percent of the exchange on each title cycle to three to four percent um and doubling it compared the volume that is actually moving in and out of the entrance compared to what actually flows into the catchment from into the lake from the catchment it 's it 's much smaller than that so it 's indicates that the most important thing that is balancing water here in this system is what 's flying in from the catchment even if we doubled the exchange that 's it 's not going to have that big big an impact on the overall mixing the other thing is that negative impacts are quite poorly understood and really it 's only in the last uh say 15 to 20 years that we have seen the long-term impacts of training of systems like wallace lake um that 's not entirely true we 've known about problems at lake macquarie for a long time lake macquarie has a long history of sediment moving for shores eroding that sort of thing so there 's a real concern that we 're going to enter into a system of runaway scour the most recent system that has been trained in the along the new south wales coast is lake illawarra very similar reasons that have been put forward here for uh potentially training tugra lakes and that is that they had an issue with weed uh they thought there was an issue with water quality and if they trained the entrance that it would resolve those problems now what they have measured is that the water quality response is not large except in the immediate a ramp this is in lakelaware there has been an improvement in the immediate entrance channel you get clearer water people appreciate that so there is a socio-economic benefit but when we 're talking about pure water quality say when science scientists talk about water quality and the ecological benefits clarity is not necessarily that important for us so we have to realize if we 're going to go forward with something like training we have to realize that the benefits those benefits are clarity it 's the way that it look it 's it 's an aesthetic benefit now um lake illawarra is a really dramatic example it 's very similar to tugboat lakes in terms of its shape and its size and its depth you have a look at the entrance if you jump on google earth or something you will see how similar it looks in terms of the shape and the way that the the shoreline is is angled the entrance channel is angled and they are having tremendous problems there with runaway scour undermining of caravan parks loss of sea grass activation of the channel this is what raises the largest concern in my mind about training this entrance can you just dave explain a little more about runaway scour what exactly uh do you mean when you say that so runaway scour is when we if you train the entrance and you open it up it actually exposes the area inside the entrance to more tidal energy normally a lot of the tide is lost so there 's some you know you 've got big tides in the ocean and small tides in the lake now what happens is along the channel that tide range gets what we call attenuated it gets smaller and smaller with systems like we have now here at tugra lakes a lot of that loss occurs right at the entrance so right where the the sand barrier comes down where it 's constrained across the rock platform and that sort of thing um so if we remove that the amount of attenuation of tide energy that you have at that location where the barrier is then there 's more tight energy that starts to impact further inside the entrance and out they start to move sand and the dominant way it moves that is an upstream direction so you start getting the channel deepening of its own accord without dredging in this case and it also starts to meander backwards and forwards across the entrance so it 'll go northwards and southwards and it starts to erode against the foreshores and that 's uh that is an ongoing problem at lake macquarie along swansea channel at the moment sand moving up not only it interferes with navigation so you 've got this strange sort of scenario where you 've got sand continually moving upstream interfering with navigation but at the same time it 's eroding foreshores so it 's getting deeper and deeper and eroding some parts but then there are areas that are shoaling and that runaway scour issue is something that will potentially last hundreds of years and create problems for a you know a long time into the future the situation at lake macquarie where the uh entrance breakwaters were built in the late 1880s we are still seeing problems there that are very difficult to a few years ago um that is a result of the opening of the entrance and people not understanding that process very difficult to analyse understand exactly what 's going when it gets into that stage some people have spoken about potentially having a single breakwater either on the southern side or the northern side of the entrance a long story short is that that has a fairly poor record of being successful in new south wales there are examples uh they actually tried to train lake illawarra in the early 2000s with a single breakwater along the southern side it closed within about a year so they um started to point the finger at the single breakwater as being a cause for the lake closing and subsequently they had to build a second one and now we 've got the situation down there which we hope to avoid here at tugger or at least i do um the other thing that we looked at because i 'll see it talking about uh entrances to the ocean and that sort of thing is the uh the potential for a second undertaking a peer review of the uh studies that have been done in the past and i found that in a lot of studies dating back to the 1970s you know coming forward to 2010 there are often studies that said that they had modeled or analyzed the issue of putting in a second entrance at budgie way but in reality i couldn 't find any evidence that they had done much at all and i find that a bit concerning um i i do think that we need to look at that a bit closer so that we understand what the parameters are around that i 'm not necessarily saying that we can get something to work here in fact it will certainly be a massive uh intervention into the system if we were going to try to do something but um i just find it a bit uh unacceptable that over so many years people have just sort of written it off without really giving it proper thought so that 's one of the recommendations that is actually going to be carried forward from well i hope we officially exist anymore so uh in summary these are the recommendations that have come out of the sectional entrances the existing training and extensive dredging like that 's dredging over and above what council has been doing for the last 30 years i don 't recommend that that be considered further it has been analyzed to death um sorry we might get we might get new information or a better understanding or new techniques or technology that might help now that might make us think well yeah we can look at it again but for the time being i don 't think that there is much value in rehashing this i know that people are a bit fatigued with studies on this so i i think it 's uh you know a bit disingenuous to be saying yeah we need another study to look at this when we 've had six or seven that have already uh come up with an answer try to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different answer i don 't i don 't advocate that this is uh there 's an issue of new south wales there 's a the issue of tidal inundation and how much we 're going to get around the fringes of the lake and how that might change if and as sea levels rise that is something that really needs to be grappled before we can even start talking about management of the entrance and increasing title ranges in the entrance or increasing you know if you open up an entrance a second entrance or you make an entrance bigger then you start exposing areas around the fringes of the lakes to higher tides and uh that actually adds on top of the the flood risk that is present around the fringes of the lake so that has to be understood and that 's what the intention of this second recommendation is the dredging that has gone on over the last uh since 93 so we 're looking at more than 25 years that they dredged the entrance um we 're recommending that it continue in the short term but the issue that i 'm i 've found in talking to a number of people that have been obscured what the reason for doing that uh dredging is when we 've looked at it it appears that the largest benefit that you get out of dredging the entrance is that it actually lets some of the ocean water the clearer ocean water get in more easily to the uh the area along um the southern part just inside the entrance so where there 's that focal area where people go and feed the pelicans and that sort of thing um so there 's a scenic and an aesthetic benefit to that and that may have uh value for tourism for socioeconomic reasons that it 's definitely worthwhile having a look at so that we understand what the scale of those benefits might be um one of the first recommendations as part of number three that we we considered was to install a water level recorder that has happened so uh the new south wales government has installed a water level recorder for council uh just downstream of the bridge now with that we 're going to be able to much better have a look at how effective it that area downstream of the bridge uh and as i said socioeconomics that 's that 's a suggestion as well we need to understand how much value there is whether it 's of the benefit to the business in that area um once that 's done then we need to have a good hard look at it and work out whether that dredging needs to continue is it worthwhile um do we really understand why we 're doing it and are the do the benefits outweigh the costs that 's the line short of it finally and this is in response to um seeming lack of detailed analysis of um you know you know formal analysis i 'm talking about here from people uh you know professional engineers and scientists that look into this sort of thing all the time i think there needs to be a bit of an open-minded study into what can be done around the budgie war in budgee voice sand mass and council is in the process of developing a coastal management program and that 's something that you know even though we as a a lot of consultation to make sure that we understand what what 's going on and how people feel about things that coastal management program also has to take that approach so um it 's it 's a it 's a genuine part of the coastal management program that there 's a vision that 's set that meets the needs of the community and um i think that as part of that i i would recommend that a study does look into what sort of options might be available around budgie boy and that 's where i 'm going to end and i 'm i 'm ready to take questions if you have any stuart yeah sure thanks david and i see that questions are coming into chat so that 's good keep those questions coming i 'm just gonna i 've got a summary here of um things that have come in over the last few days and weeks and again i 'll i 'll pick um you know try and capture all the sentiments in all of those so um there seems to be i i think i in any time as well um about what does an open entrance mean what do we mean when we say an open entrance no it seems that people have different ideas about that dave i don 't know if you 've got an opinion about um you know is open open or is there some nuance around that what does what does open mean to you i mean is what does that question mean to you so naturally this thing i mean open could mean anything it could be anything from a 400 meter wide channel to a uh to the 35 or 25 meter wide channel against the southern side so i if everybody can see my slide there we 've got two examples of an entrance that is open the one on the left hand side is a it 's towards the you know we 're looking at uh very dry drought-like conditions at the end of 2018 and the the entrance uh burn has sort of gone right south to to butt against that rock platform which is a very common location for it to end up sorry 2020 february 2020 since that flood it 's uh remained even you know open and more located towards the center of the uh the channel here so these are two examples of a naturally open channel um during floods it 's been reported that um we can actually get a channel that 's up to 400 meters wide spread across the entrance here now a permanently open entrance would be something that 's trained so often when we talk about opening up the entrance and we 're talking about works that have to be taken on board to do that we 're talking about putting in break like i just described and in new south wales they 'd typically be somewhere between 100 and 150 meters apart in it can go you know it can go even even um or even further we can talk about dredging as well to open it up more so yep there 's no no absolute definition of open but there are limitations on what we can do if we 're going to intervene in this is in an engineering manner and i would know sweet spot might be about 120 meters but between them all right good thanks um other issues which which emerged both through last year and and more recently is is questions about um sea level rise and and it 's it 's not always obvious to people to me to others about the connection between that and and flooding in the lake now i know we didn 't look at flooding as a panel but i just wondered if you could explain that connection a little a little more yeah okay so i think this harkens back to what i was talking about with flood risk so let 's forget about sea level rise for a second okay and talk about what happens when the entrance is open when the entrance is open larger and so what you do is you um you 're more or less increasing the tidal range inside the uh inside the lake itself so most of the scenarios that have been looked at by previous researchers various breakwaters various configurations for dredging they will result in a tidal range in the lake that is um when it 's a situation like we 've got on the left hand side here where it 's closure is almost imminent you 'd be lucky to get two centimeters of tide range inside the the lake now that extra sick you know uh five centimeters or whatever on top so not that much it 's a four or five centimeters on top of the the uh tide range on the high tide inside the lake actually exposes properties around the fringes of the lake to a higher higher flood risk when we add that onto potential sea level rise it 's beyond potential now it 's happening we don 't know exactly when and how much but it 's happening um when you add that on top of sea level rise it exacerbates the issue so i have written in the report i 've spoken about how that that um you 're basically adding sea level rise and then you 're also you 're giving people a double whammy by um increasing the tide range inside the um inside the inside the lakes um yeah okay so the go in and out and the bigger impact in the lake levels yeah so it 's not huge it 's only a few a few centimeters but that can be significant to somebody whose property is very flat and low lying and it 's sitting around the fringes so i might just add in here so there 's there 's a lot of discussion about the tide and i and i want people to recognize that the tide is a very complicated thing uh and david 's making a lot of comments about moon to moon and yes there 's difference between what we call spring and neap tides and we do get spring tides when they form at the with the full moons and we get neptides in between in fact the tide is actually driven by many many components and we can do title constituent analysis that tells us all the things that drive the tide and there 's there 's many things but it 's also important to know that in a big shallow lake like this when you see the water going up and down it the water up it 's often because the ocean is creating a barrier right and the bar as the ocean levels go up there 's no way for the lake water to get out so it builds up with it right but it 's not water rushing in filling the hole and completely um filling the whole area and it 's that there 's water coming into the lake and they rise together and then they fall together right and they rise together and fall together and that process is often confusing because people see the lake rising and they think oh it must be from the ocean level rushing in and filling the whole lake up with water and that 's often just not the case and and that 's a a very well known and established um process so dave i look forward to changing my mind we we don 't see anything particularly unique about the tides here um and this is uh what we look at quite a bit so we have spent a lot of time looking at this okay um you know it 's wayne right of um the one to two percent exchange currently uh again i i i 've seen over the past 12 months some questioning of that and and you know this this seems to be at least in part behind the sense that if we opened up the channel we would get more flushing and the water would be better it 's a perfectly understandable hypothesis but i think what what you 're saying is it 's a small amount of water so how some some people are questioning that one to two percent how confident are we in the one to two percent how how well do we know that figure i i 'm very confident with that figure actually i mean a lot of people have uh reported it but i 've done it 's quite an easy calculation once you know what the volume of the lake is and other people have worked that out and you just need to work out you just need to measure how much the lake 's going up and down and then understand what the surface area of the lake two percent uh when you 've got a uh tide range of about three centimeters inside toggle lakes that 's that 's about it that 's about a one and a half percent so one to two percent is pretty much on the money when it 's you know in this situation on the left hand side here that i 've got in that these figures when it 's more open you might get up to that seven and a half maybe up to ten centimeters this is the daily tide now i don 't have access to the chat but um um i i imagine it 's dave eaton that 's uh you know talking about the um the fortnightly tides spring nape cycle um that 's that 's a different thing again and that the thing is that one happens very gradually as well it takes uh 14 days um [Music] so the important one is the one that 's happening on a you know twice a day one or two percent of exchange so if you stop sharing your screen you 'll be able to follow the come back to your your pictures that might make life a little easier for you um all right thanks did we have we found [Music] um you know again people are saying it 's sort of the same question but in a different way that if we dredge uh that will improve water quality in the lakes um have you in your reviews of studies was there anything supporting that did you is that a something that 's emerged so yeah some of the big dredging dredging examples that i looked at um well i didn 't look at them i 'm reporting on what other people have done and the studies are generally robust they 're not perfect but um i believe the conclusions are pretty good we might get an uh you know an improvement of say two to three centimeters to something like seven and a half centimeters it 's around about um sorry yeah sorry it 's about a doubling maybe of the tidal range inside the lake of course that 's more ocean water getting in um but when i 've spoken to other people the issues around the outside of the you know the fringes of the lake they 're saying that 's just not enough to really have a big impact on the um on the problems that you see around the fringes of the lake okay all right thank you um the area has there 's been a couple of big floods just quite recently and the timing for our um review was uh was quite interesting given that what happened in february last year and again we didn 't look at flooding wasn 't really part of our our gig but uh is there anything more you can say or perhaps will about the this connection between what happens at the entrance and rain you know flooding from rain um because it 's obviously quite a dynamic system is there anything more we can say just about those dynamics because you know it 's that 's a point of contention for people out there understandably floods are a problem i might i might feel this first so i mean the um what happens to the entrance when the um when it held back in in the lake because the the entrance is a is a natural constraint over time the entrance channel scales it gets larger and it gets wider um so there are reported in in the literature i don 't know how well this has been examined that it can get to 300 and 400 to 400 meters wide so almost spanning you know a large distance across that entrance compartment and of course when it 's more open more tides can come in but because um you know the ebb tides are quite weak there is a tendency tendency when the entrance is very wide like that for sand to wash back in so we have this process where it 's open after a flood but typically notwithstanding what 's happened in the last couple of years sand tends to wash back in very quickly and you get this process where the the the entrance becomes constrained again there 's lots of shoals moving upstream the tide currents weaken further um and the natural coastal processes will build that barrier so that extends across the entrance down towards left hand side here and that 's where we 've got very sort of limited tides inside the lakes when it gets like that that 's the process that gets followed it might close completely as it has historically um in which case a flood is needed to break it out again okay will do you want to add anything to that i guess i i guess um yeah what what dave is is talking about it is the natural process of opening and closing of these lagoons that happens you know on 70 80 the lagoons in new south wales uh constantly every every season as we go open and closed so the uh it it gets wet it opens up and then the ocean closes it and this wouldn 't matter if there was one entrance or two entrances uh and when we 've seen there 's a second entrance that robs peter to pay paul right so typically you look at somewhere like the shellhaven or the manning where we have occasionally two entrances they 're usually closed very quickly because they don 't there 's no to push sand into these entrances now in terms of the flooding the the uh process is that yes you we can 't have a second entrance the second entrance can be a little bit open and we can get wash over and wash over is a different thing than an open entrance and i think that 's one of the things we 've been very careful of that occasionally getting water washing over an entrance is different than having a big wide open entrance that encourages exchange um and then i guess the other thing is about flooding right so i think we 've time and time again been told that we this study did not look at explicitly how to manage for flooding uh we have been looked at how we manage for water quality so if there has a an issue with um why should you open up the entrance for water quality we 'd say well it 's not going to make much of a difference for water quality it may make a difference for what a clarity and what a clarity may be enough for but that 's not water quality right the water quality can still be quite um appropriate for an estuary and so then the the next case is well how do we deal with water quality and the water quality which we 're going to talk tomorrow partly is driven by what 's coming off the catchment as we said last night what 's coming of the groundwater and if we were to have a very large open entrance the water standing water level would fall and that would bring more of the groundwater into the system and so we 're concerned that if we were to encourage more groundwater to come into the system we 'd need to have a way to manage more nutrients coming into the system as well and so there 's a point can i just be these are there a cascade of issues yeah yeah um because people might have picked up that there 's a you know inconsistency with some stuff i 've been saying before about higher tides getting higher okay when you 're talking about the standing water level there you 're this just goes to the complexity you think tides are really easy well some people do it is it it can be incredibly complex it is yeah um so again there 's a bunch of questions coming in that a really water quality questions and tomorrow night is the is the form when we 've got angus on board who 's the is the person ready to talk about that um i think if i paraphrase and correct me if i 'm wrong that in terms of the entrance and water quality there 's not sufficient water coming in and out of an entrance even work to be trained to make an enormous difference on water quality bottom line is that that fair to say yes okay all right so again it 's it 's it 's do we fix the end of the pipe and or do we try to fix the problem at the source and that 's the way we were talking about yesterday last night was um if the source of the brad water quality that we 're dealing with is coming from the catchment or something that can be fixed that 's something that should be addressed and with the extra tens of thousands of houses coming in something that should be a priority right something that we should focus on is that if they 're going to build another 40 000 houses we should make sure they 're done well and that we don 't keep adding to the problem versus turning and focusing our attention on something that even if we spend a hundred million dollars on we 'll only get a small improvement if any and and the many many studies that dave 's looked at highlight that they don 't really um aren 't really going to make much of a difference in terms of water quality yeah and again there 's a bunch of questions coming about about flooding and we specifically um didn 't really look at that in detail did we so it 's a bit hard for us to to respond to some of those um there 's i just say um stuart my understanding is that we 've got this parallel study going on with manly and i believe the times management program they 'll be looking at um bringing our work and the work that is being done in parallel together to develop an entrance management strategy that includes both water quality and flooding i can 't_''_3182.4 say for certain but i think that might be the case [Music] let me just come to some of the other questions i 've i 've seen coming in on a slightly different topic including about um government response uh question to us will is what has been the government 's response to our recommendations so far what have we heard what we know we 're probably best placed to answer that the government response has been that they accepted our report that was the first task they 've accepted a report they 've taken the report on board they did not alter in any way our report after we provided it to them so the report that we provided was the port that was released i 'm aware from the from the information i 've been given that the the governments are considering what their response will up uh i understand that uh many of them fall naturally within the coastal management program that is underway now by council for the region and so that some of these may be addressed by council and we hope to hear from that as the the process moves forward um and then ideally once council has acknowledged what they will or will not uh plan to take on then the state government will also do the same um i am as a as a local citizen uh also trying to encourage that to happen and i i 'd encourage others to do the same one of the things the reason we 're having this conversation tonight is is so that we can uh explain what we were thinking and get it out there so people will hopefully understand where we 're coming from and then try to go the next step of encouraging change themselves we just what we see that isn 't working in this community has been a lot of people pointing fingers at each other and you know the the slinging matches that have happened that haven _''_3315.359 for anybody so what happens is when two people yell at each other then they both go quiet and don 't talk to each other and that 's exactly what we 're we 're trying to get over uh and i understand the frustrations we understand frustrations and that 's why one of our recommendations i think people be aware was that we thought there was an opportunity to bring in a a central party and that you know that as someone independent that could try to bring the groups together and get things moving in the right in the right way in the right position so that we could actually start having some change happen and uh and the final thing i 'll say is that we 're very aware that a huge burden has been placed on the council to do everything with the lake with really no income to manage it and so we 've been uh encouraging and make recommendations in our report that the burden of trying to fund what 's needed to be done in here has to be shared across government and it money to do what are the expectations by the community and that doesn 't seem to getting better anytime soon and hence as we talked about last night the couple of recommendations about um stormwater levy and an environment levy wasn 't there so as part of part of that picture um so dave and will if there 's any questions there that are jumping out at you uh david there 's a question here which tony 's been asking about um studying the why on council days about a second channel which i think is is in the entrance zone not quite sure what that question means but i don 't know if that means anything did you do you ever come across anything about um a study uh in those days that um 1986 you know second channel um being dredged any impact is that bringing any bills no no i 'm not aware of that yeah okay so we are not i 'm not saying it doesn 't exist i um but you know there 's limitations to to what you can do and if it 's council archives is next to you know it won 't get uncovered easily um all right i might take there 's one here from tony and he makes a comment about at what point in time of the evolutionary journey does the expert panel wish to have the legs maintained and you know i 'm not sure he 's being facetious or not but the there is no point at which the lakes are maintained you know the the issue we have is private property right so the private property rights are what people are concerned about and how those private property rights are impacted is what drives the flood study right these are the issues that become the the governmental decision making so yes and you know 7500 is one way to go if you went 25 000 years back they were um yeah 120 meters lower so we 're very aware of of the geomorphology and the geology of the region but i don 't i don 't think any of us would want to maintain them at some geological point in history what we want to do as possible and and that is um you know i guess not forced to be one way or the other and just doesn 't waste resources so what is the best way for um for the system to be managed and that 's got to be an adaptive adaptive management is it just seems to make sense for me you know the dredging work that dave talked about said you may want to continue dredging but at least talk to the community about why why are you doing it why are you spending this money doing it and let 's have a go for what you actually wanted to achieve and if it 's not achieving that why is the community paying for that money you know so what is it and let 's let 's have us to me that makes common sense right someone 's paying for that is it achieving what you want and if not let 's have a chat about it yeah in in my work i 've worked on a number of coastal systems like macquarie and others and they are the classic wicked systems and it 's really challenging to find the answer to to all of these questions to any of these questions they 're full of trade-offs and as you 've pointed out dave a solution such as training um can can be a problem in disguise can 't it with some future impacts so they are really complex things that 's certainly my time on the panel it 's that 's that 's been a you know obvious they are really complex and challenging systems to manage and there is no such thing as a simple simple answer to any of these things um yeah i think i saw some comments last night about um the level of understanding of the system and um the fact that we you know we don 't understand these things perfectly um and it 's kind of it 's a bit of a two-edged sword like how you can study it to death and stop getting any further but you 're just wasting money and not spending time trying to resolve the problems at some point um we 've got to say well it to accept that we 're not going to understand these systems perfectly we 've got to use the best information that we 've got and move forward with it um it 's difficult science doesn 't necessarily tell you exactly what you have to do and again i 'll heart to uh this is what you know engineers this is what we 're trying to actually balance to try to pull all these things like economics and social stuff and physics and whether we want to put in an engineered solution to solve a problem i kind of see us as being having a role of helping make decisions to get the information together that helps to make decisions i i think most people would agree it 's not desirable to just keep studying over and over and over again study after study yeah indeed and i think that 's part of my part of the report the recommendations i was making about working with the community on resolving some of these things a more collaborative approach than perhaps has been visible to date so learning together um finding out see a key part of the future yeah let 's do it i 'll also add you know so i 've done something very similar to this project on in the shell haven they 've got two engines there shelvin heads community really wants that entrance open and they felt well and truly that it should be open based on water quality what they what they really wanted was it to be on water clarity so we looked at it and the water the water uh quality was actually okay um not just similar to the great expanse of the middle of the lake in in togo um but the quality the clarity was this is and was still not what they want for tourism and so that 's a different argument right if you want if the community and the value of that makes sense and you want to drive that and we should spend 100 million dollars because it brings in enough money to make it worthwhile then that 's a different argument then we should do it to make the water quality better we would have concerns that and you know like you 've seen in liquid war and other places um but you know you can just keep engineering making more and more uh brick walls around the place but you know for our points the issue of the quality of the water is really focused on the edge and that 's where we should try to fix it and that 's largely the the um the ground we 'll be covering tomorrow in um in in tomorrow 's forum so uh you know if you 're interested join that one as well um so folks i 'm just i 'm conscious of the time we 're sort of drawing to a close um i 'm trying to find questions that we haven 't sort of broadly covered without going to every question because again the ones that are on flooding we can sort of take them on notice really to to an extent uh stuart i just clarified so the this article from 86 about the second channel was at the entrance um the way the question was posed before was suggesting from what i the in another leg it was two channels at the actual main entrance yeah right good um yeah yes and there 's a last question there um are people more concerned with the water 's appearance or health of the lakes i think it 's depends who you ask that would be my sense we got input on on all of the above um so i don 't think it 's very hard to say more all of these things are important to people that 's that would be my experience um anything else dave or will that 's leaping out at you is something we can usefully respond to i think i um i saw something pop up about uh 40 000 houses coming into the catchment i think i 'd like to highlight that it 's a really really important thing um it was um [Music] you know i was spoken about a lot last uh last night and look we 've got an opportunity here right to make sure that we um we 've got an opportunity to make sure that it 's done right okay so it 's subdivided and built has as little impact as possible on water quality in the lake i mean that 's that 's just it 's kind of a no-brainer it 's going to cost developers more money that 's the way it is but there 's got to be a way to do it that isn 't going to you know stuff the lake up for everybody else gary grace too yeah yeah i mean i really wish that we had the passion for an open entrance was the same as the passion for good quality water coming off the catchment and there was a comment before about um pulling water out of the system and the impacts of that my understanding is that there is a range of water sharing plans being undertaken for coastal new south wales i 've been involved in a few of them and where they are looking at the impact of any of that happening so that as water extraction and water licensing is being looked at it 's it 's the biggest issue really in terms of the what it 's doing it 's it 's in the movement of salinity so uh we can have salt water where we don 't have oceanic water if because what happens is salt travels diffusion is what it 's called salt travels in to where the to a low level uh concentration and so salt will move up if there 's no water pushing it out if there 's no advection pushing it out and so we can get salt in places that wouldn 't actually have salt by removing some of the water upstream and that 's a big issue in estuaries we 've got a huge study looking at this in the hunter right now because of that that very issue and and so that to me is probably the the one of the more important steps looking forward is how does uh that get looked at and analyzed and you know that should then be setting the extraction limits and licenses good thanks there 's a question also someone picked up on our recommendation for task force and um what does that mean what 's our sense of the governance of and i know you 've kind of got some opinions about about these things about that how we might manage this system going forward uh well we 're very explicit in our recommendations in the in the report we said that we thought a uh a a panel local type panel something similar to what the head of lake quarry which from our consultation with many many people they were very happy with how that rolled out and what they achieved with that sort of a panel a really stop gap measure to try to draw a line in the sand get people together get a third party in there to get people talking stop the yelling at each other and and start trying to work out with what does everyone really want to achieve here and what 's feasible by doing so and and we 've also were explicit in saying that we felt it should be funded by the state government um that the state government it 's temporary it 's only a short-term thing but there are many of these i think wambral has has another one have it but the state government is the one who 's who 's saying we need to take 40 000 houses into the catchment um so i think there 's a load sharing that that seems reasonable from where we sit that would make sense that they would fund that and um and then that would also provide an independent party to look into the things that councils doing with their water sensitive urban design plans and their uh dcps and and local environmental plans and make sure they 're fit for purpose for what the community wants to achieve within the lake um so i don 't know folks how are we traveling it 's quarter past days i definitely want us out of here in the next few minutes so um i might start to wrap up and uh just want to say thanks for your time and input and again we 've got one more tomorrow night so you can find the recording of last night 's on facebook we 'll we 'll do the same here with with your permission unless i hear otherwise that 's recorded too so if anyone wants a a copy of that or any access to that um could make that happen but uh otherwise um thanks for your thanks for your interest tonight and join us again tomorrow night will you want to add anything oh just uh i guess a final thank you as well stu i mean we we are trying uh to explain some of the thoughts that we have in driving a 400 plus page report in a short period of time um we as i think we said last night we we we 've done this on our own accord that we want we feel an obligation to do this to explain what we 've done um we 're not government people and so we 're purely taking like you taking time out of our night to try to bring this thought thought together and explain what 's in there they i will say that we have written a summary report that 's a short sort of 15 20 page document with lots of so this is the 500 page report brought down to a very soon for people in this forum i imagine you 're probably interested in some other details so hope that was useful and uh you know we 'll be back here tomorrow night thanks again for coming _"

    "text": "hey i 'm ashley from central coast council and i 'd love to share with you um our progress as we 're embarking on a journey to develop new coastal management programs for all of our really important waterways here on the central coast i feel like you might be wondering why we 're developing these new coastal management programs and that 's a really good question so on the one hand we have to we have no choice in 2016 the new south wales government introduced a new framework which aims to enhance the ecologically sustainable management of our waterways as well as to enhance the social and cultural and economic wellbeing of everyone in new south wales so that includes the 2016 coastal management act as well as a document called the coastal management manual and together these two documents um include both the mandatory requirements as well as a step-by-step guideline of how we as council can prepare our new coastal management programs but also on the other hand this is something that we really actually want to do our waterways are such an important feature on revise the long-term strategy for managing our waterways in a coordinated fashion this process gives us the opportunity to update our management practices to ensure that they align with the ever-evolving scientific understandings of our environment and also to engage with our community in a really collaborative fashion as we embark on this journey together here on the central coast there are six existing management plans that will be replaced once the new management plans are finished and certified and i really want to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that while we 're working really hard to develop the new coastal management programs we 're also continuing to work really hard to deliver on the existing programs and as far as funding goes many of the programs as part of the existing plan are funded by external grants from state and federal government i 've put together this little map and it shows the areas that are going to be covered by our four new coastal management programs and of these central coast council have responsibility for two of them the tugra lakes and the open coast and and we 're partners in these multi-council collaborations for the other two so for lake macquarie and for the hawkesbury nepean area which does also include our brisbane waters area i should backtrack here because you might be wondering what is a coastal management program and that 's also a really good question essentially it 's a certified document that sets out the long-term strategy for the management of a particular coastal zone area so it identifies the coastal management issues in that area and the actions required to address those issues and how and when those actions will be implemented once the document has been certified and then each of the councils involved in those areas are responsible for implementing those actions and it 's our role as council to identify the costs associated with each of those management programs and to propose different cost sharing arrangements and viable funding mechanisms to ensure that we can deliver on those actions now you 'll be pleased to know that there are lots of opportunities for external grant funding both from state and federal programs including the new south wales government program which provides funding for both the preparation and the implementation parts of the development of these new coastal management programs i do have some really exciting news it has just been announced that our funding submission was successful so we are going to receive just under a million dollars for the development part of our new coastal management plans both for the tugra lakes estuary and for our open coast and coastal lagoons this funding is so greatly appreciated because it 's going to be of major benefit to allow us to do the really important work that we 're doing to ensure the health and resilience of these really important waterways the process of developing the coastal management programs is quite long and detailed we are going to use this opportunity to establish a clear shared vision for what we all want the future to look like and this is going to involve really close collaboration with you so all of our community and our partners the development of the plans going to take into consideration lots of different factors as well like the ecological health coastal threats between environmental and social and economic outcomes for our region so as you can see this is a five stage process the first stage is called the scoping study and this identifies things like the vision and objectives and it maps out a forward plan to gather sufficient information to establish a really effective and implementable program which will then be implemented in stage five the second stage is conducting the detailed studies that were identified in the first stage to fill the knowledge gaps and to identify and analyze and evaluate all the different risks and opportunities and vulnerabilities so that in the third stage when we are actually identifying and evaluating the management options that these are really evidence-based and they consider the feasibility and the viability as well as the acceptability to the community so that we can put together a really nice business plan the fourth stage is when the actual coastal management document is prepared and then it 's exhibited as draft along with any relevant planning documents um so that you can provide feedback and that feedback is used to review the plan which the final stage is where the fun happens so this is when we 're going to implement actions in a really collaborative way with our partners and we 'll use monitoring indicators and trigger points to evaluate them and update the program as needed and of course we 're going to report back um to our partners and to the community as a really important part of this phase so where are we at now well i 'm very pleased to announce that the scoping studies which is phase one for all four of our management programs are now complete and these are all available for you to download from our website which is your voice our coast these studies have been informed by the values and and the visions that we 've gathered from all of the community consultation that we 've done so far so thank you to everyone who was involved in contributing we had over 3900 people visit that site and over 1 100 people complete our survey which is a really great effort and if you 're interested in the results of those surveys in on that same your voice our coast website as we progress into the upcoming stages we 're going to continue to collaborate with the community and other key stakeholders to ensure that our management plans really do reflect community values so that we can build a shared sense of direction and facilitate mutual responsibility and collective action for lake macquarie there have already been a number of assessments and reports published as part of phase two and these are available for you to download on that your voice our quest page as well if you would like to get involved we would love to hear from you it 's really important to us that these coastal management programs reflect the values and preferences of our community so we invite you to register you can join um the pool that we use to get focus group members and you can also register to stay updated because we are going to be opening up further opportunities for consultation as we move into the upcoming stages and that will all be done throughout your voice our coast website thank you again to everyone i do really look forward to keeping you updated as we move along this journey together so thank you _"

    "text": "[Music] central coast council and the new south wales government are planning for our future to ensure the central coast has a sustainable and resilient water system we have developed the central coast water security plan which sets out how we 're going to do this over the next 30 years the plan is a whole of government approach to water security on the coast water is fundamental to our region supporting the quality of life of our community and economic prosperity of a growing region for the last year we have talked to our community about their values and preferences for our water future the community told us they want a reliable water supply that can withstand drought a water supply system with minimal environmental impacts that is cost effective to build and operate a safe and clean water supply system that adheres to high quality water standards and focuses on saving precious drinking water by reducing leakage and using innovative solutions we have analyzed demand options to reduce the amount of drinking water we use and supply options to supplement our water supplies and we have assessed the in the recent drought to make sure we are prepared in the future the central coast 's water system performs well in typical conditions but in a severe drought our storages can drop to critical levels in around 5 years if a drought was to continue longer than this we could run out of water if we do not have a backup plan in place to ensure we have enough water to meet the needs of our growing community during good times and in future droughts we need to be agile efficient collaborative and cost effective to make sure we are prepared for a future with a changing climate and a growing population it is likely that we will need to increase our water supplies within the next 10 to 15 years or when our future demand exceeds our available supply our analysis is now complete and we are ready to seek feedback from our community on the draft plan there are three key pillars outlined in the draft plan and a suite of actions that align with each pillar these actions will be implemented once the final plan is work together with our community to do the same since the millennium drought the central coast community has reduced their water use within their homes by 22 and in the last year council has inspected over 1200 kilometers of water pipes in our network to identify and fix leaks in the system we will continue to build on these achievements and work with our community to reduce drinking water used in homes businesses and industries and continue to invest in reducing leaks in the water network we want to make the most of our existing infrastructure we will continue to capture and store water in mangrove creek dam which can store water transferred from mardi dam which in turn captures water from wyong river and arumba creek following a comprehensive safety review mangrove creek dam can now be utilized to its full storage capacity we will also continue our partnership with hunter water and maximise on the water transferred from the central coast hunter connection to increase water security across the two regions groundwater ball fields and infrastructure was built during the millennium drought and has been used as a our groundwater system and conduct further studies to ensure that any groundwater extraction is undertaken in the most sustainable way we will also continue to investigate a potential ancient underground river source also known as a paleo channel under the tuggera lakes area which could provide even more water we currently recycle around 650 million liters of water each year we will work towards increasing this by 400 million liters per year through increased industrial recycling providing recycled water to irrigate more parks and sporting fields and continuing to explore viable recycling opportunities in new residential developments our climate is changing and the future is uncertain we will act to improve our resilience to drought and remain adaptive to future opportunities and risks we will do this by implementing the following actions purified recycled water is a reliable and safe water supply option that is already part of water supply systems around the world including perth western australia while we plan for the delivery of the purified recycled water scheme at wyong south wastewater treatment plant council will continue to engage with our community on the water cycle and the is also planning to build a desalination plant at tukley as a long-term supply option to provide a reliable source of water that is independent of rainfall and climate desalination is the process of removing salts and impurities from sea water to create safe drinking water the desalination plant would be sized to produce up to 30 million liters of water per day in typical conditions and even throughout a drought council has allowed for carbon offsetting for all energy associated with the ongoing operation of the plant to be prepared for long and severe droughts in the future we need to decrease the amount of water we use and increase water supply sources that don 't rely on rainfall we have permanent water conservation measures in place called waterwise rules and we will implement future water restrictions during drought as required we will continue to work with our community to promote water efficient behaviors and the use of water-saving devices we will also continue planning the desalination plant at tukley mentioned earlier this way if we need it earlier than expected due to an unforeseen drought it will be levels reach around 45 percent we plan to commence delivery of the desalination plant to be completed within three years at around 15 percent emergency supplies will be operated to avoid running out of water during the millennium drought council gained approval to set up and operate a temporary extraction point at porter 's creek to help supplement our dwindling water supplies council would aim to reinstate this extraction point if emergency drought trigger levels are reached again our water system is underpinned by healthy ecosystems and is essential to support our community we will continue to protect the health and quality of our drinking water catchments in order to create and sustain livable communities the central coast water security plan includes a program of actions to make the most of what we 've got ensure we can reliably meet the water needs of a growing community while remaining adaptive to be able to respond to future conditions the proposed plan increases the diversity and resilience of the system and it improves our drought readiness and security to ensure we can continue to serve our community through long and severe future of our region the central coast water security plan is now on public exhibition and we want to hear from you learn more and have your say at your ourcoast.com _"

know months later people didn 't cope at all well whereas normally they would be really stoic we 're all looking at nature in the middle of covid and so our mental health is supported by that but on the other side you 've got isolation and people losing track of their friends and things like that this is it the little dog this project here was to do three ephemeral subjects and they had to be something to do with the local community it had to be a connection it had to be a site specific thing the theme of it all is resilience and it 's because the people up here they 've been through the floods they 've been through the fires so the thought is to just give them something to lighten lighten things up a bit this is a you know what this is good for the head you don 't that he 's using something that 's symbolic from that area one of the most recognizable things about spencer is that we have these gomer plants and you always know when you 're coming close because you can see them in the bush and they were so resilient in the flower in the fires and everything weren 't they and we 're still here while we 're a very close community it 's still very easy to be isolated given all the dramas that we 've been through in the last two years there 's been a real feeling of the community being down and the community needed something to sort of get stuck into so once i opened this i 've been inundated with community support so that 's why i made this model i got this thought about a giraffe right the thought is there 's a little character on here and she 's is a cloud weaver so she rides the giraffe to get up to grab the fleece of the clouds to spin at the wall and then these people weave it yes and that came i walked in and there was like 30 of them at this long table and they all looked up they were so happy i know it 's been great so the idea of the gathering or the project is really just to provide a community space a safe space to have a bit of fun the premise of you know knitting together so it keeps the hands busy relaxes the mind and it 's been great it 's really brought together um women who haven 't seen each other for a long time sometimes they bring their husbands a lot of chat informal and formal they 're farming women and they 're working hard every day so that 's beautiful for them to say i 'm taking two hours of every week just for me [Music] thank you to you brianna for all the workshops that you 've been holding over the last few weeks there are people coming out that we haven 't_''_187.44 met before that have been here for 40 odd years yeah and they 're they 're now surfacing social interaction is so important as you get and feel comfortable now and think oh this is a really friendly place yeah and reconnecting with you know old established friends that they haven 't seen for ages it 's just so rewarding for us to see that happening what will it bring to the community interest discussions i just find for myself that it always makes me feel better when i 'm creating things interacting with others i guess and that too bringing pictures together that 's i do have fun with mythical stuff try not to be pretentious about it but in the end it 's a bit of joy you know after what they 've been through but when i talk to people they 're surprisingly unemotional it 's like oh yeah tell me their stories um they 're all just heroic you know i happened to be looking online i was laughing out i thought there 's something really cool about an hour laughing i just really like that idea i mean one thing i 'm always amazed by is the response from from people who passes by just just the joy they get out doing our first tree installation our piece of art here at the hub and it 's going to look fantastic because it 's all so much done from the heart i think what our yarn bumming is doing is allowing people that little step into being part of a community in a totally non-threatening way can i have a willing stitcher most weeks

coming back every week and catching up with everybody it was such a nice way to kind of reconnect with the community and feel like a part of it again i did work out that i couldn 't do complicated patterns and talk at the same time so i came down here to talk and i went home and crocheted the talking was very important what do you think shane i think it 's amazing i think you guys have just done an amazing than i thought it was going to be very keen for it to continue they keep saying are we are we are we still going are we still meeting so that 's really lovely affirmation that they 're

    "text": "some of the key outcomes I want to talk to you about in the development of your budgets is the importance of budgeting and how it sets the roadmap for you to achieve your big picture plan to take a look at where you are now currently and where you want to be and what do you have available to you in taking you to that next place I want to talk to you about the internal and external data and to encourage you to stop navel-gazing so stop looking internally but also then looking at the external environment in which you 're operating in it 's all about the big picture so monitoring is important and there are some of the key concepts that I want to outline with you today budget set the plan of the projected income streams into your service and also then the expenses that you 're expecting to incur over a given period of time the budget is set for that future period of time it 's either the upcoming year and it 's generally broken down into quarters or months they are a measurable terms are your dollars or units and they become your measurement of how you 're tracking towards your budget budgets are a brilliant management tool that enables you to forecast into the future identifying whether there 's going to be any shortfalls or gaps whether there 's going to be greater spend than the income that 's coming in to your organization when that may occur and then it enables you to come up with a strategy to avoid them by either generating more income or doing some more fundraising or having access to some short-term funds such as a credit card or an overdraft that will be paid back when things swing back into the positive that you 're hoping for budget support management to get all of the activities and plans for the organization out onto paper and provide a monitoring tool to see how the organization is tracking to that prediction budgets create the space to ask the question why so why are we on track what is going right for the organization or why aren 't we on track and what 's happening for the that resource to the table and enable engagement and some really effective communication around the financial management and the targets that are being achieved by your service so a good place to start in developing this meaningful resources is to take a look at your past so start by asking the question where have you been what have you been doing and then getting really clear about where you want to be going so let 's step out of the work context for a moment and think about something that you would like to do next year is it buying a new car is it creating an outdoor BBQ area for entertaining is it updating the kitchen with new appliances or maybe it 's about taking a trip to a new place let 's say the Amalfi Coast how will you make that happen first of all we need to identify what are the cost going to be if it is the trip then what 's involved in making that come to fruition do we need to think about the airfares the accommodation that transfers the hire car again as about what it is that you 're wanting to achieve what 's the time frame around this trip what time of year will you be going how much money will you need and when will you book and what deposits will you need up front and then most importantly how can you save for that to come to fruition these are the key questions when setting out your budget of any sort for any project for any outcome so another key question to ask is then where are you currently at how much money do you have left over to save for this outcome that you 're wanting to achieve what is your time frame to achieve this objective and is it realistic in achievable and then again how will you know if you 're on track you need to monitor to see that you you 're achieving those goals are on that timely basis so I 'm getting really clear with my purpose I know what it is that I 'm wanting and I know that I want to go and sit in the Sun somewhere so if I of a spending budget for meals snacks and drinks I 'm covering all of the things that I think need to be taken into consideration so where are my act currently and how much money do I have to achieve this goal one of the questions I need to ask is what is my current income and what is my current spend and then how much do I have on a monthly or a weekly basis to set aside for me to achieve this goal so let 's say I have a hundred and fifty dollars to put towards this holiday each week how many weeks will it take me to save to get to the six thousand dollars it 's going to take me 40 weeks for me to reach that target so I need 2,000 for the airfares and I want to book it as soon as possible so in let 's say 14 weeks I can start booking some flights I don 't necessarily need to wait until I have the total 6,000 before I book what I 'm pointing out to you here is about setting that you 're aiming for and around that time frame so I can map out a time frame when I want to achieve certain milestones to move me closer to bringing me to my goal or to my fruition this is the same for your organization or the same for a new startup idea or an ongoing project so you need to find that starting point first of all you need to get really clear with your purpose and then gather the tools to help map out your pathway to achieve these outcomes so for organizations that have been in operation you will have access to what 's known as the internal data just as in the example of my holiday my internal data would be what income did I have and what were my expenses and how much can I save towards the target so for your organization this is similar you have internal data available to you these are the activities that have previously happened for your service you 'll find this information on your prior years financial reports commonly known as your annual report in reviewing this and some significant events that may have occurred during that time and you can get a clearer picture of what the reports are telling you about your activities so that 's about where you 've been now we want to know where you want to be in 12 months what 's it going to look like review your current income streams will they be the same what about your expenses are you taking on new staff or downsizing the team do you need to relocate in new premises what are some of the key events that you 're aiming to achieve over this next 12 months these are all critical pieces of information that are going to help you bring your budget together this is about looking at the external data the external environment that 's going to impact on your income and your expenses over that given period it 's about getting a clearer picture of the outside influences that will impact on your bottom line so now that you know where you 've been and that 's by looking at your historical data and you know what you time to map out some timeframes and get a little closer with the numbers are good too to use this to assist you in this is an Excel spreadsheet but don 't worry if you don 't have access to an Excel spreadsheet or that you don 't feel comfortable with it it 's just about getting a big sheet of paper and writing across the top of that page the months of the year and down the side you want to be looking at the income and the expenses so down the side of your worksheet you 're going to have headings such as grant income local government community grants donations Hall higher income interest any types of income that you 're receiving into your service or that you 're projecting that you 'll be receiving into your service and underneath that then your list down the expenses that you 're going to be expecting to incur such as advertising audit fees bank fees rent insurance salaries and wages how many staff do you have at the moment and how many will you need are they casual full-time and of the things that you 're going to need to consider in bringing together your budget so your budget needs to be monitored it needs to be checked in with regularly to see how you 're tracking and in the case of saving for my holiday the indicators would be my bank accounts I may actually on track in my savings to where I thought I would be at the end of December or did my Christmas shopping blowout did I not consider that when I was budgeting so these are some of the things that you need to forecast for in the timing of your budget if I 'm not on track then I need to be able to identify that early and I get to do that through the monitoring process so I could choose to forego my morning coffee for a month to be able to catch up on those savings if I 've overspent is this achievable well what else could I do could I take a casual job to support the shortfall because I really want to get on that plane so what I 'm lost if we do lose track or we do get off-track but the budget enables us to identify that early enough for us to be able to get back on track and this is the importance of monitoring well that 's a little bit about budgeting so check out our website for further resources that may assist you or come along to one of our scheduled workshops or webinars we wish you well with your plans and achieving your objectives _"

    "text": "central coast council is planning for our future to ensure our region has a sustainable and resilient water system that can adapt and respond to change we 're considering a number of water demand and supply options to reduce the amount of drinking water we use and supplement our water supplies we 're assessing these options on a range of criteria including the reliability it adds to our water system environmental and social impacts as well as the cost to build and operate [Music] recycled water involves the treatment of wastewater to a standard suitable for irrigation of parks gardens and golf courses industrial purposes and some uses around the home it 's a reliable option as it doesn 't rely on rainfall with low environmental and social impacts however it can cost a lot to build and has moderate operating costs environmental flow substitution is a process where we return treated wastewater back into the river as natural flow allowing us to extract more water for drinking wastewater is treated at an existing treatment plant and then goes through a new more advanced treatment plant the water quality produced water it is then piped and released into the weir is used to pond water on the upstream side which is extracted for drinking water treatment this helps to separate that water from the treated water released as environmental flows on the downstream side the volume of treated water released downstream of the weir allows more river water to be extracted upstream for drinking river water is then transferred to an existing council storage dam before being treated at an existing water treatment plant to end up as clean safe drinking water in your tap it is a reliable rainfall independent source of drinking water it has moderate environmental impact with potential risk to the environment low social impacts and moderate costs to build and operate in many places around the world water is recycled by purifying or treating wastewater to a level that makes it safe and suitable to go back into the drinking water supply this is referred to as purified recycled water and is subject to multiple stages of treatment and monitoring purified recycled water is very similar to environmental flow substitution except the treatment standards are consideration of the australian drinking water guidelines and instead of discharging the highly treated water downstream of the weir it is discharged upstream of the weir so that it can mix with the river water before it is transferred to a dam then water treatment plant it is a reliable rainfall independent source of drinking water it has low environmental and social impacts however it can be costly to build and operate stormwater harvesting refers to the collection treatment and reuse of stormwater to irrigate parks fields and golf courses and for industrial purposes because it relies on rain it adds limited reliability to our water system but it does have low environmental and social impacts a moderate cost to build and low cost to operate water conservation programs aim to promote more efficient water use and identify and fix leaks in the water network its reliability is limited as it depends on everyone changing the way they use water but it is an environmentally friendly option with low social impact and relatively low costs groundwater is one of the most common water sources in the world and is already underground reservoirs provide a reliable source of water but still rely on rainfall to recharge it has low environmental and social impacts a relatively low cost to build and low operating costs dams currently supply most of the water to customers on the central coast a dam can be on river where it fills directly from river flows or off river where water is transferred to it from other sources we are investigating the feasibility of enlarging our existing dams constructing a new dam and moving more water to our dams from other catchments for storage dams at a moderate level of reliability to our water system as they rely on rain to fill however they have high environmental and social impacts while they cost a lot to build they have low operating costs desalination is the process of removing salts from seawater to create fresh water for drinking this is done by reverse osmosis where the salt water is pushed through a membrane to remove the mineral content desalination is a very reliable source of water that is independent of rainfall and can be turned on and off as social impact of desalination is generally quite low the cost to build and run a desalination plant can be quite high water sharing aims to move water across regions to where it is needed most through a series of pipes and pumps making the most of variations in rainfall distribution and storage capacities water sharing adds moderate reliability to our water system it has relatively low environmental and social impacts cost to build is moderate and cost to operate is quite low water plays a critical role in the future of our region we 're actively exploring all options based on our community 's values and best practice industry knowledge to ensure we understand the environmental and social aspects technical feasibility and costs of each option type we 're looking at ways to increase the use of recycled water by expanding our existing schemes to new customers we 're also looking at new options such as environmental flow substitution or purified recycled water we will continue to work closely with local communities to explore opportunities for storm water harvesting and with hunter water for water sharing opportunities we 're investigating and transfer pipelines should we need to build new infrastructure in the future we 're also investigating the potential for ancient underground riverbeds to provide alternate future sources of fresh water water conservation is important to us so we 're continuing to conserve water by monitoring and fixing leaks in our water network and work with our communities to love water learn more and have your say about planning our water future at your voice ourcoast.com you _"

three meters above sea level circulation patterns in the s3 are driven by wind as opposed to tides major flushing in the estuary occurs through the rivers and creeks including Spring Creek while River a rember Creek Tom B Creek and saltwater Creek with an average annual flow from the catchment of 193 gigalitres per year minor flushing occurs through the entrance channel with the exchange accounting for less than 1% of the total volume per day tides are generally limited to the immediate entrance area average retention time for each Lake that is the amount of time that water stays in each Lake before being flushed out has been calculated at 220 days photography four hundred and sixty days for budgie a lake and 520 days for Lake man Laura many studies over the years have shown that entrance modification would have limited effect on either water quality or flooding the estuary catchment has changed significantly over the past 80 or so years from the early days of timber harvesting in the upper catchments through recent clearing of the valley floors and floodplains blue areas on the maps show the extent of urbanization concentrated really heavily around the area floodplain the loss of natural filters including wetlands and salt marshes has taken away the catchments capacity to self cleanse like removing the kidneys of the estuary filling and clearing of these important vegetation communities has a major impact on the downstream health loss of riparian vegetation has resulted in stream bank erosion throughout the extensive network of streams creeks and rivers this is liberated sediment which flows directly to the estuary affecting the clarity of the water and smothering the aquatic vegetation for Shore modification including reclamation construction of sea walls and mowing to the edge all affect near shore processes and water quality around the lake margins modifying the natural dynamics of the entrance by keeping it open has broad scale effects on ecological process and affects water quality throughout the whole system more hard surfaces means water can 't filter down into the ground and instead it runs really quickly through channels and drains overland picking up lots of urban pollutants as it goes the major pollutants include nutrient sediment and has been through three phases of ecological health since European settlement the 1900s and 1960s were characterized by good water quality clear water plenty of sea grass and plenty of rock yes even back then rock was a hot topic of conversation in hindsight we didn 't have a good understanding of nature or that our actions could have a negative impact on our local area during this time the population increased and land clearing was rife but the impacts hadn 't yet started to show the 1970s and 80s saw a boom in population with very poor catchment and sewer management practices it wasn 't uncommon for sewer to flow directly into the waterways at that time this resulted in a sharp decline in health and at the same time we still didn 't really know how the yes tree worked or how it should be managed during the 1980s and 1990s the population continued to grow everyone wanted to live near the water and we were starting to see the long term impact of poor catchment management the Lakes restoration project where the four shores were reclaimed by on the foreshore then capping that with sand is one example of applying a solution to a problem we didn 't fully understand kind of like the cane toad we 're still paying for this poor management decision to this day a few good outcomes of the era or reticulation of the sewage which significantly reduced pollutant loads and the commencement of several research programs to help understand the estuary as a precursor to better management the past two decades have seen these management plans come to fruition along with smarter development water sensitive urban design and a move towards more sustainable catchment development there 's still a long way to go whenever competing pressures but the gradual improvement in water quality is evidence that we 're on the right track if we delve into some more detail we can take a look at where the pollution comes from these graphics show the loads of the major pollutants including nitrogen phosphorus and sediment that come from the catchment this information is derived from a catchment model which was validated by field sampling the model shows that in general the largest nature of their size but the worst offenders are the urban catchments around the fringes of the lake shown in the darker colors one other really important aspect is that the type of material matters if you imagine you might get sticks and leaves and silts coming from the rural catchments which take time to break down the urban catchments generate high volumes of fertilizer chemicals and highly reactive compounds that are quickly absorbed by algae resulting in algal blooms or contributing to organic enrichment of the sediment looking at how the current conditions compared to pre settlement conditions we can see that in all cases the volumes of pollution are higher than what was natural but in many cases the nutrient and sediment loads are between 150 and 400 percent of what would occur naturally unlike nutrients in our diet too much is a very bad thing when it comes to waterways and with all that extra stuff coming into a naturally sensitive and poorly flushed system it 's no wonder we 're seeing the system breakdown one of the key questions has been to look at where all effect the entrance has on moving it all out to sea Council scientists work with experts from the New South Wales government to develop a series of models these included a catchment model a hydrodynamic model and an ecological response model collectively these tell us what materials are going into the estuary where they come from where they go how long they hang around and then most importantly what effect all this has on the lake ecology the first graphic shows changes in salinity as a way of describing the general movement of water around the lake and highlights the areas of most and least activity this is modeled from the 2007 pasha bulker storm which was a one in ten year flood event photography inflow from the rivers makes up the majority of input some discharge exits at the entrance but the influence of a strong southerly wind pushes the surface water north the animation shows that away bay tugger bay and adjacent to two CLE golf course are relatively sheltered and water may stay in these bays sometime making them susceptible to algal blooms if there 's an of water through the entrance channel the inflow of water is minimal on each tidal cycle and doesn 't extend far into the rest of the lake lastly this animation shows the time it takes for the estuary to be flushed by the entrance alone in the absence of catchment inflow note the daily time steps ticking over and the limited dilution generated by ocean water coming in this really highlights how poorly connected and flushed the Northern Lakes are and how vulnerable they are to catchment pressures with this information you would assume that Lakeman Mora being furthest from the entrance would be in the worst condition but this is not the case because many of its natural wetlands including those at Columbia and Elizabeth Bay are still intact they provide a natural buffer it 's important to be mindful as well that there 's not enough energy in the system to carry all of that stuff down to the entrance so in essence what goes into the lake stays in the lake prior to the 1960s the entrance was allowed to naturally closed over during periods of low would fill up to a point then spill over scouring a deep wide channel through the entrance this natural fluctuation in water level allowed the lake to self cleanse with a lot of the material that was in the lake be that silt or rock or sludgy sediments being able to wash up onto the shore when the water receded this stuff would be left high and dry and the lake edge would become clearer once a regular program of dredging commenced these water fluctuations were greatly reduced and paired with increased loads of pollution coming into the lake took away this natural self cleansing mechanism studies of the entrance date back to the 1990s an independent study by Umwelt in 2011 investigated sediment dynamics along the north entrance Beach and at the entrance and concluded that council should not construct training walls at the entrance none of the investigations to date demonstrate that construction of training walls would benefit the lake or north entrance beach in addition the study did not support high volume dredging removal of the berm or alternative mechanisms to drive the lake entrance to a wave penetration into the estuary and increased lake water levels now and as sea levels rise both have significant risks for Lake ecology and flooding based on a recommendation from this study in 2011 the New South Wales government commissioned Cardno to develop a numerical model of the entrance channel and surrounds in 2013 carton or again commissioned by the state to provide objective professional advice this included two additional studies which looked at the Morpho dynamics of the entrance Channel and investigated a range of engineering solutions proposed by the community the latter study provided costings for a range of proposed options the first study used the numerical model to evaluate a range of popular management options including training walls which are also known as break walls or breakwaters the study concluded that the various training wall options would not increase flood level if spaced at 150 meters or more apart noting that any closer would have unacceptable negative impacts on flooding the study also stated that these options would lead to virtually no change in lake water quality would require that maintenance dredging of the type already undertaken on flood level flood duration or water quality the 2nd 2013 study looked at ways to improve sand retention on north and south entrance beaches the report went on to cost a range of options with twin training walls estimated to cost in the order of forty 6.8 million again with negligible benefit the study was the catalyst for the construction of the current groin on the entrance Beach to assist with Santa chrétien over time the longer-term impacts of this structure on entrance Morpho dynamics are currently unknown in 2015 a third Cardno study was prompted by the then estuary floodplain and postal management committee the study revisited the model but included deepening the channel which is currently constrained by a rock shelf at the estuary mouth the conclusion was that following deepening the dredge channels would begin to infill almost immediately from both the upstream and downstream ends and that comparison of simulations undertaken with or without the training walls showed little difference with regard to water quality and water levels in the lake system this study did however caution that significantly increasing tidal exchange may have additional muddy shores around the fringes of the estuary reduced recreational value and potentially fish catch reduced estuary navigation and access to jetties and boat ramps destabilization of the foundations of the entrance bridge and permanent changes to the shorelines around to River based on observations elsewhere other foreseeable changes could include loss of seagrass and salt marsh changes to commercial fish and prawn populations loss of little turn habitats migration of the flood tide Delta west of the bridge making this area even shallower exposure and oxidization of acid sulfate soils mangrove ingress into the intertidal zone in Lake Illawarra they 've seen eighty-seven fold increase in mangrove area since the training walls were installed erosion of the entrance sea wall along Memorial Park ongoing shoreline recession and erosion placing infrastructure at risk bridge instability again in Lake Illawarra emergency works to the cost of 2.5 million dollars were required to stabilize Windham bridge and less protection from coastal storms and wave impacts in a changing climate if we look at how the estuary responds to all the changes I 've described we know that material from the river catchments of the lake and then material from the fringing catchments flows directly into the near shore zone having a really significant impact on the ecology of these areas wind not tides mixes the estuary and because the lake is shallow the wind has enough energy to stir the water right down to the bottom picking up sediment nutrients and algae and holding them in suspension for a long time this is why whenever the wind blows Tuggerah Lakes looks brown and dirty the seagrass has been lost in the middle of the lakes and it 's been squeezed out to the edges so primary production is now dominated by algae and phytoplankton whilst the contribution of seagrass and macro algae is now less it is still really important when you consider sea grasses are 40 to 50 times more efficient at storing carbon than terrestrial forests and finally we know that the oceanic exchange is limited so what goes into the lake stays in the lake and if we want our lakes to be healthy we need to make sure clean water is coming in sea grass and macro algae food chain and perform a really important function in stabilizing the lake bed recycling nutrients producing oxygen improving water clarity and providing a home to fish and invertebrates if we take a closer look at what 's happening below the surface and the major energy pathways we can see that the nutrients come in from the catchment and are quickly taken up by phytoplankton these guys are then eaten by zooplankton and the fecal material and little dead bodies fall to the bottom bacteria feast on this detritus sometimes creating rotten egg gas as a by-product and cycling energy back up the food chain wind waves are the major driver of this recycling process which is the most significant energy pathway in the estuary the flow of energy up other pathways like between salt marsh fish and birds is much smaller the reason Tuggerah Lakes looks dirty and brown more often than other estuaries is firstly because it 's shallow and secondly because the seagrass which covers the bed of the lake has moved over time survey data and anecdotal reports indicate that seagrass has shifted away from the middle is a plant and plants need light to grow as the amount of dirt coming from the catchments over time increases the water was cloudy and more often which blocked the light from getting to the seagrass the seagrass could no longer live in the middle area so it retracted into the shallower water leaving just the shallow muddy bed wind waves could then easily stir up the bed sediment which further exacerbates this problem this is referred to as a negative feedback loop and can be very difficult to reverse as the seagrass moved towards the edge the sandy shores people remember were lost from some places a further complication is that seagrass now forms a barrier between the near shore zone and the middle basins which traps pollution around the edge we know that seagrass is under immense pressure but we don 't know how much it can tolerate before it disappears completely this would be catastrophically bad for the ester e the near shore changes are shown here we have some old aerial photos of the foreshore and near shore zones along long jetty and Kolani Vale estuary the early years were characterized by clear sandy shores in some places but not all and strong healthy sea grasses in the basin as time goes by you can see the macro fights starting to move towards the shallower water but the sandy ridges generated by the wind are still visible along the shoreline note the gradual enrichment of the basin in 1954 and then by 1974 the seagrass is pushing right into the shallow water by 1982 the seagrass has moved right into the shallow water which is the only place left for it to grow this was a period of time when algal blooms were common and water quality was poor keep an eye on the yellow line around the edge in the final image you can see where the foreshore was reclaimed and all of the drainage lines that were installed these drip-feed pollutant Laden water into the estuary over time further enriching the near shore zone the seagrass around the edge is thick and long and creates a barrier that traps material from the urban drains in this narrow band magnifying the impact we 've the New South Wales guidelines the New South Wales MEA is the model applied across the whole state to assess ste health integral Lakes we 've added more sites and increased the frequency of sampling to build a clearer long-term picture we use what are known as pressure and response indicators pressure indicators tell you what the system is having to cope with and response indicators tell you what kind of impact the pressures are having this is a good way to track the resilience of the estuary and alert you to a system decline these results are converted to an annual grade kind of like a school report card with grades ranging from excellent to poor the map here shows an average of grades over a six year period from 2011 to 2018 with grades between a and C and measurable improvements at some locations if we compare the grades in tug relate to other histories in New South Wales you can see in the first segment that tuggers A 's B 's and C 's are not dissimilar to many other areas along the New South Wales coast we sample in southern Lake Macquarie and Brisbane water with a is common in the well flush sites but seasoned DS and more isolated locations then moving further along we can see the northern beaches lagoons and finally the Great Lakes region again with similar scores to toggle Lakes managing industry requires an adaptive approach we start with a plan in this case the tug relax estuary management plan from here we implement the plan we monitor the system to see what 's working and what 's not we evaluate these outcomes and with an improved understanding we plan again to see how this has been put into action photograph 's we began in the 1990s with a new s3 management manual produced by the New South Wales government we developed an s3 process study which was really about nuts and bolts of how the history worked from here the sto management study looked at issues and options and the s tree management plan identified action plans and priorities since 2008 we 've been actively implementing the EMP with the support of several federal grants these have helped us deliver plan that sat on the shelf a key component of the EMP was to fill some knowledge gaps which we 've done through partnerships with experts in a range of fields this new information has been embedded in our management to date and will be incorporated into our new coastal management program this map is live on councils website and includes all of the grant funded projects that have been part of the implementation phase the map includes storm water improvements salt marsh rehabilitation Bush regeneration water quality monitoring sites stream bank rehabilitation and recreational upgrades we 've delivered these in partnership with a range of different organizations from the web-based map you can click on each icon to bring up more detail community engagement and education is a high priority for council ensuring a healthy future for our estuaries everybody 's responsibility with over 150,000 people living in the catchment if everyone can make some small change we can really turn things around our ste education programs always include a call to action something tangible that people can do to make a difference these messages are delivered in a tours report cards workshops and school-based programs each year we celebrate our beautiful waterways as part of the lakes festival a great way to tell the story of the estuary and reach a broad audience is through film we have a series of videos and short films about Tuggerah Lakes which we screen in local cinemas there are plenty of things we can all do in our daily lives to help keeping chemicals and fertilizer use to a minimum preventing soil from washing down the drain bending your waist or installing a rainwater tank or rain garden can help you can install permeable paving and use natural ground covers instead of concrete and bitumen you can let the native plants grow especially on the riverbanks and for Shores maintaining your view is one thing but wouldn 't you rather look at a clean and healthy waterway and finally if you have weekend why not join Landcare or Water Watch we are continuing to deliver actions within the sto management plan with the support of ongoing grant funding we will be working with the New South Wales government 's expert panel we will be launching a brand new website and publishing our annual waterway report cards once the new coastal management program is in place we 'll be working hard to deliver actions contained within the plan and reporting back to the community on the outcomes if you 'd like to find out more about Tuggerah Lakes you can visit our website _"

    "text": "this session is about taking your idea from conception through to fruition the scenario that I wanted to talk to you about today was having that brilliant idea that neish exciting new idea and where you need to go with that idea who you need to talk to and how you can possibly get that idea off the ground great ideas often get lost or left on the shelf because there 's a lot of fear that happens in that space about who do I need to talk to who can I share my idea with will it be a silly idea will I lose face or is this ideas so brilliant that someone may want to run with that idea community compass supports innovative ideas and supports entrepreneurs and social enterprises to take those next steps we 're here to guide you because we understand some of those fears that you 're experiencing but we also understand where you need to take those next questions to let 's look at some of the questions that innovators face so have you thought about your entity structure and what form that of the structures available to you are being an incorporated association or a cooperative or a company limited by guarantee now each of these entity types have a different reporting structure and they 're some of the things that I want to talk to you about today and guide you through in understanding what some of that compliance and reporting requirements are as a nonprofit entity what if you want to be a for-profit structure so some of the entity structures that are available to you as a for-profit entity are being a sole trader a partnership or again a company now that list isn 't endless but what my advice would be is that you seek your accountants advice to follow that up in further detail as to what 's going to be the most suitable structure for you if you 're wanting to be a for-profit choosing the structure of a nonprofit entity can align you with your values around community development so that could be one of the core reasons why wanting to set as a nonprofit entity you may be entitled to some tax concessions on entity structure and also you could be able to secure yourself some grant funding philanthropic funding and foundation funds so there 's a myriad of income streams that are available to you as a nonprofit entity that can support taking that brilliant idea through to fruition and getting you out there into action as a nonprofit entity there are compliance matters that you need to be aware of and those compliance matters are about who do we report to how often do we need to report to them and and in what form do we need to report so as an incorporated association or a cooperative you need to report to the Office of Fair Trading so the Office of Fair Trading is state legislation and it has guidance and guidelines and they have a brilliant website that has its some amazing resources available to you if you 're going to choose that entity structure the alternative is a company limited by guarantee which is a federal legislation and you become registered under assic which is the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to set up as an incorporated Association it are downloadable from the website and there 's a small fee applicable in your application however it 's not just about filling in the forms there is the requirements of having a board that are going to support you as an individual getting that idea out there so the that 's one of the compliance areas for the incorporated as being an incorporated Association and the requirements are you can actually start with three board members but it is recommended that you grow those board membership to five seven or nine members that will be meeting regularly to oversee the governance of your idea governance is about the leadership and the strategic vision of the organization as an incorporated Association there are guidelines that you need to abide by and it 's known as your model Constitution now this is provided to you by the Office of Fair Trading when you apply for your application to become an incorporated Association within these guidelines is a framework that can support your first steps in good governance and that 's about the timing of your meetings the roles that your board members procedures and conflict resolution it 's a guide that can support you to your next steps look out for other youtube clips of this nature that will support you in understanding the gamut of compliance from the Australian Tax Office when you 're in this startup phase aside from the Office of Fair Trading there are other bodies that you need to be reporting to or at least thinking about registering with and that would be the Australian Tax Office these would be matters such as whether you 're going to have business activities happening so you 'll need to register for an ABN number which is your Australian business number and then you may need to apply for PAYG and if that 's if you 're going to be thinking about taking on staff so PAYG is pay-as-you-go and that 's about the withholding of some tax from your staff to help set the scene for the decision about your entity structure what I 'd like to get you to do now is to think about the big picture of your idea so where is it that you 're be located where are you going to be working from who are your target audience and how are you going to reach them some of those questions are critical in helping you understand the size the location and also then the income opportunities that you 're going to be having what 's actually driving your idea what 's the big picture plan why are you actually doing what you want to do for example meals on wheels isn 't just about putting a meal on the table but it 's about a community approach about maintaining and sustaining somebody to be able to stay independent for longer and able to stay in their homes by keeping them well connected to other community members and also providing a nutritional meal for them to be sustained it 's really critical for you to get really clear with this concept about what what 's driving your idea because when you 're really clear with that you 're going to be able to this will be your selling point to get other people engaged in your idea some of the questions that you might is who is your target audience why are you wanting to do the things that you 're doing what is your point of difference so why would someone within the community want to engage with your project as opposed to somebody else 's and getting really clear about what you 're offering is so where will you operate from where are you going to start your project from what skill sets do you need what are you bringing to the table as the ideas person and what skill sets do you have and then who do you need to surround yourself with to bring those other skills to help get your innovative idea into fruition how many staff will you need what skills will they need when you 're starting to engage other people into the space as the entrepreneur one of the critical questions that you will need to ask yourself is what are your expenses currently and how are you going to sustain yourself through this startup phase of your project we hope that this snapshot of ideas will help you along your journey of taking your innovative innovation and just remember that everybody has the capacity to be remarkable _"

    "text": "do you want to understand your financial reports and understand the story that they tell about your organization well you 're in the right place community compass builds the capacity of organizations through sound financial management practice your financial reports are the detailed outcome of all of the activities and transactions that have occurred for your organization over given period of time whether that 's a month a quarter or a year as a committee or a board member your financial report should be presented at the meeting for discussion review and acceptance let 's take a look at some of those reports in some more detail firstly let 's look at the profit and loss report this report is also known as the performance report as it captures the activities of your service delivery for example the amount of income you have received and the costs that you 've incurred over a given period taking a closer look you will see that the income is broken down into headings such as grant income rental income all higher fees for service and perhaps some interest take a moment to think you do that generate income now let 's look at the expenses these represent the costs you have incurred to bring your activities to fruition such as marketing advertising accounting and record-keeping auditing insurance rent salaries and wages training what kind of expenses do you incur take a moment to reflect on these for your organization some of the questions you may want to think about what is your largest cost area we can graphically report your income and expenses to highlight your high income and expense areas which will give you a greater visual of your financial information creating more meaningful reports for review and discussion at your next meeting the last element that is important when reviewing your profit and loss support is the surplus or deficit area surplus means that you 've earned more than you have spent and a deficit means you have spent more than you 've earned another important report to present at the meeting is the balance sheet also known as the financial position statement this report is a reflection of the activities that have happened in your organization showing such things as the things you own known as your organization 's assets we also have non current assets which are items that will provide a benefit to your service for a period greater than 12 months things like your computer your equipment motor vehicles buildings these items owned by your organization are listed as non current assets next we will look at the liabilities which are the items we are out such as bills unpaid are our creditors GST and PAYG tax that we need to pay to the ATO and loans and grants in advance grants in advance are shown on the balance sheet due to the fact that at any given point in time if the organization doesn 't perform the tasks or outcomes required by your thunder or you close down then the funds unallocated will need to be returned or paid back to your department who funded you for example if you receive 30,000 worth of funds to run a project over a three month period then 10,000 would be allocated for each month as grant income in the profit and loss support across January February and March the project in the months that it is being spent or when the activity is occurring the third element of the balance sheet is the equity or the net worth of your organization we have assets minus liabilities which equals your net worth which is a summary of what you own unless what you owe which equals your net worth or your value of the service at any given point in time a quick overview of the balance sheet for looking at things like your bank which is the inflow and outflow of cash into and out of your service prepayments are items such as insurance which is a cost that provides a benefit to your service over the whole year so it 's broken down into monthly amounts and allocated via journal to your profit and loss support on a monthly basis this amount represents the cost used up in that month this is known as accrual accounting which is a whole other topic we will be creating a learning resource for this topic in the near future debtors are people who are you money for services that you a daily basis but the fees that are paid are only paid perhaps weekly or monthly non current assets are items that give a benefit to the organization greater than a 12 month period and liabilities such as creditors are people that we owe money to and there 's grants in advance which are funds we receive in advance to allocate to a project you will note that the net equity is made up of accumulated funds representing your previous year 's profits adding your surplus or deficit from this year 's activities also found on the bottom of your profit and loss support as your surplus or deficit this then creates your this year 's accumulated funds the third important report that is good to review is a cash flow statement this represents the inflows and outflows of cash into and out of your organization which is the actual money that transacts between the parties during the period in closing I hope this video has been able to shine some light to your understanding of your financial reports next time you watch this link you may wish to have as you step through the process wishing you well with your projects _"

    "text": "in this session we 're going to examine the importance of team roles in financial management for nonprofit organizations so let 's look at some of the key outcomes that we want to cover off in this session the importance of the team approach by Meredith Belbin who 's in the team sound financial management processes and what are the skills required for each role in the financial management of your nonprofit organization so just want you to take a moment to think about who 's in your team who 's involved in financial management at the moment and potentially who could be involved in that process for your nonprofit Belvin suggests that by understanding your role within a particular team you can develop your strengths and manage your limitations as a team member within your organization and so improve how you can contribute to the team to get the best outcome I have a quote here from Bell burner that talks about a team is not a bunch of people with job titles but a congregation of individuals each of whom has a role which is understood by other role of other team members within your organization around effectively financially managing your service financial management of a nonprofit organization is critical to support good decision-making nonprofit leaders must have the confidence in the organization 's financial information it 's important to know how much money is coming into the organization and also then just as critical to know how much is going out to cover the expenses of all of the activities of the services that you 're providing a quote from IBM in order to support the agenda for growth through innovation finance needs to partner more to analyze and predict not only just record and report so I want to take you on a journey through trying to understand who 's in your team and understand their role and understand the importance of financial management for your organization so who 's in your team of your nonprofit organization so I 'd like you to take a moment to identify the team members and your organizational structure and who 's there to support the financial ability of your nonprofit organization generally in the nonprofit sector under the nonprofit treasurer that would be engaged around the financial management processes sound financial management processes begin with identifying the source documents and coding them according to their expense categories and income streams there 's a national standard chart of accounts that has created a data dictionary to help streamline this process so I just wanted to step you through the process then around financial management for your organization thinking about the documentation and the reason we need to manage our finances in a particular way so we 're going right back to the source documents and the role of the bookkeeper in this explanation where some of the source documents that your bookkeeper will need to be working with will be invoices bank statements checkbooks and the like they 're all the source documents the very essence of the trend where the transactions are originally recorded that are happening for your organization and they 're things like the expense items and also the income so an invoice might have been received from your funders and it would be an invoice for income that needs to get coded and then allocated into and in that accounting program there 'll be some coding it 's up to the bookkeeper and the CEO to work out the relevant codes for the processing of those transactions this is often done through an accounting package like my OB or you can be using a spreadsheet such as Excel spreadsheet really the ultimate objective of this financial management process is to get us to the end result which is about reporting so the kind of reports that we 're looking for would be our profit and loss support or also known as our income and expenditures statement our balance sheet and also our cash flow report so these reports are instrumental in being able to support the decision making process of your nonprofit organization I 'd like to now talk a little bit more about roles that are engaged around financial management and they are the bookkeepers role the CEOs role in the treasurer 's role the bookkeeper provides that data entry process that I 've just spoken about that occurs for the service for a particular time period so entering all of the transactions and processing be a month could be a quarter or it could be for the year so the accuracy of this position is critical to the end result the end result is the provision of meaningful reports if the data is entered incorrectly then the reports will end up being meaningless the CEOs role is to effectively manage the allocation of resources across the organization and to do this a sound understanding of financial management is critical to be able to manage those resources well the service needs to be monitored and the figures need to be compared to the budget so where is the organization now and where was it hoping to be so this is known as variance analysis and the CEOs role is about looking at where the organization actually is and being able to report that to team leaders about how they 're managing their their funds and their resources but also then upwards to the board and the committee of the organization the role of the treasurer as outlined in the model Constitution from the Office of Fair Trading is that it is the duty of the due to the Association are collected and recorded and that all payments that are made are authorized that correct books and accounts are kept showing the financial affairs of the Association and that the treasurer reports to the board the financial position and also the performance of the organization over a given period of time so the bookkeeper needs to have a thorough understanding of the activities of the organization and they also need to be able to run various reports that are going to support the CEO and the treasurer to receive meaningful data and meaningful financial reports so that they can see clearly the performance outcomes via the not via the profit not support and also covering a particular period the financial position of the organization this is so that they can review the sustainability of the organization and be able to field any questions coming from board members at the board meetings there are key indicators to look forward in the financial data that 's coming in those reports that are being presented to the treasurer and the CEO and it 's important to be able to story that the financial reports are expressing about the organization for example an organization that is reporting a high amount of annual leave accrued on its balance sheet could be an indicator that the staff are not taking their leave on a regular basis this could be a management issue but it could also then be a board issue if the when we 're thinking about the allocate effective allocation of resources for the organization and we 've got annual leave accruing on the balance sheet could be an unexpected expense incurred by the organization what are the skills that are required for each role engaged in the financial management of your organization in closing we 're hoping that you 're now able to identify the team members that are critical in the financial management of your organization so that you 're able to bounce the ideas off check in with those people and look at the activities of your organization to enable a clearer understanding of your financial situation _"

    "text": "[Music] while the recent dry weather sampling results at Terrigal have been good Terrigal beaches received a poor grading in the state of the beaches report for a number of years the state of the beaches report is put together by the New South Wales government using the data that we collect as part of our Beach watch program the historic called poor water quality results at Terrigal Beach indicate there may be a problem so we 've been working with the New South Wales Government to undertake the Terrigal catchment audit as part of the beach watch Partnership Program we assess the swimming water quality at thirty-two designated swimming sites so people can make informed decisions about where and when they swim we have a formally trained team of scientists that conduct the beach watch tests we 're looking for the presence of a bacteria known as intra caca which grows in the stomach 's of warm-blooded animals the bacteria itself isn 't particularly harmful but it can indicate the presence of other viruses and pathogens that may come from humans or animals once the samples are collected they to the New South Wales Government to be incorporated into the state of the beaches report the results are used to grade each site as part of the state of the beaches report the results can be very good good fair poor or very poor and the results are based on a hundred samples which can take up to three years to collect the grades can be used to assess long-term environmental trends and highlight any areas of concern it 's important to understand that the beach watch results tell us there may be a problem not the source of the problem or the solution due to the results we 've received so far we 're now working with the New South Wales Government to undertake the terrible catchment audit we don 't yet know what 's causing the problem The Situation 's complex and investigating properly takes time what equality issues like those with experience that erigor can be made up of one large problem or a series of small life compounding factors as testing and analysis continues we 're likely to find a number of small problems and other stakeholders will work towards solutions for each root cause so as the rain falls in our suburbs it goes across our houses our driveways into the street and across our parks and into the gutters that flows straight out into all of our river systems our lagoons lakes and the ocean so that rain that falls on our suburbs transports with it a range of pollutants that can include herbicides pesticides sediment fertilizers from people 's yards as well as other things like dog cat or bird poop and this all washes its way down into our water systems where we love to swim the water that we use in our kitchen and our bathrooms flows into a sewer system and that 's a separate system to our stormwater that sewer system then takes it to a treatment plant where it 's treated but occasionally sewage can make its way into the stormwater system whilst council has procedures and processes to maintain their systems occasionally overflows and leaks can occur in addition old and cracked sewer pipes underground can make its way into stormwater and there may also be affect water quality in our stormwater system and the beaches in exceptional circumstances the sewer system is designed to overflow to specific locations in this case it can flow overland or it can be diluted by receiving waters and treated by the Sun [Music] material catchment audit is a comprehensive sampling program starting from down at the beach and working our way up through the catchment we 're working with state government and experts from the University of Technology Sydney to assess water quality here at the beach council employers scientists like me to design and undertake testing to make sure that it 's thorough and accurate at Terrigal I 'm testing the levels of bacteria out in the ocean and I 'm also assessing the level of bacteria up in the pipe systems through the catchment so we 've got a team of people working with me to get down into the drains and assess all the water quality in our stormwater up in the catchment area we 're assessing trace pharmaceuticals such as caffeine and medication to see whether or not any of the bacteria that we 're into our stormwater pipes we know that there have been some concerns about sewage coming onto Terrigal Beach but cloudy water up in the storm water pipes algae blooms and old odors don 't necessarily indicate our sewage input into the system so we 're taking this very seriously and we 're testing quite thoroughly to see if there are any pollution sources coming to the beach we stick to state mandated quality control procedures and we use registered and accredited laboratories to assess all of our water quality results to make sure that they 're accurate we kicked off our sampling program earlier this year and to start we 've been sampling comprehensively at the beach system and we 've been sampling under different tide conditions and different weather conditions such as rainfall to see how the beach very is varies in its bacterial content over time and this gives us a great idea on the baseline water quality conditions we should expect on a beach system we also have what we call control sites so we 're using other beaches along the Central Coast to tell us whether other beaches in the system as well throughout the catchment we 're sampling down manholes and pits so we 've got a team of people working with us to assess the water quality there once we have a good understanding of what 's happening at the beach we can then work up through the pipe systems systematically sampling in the catchment down manholes and pits and then our gutters to see there are any sources of pollution we have a host of cameras that we 'll be searching up through the storm water system to detect any possible illegal connections or any cracked pipes while it 's easy to talk about solutions the reality is far more complex up through the system there are thousands of kilometres of pipes thousands of houses and hundreds of businesses and that all drains into the terrible area the same number of houses and businesses all have multiple sewer points we could be talking about one or two major problems or many small problems or contributing to an issue so we just won 't know what it is until we 've done comprehensive testing might actually find that the problem is not as big as we first thought it might be it 's like looking for a needle in a haystack but each set of results helps us in our search for answers scientists from university of technology the state government and the Central Coast Council are collecting microbial DNA samples from the greater bay so we can actually discern whether or not the microbes are coming from wildlife such as pelicans seagulls and rabbits or whether they 're coming from domesticated animals such as cats dogs or cows or whether or not they 're coming from humans don 't worry we 're not identifying individuals we 're just looking at differences in species scientists are also working on understanding how the water moves in the bays so we can understand how long the microbes persist in the bay after a rainfall event and how far they move up towards other beaches to the north such as one Birol and foresters Beach and how far they go off into the offshore environment and this research will help council understand the origins of the microbial come up with the best management options to remediate the problem in partnership with the New South Wales government we 're committed to a comprehensive audit program before we plan our way forward we need to properly understand the problem we need to design a program that allows us to measure the impact of any changes that we make we 're asking for your patience while we undertake this work we need to get this part right to make sure that our future investments are appropriate and that we get the best results for Terrigal Beach and for our community it 's likely we 'll find other things to address along the way and as we do we 'll be working to prioritize these as residents and visitors to the Central Coast you can do your bit to reduce your impacts on our local environment do you know where your store goes do you think about the chemicals and pollutants you use around your home and how these might be flowing into our waterways we can all play a part in reducing pollution and protecting our environment through small everyday and keep our beaches beautiful remember if it 's on the ground it 's in our waterways _"

    "text": "balaji was a project that was established about three years ago and it was through I increase in indigenous music participation not in this year we 're working preclude with some I X nazar graduates connectives about dancing and culture the aim of engaging with young people was to give them the opportunity to tell their own stories through dance within both the contemporary and traditional formats I think it 's important that young people get to tell their own story so a lot of the dances that you 'll see basically outlay particular stories are significant to the young people but also through the traditions of Aboriginal culture we 're trying to make sure the give them a sense of what it means to be an Aboriginal person through a bit of local traditional stories and some traditional inspired desk where essentially workshopping dance ideas with the young people and they 're coming up with their own ideas of the dancers that they want to do and what they want to perform for nadel I 've learned that there 's more Aboriginal and like Stan 's he knows every of it is I just want to do it to learn stuff without my college and how it used to be this is a fantastic program to allow them to express themself it 's allowed the kids to actually explore their totem ask questions at home about their totem start to have Sochi artists with families which actually empowers the kids at who they are and cultural identities what we 're trying to do is facilitate a space where they could be comfortable with in who they are and I be proud of the negative people the chances of that our totems and it 's got star dancing at which represent the Southern Cross kind of traditional contemporary dance it 's about where we came from and how we gotta find out where we are my totem is in if you 're not and I 've made up a dance that shows how I express this in the totem do it 's important for them to learn about their heritage because it connects them back to their land and actually it 's important for them to know their stories and when they dance and its really magical speed especially in Aboriginal students that haven 't learnt their culture and their learning it 's free this contemporary way and the non original students that get to learn it and then they look at their Aboriginal friends a whole different way this program makes me feel proud to be an Aboriginal person Aboriginal dancing is really important it makes my own culture and my heritage and how reconnect with my mobile lot more I feel proud to the aboriginals I think it 's important for the indigenous youth on the Central Coast to be able to showcase their talent and their culture there 's not a lot of things like this on the coast I think it 's really good that as a community we all come together and work together to pursue a production that celebrates our culture and our people if we can plan a good seed of their cultural strengthen our identity and pride then that 's the best outcome I [Music] really enjoyed doing this program because it 's fun and we get to connect with other people it gives me more experience and I 'm just me more pride for on my culture I 'm having a lot of fun and my favorite thing about it is being with the friends and dancing you are definitely made new friends that I 've never thought that I would care about by expressing and dancing the aboriginal culture I believe that it will open up you know the mind of the wider community to connect with Aboriginal culture so as you watch them and all that you 'll feed dancing doesn 't just bring to the table a performance it reads to the table it brings teamwork it brings spirituality improves their oneness out that brings physical well-being out that friends all those things to the table seeing the kids need confidence their self-esteem is you know has has increased they were achieving things that they didn 't think they could do they 're having a fantastic time and it 's really heartwarming for a community member like myself to see these two having so much fun and being proud of who they are [Music] they will achieve so with them I think it 's important for us to share our culture and be proud of our culture and and build that connection between non-indigenous and indigenous people you know I could only hope that they read that program you know will continue in the future I 'd like to learn more about my Aboriginal history and do more programs like it I would like to learn more of Aboriginal history and I think it should be taught more input yeah I 'd love to do more programs like this I think the program was received very well i 'd like to hope that this is the start of more programming or a long going program it 's not just with the schools that we attended so that we can vision the relationship and build on what we 've done so that we can celebrate in all of the different and amazing things and make Australia amazing I just like to thank the council for giving us the opportunity to participate in your program it 's been a very successful project because the sense of achievement and the sense you watch them dance is amazing and not only that the schools have really engaged with the project and the dances and have voice to something like this to continue on not to make me more proud to be an Aboriginal person and also an Aboriginal working with these [Music] _"

apologies you any disclosures of interest of reports that are before council today no no no anyone on the screen okay we 'll move now to the confirmation of the minutes of the ordinary meeting held on the 23rd of february 2022 mr general manager you got nothing there no thank you mr minister i will resolve the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on the 23rd of february 2022 being received and confirmed move to the mayoral minute as it 's titled under the act it 's presented by the administrator i just want to mention that we were in sydney at the special conference for local government new south wales we tried to arrange a number of meetings with ministers but even the north coast floods and budget estimates they ended up being cancelled we did get the opportunity to meet with minister tuckerman the new minister for local government on the sideline the general i extended an invitation to visit central darlingshire council before she makes any decision on the future of administration she indicated that she would like to do that and and she would be consulting with the community on any actions she may take she has received a draft report from the consultant the office of local government sorry i 'll go back the office of local government has received the draft report yet to be presented to the minister uh so once she gets that she will need to read that then take it to cabinet and she indicated she would release or have discussions with the general manager and myself on that before a round of community consultation and we 've been laboring the point that that 's extremely important for the residents of the council area that that occurs and she indicated she would be happy that that happens subsequent to that we followed that up with a video conference last week and again we covered the same territory and the same sorts of commitments final rounds of community consultation on this community strategic planner occurring has occurred of that into our next budget a delivery plan and operational plan so last month certainly a highlight that the loan for the garbage trucks have paid off and we 're moving forward to establish reserves for that money there so make it very clear council 's finances are free and that we certainly need to be aware of that in everything we do and so certainly whilst there 's good grant funding out there it 's tied grant funding in most cases not unrestricted funding and the council last meeting agreed to lobby the federal government as with alga australian local government association for an increase in the grants that 's untied and it gives us flexibility for services in the area during question time there we had an issue on roads 2 400 kilometers 95 unsealed i looked at the map the other day it was just a massive red of closed roads and it 's certainly an issue that we have at the forefront all the time have you got a report on flooding in there club club manager yeah no there 's not okay i just lot of discussion concerning uh flooding and potential flooding at menindee and how that was managed we have a local emergency management committee and we have the state emerge state emergency management and rescue act is the guiding light that committee is there to plan and respond to disasters and emergencies it does not get involved in operational levels that 's the combat agencies and the ses is the combat agency i think they did a very good job in the planning and response for that for that event what is missing and they have a flood sub sub plan to the emergency plan which they rely on and guides their response what is missing is a floodplain uh management plan and that controls the development of floodplains and deals with mitigation measures on floodplain the general manager is moving uh to seek funding to enable that to happen and that will occur once we get some funding and deal with it there so i 'll move now to item eight financial reports cash and investments as of february 2022 thank you mr administrator i asked the finance manager to on your call uh thank you mr general manager and through mr from australia kevin yep can you hear me yep yep uh yeah through you mr administrator um the cash and investments uh at the end of um february we ended up with a balance of 5.794 million um there were three major receipts for that period uh including our federal assistance grant of 884 000 that was for the third quarter um we as you know we 've uh paid off our um garbage truck loan which is good um now that that loan 's paid off i don 't have too much to add thank you there 's another comment from the general manager i will resolve the council will receive and note the report item 8.2 financial performance report february 2022 mr general manager thank you miss administrator manager for um finance please yeah thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator uh again it 's a pretty much steady as we go report there 's not too much to report there 's no real variances to um talk about just at the moment ten thousand dollars but that still is favorable from where we thought we would be in our budget the only other comment that i would make is that um our rms works are doing quite well for this um period of time and we 've still got three months left in the year so i would expect those to exceed the budget thank you so i will resolve that council receive the report item 8.3 council 2021-22 current grants register mr general manager thank you mr i 'll ask the finance manager once again yeah thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator um the report stands as it is there 's been no new grants um received for the period of the report and i have nothing further to add i 'll resolve that we receive and note the report item 8.4 waste management reserve funding mr general manager thank you mr administrator um i 'll ask the finance manager to talk to the report please yeah thank you mr general manager three missed administrator uh as we 've discussed the loan for the garbage trucks uh the payments of the garbage trucks was um funds that was being that were being raised through the um annual charge for waste management so we now have the opportunity um to put those funds uh which amount to 13 750 per month into a reserve to fund ongoing waste management projects uh if we were to do this it would be estimated that we would be putting away 165 000 um a year which we could restrict to be solely spent on waste management as it should because it is being funded from the annual charge for waste management um we are well and truly into our budget deliberations now and so if council received this report i would propose that the waste reserve um be created during this budget and the mechanism for that is that we will show it as a reserve as part of the proprietorship if you like or rates funds on the balance sheet so that it is entirely transparent question mr general manager do we hold any waste management reserves at the moment through you mr administrator we don 't have a reserve have on our balance sheet the balance sheet is a provision for um landfill rehabilitation which is a legislative requirement and off the top of my head as at the 30th of june uh 2021 the balance of that provision was around 760 000 is that cash back currently that is not cash backed so why can 't we as of this month start putting that 13 750 into a reserve uh well we should technically do it through the budget process um what will actually happen the mechanism for that will be that that thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars that would normally go into the um uh payment of the garbage trucks will actually now sit in our restricted internally restricted funds for waste management we do restrict funds for waste management which is made up of the annual charge basically less any of any expenses okay so the next budget period we can transfer the current monies are saved from loan payment into that reserve that 's correct thank you i 'll resolve that we 've received a note received the report can i suggest administrator uh council establishes a reserve i uh for 2022-23 financial year and that it 's in on the establishment of that reserve that funds which is safe through the loan process is then put in into that reserve the opening balance into the opening balance okay can you tidy that up for minute to take mr general manager thank you so as item point one is going to be received receive the report item.2 will be that council 's establishes a waste reserve for the financial year of 2022-23 3 would be that uh funds or money saved uh through the loan payment uh during the 21 22 financial year to be put into the new reserve fund for waste management so moved resolved i should say okay we moved to item nine governance reports the model code of meeting practice mr general manager uh thank you mr administrator um as you 'll be aware that um late last year i think it was in december uh the model code of meeting practices came to council for public expedition uh we put it on display um we 'd receive no of meeting practices we 've actually included now that anyone in the community can actually now attend the public forum electronically through video conferencing um there is a procedure around that um that they go onto the council 's website and fill in a form and they send the form back to council um preferably the day before but um i think it was 8 50 a.m prior to the meeting we will then send them a link to the meeting or to the public forum and they can actually um video conference into the meeting that then it gives people opportunity who aren 't in will kenya um to actually be a part of the public forum for council so that 's now been included in to the model code of many practices thank you mr general just for the public council must adopt meeting practice and apply that code in the conduct of its meeting so we 're following that good news that we 're moving to that uh improved communication which was a commitment we said we would do we 've had now put the capacity to that we received the report council resolves the adopt dot the code of meeting practice and three a final copy of the codematic meeting practice is displayed on council 's website okay eight nine point two flood management for menindee lower darling correspondence thank you mr administrator um yes we received some correspondence from the lower darling group regarding um water activities down that end especially around the recent flooding what i

ivanhoe waste collection mr general manager through you thank you mr minister and ask the director of the shy services to talk to the report please uh through mr administrator um at the ordinary council meeting in december 2020 council resolved to consult the development community about the possibility of reducing waste collection services from two days to one day per week to improve operational efficiencies for councils waste operations there were received this report aims to resolve to reduce collection either i 've been working with uh daryl on the collectible rates for the waste in ivanhoe there 's some discrepancies there so council should complete a big collection audit to ascertain how many bins are being collected uh from all properties not just commercial properties uh and the fourth point there aims to the right to the commercial properties advising of the changes and giving them three months notice so we can implement this change in the new financial year i 'll resolve the council received the report to reduce the waste collection services in ivanhoe to one day per week effective from one july 2022 three complete a bin collection order to ascertain how many bins are being collected from commercial properties and reconcile this with information within the existing commercial waste charger four write to the commercial property owners advising of the change in service and offer free bins if you 're required the other bid will be charged so sorry administrator one one further point which may be an issue for council after this change has author of the report to any possibility of waste collection service just reductions as a result of this reduction in service that would be a matter of the budget coming up mr engineer if you can i 'll leave that the finance leave that with you thank you 11.3 regional roads report program mr general manager uh thank you miss the administrator and i asked the director for shire services to make company 's report please the regional roads repair program fund are applicable to councils up to the maximum dollar value of 400 000 per application um there 's a project in pune on the pinkery road which is deemed the highest priority on all our regional roads at the moment um the pavement 's failed and it 's estimated to be an 870 000 cost to uh reconstruct and seal 2.64 kilometers of that section of road this section of road is separate to the 61 kilometers being funded and this aims to consider allocation of 470 000 from our capital road station in the draft budget coming up subject to that okay mr general manager does this payments thinking it 's administrator the two bridges in question the telly walker bridge and the other bridge that i can 't quite remember the name of is included in this section so we will repair that issue with the roads again the abutment combat features will be included in this reconstruction thank you very much okay we 'll resolve the council receive the report consider the location of 470 000 from the capital roads allocation in the draft 2022-23 budget to match the funding amount to enable works to be clear that come from road component that will be from the regional road block okay original roads good the matching ground from regional road block grant thank you unsealed road maintenance grading procedure mr general manager thank you mr administrator and i asked the director for trial services to speak to the report please three missed administrator this report was provided um following the february heading regarding our unsealed road maintenance grading procedures presented to council the report outlines those procedures as well as the attachments whilst we 've got that there what 's the opportunity to to improve my mind there is none we um because of our vast road network work we we don 't have the capital funds to heavy maintenance great all roads the light maintenance grading that 's forms the majority part of the maintenance budget enables greaters to move along at four to five kilometers per day which enables us to maintain full length of road to reinstate crowns and roads and use scrapers to build up sand lines for next part of the question do we have major um spots that cause these these problems or they won 't spread across the network oh they 're widespread across the network because all our roads were um formed with natural formation um some of our roads have been improved with imported in gravel and extra fill to build up the vertical alarm from drainage a lot of them have just been maintenance created over the years together with maintenance grading and wind and wind erosion up to 25 millimeters a year the level of the road is below the natural surface of the road and in rain events or flood events they become periods um it 's an issue we aim to um to address that as part of our we 're doing that at the moment on the trider road and the trident of muller road so it 's a pro i 'm thinking i have to respond to the letter i it 's a long long term program additional we can 't afford to do it under our maintenance budgets um so just for your the local roads component of the flag is only spent on maintenance typically in each year so that 's about 1.6 million sorry 1.8 million and that 's used on maintenance to maintenance great sixteen hundred kilometers on sealed roads on their local roads we use the roads to recovery funding um to do capital works on our local roads um only in the event there 's urgent works required on regional roads that versus recovery allocation is spent on regional roads so the roads through calgary project this year as i 've said is aimed at addressing some problem problematic areas in ireland the year before we 've spent it on the baiden park road try and improve formation and address blood prone areas to lessen the impact of road closures okay i think this report and explanation just given by the engineer really highlights the issue we face with our unsealed roads and as much as we would like to address those issues it 's financially impossible unless there 's increased grants and that 's part of the reason why we we supported the alga submission to government to increase and roads to recovery there so that 's the facts if someone has an answer we 're happy to discuss it with them thank you and i will resolve that we receive and make the report and to a letter be prepared back to the letter writer okay water and sewer update thank you mr general manager thank you mr minister and once again i asked the um in this case i 'll ask the director for shore services to respond to the report please ah through you mr administrator i don 't really have anything to add to the report that 's current up to date i will just mention the three new towns last week to finalise their layout designs and and position of the water treatment plants uh glenda and jeff council planning department have been working with me and them to finalize the uh the da 's and our rafs etc so everything 's in hand and they 're um due to start after easter out whiteness first question mr general manager given the cost pressures being faced with diesel [Music] materials envisaged that we will have contract issues with the total budget not with this project but there 's a report further in here that addresses that another issue thank you i 'll resolve that we receive and note the report we 'll call item 11.6 services update mr general manager thank you mr australia again um i 'll ask for the director for shire services to talk to the report please uh three year ms administration there 's only one variance there the parks and gardens and sporting facilities budget has been exceeded as uh as the report was written in march where 37 000 overexpended without parts and gardens expenditure i 'm bearing that in mind the within budget so the total budget won 't be exceeded but that particular operational budget has been exceeded um that 's mainly due to us engaging cultural solutions to assist council with some of their operational works um what was unforeseen by me at the time when i prepared this budget last year we won 't have another qbr before april so we can do the adjustment at uh the april qbr mr finance manager yeah that 's correct okay i 'll result and note the report and two that the over expenditure in the parks and garden sporting facilities be adjusted in the april qbr roads and aerodromes report 11.7 the second manager administrator and uh i 'll ask the director for short services to respond to the report first now through this mr administrator there 's nothing to add on the rmcc works the state highway works uh the regional roads we have a 975 000 repair program which was due to start in march that 's been delayed due to the wet weather and the heavy patching works we 're doing for rms so that three kilometers know many road will commence in two weeks time uh the local roads we 're tracking well to deliver all the road recovery projects uh the wall street works in more canyon commenced with the curb new curving being commenced uh next week the title road in the middle tide road works uh nearing completion um and that 's where it is question mr general manager i note that we had natural disasters november december and january of flood events what impact will that have on additional works required and budget there oh yeah so we um we treated the flood events as as being funded by natural disaster as as all councils need to to try and repair damage and get rid of so since the event in november two grain crews have been working on the storm and flood affected areas there 's a number of roads that remain closed since that event and further events in december and january um we got declared natural disaster this week from that november event that took some some time but now council become can be confident that late and the by the government to help us what 's the value on that 's estimated 2.6 million about 2.6 million we 've expended although that was from the new this is a new natural disaster event from november last year so 2.6 million covers all our local and rojo and also the the work to open the roads up as well that 's right yeah so we 've expended some of that 2.6 money yep that the initial works guaranteed funding isn 't it as part of the response yeah it 's called emergency works and immediate restoration work so we had a flood event in march last year which we completed all works by december last year um and i 'm pretty sure the finance manager said we 've been paid that so we 've only just completed all that work and it rained again and damaged all the road works that we 've already done so now we 've got training crews going out to repair all that work again and you 've got any idea of included in that bill any idea of december january sort of estimates 'll put them in yeah what about november or does that cover the lot oh sorry the march event the march event was uh 1.3 million there was march 2021 or 22 march 2021 yeah two point 1.3 million from the march event yep and this event um that we 're working on now is the november event 2020 that was estimated at 2.6 million and the december january events you got any idea they 're all they 're all under the one event all right that 2.6 includes that so that declaration the other day was for the three events well whilst we have separate events in they just number events as different numbers matter which one we 're included in yep it just matters that we 're included okay so it 's not only that council can repair roads but all property owners who had infrastructure damage or stop losses or anything like that are now eligible to apply for recompense from the government just uh through the administrator that excludes the recent flooding of the darling river too so like the works coming uh the works along separate event and i included all that in our one estimate so that 's all included in the in that 2.6 2.6 million yeah when we complete the works it might be 2.2 million it might be 3.2 million as long as we keep records and evidence of our work thank you again for the roads issue that people concerned about not just our members of the public we try to maximize recovery of any funding we can get for our roads so it 's an ongoing battle so i will resolve for 11.7 receive and note the report meetings the menindee common finance assistant general manager or the finance manager thank you administrator um look it will just take that as being read please okay i will resolve that the information received from the indie common in relation to their finances on the 5th of march 2032. noted 12.2 white cliffs community association section

where water is pooling in roads and not draining off and becoming impassable so i will resolve that that that report be presented as per the nation thank you we have next year 's item seven the mayoral administration administrator minute uh look i 'd like to acknowledge particularly during the december january period the work of our staff particularly in relation to the flooding of the darling river and the efforts on ses and water and the many briefings attended our particular concern was is the need for a floodplain management plan and we 've already spoken to the local member roy butler and the general manager is following up funding opportunities for that work to proceed also note that council has lodged a natural disaster claim for works uh that arriving out of the the

communities behind it 's going to run for five weeks and particularly it 's focused on a increase in the financial assistance grants to council as you know we 've received that and that has been reduced over the years by the the commonwealth and we 're seeking a return to that to 1 of the commonwealth taxation revenue via a phase approach also seeking an investment in uh transport infrastructure through the local roads and community infrastructure program and an investment there to continue increasing uh stronger regional digital connectivity a package of 55 million over four years also seeking a targeted disaster mitigation program of 200 million dollars per annum to build i will table that and ask the general manager if he could include that into the mayoral minute and the recommendation is that one council 's support of the australian local government association alga which will contribute an estimated 6.46 billion per year to australia 's gdp and create 43 000 jobs two council agrees to support and participate in algos advocacy for their endorsed national funding priorities to express support for elders funding priorities identify local priority projects

reports um however i 'll hand over to the director for business services to make comments on these reports please uh thank you mr general manager mr administrator there 's no further comment on the the financial report commentary as such might throw to our manager finance director of business services um i 'll just talk briefly um about the cash and investments report firstly um for the period ending january 2022 uh we have a closing cash balance of seven million four hundred and thirty thousand six hundred and fifty two dollars um the most pleasing aspect of this report is that uh we 've managed to pay out the loan for the garbage trucks in its entirety uh this opportunity came about because um our friends at least pack had actually um miscalculated the time that the loan was actually to mature um by four months so um they actually came with to us with the um view that we could pay out the loan as at um january and the loan was paid out um on the ninth of february and we managed to save around about a thousand dollars in bank fees and uh interest um and that loan is now gone what was the monthly payment on that the monthly payment was thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars okay thank you uh jump to sorry we 've jumped to 8.2 i i will resolve that we receive and note the report and resolve that a report be brought forward on the establishment of a waste management reserve given that we 're going to have that uh saving monthly there so resolved we 'll go back to 8.1 financial reports council 2021-22 current grants register um if there 's no comments there there 's no further comments thank you i will resolve to receive and adopt the report okay item 8.3 financial performance report january 2022 mr general manager administrator i haven 't got anything to comment i believe the director of business services may want to talk to this report and there 's a additional appendix to the report thank you mr general manager and mr administrator we have a updated report and i 'll hand over to the manager of finance to go through that report this is what we actually presented in the paper yep thank you mr director and through you mr administrator um if you were to refer to the appendix of the report uh we 're basically showing a small surplus of fifty thousand dollars for one significant variance to talk about and that is in other revenues and that variance is a positive variance and uh it has come about because of a unbudgeted receipt from um the national carbon bank of australia um for our operating revenue we 've got a favorable variance of 426 000 for our operating expenditure we 've got an unfavorable variance of 376 000 and i 'll just talk about that briefly uh what the uh the story is there is that we 're actually doing a little bit better in our uh rms works so uh that 's reflected in um small variances in our employee costs and our materials and contracts and other expenses um our capital grants have come in uh currently at um four million five hundred and twenty one thousand um so basically our operating result before capital items is 151 000 which is 50 000 better than what we originally budgeted for and you might just uh provide for the public purpose the impacts of covert on our capital works uh yeah thank you mr administrator um with our capital works there has issue um as i understand it result revolves around um some delay in getting materials but also delays with contractors being able to fulfill their duties in a timely manner perhaps director of shire services could give a further breakdown on that i 'll i 'll operate a little bit more when i get to my reports okay thank you what we 'll do is resolve the council receive and note the report so resolve we move to item include the appendix and we will include the updated attachment could be appended to the minutes please we adopt those okay the quarterly budget review as of the 31st of december 2021 8.4 mr general manager 3u thank you mr administrator i haven 't got any further commentary however the director for business services or the manager for finance comment on this report uh thank you mr general manager mr administrator i 'll hand over to our manager finance team for the comment yeah thank you mr director and three mr administrator as at the um period closing 31st of december 2022 we reported a operating surplus of 92 000 before both um for the operational budget and the capital budget for the operational budget um we 've reduced our um budgeted roads to recovery funding by some 429 000 and that is due to um we had the opportunity last financial year to do additional projects which were performed and completed so they were funded in that year so for this year because of it 's a five-year-old recurring model our funding is now reduced for by 429 000 and conversely our capital works projects that would normally be funded by that amount have also been reduced there is a small increase in our aboriginal water and sewage scheme that we didn 't budget for initially that is because there are incremental increases that we weren 't advised of at the time we put the budget together we 've now been advised to vote so the budget has been amended uh similarly with our block funding there 's an operational component to the block funding that wasn 't included in the original budget and that has now been included there will be some reductions in the grant funding to be our capacity to have those works uh done and a lot of that is due to the covert issues um assembly with our capital budget um capital works have been reduced by the same amount as our grant funding for water treatment plants and again as i 've already alluded to some of the roads projects have been reduced because of the reduction of funding in roads to recovery and that 's it for that one just a question does the quarterly budget review reflect the additional works we 're doing for union bend access road for the will can you wear uh not at the moment i think that is um something that will be addressed in the march um qbr and in any does it also include the additional grants that we 've received in over the period are the additional grants are in there yeah thank you okay well that council received the second quarter budget review as of the 31st december 2021 adopt the variations to council 's 2021-22 annual budget three notes projected operating surplus for the financial year 20 21-22 562 000. for note reduced for 21.22 to 18 million 270 a reduction of two two million six hundred and seventy nine thousand dollars eight point five outstanding rates and charges update do we have daryl no we don 't have daryl mr administrator um if you want to talk to mr general manager yeah actually i will talk to it um i think this report is actually well laid self-explanatory um there is a still fair amount of work to be done in this area around uh outstanding rates um and at the moment we 're sitting around about 879 000 outstanding rates for water um council rates fees charges etc so um it 's a work in progress and potentially especially with unpaid rights uh there 's potential of another land sale to come up be coming up very soon so maybe potentially sometime this this calendar sorry um i also asked um the director for um corporate services may want to add something more to the report thank you mr general manager in in terms of the debt recovery exercise going forward um we have come up with a draft debt for the mandate minimum 25 days that 's been crafted over a period of time and canvassed around the the team so we 're now ready to go to um to exhibition on that as far as the the overdue charges are concerned uh no further comment to add to what this general manager has made and uh yeah and the sale of potential sale of properties uh flying paying rates is on the radar as well thank you just a question on page 22 we 've got notice debt type we 've got rates rates and water water could someone explain how that breakup has been arranged don 't have anything else santa just demonstrated i think we 'll take that on yeah okay thank you i will resolve that council one receive and note the report to receive a further report of the ordinary media council in april 2022 on the progress of efforts to reduce outstanding rates and charges three the draft debt recovery policy on public exhibition for a minimum of 28 days at the close of the exhibition period report to be prepared for council item 8.6 smart water meters meter reading and billing update mr general manager yes thank you uh mr administrator um again our as as the previous report the acting rights officer is on leave so once again uh i think the report is self-explanatory as well written out and well put forward so i recommend that we just proceed with the recommendations as listed in the report i will resolve that council receive and note the report to receive the next quarterly report on water meter reading billing and collections at the ordinary meeting of council scheduled for the 27th array april 2022 we 'll move to governance reports 9.1 unsealed road policy and reporting procedure mr general manager thank you mr administrator um as uh would be aware that uh over the last uh 12 months we 've had a number of issues around our unsealed road network with signage road closures and just the way we 've communicated so we 've reviewed the actual unseal road policy and also produced a internal procedure um normally we wouldn 't put the internal procedure out for expedition but however in expedition with the reviewed road police answer your road policy um this will uh give you know some reassurance that there is a process in place uh for opening and closing of roads and monitoring of growth which are closed uh this report and the procedure and the report was put together uh by myself however i 've spent a fair bit of time in consultation with the engineering staff on how we proceed uh around our closures and opening of roads so reports before you thank you mr general manager this does come at a cost would you like to explain that cost and the impact of that on our road maintenance please yes um there is a cost as as in the report um thirty three thousand five hundred and ninety nine dollars for the actual um having someone on call over a 12-month period now while the cost is is being put together as a probably the upper limit being that someone is on call after hours being after the normal 4 30 p.m and on saturday and sunday um it also the cost is worked on a weekend two one on being on a saturday and one being on a sunday which both times both of those call-outs are paid based on at least two working hours which is paid at double time uh and also you 've got a non-cost uh core allowance as well for a period of 187 dollars so it does all add up but um when you look at the actual cost of 33 599 that equates to approximately 17 kilometers of unsealed road to repair after traffic has been traveling across it after a reasonable range so so the cost while it might come at an impact the cost of repairing say 20 30 50 kilometers of road thank you mr general manager and i note that central darling has a road length and the length of the unsealed road is 2 168 kilometers which is 95 percent of our road and certainly when we get rainfall events we 've had over the past 12 months and beyond large numbers of complaints regarding opening enclosures of road so i think this represents the majority of the organisation in response to 's a cost we 're going to have to wear but hopefully we can pick up increased grants and road projects to try to reduce that length of unsettled road i will resolve the council receive the report to endorse the unsealed road with road reporting procedure to be placed on public exhibition for 28 days following public exhibition of reports to be presented to council for any changes made and adoption of the policy endorsement of the policy and procedure three on the adoption or endorsement of the road with wet weather policy and procedure and on-call ross to be implemented for the road condition and that will be referred to the general manager for implementation so resolved we now move to 8.2 human resource management activities mr general manager thank you mr administrator i have no further commentary on the report however i asked the human resource officer to make commentary on her report please thank you general manager no further comment to be made on the report one thing i will comment on is regarding the vacancies that we do have and the level of interest we postcode with regards to the positions between the shy so that 's pleasing to see in that regard so i hope thank you mr general manager i note that a structure just correct me if i 'm wrong is increased by to the truck driver and governance officer yes mr administrator um the governor 's officer we 're looking at additionally however i don 't believe we 'll be looking at um engagement of a governance officer in the next three months what time we go through the recruitment process and the truck driver i believe is already existing in the structures just has never been filled okay thank you and i also note that under the local government act within 12 months of the election of a council noting that central dallas new zealand administration i 'd like to keep to that schedule so look forward to receiving a report on the organisation structure for endorsement yes okay well i 'll include that at three in the resolution i will resolve the council receive the report to endorsing is an increase if you 've already of two if you driver is an existing position what 's into the structure okay endorse the increased full-time equivalence of 21.22 by two full-time equivalents to ensure business continuity three a report be presented on the organisation the structure for council consideration hey 9.3 community engagement update uh mr general manager i 'm happy to deal with it it 's a good report and we certainly increased our media and social uh footprint across under the employment of the engagement officer and noting that our website now so it was previously any comment yeah thank you mr administrator yes sir my commentary on this since we 've engaged the community engagement officer our footprint in the social media sphere has definitely increased um and i 'll actually call on the social our community engagement officer just to give us a bit of an overview of how that how much of that has increased in the in the likes and the distribution of media thank you general manager um yeah um have you got me it 's all right i think i 've got some connectivity issues here um in regard to the council second of july as council 's aware we 've had some very positive feedback both from community and from government agencies as far as searchability and being able to find information that um is required it still needs a lot of work um and i 'm working with the general manager and other departments to make sure that that is completed in a timely manner that was slowed down a bit because of the concentration on the covert outbreak in august as you will see mr administrator from the graphics we have a heavy footprint on our road condition report which is updated as soon as it comes through it 's a very important part of our rum website and one that i very much concentrate on um our flood information um page we have had a very good impression on so that 's information that people are sourcing uh i think the interesting part is a lot of our um access to the website and also to facebook is via mobile phone so um that 's very much an indication that um both those resources are accessible by mobile an increase in our following on facebook that 's been gradually increasing over the past um on my assessment over two years but very definitely uh the past 12 months we 've gone to 2700 followers and considering we have a population of 1800 i think that 's pretty outstanding we have a number of government departments as well as our local politicians following that page so they 're very much able to keep up with what 's going on um good relationships with our media outlets um and i 'm actually quite pleased with the way things have been going uh if you have any questions mr administrator i 'm happy to answer them no i think it 's a fantastic report and it 's very good in the in this agenda we 've dealt with two issues that came out of why central darling was in administration financial uh position in relation to waste management trucks and communication so certainly welcome this report and i will resolve in this receiving note the report and congratulations to our community engagement officer and all staff on the fantastic effort if certainly will thank you mr corporate services reports the ict strategic plan three year update mr general manager thank you mr minister no i haven 't got any further commentary however i 'll ask the director for business services uh my commentary on the report please thank you mr general manager and mr administrator this is an update to the report that was previously tabled uh several council meetings ago the original migration project from physical environment to a cloud-based environment was supposed to have been finished at the end of september however uh because of a couple of the the main programs that we have which have practical plus our accounting system content manager which is our records management system neither of those suppliers were able to do what they needed to do to upgrade to the new platform until so consequently through december late december through to january through to february now um that upgrade or update has essentially been completed uh so we 're now looking at the uh the migration project being completed as of the additional things that we 've done we 've created an help with the the functionality efficiency of addressing issues as they arise going forward looking at uh other programs like internal maps pulse and info council their work works in progress uh and as we get more okay with those they will then start becoming into play with other peripheral equipment that we 're looking forward to they replace one of the multi-function device fleet which is our printer scanners etc that decision has been made we are proceeding to replace those devices uh we end up with a better deal than what we we had on a three-year three-year timeline and uh with the new platform and the new uh setup we should be able to reduce the wastage significantly the other items there are all works in progress uh video contract and reset up their respective conference rooms at the chambers and volcanic depot the other three items there are again are works of progress there 's no other add-on comments to add to the report thank you and over back to you mr um just in terms of um i know the report hasn 't got any track and with the budget work we 're doing yes mr administrator we 're not tracking the budget just a question we have a public forum prior to the meeting and one of the issues that 's been raised with me that uh it 's okay if you will can you you can in person is there the ability to come in from an indie or white cliff into that public forum and if no can we you have a look at the options yeah so miss administrator i 'll answer that question um part of our code of meeting practices uh which was put up at the last council meeting uh we 've written into that um that um that ability to uh for the public forum to come in we 're also in the process of uh present moment is amending our um public access forum um application uh i 've been working with the community engagement officer nyea on putting uh we 'll put that out to a public expedition and a report be coming back in march for adoption thank you mr general manager i will project status update report and there 's no other recommendations so we 've got that okay we 've got 10.2 commit central darling shy continuous improvement pathway cip program canvas manager thank you mr administrator i 've got no further commentary on this direct business services may wish to add more thank you mr general manager mr administrator this program has been put together with our statewide mutual um uh focuses on three it 's a self-assessment um exercise focusing on three main topics claims management storm water trees and tree roots it 's a it 's a yes or no type response to a series of questions so that we can benchmark how we perform against the greater council community the reasons for the program are as noted that it 's recent and the benefits are again i know that there 's for people to read at their convenience thank you so overall um cdsc compares favorably uh against the state average the claims management area is uh probably the biggest fear it 's about 30 ah that 's mainly due to us being able to to finalize claims has been our biggest hurdle thank you i will resolve we receive the report to support council 's ongoing participation in the cip program service reports employment zones amendment to central darling local environment plan 2021 mr general manager thank you mr administrator um yes there 's the port reports in front of you we did have a workshop yesterday which um the senior planner myself uh of course yourself mr administrator the director for shire services uh and also our eho all attended we discussed the report in detail also too that the recommendation from dpie that council considers an ru5 and a e4 general industrial uh zones uh last night i sent an email to confirm um dpies thinking um i like to make uh an amendment to the recommendations being led to one that we receive and note the report two that that two delegate authority be given to the general manager and uh in discussion with the planning officer negotiator new planning zones with dpie on the best of the outcomes for kenya and the shire as a whole i 'll talk to that in the still got some concerns around the ru5 um and then we would like to go back to dpi e and just have a bit further discussion on uh their thinking around the ru5s and and the the general industrial zones just to make sure that it actually fits and which are in place at the present moment and can you explain the benefit of the public um why are we looking at questioning that particularly the use of the codes and client development um we can go to the plan don 't inspire to be a planner um yeah i 'm going to ask the senior planning officer on that question thank you administrator and general manager the issue is that iu5 is basically a residential zone and there are questions whether uh all parts of the infrastructure set could be actually utilized within that zone because we have a lot of work by service providers essential energy telstra and they already have issues with our residential zones and also the fact that the current compliant development codes that have been extensively expanded and will not work within the residential we just need to discuss that with the department there may be opportunities to put uh schedules within those steps that we were being able to use the iu5 zone and be able to utilize the steps but that 's quite important because the department 's actually restructured or set into 10 now and all the service providers use the steps thank you thank you mr general manager could you read out the recommendations again just so the minute taker gets those clear clearly yeah first one receive and note the report two delegate authority to the general manager and in consultation with the planning officer to negotiate new planning zones with dpie on the best outcome for kenya and the shire as whole so the reason being put in the shower as whole is an iu5 if we amend it it will have impact on other towns being menindi ivanhoe as well and i 'm happy to so resolve those recommendations as the general manager read out we moved to page 14 9 infrastructure contribution plan noting the spelling of contribution there mr general manager thank you mr administrator discussion around the infrastructure contribution plan um at this stage we feel that council is not ready for a contribution plan one being the costs involved in actually producing the plan two with with upcoming projects being major infrastructure works around projects probably not likely in the short term and also too this is new legislation which has been put in we feel that we should sit back and wait and see what actually happens right across the state with this new legislation therefore we 'll i 'm i 'm asking that we defer their um defer the action uh of um of uh of the contribution plan um until the actual legislation is actually implemented properly and better down thank you mr general manager just considering that recommendation is it possible to list a budget for such a plan in next year 's a line item in next year 's budget in case we do need to proceed i don 't want to be scrambling to find the money yeah i think um while we 're in an actual budget preparing budget for the next financial years we can think we should be getting a more definite cost on on what the actual cost is going to be to actually develop such an infrastructure yep i certainly agree and i 've got no problem in deferring it but i 've been that deferring if we do need to proceed with it i 'd like the budget there to be able to do it next year so

running across the two areas and we also require uh to negotiate with the native title tribunal that registered native title body corporate uh regarding an indigenous land use agreement for use of their land and that has to accompany the plan of management and so to finalize the plan of management we have to do negotiation with the buckingham pbc which we will be initiating this week and we

april on the cobb highway uh transport new south wales has sent the designs and the raf some environmental paperwork through for the next section i 'll be working on estimating and commencing that in april the regional roads repair program has been a slight delay there that work will start in march we need to finish that by june that 's three kilometers of reconstruction and rrp the local roads the roads recovery sections of trotter road and the muller try to road are in progress and they 'll be completed by march the wall street reconstruction and new curb and gutter will be programmed to commence in march and be completed by june the union ben road has been on hold since the high river water levels that 's anticipated to commence again in april once the water recedes and the water 's pumped off was dry enough to work there so that stage one works only um water new south wales have been passionate for the design and upgrade for that road to seal that and it 'll be a further report come to council about the road ownership after the union benefit management 's been completed and easements formalised any comment on the print area road uh the pinkery road is being changed five to twelve so another seven kilometer section is being worked on at the moment that 's a ten day uh stabilization process so ceiling crews coming in the first week of march to seal another seven kilometers that that another four million dollars for uh progress payment on the pinkery road by the end of march we met with the federal and state governments um they 've agreed to bring that milestone from april back to march to help council with cash flow cover that work there 's fairly significant um expenditure going out across all local regional and state highway works excuse me just pull regarding the milestone payments are they payments in advance now or are they payments in um in work completed work completed so originally got a advanced payment so we 've utilized that already and now we 're just going for as we complete work we get money in uh federal government pays differently they 're paying on milestones yep um so they 're 50 of the 25 million 12 and a half million is paid on milestones and that 's completion of certain kilometers of road the state is administered through transport new south wales and they 've seemed to mirrored the federal government milestone payments um in our last discussion i asked it was possible to do it like our normally monthly or storm damage or anything like that if you can show actual expenditure and your forecast expenditure for the coming months they can pay on a monthly basis i 've had no response to that from the state yet they were looking into it to get back to us at the next meeting i 'll follow a bit more up on that one we 're going to appoint the deputy premier no not at this stage i 'm sorry uh and further just on the premier road the estimated expenditure um has hasn 't been approved yet as the federal budget federal the people haven 't set budgets or hasn 't been adopted or anything at that level yet this is estimated increased security yep yeah so we haven 't_''_3340.4 we 're carrying on work as normal uh worst case scenario is that we 'll expand 25 million and not steal the pancary road okay mr general manager 3u is it possible to include in your roads and aerodrome report uh update on the poon carry raid yeah there is a report that comes in every two months so obviously wondering if we just have a brief update to put in there any um you want as a standing monthly update before yeah yeah yeah anything uh you know um that 's the word i 'm looking for unusual there that was in there if you could do that that would be great i 'm happy to deal with the report i 'll resolve will receive a natal report uh water and sewer update 11.6 mr general manager uh thank you mr administrator uh i 've got no further um commentary on it director for show services my wish to make commentary three miss administrator all operational budgets for water supply and sewer running to um running to budget or just under uh the capital works the main one the new three new water treatment plants diver know what this more canya we submitted section 60 approval with 100 design for those treatment plans on the 31st of january the updated program had works commencing in white cliffs in march as the manager of finance alluded to there has been some knock-on effects from coburn 19 particularly with steel timber systems australia are fabricating what they can offsite there 's been some delays as well with stainless steel uh council require a certain grade of stainless steel which is overcome by at the moment in that manufacturing industry also the civil contractors engaged by membrane systems australia are proving problematic they need to be whilst they 're sourced in south australia they need to be certified as new south wales under the building code is that correct yeah yeah so that 's an issue which membrane systems australia are sorting out because we told them they couldn 't come and start unless they were certified under new south wales so at the moment they are um hoping still to start in march but it 's highly likely they 'll be deferred till april now there will be a impact on [Music] on finance i estimated based on starting the construction on january um notwithstanding that we look to receive 1.5 million for works completed to date before the end of financial year and section 60 approval that grew problematic getting them out timely how 's that going it 's going and because we 've kept him involved the whole way through you know 25 50 75 design process over six months um they 're fully aware of the project and they 've shown a real interest in central darling 's projects i don 't i don 't really know why it 's unusual but they 've been helpful and they assure us that they 'll approve and give us section 60 within 15 days excellent i will resolve that we receive and note the report and call item 11.6 services update mr general manager through you thank you mr i think we 'll just go straight back over to the director for try services thank you for the

qba i might have to take that a notice mr administrator i don 't i don 't i don 't have an answer why we 've overspent on the costing and contractors payments and have a look there um it 's unusual for me at this time of the year to be over on parks and gardens so i 'd probably suggest uh that 'd be including mulling with the excess uh rain we 've had in the last few months probably you would be mowing because look um happy to take you take that on notice and make comment i 'm more concerned about the balance of the year that that we 've made an adjustment in the budget yes they 'll come up operationally the budget won 't exceed uh but that line item from parks and gardens is already over so that can be reconciled with other under expenditure yeah thank you yep uh the capital works i notice we 've got a number of grants in there how are they all tracking through mr ministry there is a grants report attached by the finance officer which i haven 't got in front of me but um both shy services and business services are working together as well as um having some assistance from morrison piper and manage equip make milestone payments um that sort of thing so from my understanding

and other future projects given recent fund from refund from the australian tax office and i would put include also in their reserve for leave entitlements so any comments i 'll make a comment thank you mr administrator um the report actually refers to a percentage of profit that 's actually not correct it should refer to net on cost thank the finance manager please thank you for that and we 'll

bank balance was 6.23 million and it is tracking okay 7.623 uh and i 'll just um bring attention to our loan which is now 82 hours which is very good lands my heart so thank you very much for that so when you develop the reserve report that certainly provides some opportunity for reserve flowing to waste management and also contribution to their currently um we are paying 13 750 per month that goes towards the financing of those garbage trucks that money is funded out of uh the waste management annual charge so that will then represent additional funds that we can use for waste management and perhaps other projects and is there a need to establish a wage management plant reserve i don 't know the long-term strategy and it 's something that the general manager and the director may turn their mind to whether we 're going to run garbage trucks or look at some opportunity for contracting again it 's a discussion for the upcoming budget because we will be free of this loan i believe that 's at the 30th of june so there will be additional funds that we can perhaps look at spending in other projects thank you um did i resolve to receive and note the report item 7.3 council 2021 22 current grant register mr general manager through you um thank you mr strata no i do not have any further comments at this stage on the current register i note that we have any program for that yet um

code of meeting practice to go out to public expedition for 28 days for comments three the a report to return to council following the public expedition i think there 's a maximum of 42 days it 's

local government um because we didn 't have an election we can deal with it now so there 's no issues there but we 've been through the code it governs the practice of meetings so i will resolve receive the report resolve to adopt the amendment to the code of meeting practice and sorry mr general manager if you could just read the words please um following public exhibition a report to come to council for adoption in accordance with the the guidelines in the code just to tell you that thank you 8.3 morris and piper support for grant application writing reporting mr general manager thank you mr administrator um as the report uh outlines we 've engaged a consultant morrison piper to write grants for us the last six months out of that we 've applied for five thousand five million eight hundred thousand dollars worth of grants uh three projects were approved around about 3.1 projects weren 't approved that was equivalent to two million dollars and there 's uh six nearly seven hundred thousand dollars of pending projects so uh the return on our investment of uh forty six thousand eight hundred dollars for their services for that six months i think i believe is a good return investment therefore i 'm recommending that uh we go again with the morrison pipeline for another six months this time we 'll be looking at morris and piper also managing our funding deeds we 've in the past we 've struggled with milestone reporting and acquittal and morris and piper will be assisting council in that area to ensure that we are compliant with the funding dates and what 's that the increase cost is no increased cost it 's just another forty six thousand eight hundred dollars yep just by the way i comment this council depends very much on the operating with through by obtaining grants and i think this is an excellent investment we 're getting expertise bringing that along with what our staff can bring so i 'm happy to resolve that advisory in accordance with the local government act 1993 section 553 services being sought for such as specialized major three endorsed the general manager to engage morrison and piper for grant application and writing for an overall cost of forty six thousand eight hundred dollars call items 8.4 human resource management mr general manager uh thank you mr administrator um i would actually ask the human resource officer to talk to

it 's been identified right across new south wales in the local government sector that uh all positions um are very difficult to fill particularly from a regional perspective so that 's going to

general manager thank you mr australia once again i ask that the senior planner talk to a report um the requirement for the development control plan has come about because we 've actually got quite a few development placements occurring in kenya at the moment and the councils that are assisting with the assessment of these projects have actually requested that a development control plan be put in place as soon as possible um at the moment uh central darlington council does not have a development control plan so other than the very few controls within the environmental plan there is no control for development across the whole shire we propose to put a basic we 'll look at other counters development control plans and take note of those and try and use the controls that work and we 've also got to put a development control plan in place specifically now that we have the will canyo heritage conservation area thank you mr general managing here for the cover thank you from the planning officer um with the plans we 've just adopted uh the plan plans and management and stuff like that how does this this report this proposal tie in does that tie into any of the previous report or does that help or assist if you can just clarify that for us please um yeah the development control plan we will have to develop a heritage development control plan now that we have the will kanye heritage conservation area being implemented in the local environmental plan and also the fact that we don 't have enough controls to dictate what happens with building envelopes across the shire so that is actually a requirement and also because the two projects that have been put forward for the bonnie street site and the control plan will assist in that and how does that what 's the meaning for well how does that affect uh local residents in will kenya um it well the development control plan like in a local environmental plan we will consult with the community uh about the development controls that we put in place and generally a development control plan is to try to ensure that the community gets the outcomes for the built environment that they actually want that is actually the purpose for development control plan and it actually goes hand in hand with the local environmental plan which also uh this year is scheduled to be revised and updated okay thank you um can i ask one question yeah sorry director of engineering services yeah through you mr ministry glenda um in the past um exempt development from from education police aboriginal housing doesn 't if they 're exempt development they don 't have any council input or we 're not required to inspect any of their construction does this um development control plan enable us to have more input into other government agencies and exhibit would be unable to comment on those type of developments is if the development is on crown land and then they use part five of the environmental planning and assessment act where they can actually approve their own developments whereas if it 's on land outside crown land the local environmental plan and the development control plan will actually enable council to have comment on the development glenda correct me if i 'm wrong i unders i 've certainly in the past as a planner um when the crown does development they do typically come and consult and ask what conditions council may wish to impose and we 've always fell back on our development control plans um will that process occur here uh they technically yes they should but in reality um government agencies have the right to do as they like technically they 're outside the local environmental plan and the development control plan that majority of agencies do pay respect to the local environmental plan and the development control plan and they 'll typically come to council and ask if you 've got concerns the other one go through the certification process and inspection under the act no no agencies i 've done i 've employed private certifiers to do the inspections it 's actually a different type of approval um they have uh i 've dealt with private certifiers that do this kind of approvals so it 's completely outside the normal process the only requirement is that they actually comply with the building code of australia yes okay i will deal with and this will be a draft development control plan which will go out in exhibition yes and um we probably should put it on exhibition for at least six to eight weeks yes no no that 's fine um but it 's a draft plan and the draft will come back to council to have a look at prior to placing it on exhibition correct correct thank you okay i 'll deal with the matter council resolves that i 'll resolve that we receive the report and note the information to endorse the preparation of and i 'll add the word draft development control plan for central darling shire council local government area prior to for endorsement prior to advertising as required so resolved now i 'll call item 10 a confidential we move into confidential and i will resolve that council move into confidential to consider matters listed in the confidential section of the agenda in accordance with 10 i2 a _"

council that invitation was forwarded through the local member community strategic plan we 're looking at moving to the next stage of that with martin bass and planning is underway for a series of workshops across the shire in a covert safe way i 'd just like to congratulate everyone through the lamc and those involved with the covered response i know there 's been a lot of work put in there

that committee we 'll move to item 7 financial reports outstanding rates and charges update mr general manager thank you mr administrator i 'd like to call on the acting rates officer just to talk to the report and highlight anything in the report which is of value to council thank you mr general manager through to you mr administrator um there 's no particular part of the report which i believe requires highlighting i would add though that it it is unavoidable that we do continue through the current uh recovery processes and filter out properties where the only option will be a sale for unpaid rates i would anticipate putting forward a report in february recommending the sale of a number of properties that no other revenue exists in terms of finding recovery of those monies thank you uh very much look i make comment that the recovery of debt is extremely important for an organization like central darling and mr general manager could you forward this report to olg 's consultants are looking at the future of central darling please i think it 's important that they understand that this is a major issue going forward for the council 's sustainability with those comments i will proceed to resolve that report at the ordinary council meeting in february 2022 on the progress to reduce outstanding rates and charges we 'll now move to item 7.2 i 'll call that smart water meters meter reading and billing update as general manager thank you miss administrator uh once again i think the report is well laid out well written and self-explanatory um however i 've just asked the acting rights officer just to talk to the report and highlight anything in his report uh i think i believe uh thank you mr general manager through to you mr administrator i believe uh the report reflects good progress uh returned to a proper quarterly billing program uh which uh should improve collections uh making the individual bills more more affordable uh in conjunction with the debt recovery matters previously discussed um the completion of smart metering was anticipated to be completed this year we 're currently trying to through the director of shy services maybe i 'll add some more information but we 're trying to coordinate i guess the delivery of those devices and uh supply the contractors necessary to bring to been delays uh i believe the contractors have potentially got a backlogger work so as soon as we can get those uh arrangements in place uh completion of smart metering in uh ivanhoe for filtered and in kenya will further enhance our program or enhance our prospects of maintaining our schedule of quarterly billing uh thank you very much just one question the non-government community organizations um i know 23 overdue charge how 's progress going with those organizations it has stalled somewhat through the covered uh situation um we 'd anticipate those discussions to to pick up and progress over the next few months now that uh the covet situation has uh settled or stabilized somewhat um that 's that 's about all i can really add to that thank you very much the other comment is the restriction of water supply policy i noticed that 's coming back next month correct that that is the proposed schedule to have those procedures in place thank you very much look forward to that because it 's a very effective tool to manage outstanding debt okay i will deal with the receive the next quarterly report on water meter billing and collections at the ordinary meeting scheduled for the 23rd of february 2022. i will move to item 7.3 cash and investments as of september 21 uh mr general manager i 'm happy to deal with the report unless there 's some additional comments by exception please uh thanks mr administrator um manager of finance is there anything extra you like had to your report uh thanks mr general andrew and through you mr administrator uh no look there 's nothing else that i would particularly like to add the only thing that that is of uh importance is perhaps that our loan is almost hundred thousand and that 's very pleasing thank you just a question how are we going on recovery of money from the australian taxation office the amount of standing balance there um yes actually i i had a conversation with our auditors um last night regarding the gst and we actually went through the account together and basically uh

general manager thank you miss administrator um yes we 've gone through and revised our register of delegations um due to a number of uh star staff changeovers also as well as new roles uh in of years we 've also updated the financial delegation to reflect those roles as well and those delegations are being forwarded on to the relevant staff we use a software system which tracks our delegations of authorities which is regularly updated on a monthly basis so this is part of the compliance side of council under the governments just so that we meet our legislative requirements thank you miss administrator thank you mr general manager um just a question will you be having a discussion with the staff about their delegations and the exercise of those so mr administrator um staff have been sent out their delegations and asked to make comment on all their delegations so we 've done it um through emails and without sitting down and actually getting everyone together is a bit impossible at this stage so uh i 'm pretty certain that most of the staff are aware of their delegations they 've been given uh even though that the document is a lengthy document it is being broken up into uh different um delegations for each officer and they 've all got a copy the report and to endorse the attached delegations and noting mr general manager that you or you do i need the delegations are to you the and then you sub delegate them that 's correct thank you move to item 8.2 the menindee native fish hatchery scoping study report uh good progress seems to be made there mr general manager thank you mr australia yes it 's um it 's taken some time however due to covert to get this far with the scoping report um originally we should have been finished about 12 months ago with the scoping report but the pandemic has slowed us up a fair bit in the in the fact that we couldn 't meet face to face also too we wanted to do a trip to narendra to look at the fish hatchery at uh look at fish hatchery there [Music] so the the scoping court 's been finalized it has been forwarded on to the uh department of um agriculture and the federal government and we 're waiting now for their uh

been updated it 's been lodged with the office of the information privacy commissioner um complies with all their requirements um this is a document that doesn 't need to go on a public exhibition it 's a statutory requirement and um our recommendation is that we adopt it thank you i will resolve that we receive the report to adopt the so resolved item 8.4 media relations policy um happy to deal with that if there 's no comments thank you mr mister i know there 's no further comments i will resolve that we receive the report to adopt the media relations policy and place the policy in council

resource officer may we speak to a report and thank you general manager and through the administrator and the report is as is um probably just a couple of points of note that have changed since the report was done was that the environmental engineer and the site engineer have now confirmed appointments so there are two candidates coming on board uh later this year with regards to those two positions otherwise the report stands as is uh thank you and i note that uh we 've um successful in its 13 positions for the funding of that project the 1 000 jobs package that is good and note the report um item eight point six mda delegates report it 's self-explanatory uh mr general manager i 'm happy to deal with it there 's no comments no comments thank you mr administrator i will resolve to receive and note the report 8.7 um corresponds to resilience new south wales uh the appointment of six regional directors noting that ours was ken harrison i have congratulated him on that appointment in discussions and i will resolve the council receive the report corporate services reports additional fees and charges to be added to the central darling council operational plan uh mr general manager thank you mr ministry we 've uh there 's no corporation uh corporate services report so 10.1 is the additional fees and charges i 'll ask that the senior planner talk to this report please general manager and administrator um this additional list of fees and charges is to cover services that council is already providing and the fees and charges were emitted from the council operational plan 2021 2022 and it also included where we needed to update the fees in accordance with neighboring councils operational plans for their fees and charges for the same services and that 's where we took our fees and charges from we also spoke to the service providers within council to see if those speech lodges were practical and they all agreed okay thank you thank you so mr general manager i assume though though we didn 't publish the list we 're still operating on the previous year 's fees and charges that 's correct mr administrator um yes we 're not charging any fees and charges at the present moment the um we need to do 28 days public consultation before and bring to bring it back to council for adoption before we can actually implement the fees and charges so the fees and charges with the advertised last year they would be standing standing correct yeah thank you i will resolve that council receive the report to the additional fees and charges to be placed on public exhibition for a minimum of 28 days three at the close election period exhibition periods a report to be prepared for council to take into account any submissions uh thank you mr general manager um any comments uh no i haven 't uh any further comments however the director for short services may wish to add some commentary to the report uh through mrs administrator the um report seeks to go to community consultation on aspects of that master plan for the streetscapes there 's um drawings and and proposals on how our streetscapes could be improved and looked for for our improvements in all towns there 's also the third resolution addresses the option to pursue future grant grants for the for funding to be able to implement some of this but in the first instance we want to go to community consultation and get feedback on the proposed streetscapes thank you question mr general manager will we be in a position to take this to the community uh when our consultant with the community strategic plan is out there i just don 't want to keep going back to the community if we could combine the consultations yeah thanks mr administrator um yes but talking to the consultant who 's doing the community strategic plan problem community strategic plan so i think in this case it would play to keep the two separate while yes the consultant can mention it that there is um consultation around this um i think it 's beneficial to keep the two separate at this stage okay take that on advice i think it would be good to mention it because it fits in with our locality-based planning so i 'll leave that with you i will resolve the council receive the report to proceed with community consultation on aspects of the plans for each town centre with a report back to council on the community comments and responses three council note that the cost constraints associated with the pacific aspects of the streetscape improvements and utilize this to leverage and to pursue future grants for the purpose [Music] we 'll now move to 10.3 roads and aerodromes report any comments by exception from the report no further comments thanks mr administrator thank you very much noting the

we 've got the rfs camp um set up at burke oval which is housing rfs ses some adf and police for accommodation the food shed as we call it uh next to the council chambers is in uh full operational um it 's fully operational and uh it 's delivering uh food hampers um to those vulnerable uh or desperate for food throughout will canyon and also that extends out through the rest of the shire i suppose in the last week things have actually tapered off numbers have declined now considerably from from cases of cobra cases we had probably a week two weeks ago we 're around about 46 cases as yesterday um and those people i understand are in isolation at the moment and they were people who affected uh through other cases in the same household um moving forward i 'd like like administrator said um the recovery committee is set up and we meet um tomorrow with our first meeting and uh i guess i will that will be scheduled on a probably weekly to know at a monthly basis um so yeah things things are starting to slow down um at this stage as for um getting cases back to zero uh i don 't see that going in the foreseeable future in the next two or three weeks um unfortunately um the cases there 's no cases down at menindee however there are uh something like 26 people have been in isolation those people as today i think will be getting their day 10 tests and hopefully they 'll come back negative and they will be able to come out of isolation in another four days time and um yeah um also to notice that um our local state member mr butler has um requested that um white cliffs and um ivanhoe to um to come out of self-isolation and but however be locked into a a a bubble arrangement uh very similar to other regional uh areas in new south wales so i think that 's uh pretty well it for me thank you miss administrator thanks for mr general manager just also uh council lodged a submission with the new south the shire social housing that submission has been lodged and it 's available on our website if anyone wants to read that so we will now move to financial reports 7.1 request for financial assistance i propose to deal with this indeed with the table report on the

dollars to country women 's association white cliffs branch under council 's community grant to partially cover annual service charges for the 21 22 period on johnson street wycliffe 's property question mr general manager will these be ongoing contributions annually um thank you mr administrator i 'd say by the look of that yes they will be what i 'm suggesting is that we include that under our um grants and contributions so we don 't have to deal with it on an annual basis we deal with it uh one by one resolution in the budget in that allocation we can take that into consideration when we prepare our budget for um next financial year do you need a resolution to that effect or i think we 'll put it straight into the budget and when we come to adopt our new budget i think it can be resolved then okay call item 7.3 adoption of the draft financial statements for the financial year ended 30th the statements and the audit uh documentation please are we up to date and on track to

simply at the moment is that as for the year today period ending august uh 2021 we 're reporting a uh surplus of 362 000 uh albeit we 're only two months into the financial year uh i 'd also mentioned that as at the end of september we will go into presenting a full budget review which will be presented to councils meeting in november okay so so i 'll resolve the council receive and note the report i 'll call the late item that was tabled at the meeting the financial report cash and investments august 2021 um the report is in front of us comments uh mr general manager um no thank you however i 'd like to the manager for finance to make commentary on the report please thank you mr general manager and through your mr administrator um i 'll just make my comments relatively brief uh as at the 31st of august we had a uh balance in our operating accounts at the 11th at 11 785 889 uh payments million our receipts um which are detailed there came to 5.7 million uh the loan balance is now currently 122 913 thank you mr administrator just one comment on the ato gts refund gst refund it 's a large amount they don 't normally give monies back so could you explain what that 's all about please yeah thank you mr administrator and through you um look basically there 's been an ongoing issue without gst in that the tax office uh sorry let me start again we pay our payg monthly and then the tax office in their wisdom also deducted quarterly so we 're effectively paying one month uh twice this issue has basically now been resolved the other issue um that was causing this large refund is the fact that some of our gst going back a number of periods had not been refunded as it should have been and the reason for this was because fbt returns have been lodged with errors this problem came to light earlier this year and the fbt uh errors were subsequently corrected and hence we had a refund thank you favor so i assume we put in place now policies procedures systems to overcome this issue some procedures in place and uh we 're currently in the process of reconciling our gst account uh as at the end of the third of this final current financial year um i believe that there still is amounts refundable to us and i 'm liaising with the tax office to get those refunds and what was the period that this this issue has been over um i 'm unsure but the fbt returns that had errors went back to 2017 off the top of my head thank you thank you now other comments i will deal with the report i will resolve we receive and note the report flicking between screens my apologies seven point six missed administrator council two thousand seven point six just the screens okay i 'd like to call item 7.6 council 2021 current grants register um i 've got no questions unless there 's other

agenda no thank you okay firstly there 's no administrators report this month but i do want to make a couple of comments i 'd like to acknowledge the passing of mayor lillian brady of coba and most people in local government knew lillian as a champion for the far west and her beloved community of coba gm and myself represented central darlingshire at the state funeral in koba last friday and uh it was well attended by politicians and local government from across the state along with her family and friends of the community work has continued during the christmas period we 've made numerous submissions on water policy numerous zoom meetings on the will canyon where there is slow progress being made there um we issued a joint press statement with the wentworth and broken hill on the recent flows in the darling and the harvesting an extraction there last week the gm and i traveled discuss the administration and particularly her commitment that she would look at an alternative model for will kent for central darling shire and would engage with us on that now we got an assurance that that work will be continuing and she will be coming back to us there we also raised the issue of uh ongoing capital works that we 've got as you know we 've got significant water sewer treatment plants and pinkery road and the impact of depreciation on our bottom line there and really that is a major issue going forward for this council the issue of depreciation and how we handle that we put some suggestions to her and minister marshall we also met with minister marshall i think finally they might have dropped what we were saying there it 's taken 12 months of raising that issue we also raised with the minister marshall the water policy and service delivery in in the far west now we will continue those discussions in broken hill at the western division conference in april so which was good we also met with our local member roy in the central darling shire next week the general manager and myself have a telephone and zoom meeting with minister pavi to discuss various issues impacting on this show the one bit of good news that came out was the repurposing of the ivanhoe correctional facility that work has been ongoing with government since uh it 's closed and we certainly welcome tronic products and the general manager will be meeting with the md and i will be coming in on zoom uh in the near future we 're organizing that meeting now whilst it 's not a long-term solution it 's certainly welcomed and typically with mining once they start mining they keep on mining for a while so we 're hopeful and we 'll be discussing how tronics may engage with the ivanhoe community and help that community this year just a couple of comments the focus is going to be on project delivery our director of works has quite a lot of work um work to do with water treatment plants pinkery road and there will be major works occurring whilst not directly council will kenya where to focus on the development of the organisation 's capacity particularly in governance and there 's a lot of work to do that in financial management so that work will continue okay we now have um an award i 'd like to make the uh community services awards 2020 to the world canyon newspaper chris if you 'd like to come up with us and just yeah thank you we 'll get the one handed so we 're handing it over you 're right cody thank you i 'm sorry just give me two seconds let me do it i 'm all over it thank you guys thank you thank you very much certainly it was a great pleasure i present this award to you chris and ron on for the kenya newspaper thank you thanks look uh just some words the first edition of the world canyon news came on told in the press december 2004 that 's right yes um it was produced by one person yes yes after a few years as typical funding disappears and you 've got some issues there and a group of ladies delivering the news to will canyon just in terms of comment local papers are extremely important to communities and i 've worked with communities where the paper has not been there and it certainly makes a difference to the community it doesn 't develop it doesn 't get the news and i believe papers are extremely important to hold organizations such as council to account in question there so thank you very much for the work you 're doing and i hope you can follow me yeah thank you thank you okay we 'll now move to um questions and statements and ladies first chris please and chris wants to talk on community engagement staff photo comp and cemetery reports thank you very much look we 're happy come and have a talk to me after the meeting if you don 't get it officer um i have some concerns with the current process of community engagement and they were almost confirmed this week when the paper received a media release about a series of meetings starting next monday we go with your strategic planning process that media released several say when where what time they it just failed all the five whys of media reporting and took two phone calls to the shire to find out when and where the meetings were being held and what the format was unfortunately we got a local employee who knew exactly what was going on and sent us the details what i have found with the current process it lacks both common knowledge and common courtesy and i might paraphrase more tv show what is being done is definitely common but definitely not courtesy definitely not knowledge the second point is the staff and i 'm just asking what the current full-time equivalent is please and um also what you meant in the agenda or the business papers remove this in regards to the rates club removed from local intrusion i 'm wondering what that phrase means and you seem to be entering some contractual arrangements prior to undertaking the new hierarchy and structure review and i 'm wondering why that 's happening i would have thought the review came before contractual obligations um the third point is the photo competition bill i was very interested in reading the current proposal the prize money in our experience is inadequate the time frame is also inadequate and some of the rules to abide by such as within the last 12 months we found in our experience that short time frame doesn 't reflect the predictably unpredictable climate we 're in so the photos will only reflect the climate of that 12 months whereas we 'll know out here it 's dorothy droughts and flooding rains and i would suggest a that the price money be increased and that the time frame allowed for the photos be increased for three years and the last one is the new cemetery record keeping system which i 'm pleased to see happening because it 's been a nightmare for longer than peter and i can remember i 've just got one question there about what you mean by confidentiality issues because i receive at least one a week more often two a week inquiries about people who may or may not have been married here and i do have some information at home because i 've been of his old records what what is to be confidential um in regards to what information will be given to people because i have found records i have found indicate times when the records conflict is to date of death date of internment and even names have been not quite accurately recorded so what is your definition of confidentiality as far as providing information to inquiries thank you yes yeah another minute you had one still got another minute yeah good going your public access policy i noticed it 's in the code of conduct and i would just like to say even the prime minister faces questions without notice and i 'm wondering whether on the review of the code of conduct policy you can consider having an allowance so that if it 's not on the agenda the matter may still be raised but not debated thank you and look i have personally no issues with that as long as the officers always have the right to take it on notice and come back at the next meeting with the information if they don 't hold it and handled the questions on noticing and have statements and you can ask questions but the the take it on notice and come back to you either by written response prior to the next meeting which i 've always done and we then read that response into the minutes that 's noted in the next agenda you happy yes the code of conduct is a new south wales government code of conduct we 've adopted the standard code um we can make amendments providing it 's not contrary to the code so something like that next time we review the code of meeting practice and the code of conduct certainly we can include include that and that 's something in the community meetings that can be raised about how council is transparent etc that 's an issue that could be raised there thank you answer that you want to go the rest right yeah i 'll go and go um thanks chris don 't um as for the meetings for the community strategic plan yes i 'm aware of that media release but i also thought it was actually flyers come sure if that went out with that particular media release okay i will follow that up during the day and because there is flyers to go out that was more that media release was more like more so to say there 's meetings coming out and then there 's individual media releases fliers to come out for each location my next status is okay take that on board um as for the staff the staffing report we 're around the rates officer the intrusion being the author of the report myself i put the word intrusion in in the past i 've seen when we 've had well when we had the rights officer here uh one thing um that race officer struggled with is actually people after hours people actually coming up and actually talking to him about work and actually getting quite um aggressive especially around rates payments and stuff like that so i see it with the current arrangement we 've got it at the moment our rights officer can do do the job without having to um be harassed i suppose um by by some members see be forceful about issues around race especially going through what we 've just done in the last eight and eight months with lance with collection of rates [Music] moving forward um once we 've resolved a lot of our own our rates our unpaid rates um yeah there is an opportunity to bring that role back into the organisation back locally the other issue greg was staffed without with before the restructure of the point and contract stuff yeah so looking at the restructure is going to take a fair while um so we we 've got some real serious gaps at the moment in the organization especially around our governance um and our processes so we need to sort them out and with you know with the governance officer short term that 's a good opportunity to um you know build the build the capacity of the organization up get it up to a standard where then you can train someone up when you 've actually got all the processes and procedures in place in trying to actually get someone skilled up try to understand the local government no can i make some comments as a general manager please my understanding is there was an org structure for this organisation there 's a lot of vacant positions and greg can you outline the vacant position sitting in there so at the moment we 've got a um vacant positions at the moment yeah so now in the old structure sitting there that 's been vacant for a number of years so at the moment we 've got um director for corpus for business services is vatican we 're going to acting in that role at the moment all up we 've got 54 staff uh full-time equivalents some are on contract some are casual some are ftes so we 're at nearly our maximum at the moment but we do engage a staff on part time so um different staff might work um instead of working full time they 're 35 hours a week some might work 20 hours a week or even 15 hours a week depends on on their role and that and when you add all up it 's still around the 54. okay the western councils do is attracting staff to come and work in localities such as the far west and we 've certainly got staff on contract working for us remotely at the moment and i think that is a model that we have to face where we will be in reality if we can 't get the skilled people here with the skills necessary to deliver the services to the community we have to look at other models now the other councils typically we they try to share stuff and work together we 're finding most of those are running in capacity and it doesn 't work with covert working from home it seems to be accepted and certainly we 've got the potential short-term engagement to see how it goes and work that way the rates officer getting a rates officer into a locality such as central darling proves very very difficult a competent writer and what i 've found is the the governance systems and processes have fell away over the years and we need to rebuild those we started last year with policy we need to do a officer here this morning working with kevin setting up the systems and processes in our our software so we can deliver reports that are meaningful to you guys too and even our own staff struggled with the current system that we 've got so it 's part of the capacity building of the organisation that we need to get to and remember the office of local government sets targets we 're no different than sydney city council we 've got to reach those if we don 't have the skills and the staff we can 't do it and i gave a commitment to the minister that we would certainly work to build the capacity of the organisation she gave the commitment to come up with a future governance model for central darling that 's what we met with the other day to ask her to move that forward as quickly as possible because i believe the community needs to understand where they 're going in terms of the community strategic plan that 's an exercise that 's got to be done no matter what happens and that 's why i did that on purpose because i wanted that plan prepared before the minister or the government says this is what we want to do with the area at least we have a document the community has inputted into set what they want and that 's what we can hold them for we can try i 'm not saying we 're going to succeed but we can try because the community has come together and prepared that plan okay um cemetery records note those comments and i 've got to say being an old gray-headed person in local government when we inherited the rec cemeteries and records from church they were a mess and lots of councils are still trying to sort them out so yes this is a start well stay with the audience again thank you mr administrator um firstly i noted your circular report that central darling wentworth and broken hill did on the river i commend you all on that uh will county community terrorism association put in a letter of support the next day supporting your comments and let 's hope we can follow that the side of the box to start with uh and the method of doing it and the clearing of them it 's been done well the blocks have all been done have all been cleared and the job is well done i must admit there 's probably a few cases where there were existing trees that were beneficial that could have been left but then i was performing on it impressing up to me the part that really got me was the transportable units that have been brought in they 're more in keeping with a caravan park pot there 's no legs on them they 're very very basic but apart from all that the positioning of them i just cannot see ryan or reason whoever decided to put them where they put them hingely piggly and sure they had glass sticking out any one of the miniature demolition team in town could have broken a window from 100 yards away for the shanghai i just don 't know what the reasoning was for putting them where they are i know it 's not my call and maybe you don 't know but they look pretty hideous at the moment and apparently they 're four shire staff there are i don 't know how many blocks around town that have been cleared they 've pretty well totally fenced a lot of them those units could have gone in any one of those i would have thought they 'd have had a fence around them straight away and be protected but up there within a hundred yards of the kenya center of midnight music you know who you and this thing is it 's just doesn 't make sense to me that 's all and i just i thought i 'd bring it up thank you for that bill that 's right do you want to comment mr generator i 'm happy to leave it um yeah thanks for the comments um i haven 't really had much to do with this project and i suppose the director for um services would you like to add anything online or take on notice now i can add more comments with the apt the units were originally [Music] planned to go at shower flats existing due to the size of them and more so the capacity of the electrical supply to that end of town we couldn 't afford to spend out another 50 000 to upgrade transformers and put them there as well as access issues from the back lane there so alternative blocks were looked at and following the sale of unpaid rates council acquired those blocks they were consolidated the positioning of them i disagree i think they 're fine the the building projects manager that we have on on a 12-month contract designed those and had them surveyed and we think it 's they 've been located for ease of access and car parking and and whatnot they 'll be fenced with a six foot metal fence around the boundary with a with a pool type fence at the front for for aesthetic purposes um they 're all earmarked for staff at the moment we 've got staff and temporary accommodation two of those will be going straight into those engineering staff um we did what we can now the general manager was consulted on location so then some people are gonna not agree with the location i 'll take your comments with the music and loudness landscaping but it will but after they 've moved in and we 've spent the budget on the on those three units which was 100 funded through grant monies thank you um peter thank you you 've covered most of them the new buildings up there you know of all the places in town to put them that 's the last place i would put them um but that 's just my experience with them um i would like to comment on the you know thank you for the comment regarding you 're talking to the minister about it a different um what would you say administration time for this central darling show um what cetera what the minister needs to also understand that central darling shore is the first yeah one to the last that go down this track um i mean you was in convoy for the funeral did you drive around town i know cobar we did drive a little bit around town but not greatly we were of the houses in cabaret got the sauce on thing business houses that have closed are just empty shells in the street so you know cobalt whatever they like to say is not far behind central bank right across the board um the other thing that i do have a problem with and i know it 's a sign of the time and i know central darling has always struggled to get stuff it 's not a new thing it 's been there ever since which always been here um one of the major problems with outsourcing the staff and i know and over the last 12 months haven 't_''_1650.0 been very good but whatever and people have been encouraged to work from home rather than to whatever but made the problem with working away from home but you 've got six or eight jobs outsourced and going to outsource more separate shire can 't afford to have all its wages being paid to support communities and elsewhere in australia you need as much of that money as you can your wages the outlay to stay within the short area you need the biggest percentage if you can do it to keep that money within the shop yeah i i mean basically at present what we 're doing we 're putting up their rates every year blogging and some poor bloody weight fire to subsidise the community in west australia generally that 's what i like some comments when you finish so yeah i mean i or something for a job last year and he 's decided he 's going to have a mate he 's going to do a bit more for you so you 're going to pay him 60 000 and then you know um i i just yeah think that that we need to have as much of the staff in the town and i know they 'll probably spend a lot of their money in broken hill or all these other places but they 'll spend a percentage of it in in general another year even if they 're not dispensed for all the intersexual going area you know how much we need as much of the money to circulate within the communities as possible a new model i mean this has been flooded for years it 's been around a long time we 'd actually started to go that way at one stage and um not being detrimental to anybody but the majority of the councils got too hard they had to think about things so they decided to stay like they were and that 's why we 're still funding along like we are now you know instead of being called or they 've taken place 15-20 years ago we 're still talking and if people get your discussions with the minister will there be any um i suppose input from people other than those on the council yes and i 'll make comment when you 're finished so yeah yeah i won 't understand what were the two points i noticed in the um gorgeous report that we were the child was down because it didn 't have a star let me just clarify that clarify that a bit more the two order just points well in the end of the page reading there we are on the orders report the order our things with the local government is that in the staffing report yeah in that staffing yeah yeah i mean i i was just interested um asking what they were they were major islands or just you know yeah yeah so in our previous auditors report and the one we just received um governance has been a big failure around reporting our reporting and our compliance and around rates especially around our fees and charges as you 're all probably aware that we had major issues earlier in the year around water uh water billing where we never actually sent out any water billing for nearly a nine month period so those issues have been raised in the order in the auditor 's report in discussions with the minister her commitment was to develop a new model that 's when she extended the period of administration and she also indicated that i was to engage with her on her office staff office of local government on that model we 've had some engagement with them at the moment covert slowed that down they have developed some options internally they are and to put those that 's the next phase of it she 's given a very strong commitment she wants to come i 'll show you her department come and talk to the community about it and i agree with you this is 15 years too late um the most recent was the far west model that was put up there 's a heap of consultants come out here when they did the recent reform of local government i thought that was a very good model that had potential for the far west unfortunately politics as it normally does got involved it fell over and i agree with you there 's a lot more councils like central darling they 're just not admitting it at the moment yeah and the government needs to come to grips with that we were talking earlier about the cost of depreciation on infrastructure this community can 't afford these upgrades it 's never funded um the full cost of upgrades or made a contribution um the government has always done that so why doesn 't the government own the infrastructure we central darling does rms roads their argument will be we don 't want that depreciation on our books my argument i put to them last week you already carry it guys and they 've got a community service obligation to give the people of the far west the same equivalent service uh as the larger councils can do and water supply authorities so in other areas so that 's a discussion we 're trying to prosecute at the moment um whether we get anywhere i don 't know um but i think the the um you will see a little bit more movement on the model of local government uh coming this year i said to her i was disappointed that hadn 't moved as quickly as what we 'd anticipate and i know covered and i know they 've still got staff working at home and they had to go and get some money in the budget to do this modeling that they 're doing so i would encourage everyone i know take on board chris 's comments about the community strategic planning notification we 'll we 'll address those in the document i think the community could hold up to the government when we come to that model okay we 're a little bit out of kilter with the meeting this section is normally not recorded we will edit that out but uh it 's supposed to be a session beforehand um anyway i 'm quite happy to let it run there today and we 'll pick that up in the future but look anytime you want to come and talk just make an appointment with through greg for me and i 'm happy to have that discussion and i 'm quite happy to do something after meeting if you want to talk okay we 'll continue on with the agenda and my apologies for everyone getting out of filter there with it we 'll move to conservation of the minutes of the ordinary meeting the 15th of december mr general manager any comments i 'll resolve the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on the 15th of december 2020 being received and confirmed we 'll now move to financial reports item 6.1 the grants register reconciliation there before us i will resolve that we receive and adopt the report on the grant register reconciliation just by way of commenting mr general manager it 's a great start the grants register i 'm wondering if we could add some comments in there the amount of the grant and progress of suspended please yes we can this administrator we are looking at that on board i 'll take that on board this is something we are definitely looking at in the future thank you mr general manager sale of land for unpaid 6.2 sale of land for unpaid rates and auction results the report is there in front of us um whilst it wasn 't a success financially um it was something that had to be done and have been a legacy issue that we needed to tidy up and again that was one of the issues auditors kept raising with us so we 're working through some of the issues that have been there for many many years so if there 's no comments mr general manager no i haven 't uh unless the rates officer would like to make sorry enough you there daryl no yes i 'm here sorry daryl would you like my comment on the room on your report uh no there 's just been some variation since it was drafted in terms of numbers of property settlements that have completed and the progress towards completing um the remainder um but pretty much it reflects uh the situation uh apart from some apart from some more properties completed yeah thanks mr tesla thank you i 'll do with the report i will resolve the council receive and note the report two note that the monthly reports will be provided to council until such time as the contracts of sales have been completed and sale processes finalized now move to item 6.3 cash and investments report um it is there before us mr general manager or the finance manager any comment uh thank you mr administrator i 'll just make some brief comments on that um our total cash balance as at the 31st of january was 7.226 million the main driver of that balance is grants that have been received basically in advance so they 'll about our loan account our loan account is now down to 215 000 that 's a good result the original balance of that a number of years ago was up around 825 000 um that loan will be paid off in the next two years and that will be a good result for council thank you and we 're holding money at the moment for the pinkery road aren 't we that is correct thank you and that 's reflective in that in the restrictions yeah thank you okay 6.4 smart water meters meter reading and billing update mr general manager thank you mr administrator uh i 'd actually go to the acting rates officer mr tilfer would you like to make comment please uh thank you thank you um yeah i think it 's clear that there 's been uh some fairly uh bad outcomes in the past i think the issues are fairly detailed well set out and explained in the report uh we 're on track now to bring it all back into a regular schedule and the implementation implementation the smart metering is certainly going to 've got i guess fairness in terms of who pays for the water supply uh by having accurate meters and um it 's all been funded externally uh which is great no cost to the ratepayer i understand and um it 'll actually provide a lot of efficiencies thank you thank you mr safeway i 'll just make a couple of comments um the reporter is timely and and uh appropriate i think this report reflects the development of systems and processes at central darlingshire council and the lack of those and the ability to project manage and deliver a project there there is certainly a shortfall of meters that i 'm reading 73 meters [Music] reading the report it 's proposing at this stage that be dealt with in the next budget mr general manager unless you can look for a grant application um somewhere that may fund that so look it was a good project unfortunately um there are aspects of it that cause concern so i will resolve that we receive and note the report two that monthly and these are additional for the minute takers that further report be submitted on the cost of additional and cost of purchase of additional and fitting of smart meters for inclusion in the 2 000 21 22 budget correct 20 21 22 21 22 and 4 that a report be submitted on outstanding charges uh to water fund that were levied um rates and charges back to it i 'd like to understand what is the balance of the outstanding charges owing to waterfall police i 've got these written down there just so thank you [Applause] quarterly budget review item 6.5 as of the 30th of december 2020 mr general manager and to you to through the finance office if there 's any comments i haven 't thank you mr administrator however the manager of finance may want to add comments thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator again i 'll just make some brief comments about this report uh firstly we 've got a reduction in our projected end of year result of a net 44 000. the details of why that is occurring is in the report our projected surplus for the end make a brief comment about the capital works report there has been a reduction in the capital works expenditure of 5 million this is due to the fact that we will not be starting work on the white cliffs water treatment this financial year so that issue will become subject to next year 's long-term financial plan and next year 's budget any other comments stuff no i can go through some other stuff if you 'd like we 're in your head okay i 'll just make uh some further brief comments uh just back on the profit and loss statement um the variations um to use the fees and charges uh this was to do with some um work done to repair some storm damage of 1.8 million dollars that 's also reflected in the expense line [Music] for materials and contracts because basically it was a dollar for dollar arrangement we also undertook some storm damage um works for the kobar shire council and that again is reflected in the use of fees and charges and the materials and contracts but for that for those works we result um for council we 've got some additional wages there in the um report that is to do with the additional um staffing which is subject to a report in this agenda and i think this time that almost covers me off unless there are some questions and part was also extended leave taken by the director of business and that is correct there 's an offsetting amount there yes which was unavailable okay i will therefore resolve that council will receive quarter two budget review as of the first of december 2020 to adopt the variations to council 's 2021 annual budget through note that the projected operating surplus for the financial year is 2021 is 547 thousand dollars four note that the projected capital works budget expenditure for 2021 is 14 596 000 um just for comment to the for the gallery we made provision for bad debt right off last year didn 't that 's correct yes do you recall what that was it was our provision for doubtful debts in total is now 1.33 million so that was an increase off the top of my for that was because of the write-offs that we 're going to have to undertake for um rates so we recognized that in the um 1920 year and so that 's been audited and it 's in the audited financial statements okay okay item 6.6 presentation of the 2019 20 annual financial statements mr general manager and you might summarize why we 're doing it at this meeting too thank you mr administrator um yes due to um some issues earlier in the well sorry late yet late last year with um staff matters um daniel final man potential states were delayed uh on a number of occasions we on two occasions we had to seek extensions to um to complete our annual financial statements which they were only completed uh a couple of weeks ago so um these are now being presented to council uh from which um uh will be inserted into our annual report which will be then forward on to the office of local government in coming weeks so with that um yeah financial management any more two statements uh thank you mr john manager and about the highlights of the financial statements for this year a council is reporting in that operating surplus of 6.093 million which is a good result um the drivers from that for that surplus basically the amount of operating grants we received but also we had a good good result with our fees and charges that was primarily driven by receipts from our rms works um a total expenditure for the year came in at 23.693 million um one of the main drivers for that expense and as mentioned previously is our depreciation is up by 4.09 million also previously mentioned we increased our provision in for bad debts up to 1.33 million um just briefly uh on the asset side of the balance sheet council completed a capital works program of 5.954 million which again was a good result for cancer and the statements uh mr general manager unqualified this time yes of course and they have have been for the last two years okay i will resolve that council receive the report to adopt the 2019 20 annual financial statements and audit reports three present the reports to the local government act and do i have to resolve that they be reported to the office of local government i will anyway i 've got a feeling that we 've done that in i 've already been forwarded oh good thank you we can believe that now we 'll move to item seven governance reports uh community engagement officer there 's a report there mr general manager thank you mr administrator um there 's just an overview of what the communication officer has done since her employment system overview overall i think we are getting good value for money through having a communication officer our facebook page is increased in numbers also visitation to our website has is increasing however our website does need some work um we we are pumping out a lot more um press releases and media releases and engagement with the community which is also um getting feedback from other organizations on on on those releases which is good so yeah it 's there for your information uh thank you mr general manager and certainly this is a step in the right direction if you engagement was a major issue and it does present challenges for a council without one single newspaper in the area and communities separated by distance so it 's a good step in the right direction and i will resolve that we receive and note the report continue to get work and noting that we will find tune at chris as we go along engagement of staff and organisational structure um item 7.2 i called for this report in december i asked the manager to bring forward a report on the organization structure and staff his organisation needed going forward if we address the issues in the original inquiry and ongoing governance issues and financial management issues of central darling so mr thank general manager administrator um i believe i pretty well outlaid where we are at the present moment with um our the issues facing central darling choir with with staff and as we previously discussed in in the public forum regarding attracting um uh suitable staff and having staff willingness to come out here and work for us also you know the issues around you know finding commendation and up the the organisation of capacity uh is a critical thing and and as we mentioned earlier in the in the council meeting uh with the auditor 's report we do um struggle uh in a number of areas where with uh this year i think there 's 15 points in the management letter which evolve around segregation of duties reporting on government matters water you know with our water rates visa charges um around our it uh and that type of stuff um we really do struggle um you know have the appropriate staff to uh to manage those those areas and especially with the expertise so um so with that um you know there 's an opportunity through the joint organisation uh which um central darling and shire is a member of the fast far south west jo which is now utilizing a um executive officer uh with ramjo which is made up uh which is a all albright and edwards river murray river councils and a few other councils so we 're sharing a executive officer there they 're looking at putting a governance officer on for to outsource that governance officer for one day a week which we which will cost us 300 a day being that um their reporting is similar to what our reporting requirements are likewise bell rental council is is looking to do the same as well so this person will be working a remote uh exis assisting central dale assisting um bell reynold um in getting our governments up to date and when you refer to governance for the gallery mr general manager what specifically covering that is policy developments policy development procedures um development of registers so registers around our contracts uh our contractor contracts our you know even around our council meetings with um confidential items um there 's a number of registers which we 're falling short for we 're not actually producing at the moment again that 's also being identified in in the order of an letter as well so so the governance officer is for a 12-month period the rates officer for three days a week for a two-year contract is that immediate or because is that position already in the org structure so that officer is looking at taking a little bit less time than when he 's working at the moment um he 's pretty well full time so he would like to go back to three days a week and um and concentrate on the policies and procedures around water and waste um our feast of charges uh where this rates officer would be just wholly and solely working on our on our rates um you know making sure the rates are going out following up that rates being paid and working on that topic so that involves no change of the structure from fulfilling the position um so we can adjust the budget for those two positions at the next qbr the money is there and that a further report you 're going to bring forward to april on the rest any other restructures that may be necessary that 's correct so i 'll bring a report in march including financial impacts et cetera i 'd like to see that factored into the 10-year long-term financial plan i 'm happy to deal with it and i will resolve that one council 's office through the far west joint organisation for one day per week for a 12-month period the employment of a rates officer for three days per week for a two-year contract the 2020-21 budget be adjusted to reflect the engagement of a governance officer and the employment of a rights officer a further report be coming to the april council meeting on the restructure of the organisational structure and how this will affect future financial budgets including the long-term financial planning we will move to item 7.3 future management of the ivanhoe hall mr general manager thank you mr administrator um look i think the reports pretty well spells it out regarding the hall recommendations there for you thank you mr general manager i think this is just a sign of the times and i will resolve that council receive the report to acknowledge the request dated 29th of november 2020 from the ivanhoe hall committee members for the central darling shire to resume management of the ivanhoe hall three create an internally restricted reserve the ivanhoe ivanhoe hall reserve to manage the final funds transferred from the previous ivanhoe hall management procedure to ensure lahore is available as a facility to serve the ivanhoe and central darlingshire community and on land five the letter of appreciation be sent to those final serving members on that committee for their service in managing the ivanhoe hall thanks if you could do that mr general manager please 7.4 photo competition my shire in my eyes mr general manager thank you mr administrator um reports there from the community engagement officer um i might actually hand over to the community engagement officer if you would like to add anything further thank you general manager um mr administrator one of the first things that was uh we fine yes thank you one of one of the first things that was brought to my attention on my appointment um to this position was the lack of photographs that were available for website promotional purposes report illustration things like that with the vastness of the area i know from experience it would be prohibitive to employ a person to take professional photographs also from experience i know that residents like to engage with what goes with the general manager came up with a um opportunity to engage our residents and [Music] give them the opportunity to to supply photographs of our shire as they see it so instead of just you know management and offices you know saying oh this is a really great idea um we 'd have a stock of photographs that actually do represent the shire and how our people see it um the photographs that would be submitted would be the possession of council so automatic submission to the competition would give council ownership um the reason i suggested that we put a bit of a prize money in there is just to try and encourage a little bit more and um give some sort of recognition for you know outstanding photographs that would be used regularly um throughout our run promotional material website reports um there as we know there are some photos that you know we just love completely and would get used a lot and i think people should be recognized for that in some you know small way anything thank you thank you jenny thanks jenny look and it 's worked without prize money um i can happy to accept that i think it 's a great step in trying to engage the community and building the photo library and i 've certainly been part of decisions to engage um someone to develop a photo library and it 's very expensive and i understand the 12 months because particularly photographs of cars and can become time sensitive so at this stage it 's a start and i 'm happy to one receive the report um approve the use of the photo competition to be known as my shower in my eyes with the entries accepted from monday fifth with entries accepted i 'm not going to resolve the dates just in case it goes wrong i 'll take on um um the comments made in their um in the open forum and just in case something goes wrong in organization b allocate no more than 400 prize money to be distributed between first second and third in both the adult and junior section as suggested in the report with discretion to allocate further price within the prize community engagement officer the general manager is delegate and an independent person photographs must be taken by the entrant that can be subject taken at any time in the past 12 months be all entries whether or not they receive prizes become the property of central darlingshire council that will be watermarked with the name and town of the entrant acknowledging their contribution so resolved uh cemetery records management uh mr general manager um thank you mr administrator um the acting director for business services would would you like my comment on this one um through you mr administrator this software was sourced and after long consideration by the previous cemetery records management officer who is no longer with the shire but she was involved in the implementation um of the of the software and um recommended it uh it is already proving to be a boon to us because inquiries have become much simpler to resolve and it has allowed us to clean up a lot of um dare i say this so it 's already proving to be worth the money that we 've spent on it okay we 'll receive a note of the report and i understand that the cost is carried in the budget the existing budget that was actually a adjustment in the last qbr okay we 'll move to the shire service reports so warner and sewer update general manager thank you mr administrator um i might actually ask the director for child services to uh comment comment on the following reports regarding infrastructure uh through ms administrator the report um details the operational budgets there which were all running within within budget parameters i 'll just comment briefly on the capital works it 's listed there that we went to tender for the three new water treatment plants we had a really good response at the pretender meeting and two companies have visited this week inspecting personally the three water treatment plants throughout the shore and talking to the operators it was made because the safe and secure funding for the water treatment plants is in the public arena through the safe and secure funding announcements the tenders are aware of our limitations with budgets and our capacity to allow non-capacity to hopeful that we 'll get tenders that will be received for good water treatment plants for the capacities we need and within budget they as listed there a three-week tender extension was granted dpie water at their request and their wishes differ slightly to council 's wishes for the capacities of water treatment plants so all tenders are to provide five tender schedules three one each for each water treatment plant plus two mandatory alternative tender schedules for will kenya and ivanhoe so they 're progressing and further reports will be brought back to council following the close of tender and and the tender assessment period now the workless reticulation is the second part of the 5.5 million um announced for white cliffs um the survey is going up next week to finalize meter locations so we can finalize the design and go to a civil works tender for for that component of that work i haven 't heard anything further on the kenya proposal for the wool kenya gravity sewer scheme um that the scoping study elements been completed but there was talk of possible funding um to proceed has been added project about 12 million estimated 8 to 12 depending on and we certainly raised with minister marshall council 's capacity to make a contribution and we 'd be seeking 100 funding so that 's on the table for you okay i 'm happy to deal with that and i will resolve that we receive and note the report roads and aerodrome report mr general manager thank you mr administrator once again i 'll hand over to the director of shore services uh through you mr administrator i have nothing further that for the services update the tables for the operational budgets and the capital works for building stronger country communities community grants

the regional road um expenditure is listed there um one thing missing from the report is an update on the pinkery road project and i 'll include that in the next agenda but as you and the general manager have seen firsthand from your visits this week that started on the 19th of january construction commenced and it 's running to program at the moment and all side tracks have been completed and pavement construction has commenced on three separate sections on the pinkery road and we also visited the works around menindee too oh the the roads for recovery works yeah for four reconstruction

for 44 reed street will kenya mr general manager mr um as it 's laid out in front of you there 's a report uh this is regarding the barca cultural center i might ask our senior planning officer um to make comment on this one um mr administrator and general manager um the plan of management is actually required as land at 44 reed street where kanye is a community land it 's council-owned land and any works to the site requires a plan of management under the local government act so we 're implementing land or the barker cultural center so that will be under the local government act uh

and the plan of management only applies to the land that council owns and manages for the crown that we have at the moment so i will resolve that council receive note the report to endorse the

for the planning proposal for the reclassification that is the preparation of the amendment for the local environmental plan to the planner do you have any other comments to that comment i just made uh no this is due to a requirement from the minister that we go for yet another public hearing to ensure we follow the correct process under the local government in 1993. for the gallery 's why we 're holding another public hearing on the matter we 'll go through it 's a similar process but it 'll be an additional one to make sure we comply with the process of the local government so i will resolve

is loose right not seem to have these so that 's the next one 9.7 desali street will canyon my apologies if the pronunciation is wrong um the purpose of the the southwest street will can you mr general manager thank you mr administrator um i might ask the director for trial services tonight 's comment on this one for you mr administrator the report outlines the history here um the the initial request was through the local traffic committee concerns from the police for the safety of local uh mainly kids on motorbikes unregistered vehicles going up beside the council depot from the mallee from the north side of south town to the south side of town there 's already been one serious incident with two kids on a on a motorbike hitting a truck there so upon investigation council is not the legal owner of that road it remains a crown road the report seeks council endorsement to purchase that crown road and then upon transfer of ownership we 're unable to close the street if it 's in the interest of the community public safety matter issue i will resolve the council receive the report to apply to purchase crown land known as disability salary the sally street the saudi street will kenya three upon transfer of ownership highway we 'll move to item nine point eight pound perry road realignment mr general manager thank you administrator i might just add comments to this before i asked the director of fire services myself and the administrator met with mr wayne smith yesterday and his wife regarding the realignment of the print carrier road um we actually we drove the realignment of the road and in principle we agree with mr smith that the road should be realigned subject to the environmental impact survey and the costs associated with the realignment of the road so overall we spent approximately a good hour hour and a half with mr smith and mrs smith um looking around the site with that i 'll ask the director for shy services would you like to add anything further to see that report through this administrator know the report deals with both kerula homestead realignment and what 's locally known as yampula crossing on that road that borders two properties [Music] the bono station and telano station it goes across that property boundary so similar to the proposed realignment of corula we 're seeking holders and commence legal land acquisition through that process i 'd like to pay for mr general manager a submission we received from the smiths if you have that attached to the minutes that submission really summarized uh the comments the general manager made uh as a stock and domestic boar was in 20 meters 24 meters of the existing roadside and certainly the existing road burst basically sits upon the homestead there and they 've obviously suffered dust issues over many many years and the road realignment is certainly i think a good outcome it was always said council supported but never had the money so the project was there we did talk to mr and mrs smith they 're prepared to enter into negotiations by way of a licence agreement to allow us access in construction to include certain conditions that they 're looking for we

minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on the 28th of july 2021 we received and confirmed there 's no business arising we 'll move to item 5.21 correspondence received from the on honourable melinda pavy mp unless there 's any comments i 'm happy to do with the matter i will resolve the council receive and note the correspondence we have item 5.22 correspondence received from the honourable mark coulton mp regarding the conduct of the census is it that 's correct um i will resolve that we receive and note the correspondence item six is the administrator minute uh it 's read there i 'm going to just bypass that at the moment and ask the general manager if he could provide an update on the covert situation and council 's response to date please a brief summary thank you mr administrator so um to date there are 42 cases of covert in will canyon that was as from 10 o 'clock yesterday morning there however there are people in menindee who are isolating as a result of being close contacts to the funeral we had on friday the 13th in will canyon so the response has been that it 's been on actually on a number of different fronts [Music] we 've set up a food distribution center here at will kenya um we 've received from the resilience new south wales we received 10 food hampers and five um [Music] hygiene hampers which were all distributed last saturday uh to the will canyon community everyone in the will canyon community received a at least a food hamper and he 's had each household received a hygiene hamper that was ten pallets was it mr general manager that 's correct ten pounds oh yeah yeah hampers so yeah sorry ten ten pallets of the hamburgers sorry my correction um also set up is uh along with that with the food desperation distribution center which is set up here at uh will canyon uh next to the office in our archive shed um is also to we 're receiving a lot of donated food fresh of dried goods being flour sugar and also sanitary products being shampoo toilet paper tissues hand sanitizer and stuff like that so at this stage i believe that um kenya is pretty well sufficient uh we 've had conversations around you know buying local our businesses uh where our shops at each of our locations are open and functional there 's no reason why people who are at on stay at home orders who aren 't isolating due to contracting covert or having close contact can still go out and shop at their local store and we 're encouraged in that also too there 's a number of um click and collect services being set up uh one in menindee where the local volunteers of um providing a service for the elderly to place an order at the iga and these volunteers will pick it up and deliver to their door likewise we 're um we 've just been in discussion with coles and woolworths to do deliveries to laucania and white cliffs that 's a same thing click and collect where people will put their orders into coles woolworths new south wales transports new south wales will be picking up the the fun of the costs of uh transportation of these um [Music] click and collect groceries out to canyon and white cliffs ivanhoe is from what i 'm hearing is still self-sufficient there 's no requirement to put anything further in place at ivanhoe the store did shut for a day due to a close contact of a person traveling through ivanhoe um the store closed for deep cleaning and however reopened fairly quickly and that 's business as normal at the moment we 've got additional police in will kenya and we 've have at the rdf in will canyon additional police and additional rdf are here to support our local police in compliance help out with help out the police with other duties also the healthcare agencies in the testing facilities and also the vaccination clinics we 've also got the osmat adf here as well they came in yesterday and they 'll be here from what i understand from the remainder of this week fully back trying to fully vaccinate everyone in will canyon going the the uh the osman backs osmac adf going through doing vaccinations we 've also got a pop-up vaccination clinic which is at the town hall which is operated by the royal flying doctor service which is also assisted by council staff in administration duties we 've also got a testing station which is set up at um the oval showgrounds uh which is operated by uh far west health test and assistance with the ambulance and council assisting there with traffic control um we 've also got um far less self going door to door as well doing testing on those people who are have been reported to have covered and are in isolation or close contacts uh who are in isolation so um so there 's there 's a fair bit happening at the present moment just in volcano alone so um and the lemc 's uh stood up and operating with all these agencies and functional partners that 's correct so the the early emcee meets on a daily basis um and also too we every second day we meet at the regional level um to talk so at the moment um i don 't see any great demand or any major issues that needs to be reported to council there 's always issues which we are dealing with on a daily basis but we seem to resolve you know within a matter of hours or a day from council 's operational side of things as far as i know as from yesterday we 've had two staff who are contracted to cover my team um our operations from our field services from our engineering side of things are very limited now most of the most low staff are in isolation waiting to be tested or have been tested i should say and waiting for the results back some of the close contacts will need to remain in isolation for 14 days um so what we 've done is scale back our operations right back to just a bare minimum as being water and sewer uh sewage operations emergency um response and also a waste collection um no no field staff will be going out in the field to do any other maintenance activities we 're just to keep them safe and respond to anything we need to deal with um just to keep the town operation thank you mr administrator thank you mr general manager uh just one question you 're satisfied that the adequate communication is occurring to our other urban centres and communities outside of will kenya whilst the focus operation is there um the other communities are assured and that there 's adequate planning and response plans in place yes i am administrator i 'm satisfied that there 's an ample of communication uh i think of all the agencies i think central darling shy is probably the best at the moment and best position to actually communicate thank you mr general manager for that update and we will now move on uh the financial report 7.1 outstanding rates and charges action plan mr general manager i 'm happy to deal with that if you 've got any comments no thank you mr administrator i will resolve that we received the report to consolidate recovery actions for rates and annual charges with the recovery actions for water consumption charges into a single and of claim under the civil procedure actor claims of a thousand dollars or more so resolved uh we will now move to item 7.2 smart water meters meter reading and billing update mr general manage any comments um thank you mr ministry no i haven 't got any further comments however the author of the report may wish to speak to that um i believe it might be the either the director for um business services or the acting rates officer i 'll try to either of those two thank you thank you uh it 's the acting race officer daryl here um only one uh further comment just with the covert development in will kenya um there won 't be any meter reading of any of the non-smart motors there 's only 28 or so of those most of them historically don 't record usage fortunately the smart metering in will kenya allows us to read and bill those accounts on time and the director of shire services has advised me that the meter reading activities in ivanhoe and white cliffs will go to schedule so we look like reading and billing thank you uh [Music] the only comment i 've got uh it seems that we we are lacking in the policy area for the restriction of water meters that if we can 't recover uh um outstanding debt would it be possible to bring forward a policy position and procedure on that yep that 's certainly something we can we can address um i 'd suggest that the need for restrictions typically aren 't large so it probably hasn 't had any focus being considered a lower sort of priority activity for debt recovery um i 'll just i just know from council operations unless you can show that you 're serious for debt recovery at the end with some consequence and that is one consequence um sometimes you don 't get payment so that that 's my comment there so i 'm happy to deal with the report and we 'll resolve the council one receive and note the report to receive the next quarterly reports on water meter reading billing and collections at the ordinary council meeting scheduled for the 27th 27th of october 2021 water meter restrictions move on now to uh 7.3 for financial performance report mr

amendment has been made to the central darling local environmental plan to proceed with the process for the sale of the land at lots two three and four the description as previously set there as previously resolved so resolved unsupervised swinging pills 10.5 um i 'll call that report mr um general manager through you um the director may like some comments on there yes thank you mr minister i 'll ask the director bush high service to talk to the report police through you mr administrator i don 't have a lot of information to add to what the report details a little bit further information was requested from statewide council 's insurers uh to to address any risk and liability um directly from them that was sent to you and the general manager prior to the meeting um i 'm not sure whether you wanted to tape all that as well but that should retire that also addresses the community concerns and how council proposes to address that in the new operational further information thank you mr director i i have some concerns about this proposal my concern relates around liability and safety and i 'm wondering if we could get a further background report on the operationals from the information that you put yesterday and table today on councils that are operating these pools on particularly any issues in operational requirements on how we 're proposing to operate the pools and bring a report back to the next meeting through you mr administrator if you don 't make a decision today you will be unable to get the infrastructure in place to run unsupervised swimming pools mr general manager what 's plan b you 've got two options you can either leave the pools as they are and advertise for lifeguards in all pools or you can go with a recommendation in the report to trial unsupervised swimming pools if you want further information and and how other councils are operating theirs further to the statewide information provided i won 't have the time to put the infrastructure in including the automatic gates uh remote supervision signs to be able to gates in will you have ctv um and explain to me how you record who 's going into the pool numbers and compliance with the operational requirements of the cards the gated access is on a card or sob system that 's proposed to have them at the council offices they 're issued to the the parent or the responsible person for the family in issuing those they undergo an induction process which explains that all liability is passed to the responsible parent um who signs over for that card access system the cctv can 't_''_1866.24 be monitored while the pools are open it 's more of a deterrent and a recording device that monitors people coming in and out your concerns about children going in unsupervised has merit there 's nothing we can do there other than the advice that 's been received from our insurers that if we follow due process and have the signs and processes in place now administration plans that children are the responsibility of a parent or responsible person that would be out of our control and it may present further risk for possible 're not prepared to accept all that liability and risk we shouldn 't go ahead with it mr administrator yes mr general manager i 've got a question for the director if we try two-pronged approach in the sense that we looked to engage lifeguards at wycliffe 's and ivanhoe and i recall we didn 't really have an issue with white cliffs in attracting lifeguards uh ivanhoe did we or didn 't we have trouble in the past in attracting lifeguards down there uh we 've had issues at ivanhoe with lifeguards and attendance and pool closures in the past okay so what i 'm sorry i 'll make one other comment the reason i think we should be trying this for is in council 's interest from a financial perspective it costs us three to five hundred thousand per year to operate in main town swimming pools and we only open them three to four hours per day in hot summer months in some of the most arid places in new south wales here we can have a system that lets the pool be open all day and all that that was where i was coming from if the general manager and the administrator don 't think it 's in council best interest i 'm happy to keep it as is thank you decision thank you um director for the show services um i 'm thinking about trying that i agree with what you 're saying and um i think it 's worthwhile trying but i 'm thinking about flipping it around the other way is is gage our lifeguards bring the system in and slowly phase out the lifeguards could that work that gives you a bit of time to actually bed in your systems and get your procedures in place get your cctv working properly without having to rush prior to the prior to the swimming season happy to do what 's what i 'm instructed if i can make comment i 've certainly worked in a council and was the general manager where such a system was introduced and certainly much more mature organization in terms of software procedures and policy and it took some time to bed down particularly ongoing operational issues i like 's reasoning for the cost and service to the public but at the end of the day my concern is risk and public safety um i think if we could proceed with a staged implementation i would be happy to deal with that and implement it uh for the for the trial this period mr general manager any comment yeah that 's where i was heading um with mr um with mr administrator is that um is i totally agree what the director is saying is uh yes it gives the community longer access to the swimming pools um my concern is is actually the take-up and trying to implement the process in a matter of couple of months uh and get the community on board and get them settled i think we could engage the lifeguards for uh a six-month period uh up to christmas uh with the view of trying to get this system in place and slowly phase out the lifeguards you know by christmas eve if we have to maybe by the end of the swimming year swimming season with uh a full understanding that next do you think that would work director you got any comments on that proprietal no no further comment mr general manager he got a resolution for me um look yeah look i think we 'll keep uh line two uh implement unsupervised swimming pool operations at ivanov white cliffs over the over the 2021-22 swimming season with the view of phasing out lifeguards for the following swimming season or the current season depending upon wake up success and satisfactory implementation yep if we could uh have those words mr general manager and i 'm happy to resolve that way receive the report and two as per the general manager 's comments there i 'll work with the minute taker to form up the the recommendation thank you and mr general manager i think that once you do that and get that in place we need some press uh given it did generate a bit of public interest i 10 0.6 leased between council and the bureau of meteorology it is straightforward so i 'm happy to deal with this there 's no comments no mr administrator the result that council of council to the lease between central darling shire and the bureau of meteorology for the purpose of accessing the will kenya aerodrome land lot one dp906 that 's all i really need to resolve because um when you fix the common seal it 's the general manager and the the administrator signs off on that so i 'll just leave it at that one uh services update 10.7 again i think it 's straightforward unless there 's any exception comments no thank you mr master i will resolve that we receive and make the report roads an aerodrome report in point eight again i 'm happy to deal with it unless there 's any exception report no mr mr resolve that council receive and note the report 10.9 water and sewer updates happy to deal with it once again uh no further comment mr administrator result that we receive and note the report the minutes of the committee meeting we have 11.1 the minutes of the white cliffs community association that is of july 21 i will resolve the minutes of the white cliff community association wacker meeting held uh we have some matters in confidential and i will resolve that council move into confidential to consider the matters listed in the confidential section of the agenda in accordance with section 10 a of the local government 1993 for the reasons specified being prejudiced the commercial position of the person and confirm a commercial advantage upon this we 'll resolve that at 9 43 we _"

those visits on hold and they will remain on hold until we believe it is safe will travel across the state and into the central darling community the only other comment i want to make is the general manager and i have had video conferences with the office of local government staff they 're moving towards the uh looking at developing the model for the future governance of central darling and they

council delegates authority to the general manager to enter into an agreement with services new south wales and two any necessary documents be authorized for execution under the common seal of council if required thank you we will now move to shire services reports item 10 item 10.1 the menindee residential lot dwelling project mr general managers through you or your staff thank you miss minister i 'll actually start first and then i 'll hand over to the senior planner this report 's come about the council actually owns six residential properties in menindee and i understand this is a legacy going back to the previous councils or councils before where they were gifted these houses and subsequently continue to rent these houses years old asbestos type properties they are probably x trust or railway houses and they are costing council money in keeping them up to up to a reasonable standard of living so from council 's perspective i don 't believe that we are property developers or should be in the game of of investing in properties while we do have a uh a responsibility to ensure our community uh has adequate housing i don 't believe we should be in that market either so the idea is to eventually look at selling these properties either to the tenants or to other interested parties so i 'll hand over to the senior planner and i 'll get her to explain the steps from here mr general manager if i could just come in there please the just a question and the planner may be able to answer this it appears that we 've got to prepare an amendment through the planning process to amend the central darling local environmental plan to change the classification of land to permit sale or et cetera of the land i 'm just wondering is there of management at this stage if council resolves to proceed to amend the lep is there a necessity to do that or can we i 'm just thinking we 're doubling up preparing a plan of management and and the amendment is there a requirement to prepare that plan of management or can we proceed straight into the uh lep amendment oh i asked the senior planner to answer that question administrator and general manager um [Music] as you 're probably aware from the other planning proposals that we 've been putting through it takes a minimum of nine months to get an amendment to the central dwelling local environmental plan um for the reclassification of that land because at the moment it is community land it 's not operational land so in order for us to sell the land or gift it to maybe the housing commission or aboriginal housing or whoever we still need to reclassify the land in the meantime as it is community land we are actually required under the local government act to have a plan of management in place and the leases the people to have be under a lease connected to the plan of management or at least a license um i understand there are licenses but i 'm not sure what type they are um so therefore technically yes we need a plan of management and we do need to do a planning proposal to amend the legislation in order to sell the land or dispose the land or gift the land um unfortunately as we 've covered the nine-month time frame may end up being longer so i suppose it 's uh you 've got to take the risk factor into account whether we prepare a plan of management to tide us over until the planning proposal is made or we talk to the office of local government who is actually already requested a list of our plans of management and leases which we haven 't been able to provide as of yet thank you yeah thank you um [Music] senior planner the question i 've got is that i think we ought to have the discussion with the local government if we resolve that we 're going to change the commute within the community we resolve to amend the classification then we prepare a lease is there an urgent requirement or can and could we proceed with the office of liberal government 's approval to head straight to the lep process um mr general manager your thoughts express administrator look this is not an urgent project um this is something which is it 's been a legacy for quite some time and it 's just you know even my time here for the last three years it 's been sitting there festering away and you know council is going to have to at some stage invest quite heavily in some major works on these things so we can defer the report more than the recommendations we can alter the alter the recommendations if you 'd like um it 's just giving us a leeway and a path into starting some action on this project as it 's going to take a number of years to to resolve even if we go to if we sell them sell the properties if we give the properties whatever how however we dispose of do so i 'm just noting the recommendation doesn 't talk about a plan of management i 'm quite happy to pass the the to resolve the recommendations as providing we have those discussions with olg and we could re we could resolve to prepare the planner management if required at a future date um if we proceed that way it certainly enables uh council and its staff to commence the process of rezoning is it mr general manager comments from yourself do you see if there 's a problem if we went that way no i don 't see any problems um i 'd just like to again start a process on this and make sure that we we 're you know continually chipping away at it like we said it 's going to take a number of years to to come to a resolution on the matter um how we you know if we dispose or how we handle these properties so if you want to add a uh additional recommendation that uh that uh council enters into discussions with olg uh regarding uh the plan uh the you therefore i will resolve one council receive a note the information and options for the council owned community land at lot 1 dp 106 4 2 0 at 31 34 four sorry thirty one forty one darling street street menindee to recommend the planning proposal process to commence or resolve i 'm sorry result that the planning proposal process commenced for the reclassification of the community land to operational land with an amendment to the central darling local environmental plan 2012 3 resolve that council commenced discussions with the new south wales housing and new south wales aboriginal housing regarding the disposal of the six residential dwelling lots four council commenced discussions with the office of local government on the proposed process so resolved we 'll move to clause 10.2 planner management and lease for 44 reed street or kenya lot one s13 section 13 dp 759091 barca cultural center mr general manager thank you mr administrator i have no further comments however the senior planner may wish to make commentary on her report thank you mr administrator and general manager um as with the previous project this one and draft lease was required to be prepared it was exhibited for a minimum of 28 days council received no comment except the minor comment on the lease where the lease was amended and other than that we received no further submissions on the plan of management or the lease therefore council if they resolve to adopt it i don 't think there 's any issues inhibiting the plan of management or the lease being implemented thank you senior planner mr general manager i note that the next report deals with this same site could we just clarify the linkage between the two reports thank you mr scrotum once again i 'll ask the rev senior planner to explain that please um this first report is on the plan of management which as i said we 've already exhibited with the lease under the local government act we are required to have a plan of management and a exhibited lease because it is community land and this is also to a certain degree of stop gap measure because we 're also with the next report um commencing a uh planning intention is to give the land to the barca aboriginal cultural community with aboriginal corporation so that they can actually run their cultural center so the plan of management and the lease enables there 's a development application or coming up to actually start or commence the works for this cultural center so the plan of management enables that um the reclassification of the land enables the eventual sale of the land thank you thank you mr administrator just one of my commentary on what the senior planner made then um she mentioned gift land that 's not quite that 's not correct it 's actually sale of the land and the value of the property the land will be done by a licensed valuer thank you thank you mr general manage for that clarification so i 'll deal with the 10.3 oh sorry 10. 10.2 thank you i will resolve that council receive the report and note the information on the completion of the exhibition of the planner management and draft lease for the new land use category general community use and new use of the community cultural center street will kenya two

ireland shire council and the barca cultural center will kenya aboriginal corporation for the use of the land as the barker cultural center i 'll now move to clause item clause 10.3 planning proposal for the reclassification of land at 44 reed street or kenya lot 1 section 13 dp 759091 barker cultural center um i 'm happy to deal with the matter mr general manager unless there 's anything else you want to add or the senior planner to this report no thank you mr administrator resolve that council will recommend that council commence the preparation of a planning proposal to reclassify the community land at lot 1 section 13 dp 759091 44 reed street or kenya to be reclassified as operational land to resolve to inform the department of planning industry and environment of the intention to prepare the planning proposal to reclassify the land from community land to operational zero one 144 reed street or kenya so resolved okay item 10.4 planning proposal to reclassify land mr general manager thank you mr um 10.4 we want to defer this report um i 'll let the senior planner explain why mr administrator and general manager um the department of planning industry and environment even though they actually stated that the amendment will be made by this date due to covert restrictions parliamentary council has not been able to finish processing the amendment therefore they 've asked us to withhold this current report thank you mr general manager senior planner i 'll resolve that item 10.4 planning proposal to reclassify land at bonnie street will kenya be deferred for a further report so resolved item 10.5 draft assessment plans and strategy the draft assessment management plan and maturity assessment report and asset management strategy mr general manager and you or your staff mr administrator i 'll hand this over to the director for shy service the main comment through you miss administrator as part of the ipnr fraud new south wales councils we 're required to have a asset management strategy our long time long-term financial planning to guide in the planning construction and maintenance of our assets uh these are draft plans uh presented to council and the recommendation is to go to public exhibition so the community can review and provide feedback if warranted thank you mr director in that public consultation uh period will the public and i note the complexity of the documents have an opportunity to talk to you or the consultants about the plans if required certainly okay and another question to through you mr general manager um has our finance people had a chance to look at the plans and uh any gut feeling on initial um thank you mr administrator i 'll ask the manager for finance to make commentary regarding the asset management plans uh thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator at this point of time i have not had the chance to review any of these plans um but i will certainly uh have a look at them shortly as we move into our next um financial plan uh mr general manager the director has not got budgets and works programs going forward through mr administrator um the strategy identifies that across all asset classes we have sufficient funding um to maintain our current assets to a a standard that we accept particularly for road works however there is no capacity for council to fund any capital works or improvements uh and it basically outlines that we 're entirely dependent on grant funding for capital works i have to go into each asset class and explain each one to you but i 'm happy to address that in a further report after it goes to public exhibition thank you okay i 'm happy to deal with the matter and will i will resolve that council received the report to seek community feedback by public exit exhibition period for 28 days three report back to council following consultation period with findings i 'm going to add an extra four one uh extra item four that the general manager convened a workshop um with myself and and staff to review the implications of the asset management plan the ralph death asset management plans so resolved uh mr general manager we get past this cove and can travel again thank you item 10.6 regional roads repair program mr general manager through you thank you mr once again i 'll hand over to the director for shy services through mr administrator the report details the um offer of funding of up to four hundred thousand dollars to um for an initial seal project on the ivanovandi road the initial the initial application by council was to extend the seal from the ivanhoe end going towards menindee following recent rains wet weather and a couple of incidents it 's in the it 's in the interest of council to address a road safety concern adjacent to a property called palapa it 's about 40 40 kilometers west of ivano towards menindee and this report seek to right to transport new south wales to change the location to that one there 's no no additional cost however it was originally not budgeted for in in the draft budget that i did it was unexpected funding we we normally don 't get the repair funding each year uh due to our location and traffic funding each year uh fortunately for us we have um and this number three of the recommendation seeks to source the council 's contribution of 575 000 out of the regional road block grant to enable that project to proceed do we add that council funding from the regional road block grant do we need those words in item three mr director happy to include that in item three thank you [Music] i will resolve to receive the report to right to transport new south wales requesting change of location works on main road 433 iron home and indy road three allocate 575 000 of capital roads funding from where mr director the reconstruct and seal three kilometres of road from 36.5 kilometers to 39.5 kilometers that 's a three kilometer section from ivanhoe towards menindee now the funding uh that would be updated in the first quarterly budget review or to come out of the regional roadblock grant we 've allocated 1.2 million out of that block grant for capital works those capital works will have to be amended to reflect the 575 000 council contribution okay i just grant that 's correct to reconstruct and seal three kilometers of road 36.5 kilometers to 39.5 kilometers from ivanhoe towards menindee 4 update the budget accordingly accordingly in the first business report qbr so resolved we 'll move to item 10.7 roads to recovery 2021 to 2022 allocation mr general manager thank you mr australia no i have no comments uh however the director of the fire service may wish my country uh three miss administrator the r2r allocation for this financial year as detailed in the report is uh 695 670 dollars uh the three projects identified as a priority there list uh two roads two local roads in ivanhoe uh the trider road and the muller detroiter road both those roads haven 't had any capital works been done in the last 20 years continuous maintenance grading and drainage issues there see the roads closed for extended periods of time following rainfall we need to build up the low-lying sections of la of road on both roads and and put new culverts in uh the third one there is to reconstruct wall street in will canyon between mcintyre been patching that for some years and the new curb and gutter will create better access for residents and address some drainage issues there so they 're the three projects proposed to be allocated to the roads of recovery project to be completed by june 2022 and these fit within our asset management strategy mr director they 're directly involved in the transport asset management plan with respect to culverts on the two uh local roads and then we 'll kenya township wall street the pavement is also due for renewal as part of life cycle costs for local roads thank you i will deal with the matter i 'll resolve that we receive the report to allocate the 2021-22 roads to recovery funding to the following projects wall street will canyon reconstruction curve and drainage improvements do we need to define the area in there the section just to be clear to the community uh yeah we can amend that it is between mcintyre and field street uh i will include that in general managers pick that up in the resolution tried a road formation reconstruction and new culverts that again to define the location muller to try to road formation reconstruction and new culverts again the same if there 's a section in there i 'm so happy to resolve we 'll do for item 10.8 and terry ryan progress report mr general manager thank you mr administrator um as the report is in front of you i suppose the biggest concern is there is going to be a overspend on the project um as the project uh engineer has pointed out this stage we don 't know the full extent of the overspend um however i 've asked that we look at the overspend in coming months to actually finalize the overspend will be to complete the entire project so that we have a better handle on on the run on the actual overspend um this will come about once we 've done at least see once we 've completed two two sections uh we 'll have a lot better idea of the actual cost instead of um surmising or guessing anything as we go um we have to keep in mind that um when we actually in 2019 20 189 fish kills we received the funding for this uh we didn 't sign an uh the grant without location with the state and federal government until 2019 um in that time we will base our costs on best guess i suppose you can call it we 've never had a we never had time to do a detailed survey of the the of the the rule the road itself in its longitude in its horizontal and vertical alignments uh we never had a time we never had time to actually do a design uh um on on the road uh on vertical alignment to regarding what issues around flooding also too there was a number of low-lying areas which we knew of but we never done the the volumetric survey to work out how water was going to flow through so um also to the um the environmental survey was done after we received the funding so with those contributions um has pushed the project over uh also to um we have to take into consideration that um you know there 's possibly a going to that in as well so um i 'd suggest in two or three months time we 'll have a better handle on what the project is actually going to cost and we 'll bring a report back to council uh with what we think is actually going to be the overall budget for around the pinkery road thank you mr general manager any other comments uh no thank you um just i 'll make some comments this project is certainly receiving a high level of community interest and it 's a matter that i receive regular uh representations from the menindee community on therefore it 's a high profile project we committed to an open and transparent process once the concerns were raised about the damage of the archaeological and heritage issues i 'm pleased the question was asked today about the reports um and uh we 're happy to say that those reports were presented to council and available to the public certainly um cost wise i think we were all aware um it had the potential to blow out certainly beyond the grant given that we never had project so accept that mr general manager i see that there 's going to need to be some ongoing reporting on this matter i note that you 're still in negotiations for issues to resolve the impacts of the archaeological and heritage damage i 'd look forward to bringing that report as soon as you can back to us how we 're proceeding and to deal with ongoing construction i 'd say that we need a monthly update report there so i 'm happy to deal with the matter if you don 't if you can certainly add to my comments i 've made it if you wish to there thank you miss administrator yes look i 'm happy for a report come from the project engineer on progress of the works um that will be my reports will be separate at a higher level and talking about um the costs uh the overall costs and the engagement with the community while the project engineer reports uh he 'll report every bi-monthly uh on the progress of the of the construction and you know the weekly updates as such just with the matter i will resolve the council receive and note the report on the pune kerry road uh initial seal construction too that further reports be brought forward on dealing with the help me out here mr general manager the um construction reports on a bi-monthly basis to council and two um further reports we bought on on the future funding and cost of the project so resolved uh item 10.9 unsupervised swimming pools interesting report mr general manager if you 'd like to make comment thank you mr minister yes it is interesting and it 's another um way of looking at it and it 's a bit of an out of box thinking and um i recommend the director for shy services for his report and i 'd like to like him to actually talk to it through you mr administrator as the report details we 've struggled in the past to provide the service to the communities due to a lack of lifeguards and employees for casual staff to keep the swimming pools open following discussions with our insurers statewide mutual there 's a number of that are unsupervised from an insurance perspective that can be dr addressed through science 's remote supervision uh and an access card and process to access the swimming pools so this report aims to seek community feedback for a public exhibition for 14 days it 's not 28 days because we need the time to install the infrastructure council decides to go ahead with the trialling at um unsupervised pools at white cliffs and ivanhoe it 's proposed if it does go ahead and and council 's happy with the community feedback we can monitor that and see how it goes over there over the summer months for this season and see if um council has any interest in in expanding that to all kenya and menindee it 's not proposed to bring that in at will kenya and india at the moment due to some behavioural issues we 've had at both pools over the over the last two seasons so um like like i say the reports there it details um what liability and insurance risks are associated with the with the operation of our swimming pools but the community that will have longer pool opening hours through the summer months a question mr general manager show you to the director i 'm certainly aware of um supervised and after hours access to pools with cards but my understanding in terms of risk management that was for informed adults have you talked to the insurers about the risk of say [Music] people who are not classified as informed adult adults entering those unsupervised pools uh yes we yes we have the the proposal would be to have a responsible adult sign for the card or fob that accesses the gate and by signing that liability or insurance is covered by that a responsible adult taking responsibility for their own family members there is concern that you know a lot of kids will access the pools unsupervised but as the report states that we 've got the appropriate signs up as remote supervision we 've got the proper management plans in place and and we 're monitoring that you know you can look at possible cctv that sort of thing so there is no liability or insurance risk concern those um requirements okay i 'm happy to deal with the matter but in bringing a report back i 'd certainly like to see comments from councils particularly rural and remote um the the operational issues they 've experienced i have some concerns about risk particularly the um children accessing it and the cards being used to bring multiple people in i 've certainly experienced that in another council that happened and cctv we had to end up banning people etc but i 'm happy to explore the opera the the concept and i 'm happy to deal with the report and the recommendations and will resolve council receive the report to seek community feedback by a public exhibition for a period of 14 days i think the 14 days may be a little bit short and 14 or and i 'm happy to add in as determined by the general manager to that part of the recommendation report back with findings at the ordinary meeting of council including information from councils operating a similar concept did we get that uh through you mr administrator if you would like our council meeting or offline if you need further information um i think i 'm happy to workshop that uh mr director we could do that uh not in a council meeting but with the general manager and yourself and the insurers are happy to workshop that thank you mr i 'll well we 'll propose a workshop in a couple of weeks time around about the same time when the the public expedition period closes thank you do you think 14 days is adequate the reason why i asked for 14 days is because i 'd still like to get the report following that public consultation to the august meeting we need time to be able to put the infrastructure in to be able to have it ready for the first of november yes thank you we 'll do it with 10.10 uh roads and aerodromes report mr general manager thank you mr administrator no i have no further comments however the director for short services may wish to make commentary no nothing further from me happy to deal with the matter and i will resolve that we receive and general manager um start getting this administrator no i have no further comments however the director for child services may wish in the commentary uh three missed administrator or water supplies to all towns are adequate following rainfall and flows so there 's um water security is no issue at the moment for for i 'll just update you briefly on the capital works we awarded the the contract for the three new water treatment plants and that 's going along with the detailed design through membrane systems australia uh we have the 25 design meeting uh tomorrow um to discuss that an initial um initial findings of that with our uh expert consultancy water technology uh our senior planning officer is assisting with some development application works with regards to the new buildings on the water treatment plants and that 's in progress uh the white cliffs articulation design uh hasn 't been completed that 's with public works out of the dubbo office uh the survey works there have been completed and the design changes have been clarified they 're still doing the hydraulic analysis and um and the environmental stuff is nearing completion as well um and council expect to submit the a here shortly for the retic works which which from experience takes a little bit of time and the last one that will can your gravity sewer project we haven 't had anything in writing or further feedback from the department of primary industries and environment thank you mr director and just a couple of questions following your comments i note uh the white cliffs works proceeding and you hope to have that expect to commence october 21 pending 60 section 60 approval i also note that that can take some time from dpi water are we sure we 're going to meet that deadline well we 've done everything possible in our power i 've kept dpi e and their senior approval people bill howe and his his department they 've been invited in discussions um not only a concept design stage but but through the whole process so they 're up to speed with everything we 've done and i 've provided monthly reports so they 're well aware of what we 're water treatment plants they have no issues with uh they 're very surprised and and excited that we um were able to get a tender and a water contract within budget so i can 't see any anything initially why that process would be held up and there 's also things going on at a higher level at a federal and state government level about the whole section 60 approval process so i think that their own department may be under a little bit of internal pressure to try and get this thing these things expediated so you don 't have local councils held up through this process thank you mr director the the second comment regards the smart meters it says an original budget of 50 000 um is that our budget or is that some grant funding no that 's our budget that was um included to finish off the smart meters so whilst we um put smart meters in at will kenya and ivanhoe it was an oversight on the utilities engineer in my behalf that we missed some in that rollout program so there is some finish off those whilst not directly related to this report to you and the finance manager are our water meter reading progress is it up the date and the progress on recovery of outstanding amounts through you i can 't mr administrator i can 't speak for the finance side of it but i know that i 've spoken to daryl and just for you gordon he 's up to speed with every getting all the water accounts out and the smart meters are really working well for him there hasn 't been much community interest we have the ability for the community to to log into the my water platform and check their own meter billing or any any information on their own water usage i don 't believe that 's been accessed by a lot of people other than other than staff when trialling the the platform but it 's good the council provides that [Music] administrator um council was lucky enough around in the drought federal government drought funding uh round one where we did allocate funding to smart meters however in the second round and with these meters on private property it actually doesn 't align to the guidelines of the funding funding so we 're actually quite lucky in one sense that we were able to fund originally the first rollout of the of the smart meters under under a funding scheme um so from you know from here on in is going to have to be funded through councils you know potentially through a grant internal grant yeah but the meters even though they 're on private property they 're the the the media property that 's correct the meters are belong to council but because we 're installing meters and they are located on private property it 's a conversation i 've had uh when we found out we had a shortfall and a couple other opportunities with grants because it 's put on private residential and commercial properties it doesn 't doesn 't fall into the guidelines of those grants and we would we would try to in this round two um when drought when the drought federal money drought money came out uh there was a bit of conversation a bit that and they said no because it 's not infrastructure on council property the council has a legal right to put it on that property under the local we have the legal right under the what is that i believe and the local government act there it 's there to enter in him okay i 'm happy with the comments received i will resolve to receive and note the report uh 10.12 services update mr general manager through you um i 'm happy with the report unless there 's some additional information there no i haven 't got any further and by looking at the the director for shy services haven 't got any further concrete the the only comment i 'd make um it 's great information the services capital works i note we 've got some build building stronger communities i think it would be good for the public 's information to see where that money was actually being spent uh if we could have some projects identified under there because there 's been a lot of money poured in under that program in the community it 's there i 'll leave that with you mr general manager to consider police and a resolve to receive and note the report your grants report yeah certainly in the grants report but there 's no detailed breakdown location etc that 's what i was looking at i note there 's no minutes from the committees and we 'll move to item 12 confidential matters and i will resolve that council move into confidential to consider matters listed uh in the confidential section of the agenda in accordance with section 1082 of the local government act 1993 for the reason specified uh the item is the bitumen spray seal contract and it 's considered confidential under the local government act section 10 2ad as it relates to a commercial information of a confidential nature that would have disclosed prejudice the commercial position of a person who supplied it or confer a commercial advantage on a competitor of council or reveal a trade secret so at 1004 we 'll move into confidential and asked if the public could leave the gallery please _"

mr general manager thank you miss administrator um i 'll call on our acting rights officer to make comment on the report please i only have only have one small uh item to to mention and that is there 's been one furthermatic uh fully completed there were three matters that were pending registration of transfers one of those was registered uh late last week there 's still two more to be registered which we are fully confident will happen within the next couple program for the sale of land for unpaid rates for this round no doubt there will be a need to go through the process again at some stage down the track as indicated in the report thanks mr general manager just a question i know that the ordinary meeting council resolved uh 20th of may that they bring forward a report action plan to reduce outstanding debt when are we likely to expect that um yes thanks administrator yes that will be coming um we 'll look at it coming in july um on that one just one thing further i 'll just like to thank the um the rates officer for actually um going through this process uh for the last 18 months it has been a a long-winded process and it 's been new process to the staff here at the council it 's been something which was necessary for council do under local government act considering that council rate revenue 33 was actually unrecoverable due to unpaid rates um so it was a necessity we had to undertake just another question to the rights officer how will sets for unpaid rates uh thank you uh the uh well the ratios will should improve uh by virtue of the write-offs that we 've incurred uh effectively the sale for unpaid rates would either recover the unpaid rates or force us to write off uh the shortfall from any sales as indicated in the report the majority of sales resulted in a shortfall in fact all of them except one um so that that ride off has actually reduced their outstanding debt um albeit at the uh at an expense on the profit and loss that was something we always expected would happen so i 'd be interested in the projected ratio at some stage if you could report on that i won 't resolve that i 'll refer that to the general manager you can pick that up so we will for item 7.2 resolve the council receive and note the report as being the final report on this round of sales for unpaid rates thank you uh to the rights office has been an outstanding effort we moved to clause 7.3 cash and investments mr general manager manager of finance to make comments on this uh thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator uh council 's bank balance uh as at the 31st of may 2021 was 8.9 million uh this represents a decrease of some hundred and twenty from the previous months um the reasons behind that is the council made payments for wages and suppliers of 3.8 million um and receipts for the month were 3.087 million um in terms of the receipts the major receipts that were received for the period was um in fourth installment of the federal assistant grant of twenty 728 thousand uh some payments from four rows to recovery of two hundred and twelve thousand grant received from the national indigenous australian agency of forty five thousand and an amount of one point six six million from transport new south wales which represented rms works on um it was resealing and ceiling works on the tilpa west road the barrier highway and some works out at rosewood going on the loan for the garbage trucks now stands at 162 8333. it is uh interesting to note that to three hundred and ninety one dollars whereas um several months ago it was hovering around a thousand dollars so that is a good result as the principal reduces and as mentioned we are still on track to repay that loan by june 2022 thank you i will resolve the council 's receive and note the report we moved to the grant registration the 2021 current grant register mr general manager i 've only got one question apparently we 're migrating the uh register of the pulse software to be completed by july can you confirm that we 'll be the post uh yes thank you miss administrator yes we around about july the there 's no other comments i 'll resolve that we receive and adopt the report move to item eight governments reports the food kerry road construction investigation of impacts and harm to aboriginal cultural heritage mr general manager um thank you mr administrator i suppose the major item in the report is the actual report received from the independent engineering firm hds australia who has done an audit on the project um they 've found a the issues around the native veg but also in how the project was managed how the project was actually structured um training of site monitors um you know reading right through to um the a hip how that was actually presented to council so um the report doesn 't do the report doesn 't point any fingers at any particular officer or agency however there 's 53 recommendations has come out of the report um from that council will be presenting next month with those 53 recommendations what council has done to rectify uh those issues raised in the report or what we intend to do moving forward um [Music] also too i 'd like to report that i did meet with the bhakti rangers and members of the indian tourism association last wednesday to go over section three or the third section which was commenced and which was currently uh has stopped at present moment just to walk over looking at recommencement of works there there 's a number of issues which still needs to be resolved around that area um so yeah in july there 'll be another intend to deal with them and now further update thank you i 've got some questions as you indicate there 's a number of issues that need to be addressed how 's the council currently addressing those issues and what 's happening there in progress look like i said um next meeting i 'll present table of those 53 recommendations and how we 're going to address them um there 's a number of issues in there um for me to go through it at the present moment it 's going to take some time so i want to be assured that council can be comfortable we 've recommenced work and the recommendations are being carried forward on that work that 's that 's correct and a lot of the a lot of the recommendations we 've actually dealt with probably two-thirds of them yeah it 's around the project management and installing uh processes to make sure that we don 't have the reoccurrence uh what we 've just had and also improve our project management of the project overall thank you mr general manager the purpose of this an open and transparent review of the project management we have received that as the general manager noted there is no blame to any particular person or agency organisation but a series of systematic failures in there and we 're addressing those so if there 's no further comments i will resolve that council receive the report and endorse a further progress report to be presented to council at its meeting in july including a full budget report cost to date and projected the works within the current funding so resolved 8.2 cemetery record management system mr general manager thank you mr administrator i think the report pretty well outlines um the cemetery record management system we 've been engaged a software program optimus extensia software which has been implemented in the last three to four months that replaces a paper-based record management system which council had across the whole whole council organisation um this also this software program also allows uh the public to actually go into a portal and research by cemetery um any persons of deceased and also to to look for future plots for reservations so far as it actually firms up our record keeping uh puts it into a central repository also too that um it allows the general public to view our cemeteries do any sort of history do any history uh work they want to do around deceased and also to book plots for the future so overall cost council i think five thousand dollars um to set up uh with a maintenance fee of 720 dollars per annum and so i think it 's worthwhile investment thank you mr general manager i certainly agree it 's a good investment and one that provides better customer service in terms it 'll be ultimately an online uh access to it the only comment i would make just for reference when preparing reports we need to stay with the format the risk legislation etc that that is actually an information report yeah it 's not actually um okay yeah that 's why otherwise if it was a recommendation you put those on there okay okay we will resolve to receive and note the report item 8.3 correspondence from melinda paley mp um mr general

    "text": "thanks everyone i would like to declare the ordinary council meeting of the 20th of may 2021 open central darlingshire council i 'd like to acknowledge from the country i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land and pay my bill respect to elders past present and emerging call item for any disclosures of interest no no resolve that there 's no disclosures of interest item five confirmation of the minutes of the ordinary meeting 22nd of april 2021 mr general managed to give any comments no thank you mr minister will resolve that the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on the 22nd of april 2021 be received and confirmed item 6 is a notice of motion by the administrator and i will move that the general manager bring forward a report to the june council meeting detailing one issues and concerns associated with the operation of the electronic road condition signs recently installed at various locations in the shire and the program to rectify these two policy and operational procedures for road closures when electronic signs are not working including coordination with adjoining lgas road closures in a timely manner including clear road descriptors just in terms of comment um with the recent wet weather and road closures there 's certainly been issues emerge uh particularly in the signage wasn 't working correctly showing road closed or opened or vice versa and if it showed the signs weren 't working um there was a lack of getting hard closures up there and reopening now just in terms of the public and ratepayers there has been a meeting held with the joining lgas and national parks uh wentworth council by rental council central darling national parks in an attempt to coordinate uh and better deliver those services to the traveling public particularly as a lot of our towns now depend upon caravanners and etc moving through the area so i will resolve those three items there is a resolution for the minute taker i won 't repeat those so resolved item seven the administrator 's minute just in terms of quickly the the minutes there for everyone to read uh just in terms of uh i 've had contact with the office of local government to look at governance models for central darling i have also requested that those consultants travel to the shire and meet with residents and been given a strong commitment that will happen so we look forward to that moving very quickly the community strategic plan again i would encourage everyone to participate in that because that 's going to inform future funding options particularly for this council that depends so much on grants so it authorizes the council to pursue those grants it also informs government of what the community needs and sees as important the murray darling base darling association conference was held at wentworth which i attended central darlingshire council put up three motions they were successful um and they were supported by the the association and they related to the new south wales water sharing plans of the barrie for the barwin darling murray lower darling and northern basins to include minimum flow and storage levels that will protect the health of the lower darling river right through the whole systems and there was also a motion that the calculation of the water in the menindee lakes _''_282.0 to the lower darwin system and the minister spoke yesterday morning about that the general manager sent a letter that signed i signed requesting those variations wentworth has done that and the association and i believe we will get some support but it 's a matter of convincing the other states too but at least we 've got government support we also put a motion up about the listing of the munici lakes as a ramsar system and that was successful and the other one was at the murray darling basin called upon the basin governments to commission independent analysis of best available science in determining provisions and circumstances in relation to end system and valley pacific flow targets for the menindee lakes and particularly to develop design development agreed option and business case for the menindee lakes seems to be going nowhere at this stage joint organizations i 've participated in a review of that and put comments it 's a good system the joint organizations but it needs to be funded by government it was supposed to deliver the scale and capacity that the far west initiative was get some additional funding for the jos touch on workplace culture the general manager is developing a program for that of how things are done around the organization and the important issue of culture and delivery to the public so i commend that and trust it all staff will participate in that uh that 's all my report there so we will now move to financial reports of sorry just in terms of that one i 'll resolve that have been received and noted item eight financial reports we have the 2020-21 grants register mr general manager comments thank you mr administrator yes i just made a couple of comments and i 'll refer back to the prior to the meeting from public gallery in question time regarding the attachment but the more detail needs to be being publicized this uh that attachment listing all the grants and the funding bodies and the dollar amounts is on in a spreadsheet uh hence uh this spreadsheet is fairly large inside in sense that it has a breakdown further breakdowns on timeframes and stuff like that so that um what we will the report we will also report on any over expenditure or any time frames which is not being met through the grant uh also to uh we 'll do a media release to actually um over a period of a number of months and i 'm not sure how we 'll format that but we 'll talk about the different grants we uh we received and the breakdown on those grants especially around tourism and infrastructure projects thank you mr administrator thank you mr general manager i will resolve that council receive and adopt the report moved item 8.2 sale of land to unpaid rates auction results so the report is in front of us mr general manager any comments or through you to the rates club um thank you mr australia i haven 't got any further comments however our rights officer may like to add further commentary uh thank you uh not much more to add to what 's in the report we 've just progressed and completed now 65 matters uh notices to complete um that have previously been served have lapsed and uh of those it uh there 'll be 10 properties that will have to keep in current ownership and deal with the next opportunity to sell that 's about all i have to really add thank you mr general manager you you 're happy so yes i will resolve that council will receive and note the report to note that monthly reports will be provided to council until such time that the contracts of sales have been completed and the sale process is finalized three increased provision for doubtful debt provision for rates annual charges and interest by 108 thousand dollars and mr general manager that 's been factored into the draft budget uh major so thank you yes i 'll actually direct that question to the finance manager uh thank you mr administrator and through uh thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator uh in the draft budget currently there is no additional provision for doubtful debts um we generally assess the provision for doubtful debts at the end of this financial year so the impact will be in this financial year not the next financial year and you 'll it will be picked up through the qpr as debts are written off progressively thank you item 8.8 cash and investments as of april 2021 mr general manager no i haven 't have got any further commentary on this however the finance manager may want to add country thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator uh the report is there in front of you um i 'll just quickly go through some of the highlights our cash balance as at the 30th of april was a touch over 9.6 million this actually reflected a slight decrease over the month of some 42 000 uh the drivers of this were creditors and wages payments of slightly over 3 million offsetting that were major funding received of 1.7 million for natural disaster funding 50 000 for grant funding for the new south wales planning portal 786 500 contribution from the far west joint organization and a 148 odd thousand received from a payment claim from rms um our garbage truck um loan is now down to 176 thousand dollars and as reported previously this is on track to be questions the 1.7 million grant funding for natural disaster that was the earlier event in february earlier this year it 's reimbursement for works we 've already done that 's my understanding thank you and the 786 000 contribution from far west joint organisation for the tourism project that is uh made up of that million dollars we received so uh so the million dollars so we received a portion uh last financial year we picked up the 750 this year and then there will be another payment uh next financial year uh to complete the grant and the proposed works proposed works um there 's 12 items in there and i can 't recall all the top of my head but one just brings to mine was the painting of was the painting of the water towers but that project has been altered to to reflect works on that indie tourism center and some signage in menindee um i think there was some funding to be spent on the caravan parks with electronic booking systems there was some work money to be spent on [Music] on a customer service provides information for visitors so there 's enough there 's a number of project and also tours for sunset strip and children thank you for that given the comments earlier in the question time and again we can pick up that information in future reports and that 's what we 'll get thanks mr general manager 8.4 outstanding rates charges and other debts might i say a very enlightening report mr general manager thank you mr administrator yes it actually is a good report um done by the rights officer and it really highlights some of the issues that we are facing in outstanding debt and debt recovery i 'd like to hand over to our rates officer just to make further commentary on that and then i 'll finish off after eastern thank you thank you mr general manager through you mr administrator um yeah look the the report just presents i guess the snapshot of the position um and just presents that information in different ways and formats it doesn 't matter how you look at it though it is uh it is what it is a total uh including water consumption um and then obviously there is some money outstanding in there in our debtors book as well um it 's really a matter of understanding um what the risk is attached to these debts to understand really uh the way forward um the aging is typically how you would assess a risk um but it 's not the only way to to assess it really um so it does present the position it 's just based on evidence and facts um and it 's i guess reflects the position that uh many have known in the past probably for decades that we 've had a very bad record of collections of rates and charges thanks thanks daryl um further commentary that and [Music] when daryl completed his report um we had a meeting of staff um between the hr officer our rates officer and the financial match our finance manager uh as reported previously to council council was advertising a rates officer which was 22 hours a week um we ran the interviews for that however we never really got a suitable candidate for that position description just for not from my rates officer 's position but also to recover look at debt recovery as well so this role we 're proposing is going to be a full-time road bug role could be worked remotely or locally um this this role would be called um a financial officer for revenue for council um this position like i said is is around rates it 's around debt recovery it 's also uh looking at the revision of our fees and charges um of council in future years so the impact the impact to the budget will be additional 32 150 000 um on top sorry that much uh 32 150 right additional fire that 's right and overheads on what was already previously budgeted for this role uh with that we 'll do the next meeting the hr officer will include that in the report to just ratify ratify that change i 'm particularly concerned when i look at the schedule table nine vehicle sale thirty five thousand dollars ninety days over two cemetery eleven thousand da fees um [Music] i know cemetery fees are always a we have a policy about payment or cemetery fees upfront or an agreed schedule of payment i don 't tell you what i notice thank you and da fees again i find interesting that that 's there usually da fees um you collect those before any application is processed so and the vehicle sale 35 000 i assume that 's a book entry hasn 't been come off there and it 's showing up so if i make further commentary uh regarding the da fees because we haven 't had a position [Music] a debt recovery officer and that was being done through our environmental officer who was um organizing the debt recovery for da 's that role is now vacant so you know with this potential new role however and saying that um we have already issued invoices to those outstanding da 's and also to the rental uh the rents which are shown there as well okay thank you um just by the way our comment da shouldn 't be accepted until the fee is paid so there may be a need for policy because there 's a i will move result that we receive and note the report and i note that the resolution says three that needs to be one two that the general manager bring forward an action plan to reduce outstanding debt uh through recovery and i include assume that will include your proposed staffing arrangements in terms of uh structure there for budget impacts so thank you i will say resolved 8.5 quarterly budget review at the 31st of march 2021 mr general manager thank you mr administrator i 'll hand straight over to the finance manager uh thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator this is the quarterly budget review for the quarter ended 31st of march and the review is forecasting a decrease in our surplus budgeted surplus of thirty six thousand dollars down to a hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars um there are a number of drivers um around this decrease they mainly re uh revolve around additional funding required to complete our street cleaning program additional funding required to continue work on our ipnr planning framework we 've also allocated additional budgeted amounts for staff side we will be putting in an additional two hundred thousand dollars for rms works uh at will andrew creek which i believe are starting this month as far as the capital budget is concerned um there is a five million dollar reduction in the capital budget due to funding not being received this year for the white cliffs water treatment plant that funding is now scheduled to be received next year just a very brief comment also on our restricted funds after discussion with yourself and the general manager it has now been determined that it would perhaps be prudent to recognize our employee leave entitlements as a restricted to as a restriction to our general fund that amount is 983 000. general manager any comments no thank you um thank you for to the finance manager just a comment for myself on page 24 just in my comment i think we need to put some additional detail around the comments in the report going forward um i read an additional 240 000 has been allocated for hr and recruitment i think some additional information around there on reading and i know that 's not the case so there and the employee entitlements i assume that 's annual leave and long service that 's correct okay do we mr general manager a program to reduce annual leave entitlements there 's no formal program as such however we are talking to those staff who have excessive long service sleep and excessive annual lead and we 're trying to manage them as best we it 's very hard to um to put people on leave and backfill their roles mr general manager at some stage i 'd like to see a report on how we manage that leave going forward it 's a liability it 's increasing for the financial sustainability of the house i think it 's a discussion that we need to have at this table so at some stage um i 'm not going to put a time frame on it i 'd like to see a report within the next six months just like i mentioned that it is already mentioned in our border letter our management letter from the order office there is a repetitive yep is yeah it 's going to come at a cost to council because we we put people on leave we need to backfill those roles and especially when we 've got a long service 9 to 12 months um yeah yep no i agree totally with you and been in the situation but it 's a discussion we need to have and the community is aware of it too but the implications answer i will resolve that council one receive the third quarter budget review as it 's the 31st of march 2021 to adopt the variations to council 's 20 2020 21 annual budget three note the projected operating surplus of the financial year 2021 is 187 0004 note that the projected capital works budget expenditure for 20 20 21 is 14 596 and five the general manager brings forward a report on lead and long service leave liability to council and how we may manage that okay [Applause] page 25 item 8.6 draft 2021-22 integrated planning reporting documents for public exhibition mr general manager thank you just mr i 'd just like to make a few alterations amendments we 've got 2020 to 2021 it should actually read 20 20 20 21 22 so that that will need to be amended also too we 'd

in line with the ipad rate peg water charges and sewer charges are also forecast to rise by two percent again based on the ipad rating peg the budget will have a surplus of 182 000 uh some of the main drivers behind that will be capital grants received of 16 million seven hundred and eighty thousand dollars and we 're forecasting some small increases in wages and depreciation there will also be rms works that have been costed through the budget um they will come in at approximately seven million dollars the capital works program will come in at twenty million nine hundred and fifty six thousand dollars some of the major projects that will be completed out of this program will be eight million dollars for the poon carey road two point two seven five million dollars for road renewal and repair

plan three place the draft documents on public exhibition for 28 days seeking community submissions for consideration prior to adopting the documents at the june 2021 council meeting move now to government 's report nine nine point one poon carey road construction investigations thank you mr general manager thank you mr administrator um has laid out in the report in front of you uh since last council meeting we have resumed works on the puncary road but only on the two sections northern sections um and works being carried out by unbelievable earth movers prior to that we have met council met with considers community members of menindee especially with the aboriginal community around recommencement and done by osis so we got good feedback from from the community with the recommendations they were satisfied that works could resume on a number of advisors which came out of that meeting we 've also started our external audit on on the project management of pune carey road [Music] ghds australia david sutcliffe has visited the site and also met with key stakeholders and also council staff as part of the audit investigation into the into the project management of pinkery road and it will be likely that i will receive that report sometime next week which will be then tabled our council along with the rest of the documentation um like i said works did recommenced that was going to commence on tuesday 11th however um the monitors for the punkieri road was originally sourced through the bernini land council aboriginal land council um due to their um ceo leaving and their inability to provide monitors this has now been um sourced through the the barking native title group and uh there 's there 's a bit of a delay there by one day and organ and setting the third section which is uh being done by otolbra uh hasn 't resumed yet um we 've got to adjust the road design um especially around the vertical alignment of the road design so that there 's no more bulk earth works in excavating the road down any lower so what what i 've got to at this stage is it 'll be the finished sub base for the road construction with road road base going on top so that needs to be um go needs to be a meeting down on site with the community uh before any work starts down there to explain that to the community also talk to the community about rehabilitation of the of the of the site and clearing on trees and uh and stockpiles of seeing how that 's going to be done before anywhere there so um like i said there 'll be another report coming to council next month on the progress and mr general manager you 're satisfied in the arranging department satisfied we now have systems and processes in place that we don 't end up in this to get to recommence works uh part of the order is to make sure that these types of issues don 't flare up again in the long term um and put some more put more stringent uh restraints around the governance of project management of the of the job thank you okay i will resolve that councils receive the report and endorse that a further progress report be presented to council at the next meeting moved item 9.2 human resource management activities on page 33 mr general manager um thank you miss administrator i 'm going to hand over to the human resource officer my country on her report thank you general manager and through the administrator um the report nothing really too much to add with the report that 's in there um in terms of the positions um that are that are displayed in the report just a bit of an update that two of the positions the director business services and the environmental uh engineer it is currently progress in terms of offering and negotiating some employment relationships with some successful candidates so that 's been a already discussed that and the way forward and with regards to the senior project manager role we had a couple of candidates one withdrew and the other candidate we 've interviewed and uh wasn 't appropriate to progress his application any further um as indicated it does remain a bit of a challenge for council to recruit specialised in staff however not insurmountable and we 're looking at addressing that through putting in place a hr framework just on that hr framework a draft has been prepared and we 're looking at meeting with key stakeholders which is the leadership team and the consultative committee and management exec next week with regards to actually putting some robustness behind it the hr framework will actually guide um the organisation forward with putting some structure and robustness around the hr processes and ensuring that we may meet legislative requirements and our obligations and also dovetail into the ipnr 's framework around workforce management planning which will in turn obviously support the operational plans and budgets going forward the only other thing just to note is the thousand job package uh traineeship the back that um they 've received it they 've got a few more questions that they 'd like us to respond to so that will be forthcoming from there but other than that that 's probably needed to share for now thank you anything else mr general no thank you mr um congratulations hr is certainly one of those legacy issues that we need to move forward and advance into best practice that exists today so this is a good start and thank you very much so i will resolve that we receive and note the report and look forward to future updates item 8 9.3 the community participation plan

question i 've got um when are we going to see the finalization of the tender process for our water plants has been moving along at a very slow pace and i understand the issues but yep so um thank you mr estrada um currently it 's out for tender present moments of white cliffs and i believe will canyon and ivanhoe is the same last week there was a as part of the tender process there was a uh a site inspection at white cliffs regarding the site for tenderers and that 's compulsory as part of the part of the tendering process that if you are submitting a tender that you need to to be as part of that site inspection so i would say uh a report will be coming to council uh i wouldn 't like to say june because of july meeting uh on the recommended recommendation and potentially uh the same with looking at their nominee thank you i will resolve we receive and note the report and look forward to that report the service update 10.2 um general manager thank you mr strata um look i am i have no

and note the report planning proposal to reclassify land and the land we 're dealing with here is bonnie street or kenya and as indicated i intend to move that the council go into committee sorry 10.4 planner management for 44 reed street or canyon lot one section 13 dp 759091 the bach cultural center mr general manager uh thank you mr administrator i haven 't got any further comments uh however the senior planning officer may like to add commentary on this thank you general manager and through administrator uh this is a plan of management for again a council-owned general community land because we 're proposing a land use category of general community use and a new use of the land as a community cultural center we 're required to put up a plan of management and a lease and because it is actually a new land use category we are required to have a public hearing but please note the date of the public hearing is no longer the 8th of june it will be in the week of the 22nd of june uh we 've just got to finalize which chair but other than that the plan of management just outlines uh the proposed plans for the general the community cultural community centre and just outlines how the centre will operate and under what requirements it has to meet and the lease again is a standard community land lease from the crown lands that so this is not crown land they still need to follow the same form and again the minimum lease length for this kind of land is 12 months so we 've started at 12 months but it can be extended if required ah thank you thank you unless there 's another comment i will deal with it that count count resolved the council will receive the report note the information endorse the exhibition of the plan of management for the new land use category general community use and the new youth of community cultural center at lot 1 dp section 13 dp 759091 44 reed street will kenya receive the report and note the information and endorse the exhibition of the new lease for the land known as lot 1 section 13 dp759091 3 resolved to new land use category general community use and the new use of land for a community cultural centre or resolve to hold a public hearing on the new lease for use of land for the barca cultural centre five public meeting be held at the council chambers at 21 reed street will kenya and a date to be determined by the general manager so i 'll leave that date flexible there so we don 't get caught up with needs for research emotions etc okay now moved to 10.5 public hearing into planning proposal to reclassify land on page 53 mr general manager thank you mr administrator i haven 't got any further commentary however the senior finance officer to see the planning officer maybe you want to add commentary thank you thank you administrator and general manager um this papers to say that we 've had the public hearing we 've prepared the public hearing report and submission summary report as required under the local government act and the planning act the environmental planning assessment act um we 've prepared all the submissions uh we also know the recommendation public hearing attendees from the community did not support the planning proposal um also note that we 've had further submissions in support of the planning proposal to reclassify the land and also to note that generally council is in support of the reclassification of land because of the fact that it 's providing a medical community facility for vulcanuia that 's desperately needed um that 's about all thanks thank you planning officer i 'm going to move now that the council move into committee of the whole which for everyone 's information means that the suspension of the code of meeting practice occurs and the council may then conduct its business with the debate and um also give the opportunity for members of the public if they wish to make comment uh on this proposal i know there 's a lot of interest from the submissions and conversations i 've had and emails so i 'd request anyone who 's speaking three minutes and we 'll move forward from it anyone want to make a submission thanks mr administrator uh mr paul brown as indicated he wants to mr mr i 'm really just responding to some of the comments within the report to council one was the last comment that was made by the um planning officer and that was that the facility is urgently required in fact if you go through the list of activities of the clinic all of those are currently performed in existing facilities there 's no dispute that a new facility would be nice and certainly be probably a little more efficient and effective but it will not be providing any further services provided from what i can see secondly there are comments in the document about flood levels and it makes it quite clear that the floor of the building will be above the flood level what it doesn 't specify is how high above the ground that floor will be to keep it above those floodwaters in fact the um my assessment of the artist 's impression of the architect 's drawing is that it would appear to be six to eight feet at least probably closer to two meters above the ground the floor will be on stilts to that there will be open community space and community free area between the building and the river uh it should be pointed out and made quite clear that the land will belong to murrah all of that area was part of the lot that was going to be passed over to murama and in much of the documentation there 's little made of the sale of the land at the moment we 're talking about leases particularly in the plan of management it is indicated but it 's not quite clear in this the one other comment i would make mr administrator is that i would assume and expect that the background and detail of all submissions is uh examined by those making decisions on the basis that uh i 'm not suggesting in propriety i 'm part of anyone i 'm concerned about some things i 've heard recently about some of those submissions i simply ask that those submissions be reviewed carefully to ensure that there 's been no energy pressure any other comments no i think we 've covered most of the other issues mr administrator also on that river front because uh from what i can see at the moment it 'll be very poor for you from the bilby if those trees remain bill do you want to make comment mister in australia i appreciate that i didn 't put any previous datas in no not required in this case um just a couple of comments there one i was at that meeting that night at the council chambers here and i 'd just like to note that the seven people at the room who were against that um change of land or all right everybody else in the room was transient including the marijuana people who obviously wanted i am definitely not opposed to marijuana having a brand new centre i 'd like to see them have a great center that they can work out independently away from the hospital i 'm all for that and if i could just try and point out what paul was alluding to some years ago we had put out the nominations for citizen of the year and one particular citizen got 12 nominations and it turned out people who he was in control of and looked after and it wasn 't picked up in the council when they were all checked out and that person became citizen of the year i believe that that thank you for your forthright comments both of you in looking at this proposal i 've looked at it and visited the site a number of times and i understand the difficulty that the community is having here in looking at the submissions i don 't play a numbers game with submissions i look at the issues that are in there and i want to put some context around decision making that i as administrator am required to make here the council is in administration and the administrator becomes the council so there 's only one administrator so it falls to me so that 's the tough part of the job and i accept that and that means sometimes there 's going to be hard decisions made there and won 't always align with the community but that comes with the process so firstly i want to make sure and i 'm satisfied had to go back to another public hearing to ensure that happened i want to just reflect upon i 've worked in regional and rural new south wales and the issue of medical services continually comes up in communities provision of doctors and investment in facilities to attract doctors and allied services and i was at wentworth earlier this week and the talking the general manager they 've just had to come to an arrangement with an aboriginal health service that provide doctors to the community and that seems to be working well our shire is characterized by a sparse population and the large regional centre of broken hill where higher order medical services are concentrated we have the hospitals or mps providing services and the attraction of doctors is is problematic in all those centers i have now dealt with in my career applications of this type three times and this is the third and i 'll reflect on from one was on a hospital site and it was agreed to by the medical service to provide land for that site and i remember the reasons for that were the hospital so the doctors could walk over and transfer patients and to provide a network of support around their doctors and ancillary staff the other one was a site where that agreement couldn 't reach the town was lucky enough to be supported by a number of doctors but in recent times that has declined couldn 't reach it on site and there had to be private investment made there and that took a while to get there to inform myself i then went to the regional the far west regional plan and to look at the provision of health services in the far west and it said health services must meet the needs of remote communities including aboriginal people people with disabilities disadvantaged young people and families it also recognises that investment in health facilities can drive development of complementary health services that meet community needs and support the central darling strategic plan 2017-27 provides some direction and it talks about relevant and quality health and family support services for all members of our community retain and access performance target retain and enhance existing health services and the for continual funding i look at the moody park regional strategic plan 216 2016 and it talks about fostering access to locally based culturally safe health and human services which address many factors affecting well-being of community members marama is a health service i think it started in 1995 it is now 2020 moving 21 so it has a long history of division of services in the west i know they have attracted a grant for um the site in the building of the center council was certainly approached in early stages for to the identification of the and we looked at sites and this site was potentially suggested and they were told go away and consult with the community the public has certainly raised and rightly raised concerns about flooding access for viewing and community benefit will kanye is built on a floodplain and any development must meet the requirements of the new south wales flood development manual and certainly having experience with application of development that manual and the requirements there that could be met on that site through flood safe design and peering i accept the comments flood plain certainly that level it 's certainly not a mainstream flood plain it is more backwater and slow low velocity moving water there seems to be and the indication i 'm getting is the hospital flood floor level has not been subject to flooding so there is a basis level there and the manual can call up a height above that if required so where i 'm at and considering the the issues and i note there has been many submissions there was a standard letter that came in after the closing of the exhibition period and considering all the issues i 'm going to resolve that council receive and note the public hearing report and submissions from the public hearing held the 28th of april 2021 note that the public hearing independent chair recommendation that the community members that attended the public hearing on the 28th of april 2021 did not support the reclassification of the community land to operational land for lots 234 1201 and lot 111 dp 120 1028 bonnie street for kenya note that they combined 17 written and verbal submissions were received during the that more than 10 verbal submissions on one written submission opposing the classification were received during the public hearing on the 28th note that 20 written submissions were received on the 13th of may supporting the planning proposal to reclassify the land from community land to operational land to enable the building of the health facility six support the reclassification of the subject land from community to operational land seven progress the reclassification process through referring the public hearing report council recommendation planning proposal to reclassify the land and the submission summary report to the department of planning industry and environment can making the amendment to the central darling local environmental plan just in further context not i didn 't cover off on this in my comments the comment was made about viewing areas there certainly it will limit public access to the site but there will is the potential in the development application to ensure that public access is still available there there is even the development process can cover off on the flooding impacts and vegetation impacts and the other issue that drew my attention with the construction water view for will canyon in terms of height and backup water so i just want to put that context around the resolution that i just made so i will now move to ages right 10.6 plan of management community land for crown reserve lot eight seven four six three will kenya golf course lots 69 88 dp 757 463 lots 1-14 section 6 dp759091 7306 dp 117 9 8 will

services be treated as a matter of urgency for the meeting and mr general manager thank you administrator look um i complaints directed at council but concerns regarding landline services on those in the last couple of days landline services haven 't_''_4416.4 been haven 't haven 't_''_4419.84 existed as such with limited mobile phone coverage and internet coverage so this is obviously impacting council 's operations at our ivanhoe offices and also some local businesses this was escalated to our regional telstra manager today and at the moment i haven 't had a response back but what i was told there was a major uh issue with a telstra cable being cut somewhere in the region he was we 're not sure if that actually affected the service at ivanhoe um but he is looking into the matter at the present moment thank you mr general manager we 'll take that on notes and if you could stay across that and lend any support for better services that 'd be great i will close the meeting at 12 20

    "text": "at the moment or canyon tourism website is getting close to a thousand hits a week i 'm getting probably seven to ten phone calls a week regarding rose and so forth um scott smith is wondering what 's going on riverwicks and so forth the 76 flight level was 11.59 that mark is about seven foot above ground level so i figured with an expected and i know this is only expected i know it can vary in a couple of boats turn their pump on it 's going to change immensely probably but the expected flood level at the moment is 9.4 and the base of the caravan car is nine point four um is that below the highest club level you 're saying what do you mean the base sorry you said the base of the caravan park i mean the ground level of broadway ground level the caravan park is 9.4 river level so if that expected level of 9.4 does eventually all goes a little bit higher or maybe lower we don 't know but if it does the caravan park is very likely to the number of people that are going to be going through the town and i 'll refer there to the fact that war along is currently booked out to the end of august he 's looking at putting in extra sights if he 's able to get them put in um the our caravan park the victory park is heaps of each in every time it 's really popular it 's run properly it 's got a good name i get a lot of phone calls about it what are we going to do okay general manager and i have had a discussion he raised it with me when we were in the car yesterday my suggestion was he needs to seek the advice through the local emergency management committee and i 'll hand over greg for comment yeah thanks mr australia yes uh as the administrator pointed out yes we 'll seek advice through the emergency emergency management committee um i 've noticed looking at the flood levels history in the past there 's a number of roads uh will also be closed so uh we will never enact looking at comment uh putting our communications on road closures and closure of the caravan park um as we discussed last night bill um alternate sites around for where our caravans could go yes potentially could be up at the oval uh of non-powered and non-um amenity sites um just just free camping potentially pull up they 've got the services of the of the the bus dump as such um but we will have to work out some sort of way of measuring it and monitoring it to make sure that it is overnight or one or two nights and that we don 't get a a village all of a sudden popping up so we 'll have to work through that over the next week or two okay look it 's by no means mentors criticism or anything it 's just the fact that no i appreciate you bringing it to our attention if you could let me know so that we can then put it on the website and i can put it in my sunday night emails because that goes um i 'll have to organize that we can get the right people in the room so that will consist of police ses rfs uh ambulance and stuff like that so may i just add something um of interest to you uh we have been trying to assess we haven 't actually been counting but we are about to start counting the customer service inquiries that we get over the phone because at the moment nearly all of them are about road closures or the victory caravan park camping so um you know probably eighty percent of our phone calls that 's what they 're about um so we we are we 're trying to manage things too now look i don 't think that for one minute it 's just to try and help in the situation very much we 've got a website there that we can update in five minutes and i can put it in my email every week i 'll go back to weekly general manager will come back to you on the issue the director raised about road closures we appreciate that 's a problem and i 'm going to closures and things we 're doing there yeah well i just passed those onto the shoulder thanks mr phil uh it 's now uh time i 'll officially declare the ordinary meeting of the council meeting wednesday the 22nd of april uh open [Music] i 'd like to acknowledge that we meet on traditional lands pay my respect to elders past present and emerging any apologies there 's no apologies any leave of absence no leave of absence any disclosure of interest uh no thank you mr administrator uh a result there was no declared disclosure of interest we moved now to confirmation of the minutes from the ordinary meeting of the 24th of march 2021 there 's some amendments in there that needs to be made item 9.1 slash minute number 10.321 i request that they be changed to accurately reflect what was said at the video from the video recording of the meeting and that was the report on services to ivanhoe general business item 11-1_:_387.88 minute 17.03.21 a verbal report was provided by the director of the director of shire services on the pune kerry road um verbal report into the minutes as per the video meeting recording of the meeting thank you so resolved i 'll resolve that the minutes of the meeting of the 24th of march 2021 be adopted as per the recommendations there i 've just read okay now we 'll move to the administrators minutes minute want to reflect that the pune terry road project had commenced there was an allegation that we had done some works that impacted several several aboriginal artifacts that information was received and we stopped work i want to acknowledge that subsequent to that stopping the work we 've engaged the independent consultancy to review the project and there is a report in there from the general in this meeting 's agenda from the general manager and i 'll provide further comments there but from a personal point of view i 'm disappointed and upset that we we have these allegations and i want to commit to compliance it 's non-negotiable as far as i 'm concerned and i will commit to transparent findings on this issue we 've also had myself and i know the general residents about customer service and i note that the general manager has been on on ground at menindee and dealt with those issues and there will be some additional staff training on customer service the general manager is organised i want to reflect upon road closures i know with the recent wet weather we received several representations about road closure time timeliness and failure of electronic signs and we undertook that we would meet with our neighbours to discuss this and i 'm pleased to report that in the coming weeks there will be a meeting with wentworth bell reynold central darling and national parks and wildlife to put and it 's been coordinated by wentworth show they have a road safety officer and to put some structure around road closures so we have a consistent approach and mr general manager do you want to update now or later on where we 're at with the electronic signs thanks mr mr no i 'll do an update now um so with the electronic signage uh correspondence with the the manufacturer is that they are currently doing a software upgrade uh there 's some [Music] mechanical issues or electronic issues around the signage we 've received parts now for those signs and i understand that they 'll be replaced and repaired in coming weeks along with the software software upgrade and i believe that should resolve some of the issues we 're experiencing at the present moment also too we are the engineering staff are looking at a procedure in how we manage and manage the road closures and reopening of roads there 'll be a documented procedure and also too if we have failure of electronic science how they will be managed using heart signage as such as you pointed out there will be a meeting which wentworth shower council is organizing with the surrounding councils and how we actually manage our managed road closures in the far west also to uh as uh at our conference our recent conference for the western division central darlingshire put a motion to the conference regarding a road safety program for visitors to the far west and incorporate locals on road safety on driving on unsealed roads and i believe you 'll probably agenda so thank you mr administrator thank you mr general manager just on that notion it was passed for a road safety campaign and the coordinated approach the management of road closures in the far west um and i think that 's a timely motion and position because right across the straight state during recent flood events no one understood what road coaches was so we took that up just on the western division conference i 'd like to report that we were also successful putting a motion up on the airport certification seeking to increase the current funding from 150 000 to an upper limit of 300 000 without matching contribution that was passed at the conference and i also took the opportunity to talk to our federal member mark colton and the general manager will be writing to him outside of that we also discussed with the rfds last night the opportunity while we 're at white cliffs and the general manager will be speaking with our and our technical staff to their people and they will give us relevant technical data on our airports and i also requested information that councils spend on medical services and i 've asked the general manager to write to make a submission there 's a parliamentary inquiry that really our airports are there for medical retrieval etc in the far west it 's a community service obligation which shouldn 't be funded by local governments so we 're taking that action the other comment was general manager and i attended a meeting in dubbo on the 13th of april regarding our community strategic plan there was another a number of government agencies both state and federal in that room and i believe we very clearly articulated the issues of the far west and a comment was made for me from the state government he represented he believed there was a far better understanding after that meeting so we 'll see where that goes and last of all some time ago i offered communities the opportunity of the establishment of development committees given that we 're in administration to enable the community to have a direct input into council decision making whilst they won 't get to make the decision they can any community that wishes to proceed that way and the general manager and i had discussions with the administrator and general manager from ball rental council they have a number of committees operating like that and they 're proving to be very effective not only in the ongoing administration but enable community feedback into decisions so that office still stands for any community and lastly i would like to resolve this is a resolution to the minute taker place that the general manager provide a separate report on all outstanding rates fees and charges by fund and other debt going to central darling council i 'm particularly interested in a breakdown of rates water and sewer so i can understand that and any other long-term debts that we may hold and so resolved okay we 'll now move to financial reports uh 7.1 council 2020 21 current grants register mr general manager any comment um thank you mr nest no i have no further comments i think the report is laid out in friendly and self-explanatory it 's a monthly report that we receive and i 'm certainly looking forward i will resolve that we receive and adopt the report item 7.2 sale of land for unpaid rates auction results the report is there mr general manager any comments or from you or the rates class uh thank you miss administrator no i haven 't got any further comments however the acting rates officer may like to add further commentary to his report good morning thank you mr general manager through to you mr administrator uh no further real updates on that just we 've had a few more matters complete completely complete so we we now have 41 matters completely completed for one of a better phrase um there 's probably about a dozen where we 'll need to serve notices to complete um some of those will just be forcing the issue and just collecting our deposit money is that a road there 's potential for a number of contracts not to complete they 'll be terminated and they 'll leave those properties back on the market next time we get a sale it 's probably about 10 in that category at this stage so we 'll have to complete have been issued and expired uh thank you very much i will resolve that council receive and note the report and to note that monthly reports will be provided to council until such time as the contracts for sales have been completed and the sale process finalized item 7.3 there 's a report on cash and investments to march 2021 mr general manager uh thank you mr administrator no i haven 't got any further comments however i 'd ask the manager for finance to make commentary on the report especially around our financial position uh thank you mr general manager and through you mr administrator um as at the 31st of march 2021 we had a fairly healthy bank balance coming in at 9.6 million um and the thing that basically drives that is the uh advanced receipt of um grants um the net movement of cash for the month of march 2021 was an increase of just over 2.8 million and the reasons predominantly for this were that we received grant funding for the poon carey roadworks of 4.1 million and we received our roads to the month were 2.1 million and this was predominantly payments to suppliers of 1.7 million uh just moving on to our loan our loan balance that 's at the 31st of march stood at 189 351. um as we know that this loan was taken out a number of years ago to finance garbage trucks um the original balance of the loan back in 2000 sorry back in 2013 was just over 1.2 million we now have the balance down to under 200 000 and we should have the loan paid off by 30th of june 2022 and that will be a very good result thank you very much now that is certainly a pleasing result and heading in the right direction and you said a loan just for the public that 's the only loan that that is the only loan council currently has on its books however in saying that there are certainly from my view some underlying financial issues such as long-term leave liability etc and they 're issues that we will need to address going forward and we 've certainly started those discussions so i will water meters meter reading and billing update uh mr general manager thank you mr administrator um i haven 't got any further commentary on the report uh however the acting rights officer i 'd like him to just add further commentary to his report please thank you mr general manager mr administrator uh no further comment on the report we need to take uh later data and analyze it and we 'll plan to do that in the next next month 's report uh the most recent bills fell due just a week ago so we haven 't really had an opportunity to analyze uh i guess the collection rate on that um just probably the only other point there would be that there 's been discussions um with uh some of the larger outstanding account holders so we 'll hopefully have a few of those results within the next week or two or not necessarily paid but certainly some understanding about when we will be paid um thank you uh acting rights officer just a question uh yeah outstanding total outstanding as from the 31st of march 2021 is meeting to reduce significantly or is that is that trend going to continue uh moving forward uh well just um unverified the number there stands at about four uh 442 000 um so yeah um it 's certainly going to be lower than what it 's reported there but that 's expected because we 've had um a bunch of accounts that have just fallen due within the last week so there would have been hopefully a few of those paid uh between when the data was taken for the report and today 's date sort of thing thank you just one question i note that there 's 70 to 80 smart meters required to be fitted and the question is have we looked at the possibility of grant additional grant funding for that project or are there opportunities through the new south wales government thanks man now i just understand that um the director shire services had been exploring some alternative funding um but that was unlikely to be coming through in the current financial year whether that um that uh avenue was successful or not i don 't um acting rights officer um mr administrator i can add a little bit more commentary to that originally the smart meters were funded through the federal government drought program in round in the first round when it came to the second round and we found out there was a shortage of meters they they made the guidelines a lot stricter and stringent so that where the guidelines actually said that any infrastructure had to be on council on land and when we went back to verify that it was that because the water meters actually don 't sit on council land it sits actually on private land or residential land we weren 't eligible for that particular funding stream uh we continue to look for further funding with other state funds and because of this issue around that because these meters will be sitting on private land it 's probably unlikely and so we 're looking at budgeting for next financial year the remaining 30 meters my understanding whilst appreciating their on private land they are the water meters are the property of the local the water supply correct you on private property they won 't fund it and that 's the discussion i had with the federal government okay okay i will resolve to receive and note the report and that council will continue to receive quarterly reports on water meter reading billing and collections commencing from april 21. move to section eight governance reports uh and i 'll call the report pertunity to berry road construction investigation of impacts and harm to aboriginal cultural heritage sites mr general manager thank you mr administrator um yeah as he outlined earlier in your administration administrators report there is significant um damage caused through the road construction to aboriginal sites and a number of uh and some native vegetation and there is disappointment in the community at menindee and we 're working working with the community at menindee along with the aboriginal community several weeks ago archaeologists was on site to assess uh and make an assessment um directed by council from that there was a number of recommendations well there 's the findings as uh from the investigation which is outlined in the report uh there are seven uh conclusions it 's listed there and then there 's uh ten recommendations um which we 'll be discussing um with the menindee community and elders from the aboriginal community uh and work through with those recommendations so that um potentially we can have a return to work very soon um on the pinkie road while there is some general recommendations we 'll further discuss that at at that meeting of next week um furthermore we will be also engaging council will be engaging hds australia to undertake a audit of the project management of the poon carey road that 's to look at go beyond the scope of the archaeologist 's um findings uh is actually make sure that um the project we 're managing that we 're not going to have the same issues reoccur again um being taking in mind that this project is a three-year project uh we want to make sure that there is going to be no further issues especially around damage to our aboriginal artifacts or anything like that and we want to make sure that the project management um is going to be tight governance framework around the project um so i will prepare a report again next month to bring to council and at the end of that when we do have uh hds australia 's report i 'll report back to council with that particular report also i will include all the other documentation being the bios report from the initial site survey to the uh the recent report done on the investigations to the a-hip as a collection uh of the report which will from council 's perspective we want to be transparent to the community and further abroad thank you mr administrator thank you mr general manager any other comments okay thank you just make the comment that uh thank you very much for the report as i requested you to do i note that we we undertook significant environmental investigation reports to gain a a hip approval and that a hip approval came to council with conditions to enable construction works to be undertaken as i indicated i was disappointed that we 've arrived at this point and compliance from my view is is non-negotiable we are now in suffered reputational damage in the community and i want to be transparent to ensure that we address that and thus the archaeological report and then the subsequent audit of the report on the project i will pass the following resolutions and i 'm going to add to it that council receive the report and then receive the report that we council adopts the recommendations one to ten of the audit findings three and of the minute taker please pull me up if you can 't keep up i 'll just get the notes from you after thank you that the general manager the author delegate authority to represent and be authorized to represent council at the meeting of the stakeholders and work with them to address the report and i think it 's number four that the independent report on the project management and delivery be reported back to council [Applause] and we 'll move to item 8.2 engagement of staff and organizational structure mr general manager uh thank you miss administrator um no i haven 't got any further commentary however i want to introduce our human resource officer for i think six weeks um she was the author of the report so um i would like her to make commentary on the report please thank you mr general manager and through the admin mr administrator um not too much i wanted to add to the report um i believe that this is a really key report to give council an indication of um the operations within um the staffing or the the structure the position the vacancy report just gives you an outline in terms of the vacancies that we 're currently filling we 're currently looking at the whole workforce in terms of positions and vacancies and looking at the bottlenecks in terms of understanding of how to fill some of the vacancies so that we can actually deliver on our strategic directions the only other aspect i thought would be worth while commenting on are the 1000 job packages the traineeships and employment um opportunities um the they 've got the second transfer the second round of funding uh through the national indigenous uh the national indigenous australians agency this is the second round of where so far they have um in speaking with the agency they 've only had applications to fill 300 of those 1 000 jobs so currently putting a um submission in or a grant an application in to get grant funding for a number of positions now while the reports indicated some of those positions that i 'm exploring we 'll look at this as another opportunity to see how we can actually develop our workforce a little bit further the funding is actually a two-year funding so it 's funding for the positions for a period of two years of which then there will be a financial cost to council if they wish to keep those positions on moving forward so the idea being it be a succession plan um in in leading into the future and there is also some additional funding if any of the positions that we can put on board are traineeship focused as well so there 's some funding available that we 're exploring other than that there 's not much else i wanted to add with regards to the report and that looking at it seems fit thank you thank you very much evelyn and welcome aboard certainly human resource and staff management and performance management was an issue that we identified early in certainly my period of administration and was part of the reason the extension of the administration to rebuild the organisation systems and processes and this is a good start so the only i will receive the report and note the potential employment of the environmental engineer and subsequent increase in wages budget receive further reports on human resources activities including the presentation of the new organizational structure chart to the council so resolved we 'll move to 8.3 website redesign mr general manager thank you mr administrator um we haven 't got the community engagement officer here today so i 'll make commentary on the report the reports come about because of our current website uh we 're using the web provider web one one two three um our website is not going to be supported moving forward so and also too that we 're looking at a severe looking at a comprehensive upgrade of our web page so we cities is a web provider and a web a web page developer which is quite commonly used through local government new south wales it does have a lot of additional functions being that customer requests can be actually done through the website also too we 'll be able to manage our development applications and building certificates through the web page and there 's a number of other functions which um that the website does which will be advantage to council also too that the open city web page uh has the interface with our other software being hp hpe trim which is our record management system um fun while the the cost for the the website uh is a lot more than um what we 've been paying in the past however we was lucky to secure fifty thousand dollars of uh funding through the state government just in the last week for the planning for the development planning portal uh of which uh the six thousand eight hundred dollars of the the first year subscription and development of this website will be paid out of that fifty thousand dollars until uh next financial year being 2022 23 for the licensing on the website thank you thank you mr general manager and certainly our website does need upgrading and particularly i believe information on road players could be dealt with much better there and i know the requirements coming through for the planning just thank you mr um acting um director for shaw services i noticed that some correspondents just recently between our provider um are you looking at um that being on the website as well yes mr general manager thank you and through the chair um yeah we are um it 's going to be a different setup though it 's not it 's going to be mainly off the phone lines which is going to be more reliable than we found that previous electronic and with uh if we can gain that additional funding which it looks like might we can convert the existing signs over to the new new software as well okay thank you what i 'm particularly interested in mr general manager is the next phase of that while we get our signs working our website yes i want a website that can convey that information so currently currently on our website we do display open and closed roads um it 's as i am understanding some manual uh manual exercises we actually put up a document but i suppose and i 'll be guided by the acting um director here is if it can be the actual interface between the two softwares being the website and the electronic software for the signage can can be interfaced the um mr general manager i think so at this stage yes but that would probably be after further discussion with him to tell him thank you thank you very much i will resolve to receive the report to that council ratifies the decision to sign the one-year contact with this contract with the supplier for website development and that ongoing funding be listed in future budgets shire services report 9 water and services 9.1 water and sewer update mr general manager or the director acting director any comments no i haven 't uh thank you mr administrator um maybe they can directly like my country on mr gentleman you 'll see the chair it 's ongoing update so i will resolve that we 've received note the report um service update um mr general manager 9.2 um comments no thank you mr administrator um however the acting director may want to make commentary on the service update report um known on this stage i need to add so mr general manager that most of the budgets are getting close to being expended now other than that after putting together a report there 's nothing further away i note that the street cleaning bins are 105 we 're over i assume the finance manager has given you some more money uh let 's hope so mr administrator the um we 've actually instigated a uh the street room from broken hill to service these areas and we 're just spawning they 're running a little bit over cost so could you just repeat that again that 's um i think that overrun was due to the street broom from broken hillby high that we agreed to trial that issue will be addressed as the general manager in um i 'd like to actually ask the director of his commentary on street cleaning and are you finding that to be working better than the past methodology yes i am mr general manager and um one thing we did do while we 're at the expo was look for small streets cleaning machines to see if they are an option too so now that we 'll receive some further reports on that um with that i will resolve to receive and note the report we have the roads and aerodromes report um this is general manager thank you mr instructor no i haven 't got any commentary other than what we talked about um at the start of the meeting regarding uh the motion we put to um the western division conference for further funding assistance on our airstrips um acting director for um child services would you like to make any further commentary on your report mr general manager and through the chair the only dad that we will need to seek further funding for the volcano airport next year due to the reseals that are going to to us last night because will kenya is the priority project for airports i 'm sure so just um asked the acting director um if we don 't seek fund if we don 't receive funding for the reseal would with that money have to be done through our budget through other means being our grants or our block grants or something like that mr general manager here could be an option um well i need 257 000 to seal the airport the raup program will only provide 150 unmatched mr general manager i think that highlights the urgency of your letter writing to yes senator colton i won 't resolve that you 'll take that on that i thought i 'd just ask the question um can i make the comment having worked in local government for many years and at this point in time i 've seen worse reports on roads where money hasn 't been expended so thank you very much so i will resolve to receive a nopa report okay we now move to 9.4 plan of management for 44 reed street will kenya mr general any further commentary at this stage on the report however i invite the senior planner to make commentary on the report mr administrator and general manager um there 's no further comment on this report other than to note that there is a public hearing required on the 8th of june um which is the new well is the requirement for all uh plans of management that put forward a new category and land use and as council at present has no plans of management for any council owned community land um any plan of management will require a public hearing we need to emphasize also that the feedback and submission on the lease is actually the trigger point for any issues to be raised for the plan of management thank you um ask questions could you just um explain uh for viewers and the gallery what is a plan of management what details and what the triggers are planner management please um the planet management is required for all council owned and crowned land reserves that are categorized as community land um a planet management 's not required for central darlington council has no land that has been listed in the central darling local environmental plan 2012 as operational land therefore all our community land requires plans of management under the local government act um in the next year we will have to put forward a plan of management almost to work out when we 're actually going to do all the plans of management for all the community land that council owns we 're already in progress doing four major plans of management for the crown reserves crown land with working with the council crown land team in the department of planning industry and environment we are actually working with the office of local government now on putting forward and basically producing all the plans of management for all council-owned community land also in the uh revision and update for the central darling local environmental plan 2012 we will need to look at um reclassification of council owned and crown reserve land that is actually operational land that was actually in 2004 for some reason re-classified from operational to communityland so we 'll need to put those all review of all the community land that should be operational land and yeah basically a review of all council owned land and the process for putting a plan of management in place is that we prepare the plan of management and if the land is for use as a community center or a community health facility for any other community use where another organization wants to lease that land we also have to put in place a lease that 's authorized under the local government act up with the plan of management which must be exhibited for a minimum of 28 days and also because we have no plans of management in place every plan of management will require a public hearing [Music] basically that 's a process thank you um uh senior planning officer um i 'd also like to add that while we have while we 're going through this plan of management for a number of our land and elite and our crown lands uh this is actually a time a time issue you know being that it 's a time it 's it ties up a cost to council um we 've had a number of um um land which is crown land where we 've actually now pushed back on the lease uh moving forward so that we don 't have to develop these plans and managements to save councils costs in uh resources and uh in other areas so so mr general manager you 're telling me in effect we 've discovered another legacy issue that we have to deal with that is correct uh mr administrator yes it is another legacy which we 've discovered unfortunately is the process we have to go through it 's another burden on council 's resources and finance we 're playing catch up thank you mr general manager and thank you glenda for that explanation okay i will resolve one we received the report and note the information endorse the exhibition of the plan and management for the new land use category general community use and the new use of the community cultural centre at lot one s13 gp 759091-44 reed street will kenya receive the report so sorry to receive the report and note the information at lot one s13 dp 759091-44 reed

    "text": "okay i will declare the ordinary council meeting of the 24th of march open at 9 20. i would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land and pay my respects to elders past and present there 's no apologies or leave of absence uh disclosures of interest item four um any disclosure of interest in accordance with council 's adopted code of conduct neil nil i 'll resolve that there were no disclosures of machinery or non-pecuniary interest received we moved to item five confirmation of the minutes of the ordinary meeting the 24th of february they 've been circulated mr general manager any comments at all no thank you administrator i 'll resolve that the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on the 24th of february 2021 be received and confirmed move to item 6 the administration administrators minute as i indicated it 's been a pretty busy month and uh the the main part greg and i did was our trip to sydney and the meeting with minister hancock i 'm not going to have that go i 'll summarize in the question time what about in the meeting and i didn 't cover was the better coordination of delivery of services to the far west between government agencies and ncos to ngos to communities i think there 's a disconnect in there with number of government agencies coming into town different circles so that 's part of the discussion we 'll be having at dubbo about a better delivery service model we talked about aboriginal housing overcrowding which has been an issue raised in many many reports over many years and subsequent to meeting with the minister we also met with minister zoom conference by minister pavi what was interesting was the documentation and data there um the the data showed there wasn 't no many on the waiting list the general manager is going to write and put that report to the minister on that she 's asked so that was an interesting discussion and i suspect some data sits with another agency and some sits with the mother so we will work on that um the other critical one that happened in the month was minister pave he has suspended discussions with the focus it 's on the wider issues that that are occurring there um that is certainly good news for menindee but it also places the minister has said very clearly she wants manindy to say exactly what they want uh from the community so we 've had some discussions with the local member how that may occur and we will continue some work on that i flagged the meeting in dubbo that 's came up um we 'll continue working on the strategic plan there okay financial reports uh 7.1 current grants register i note in the report mr general manager we 're going to have it completed by july 2021 is that still on target yes thank you mr ministry yes that 's correct that 's um due to their general ledger and cost job numbers um so i was talking to the finance officer about this yesterday and she 's assured me once those job numbers and the account uh general ledger has been sorted uh we 'll have that issue be resolved just by way of comment for the gallery this is certainly one of the 's good news we can complete by that date i will um resolve that we receive an adopter of that report item 7.2 sale of land for unpaid rates and auction results this is an update report mr general manager any comment additional comments you want to make um no i haven 't thank you mr administrator unless our acting rights officer would like to make comment darryl thank you mr general manager through to you mr administrator no further comments we 've got a small number of changes in terms of the status of the the progress towards completion of the matters that have not yet completed nothing substantial uh to really update from what 's included in the report thank you uh thank you very much i 'd just like to record at the meeting we 've got people online glenda dunn who is our planning officer darryl tefla the rates officer jemima is it gemma gemma who 's our rights officer okay your daughter okay our communications officer so they 're sitting in on the meeting okay there 's not no further comments on that meeting i that note that we will be further monthly reports will be followed until such time as contracts of sales of land to be completed and sale process is finalized uh cash investments report 7.3 uh the report is in front of us mr general manager thank you australia no i haven 't however the manager for finance may wish to speak to his report thank you mr general manager and through you as administrator and the cash balance has at the end of february 2021 was 6.771 million there are a couple of uh drivers for that balance and as previously discussed those uh the advanced payment of some of our federal assistance grants and payment in advance for the boom kerry road turning to our loan account and this loan account and some may report with the garbage trucks which were purchased by council about eight years ago the current balance of um that loan as that between the february 2021 is 202 397 uh so council remains on track to have that loan paid off within the next two years thank you mr administrator thank you i know and a little bit over one million um just a question is that for our contract works and are all those payments up-to-date accounts being submitted not the date um thank you mr australia um that 's a question for the director for run short services through this administrator yep that 's correct that 's all for ordered works so that 's paid on a monthly forecast system and certified expenditure so the one million is a large part of that 's for the initial seal works on the cob highway and other works that we completed with heavy patching works so that 's what the majority of that 's for thank you i 'll resolve that we receive and note that report moved to item 7.4 smart water meters meter reading and billing update mr general manager thank you mr administrator um i haven 't got anything to add to this been a lot of work done in this area for the last um six months or three to six months in getting our meter reading up to date it 's probably better if i hand this over to more commentary to the matter thank you mr general manager through to you mr administrator i haven 't really got anything further to that but i 'd just like to emphasize that i guess the percentage of overdue to levied year-to-date figures um can be somewhat distorted by the timing of the the snapshot of the data compared to when bills fall due as included in the report it 's also been impacted by the fact that we did have a lengthy delay in issuing bills up to the november bills that went out we 've since issued bills on the 15th of march they 're not yet due so those amounts are included in the total due in the levied to date but they 're not reflected in the overdue because those amounts levied on the 15th of march are not yet due i just wanted to make sure that that was was clear and understood but happy to provide any further clarification thank you just for question the overdue amount as looking at the 30th of june 2020 was 402 thousand how long does that go back for very uh you it does vary uh account to account so you know there are some uh accounts where we would have greater than five years overdue um whereas that customer would not necessarily have five years in rates overdue so it 's a matter of having conversations and i guess bringing down the longer overdue amounts without i guess jeopardizing the current rates position of those accounts it 's a very individual account by account breakdown that would be required uh yeah but there are certainly amounts that go plus go back more than five years um yeah to break it down beyond the five years would require a fair bit of work but i think once it gets to five years it 's fairly significant and there may not be that much value in going back further than that when looking at it from a strategic point of view okay the next question i 've got do we have a policy in respect to either restricting flow or disconnection if accounts unpaid yes council 's debt recovery policy does provide for those actions for restriction in the initial is that disconnection isn 't um a viable uh option uh in terms of um it 's still necessary to provide a minimum supply to provide for health health reasons flushing of toilets for instance the next question i 've got is there any breakdown on um state-owned housing versus private is there any debt going there i don 't have a breakdown but if council would like a report on that we can certainly provide that because there should be no excuse if it 's state of money zoey interested in looking at those figures i understand you understand uh your point of question there mr administrator and going forward um given this are we going to recommend actions for recovery of outstanding amounts as indicated in the report uh it will all come down to providing the necessary resources to to action those items and to i guess deal with any other rates revenue functions and the appointment uh or the impending appointment of uh advertising for and hopefully appointment of a payment of rates office will go a long way to resolving those yep and that will if there 's no further comments i 'm happy to deal with the matter and i will resolve that council receive and note the report two the council received quarterly ports reports on water meter reading billing and collections commencing in april 2021 three receive a report regarding complete completion of smart media metering of filtered water services in ivanhoe will kenya at the ordinary meeting of council on the 28th of april and for that a report be brought forward on the breakdown of outstanding amounts by service area and indication if there 's any owing by government agencies item 8 governance reports call for motions to western division council 's conference and the murray darling association conference mr general manager thank you administrator as the report outlines we 've got several conferences coming up in april and may this year which yourself myself will be attending we 've been asked to put forward motions to the murray darling association conferences conference which will need to be submitted uh by the 15th of april hence this is the reason for the report as well as the western division they be putting up these motions at the at the conference so there is uh the first item two three and four uh more specifically to do with the murray darling association conference uh we also raise those up at uh the western division conference but five and five regarding uh the capital water infrastructure depreciation will be a a topic we will be raising as a motion and also a discussion with uh in in the forum of the conference so i think the report the rest of the report is silver explanatory thank you i will resolve to receive the report and forward the following motions to the western division conference and the murray-darling association conference and the motions are that the murray-darling association calls on the new south wales government to support the listing of the environmentally and culturally significant in indian lakes system as a ramsar site three that the new south wales government recognises that the muni lake system located on the lower lower darling river has significant environmental and cultural significance and the steps be taken to ensure the system is operated to preserve these darlings association supports the demands of the lower darling river communities for a fair go to ensure a healthy connected river to the junction of the murray river particularly in first flow events by prioritizing these flows over irrigation extraction five that a new approach is required for the funding of capital water infrastructure book trip treatment plants and storage for far western rural and remote councils with an alternative model that the state government meet the full cost of all new capital works and ownership of the asset state government would contract out to the local authority operational aspects thus removing the burden of depreciation on the local authority so resolved item 8.2 change of ordinary council meeting dates and times for april and may just for information council meeting dates are usually set at the beginning of the year unfortunately we have two conferences we need to attend the western division conference and the murray darling association conference both of those will have representative state ministers and federal ministers there and the motions we 've got certainly important for this council and what this report does is seek those conferences to reduce travel costs et cetera for the administration so mr general manager do you have any additional comments no thank you mr administrator i will resolve that council receiver in the report and endorse the following council 's april meeting be rescheduled to thursday the 22nd of april 2021 commencing at 11 a.m council 's may ordinary meeting be rescheduled to thursday 20th of may commencing at 11 a.m so resolved uh mr general manager will you ensure that that gets that will be advertised advertised immediately and maybe a couple of times to ensure people were aware okay we moved to item 8.3 digital web and social media policy mr general manager um thank you mr administrator um i think policies later the reports laid out in front of you um pretty well i 'll just probably ask well we 'll ask the community engagement officer to speak to the report thank you general manager um mr administrator it 's uh a standard practice for council of councils to have a um policy surrounding the use of online social media um this policy that i 've together instead of having a raft of policies covering the website uh social media um online things um it 's something the um use of online social media while it 's mentioned in various codes um doesn 't specifically cover the use of social media and this policy sets to define a framework of how council will use that thank you um you got any comments mrs generally no thank you um this is putting the policy out on public exhibition for 28 days i noticed some comments that were made in the uh questions with it on notice with the general manager and you can have a could you have a conversation with their communications i 'll tell you what i 'll resolve that we 've received the report to put the draft policy on public exhibition exhibition inviting comment for 28 days after which taking into account comment a report be presented for council for adoption business service reports 9.1 provision of home care services including meals on wheels on ivan homes the general manager i know we don 't have an acting director so no we don report is self-explanatory it 's about um council uh no longer continuing with the meals on wheels and others support um community support the reason being is that numbers have dwindled away over the years i think we 're down to about we 're down to about three clients in the end there are there are a number of other agencies working out of the ivanhoe who are providing similar or same sort of support and it seems like we 're competing against those ngos as well so uh we 've decided um you know the work and effort we 're putting in isn 't um worthwhile and we believe it 's better if we actually hand hand back the support we 're providing um there was a commentary about the legal side of the financial side we 'll have to return unexpended funds um as from yesterday uh there 's three thousand four hundred uh dollars of funds which is unexpected however we 've still yet to take out another month 's worth of expenditure so that will win would be well under three thousand dollars mr general manager one climate client at the moment so let 's give away since yep um just to comment do we have to give notice of our intention to cease i think it 's probably advisable we do this okay because i don 't i think it 'd be terribly unfair if we just pull the wickets and leave so i think we need to have that discussion with the funding agency we have been discussing that in the last four months with the agency um with chips about council we 're removing itself from the service okay i will now deal with the report result that we receive and note the report to subject to discussions with the funding agency we give notice that council intends to cease to provide home care services in ivanhoe at this time with provision that the decision be monitored since this situation changed three return any unexpected grant funds to the appropriate funding agencies so resolved okay we moved to shire services reports water and sewer update mr general manager thank you mr administrator um i haven 't got anything to add however the um further to his reports through you mr administrator that the operation of all water supplies are running to budget and that 's on track to meet budget constraints operationally the water and seal capital works one point of note there we gave an extension to the new water treatment plant tender for a further week some of the tandoors are having trouble getting quotations back from suppliers electrical and mechanical so they were granted another week extension so that now closes on friday 16th of april we 've had a had some real interest there which is encouraging we 've had four companies visit the shire so far with two more expected to visit next week the work of reticulation design has now been surveyed again um there 's issues there for council with some native title claims over the dugout areas which causes um legal implications for us putting water service lines from from roads across across those claims which we 're addressing as part of surveying and redesign uh no further information on the proposal can you gravity sewer project at the moment and just on that um bodies that would be making applications for 100 funding for the gravity will kenya gravity the very contribution from council yeah we 've had some discussion around that um with dpi award um so we 've we 've raised the issue that uh council doesn 't have the have the capacity to uh um to fund um you know any balance or any um um [Music] one of the grant fundings is 10 which council will be looking at at least 1.2 million dollars but um you know discussions is that we just don 't have the capacity to do that so they 'll have to either look uh for other areas of funding um to uh for that co-contribution thank you and just in while we 're dealing with water mr general manager you 've got any update on the will can you wear uh thank you mr mistrader um last conversation i had uh with this guy water was that they 're about to go out to tender for design and construction i believe that 's going to be around april may with a view of appointing a october of this year with a completion uh of the weir in uh march of next year i believe so um i believe there 's a series of uh workshops coming up uh one today i think and uh and another one tomorrow and we 're working on the management plans for the sites yeah so we 've been working on um plan and management uh plans for um the site um which will incorporate a access road and potentially maybe some picnic setting or something like that tables and shoes i 'll resolve that we receive and note the report um we dealt with the woodland sewer deal with uh services update item 10.2 mr general manager um i 'm happy unless there 's any comment by exception no thank you no i 'll resolve for item 10.2 we receive a note of the report move to item 10.3 roads and aerodrome report again i 'm happy unless there is some comments by exception through you or the director mr general manager no thanks result that we receive and note the report 10.4 community participation plan mr general manager anything further to add however i 'd ask that the senior planner community engagement officer speaks to the report um i will actually leave it to the community engagement officer as she has actually passed this project following her the community engagement plan thanks glenda jenny can you got any further comment on the on the report yeah thanks general manager just by way of um explanation uh mr administrator the community participation plan that 's in front of you is specific to planning issues and is totally unrelated to the community engagement plan which was adopted by council in november this is a requirement of the environmental planning and assessment act and follows schedule one of that act once it 's adopted by council i think needs to be put on public exhibition and then adopted by council it then needs to be registered with the um department of planning on the new south wales planning portal as part of their um um digital services program um [Music] the participation plan as i said uh follows schedule one and it will give council um a very solid framework for that are coming up in planning um because it 's highly focused on advertising and engagement i have taken joint ownership of that plan with the senior planner thank you okay i 'm happy to deal with it we resolved that council received the report to approve the draft community participation plan to go on public exhibition for a period of 28 days three after the exhibition period taking into account any comments council will receive a further report to formally consider adoption of the document and placement on the new south wales planning portal and council website 10.5 development applications approved through the new south wales planning portal there is a list there unless there 's any comments i 'm happy to deal with it they 're approved it 's for information purposes resolve the council note the information in regard to the development applications approved by delegate authority and submitted and processed through the new south wales planning and portal the first two months of 2021 we now move to item 10.6 public hearing for the plan of management for community land at lots 2 3 and 4 or kenya mr general manager thank you mr administrator um i 'm going to actually hand straight over to the senior planner to talk to the talk to the report thank you general manager and administrator um there is actually a requirement to have a public hearing for the plan of management for community land as a council has not currently got any plans of management for any of the community land without throughout the lga therefore any plan of management will introduce new categories for community land therefore a public hearing will be required for any plan of management for basically all of councils community land so therefore we 're holding a public hearing straight after the public hearing for the reclassification of the land for the same site on the 28th of april at 7 30 pm and basically this is a legislative requirement under the local government act 1993. thank you i will resolve that council note the information in regard to the statutory requirement under the local government act 1993 requiring a public hearing to be held where a new plan of management introduces a new new category of general community use and for new use of community health facility for the land at lots 2 3 and 4 dp 1201089 and lots 111 dp 1201028 bonnie street to note that a public hearing for the new plan of management introducing a new category for community land is to be held at the council chambers at 21 reed street or canyon on the 28th of april at 7 30 pm so resolved now moved to um general business mr general and manager of urgent nature um no yes there is actually one i want to ask the director for russia services to just give us an update on from kerry road please through mr administrator the poon kerry road construction has been halted at 12 o 'clock last tuesday uh council had a call from the department of premier and cabaret cabinet heritage department they 'd received a report that council had knocked over scar trees and harmed aboriginal cultural elements so following that we took their advice on stock works further investigations needed the photos of the alleged trees have been sent through i 've those alleged trees environmental due diligence has been followed by council we 've done everything that we needed to under the national parks and wildlife act 1972 we 've had full aboriginal cultural heritage assessments by archaeologists and the local aboriginal land council and the buckingham native title group everything identified in the ahip which is an aboriginal heritage impact permit has been documented we 've also been back to site and removed all those items that can be removed so our environmental due diligence is good and that 's recognised by the compliance and reporting unit of the heritage department i 've been asked when we can recommence work and i 'll be recommending to you and the general manager that um we don 't recommence work until you 're satisfied and council satisfied that we 've haven 't done the wrong thing and we 're complying um with the environmental due diligence which we 're required to so at this time we 've engaged an environmental consultant to um assess all the documents and photos and information um provided as well as the alleged photos of scar tree feedback as soon as we can just a question that uh request to engage the consultant was from the heritage of office right yes so we 're acting in compliance with their requests yes and that report will go to that department for assessment yes thank you yeah okay um mr general manager do you want anything there no thank you mr administrator yeah unfortunately um we 've had to stop work as required under the legislation um we 're working through that with the relatively the relevant authority and we 'll be taking all efforts to try to get back to the job as quickly as possible there and resolve any issues so i 'll resolve that we re note the director of shire services reports on the pune kerry road and uh seeing there 's no other further general business i 'll declare the meeting closed at five to ten if that clocks right almost enough four four to ten quarter ten meeting closed thank you thank you everyone for attendance you want to have a chat now that 'll be right yeah _"

    "text": "streeto rhymes with freedom [Music] good evening so i 'm here with gavin and max raywood at grafton street oh so i 'll just get gavin to let you all know how it actually got started and then we can find out what 's happening today thanks leo so we moved to town about 10 years ago and i 've moved up from newcastle where i had an event just like this called streeto which is short for street orienteering i never did much orienteering previously in my life but um i like adventure racing and to do that you need to learn how to navigate i thought well to learn how to navigate i need to get something like this set up and running but also it 's just great for the community i want to pull the community together i get people outdoors and active and just social and just kind of having that community focus and getting people out there [Music] fantastic now um everyone has starts at their own time they 're basically starting every five minutes so that everyone 's not rushing off together so here after work really hasn 't it and i i don 't know i 've passed quite a few people as i arrived here today so um have you i think i believe you 've taken over the reins of organizing this one have you oh yeah yeah okay so have you got any idea of your numbers today uh more than i was expecting i kind of yeah look at the weather and stuff yeah the weather i was wondering too today whether it would end up going ahead or not so that 's fantastic i have seen quite a few so i 'll have to get some final numbers from you when we get back in so um yeah so you obviously really enjoyed it before as well and decided it was time to have another one because between covert and everything it 's been off uh oh it 's been off for a while i think dad didn 't have much time to do anymore and then i think sometime last year it 's kind of felt like doing something or having a something to work on up again it 's been in talks for for a while uh yeah so today is to gauge the interest to see sort of whether it 's worth getting it back up and running on a regular basis uh yeah kinda i mean if it turns out all right pre uh keep it up yeah okay fantastic um yeah so how does it work what do people do like okay i 'm i 'm about to head off that 's why i 'm dressed like this i 'm about to head off can you give me some instructions what have i got to do now i 've seen i have a map i don 't have it in my hand but i 've been given a map uh i guess you kind of look at the uh the checkpoints and um see whatever whatever 's closest and go to that and yeah there 'll be a question that you have to answer uh on the map and um yeah just try and try and get as many for example oh uh i think some of the the frequent ones have uh so yeah just try and try and answer that and then move on to the next one and get as many as you can in 45 minutes okay 45 minutes and the last lot leave at 5 30. so i 'd better get a move on hadn 't i okay thanks guys all right so the kitchens are just finished they 're the first people to return from streeto today and they look more now so they 've obviously run it so just a few questions how 'd you find the course today yeah yeah it was great it

we found multiple locations and i think we got some um some good scores so kids all did well they worked it out for themselves and had to use their heads so it was good fun got some exercise we did end up doing about three and a half kilometers that was good awesome and it 's not just a typical run either so yeah mixing up with a bit of brain work as you um you got to use your brain to figure it out on the map where you 're going you can 't just use your um your speed you 've got to um work it all out as you go so yeah that was good um it 's good for them to as you can see they 've got red faces so was good for them to get a little bit of training so that 's not just an embarrassment then and so have you done much navigation before because you 're a good runner but yeah yeah i enjoy my running um go on a lot of running events but um i haven 't actually done any street volunteering before actually orienteering out in the um and bush either so forest so it 'd be good um something to be interested in giving a go it 's a good challenge as well uh something that adds another dynamic to running um rather than just racing it 's a different dynamic to it as well yeah that 's exactly right so bush and beach iron caring club they 're based in sorry a satellite kind of club to them so it 's good part of their group anyway um yeah thanks heaps for coming is there anything else you 'd like to add no so thanks for organizing it thanks to people who have volunteered and organised everything for the day for the kids and uh that 's what it 's all about get their families out and get them in the outdoors and yeah thank you thanks jonah okay thanks a lot all right so we 've got some new comers to streetos so some of their friends the maki 's have been before but these guys

was it cool it was actually fun it was very tiring i 'm so excited but it was actually really cool but i was so confused like the whole time i was the one in the lead were good and like um so i 've been in grafton for a while and i 've found when other people have set the course and i got an opportunity to have a run that i 'd even get lost out there even though all the streets are out there i don 't know we spent the first what 10 minutes around that area trying to figure out where we were we were very confused but you were confused i knew where i was we got there eventually so it was all right excellent and although you 're confused and people knew where they were you 'll be back for more um yeah if i 'm happy again i 'll i 'll be coming back that was so fun just played a bit of music and just did a bit of running so it was good awesome so we 'll probably kick off again in november so hope to see you again there so we 're here at graphene street oh this got a first timer to streeto

steps damn that 's good so you got a running yeah ah it 's terrible yep so you have fun and you 'll be back back again so what made it so fun probably getting to run around all together and find stuff as a team yeah so it 's not like just going for a run it 's got a bit more of an interest to it you gotta you gotta know where you are it 's sort of like orienteering yeah it 's a lot more fun than just not having a reason to go for a walk or actually rather than 10 around at home on like watching tv and you actually you don 't just go for a walk for the sake of whatever you actually get to do some fun stuff with some people you get to explore [Music] i love that i love that part where it 's more fun than sitting you guys again soon so these guys have just done street ope um i 'll ask how did you find out about it and did you have fun she told me about it but also we got it was on our announcements at school and it went pretty good but it was quite painful as well my mum told me five

done it numerous times before but she keeps coming back for more so how 'd you find today i did discover grafton as i thought i may have been um yes there 's probably something in that there 's a phrase i don 't know about haste too much haste or something i can 't think what it is at the moment but let 's just say i was trying to run too hard and missed a few streets so yeah but it was good it was a challenge so will you come back for more yeah bit of fun and if my kids want to come along that 's even better gets them out of the house and off the technology comments from the crowd there well the kids they said they enjoyed it and they just keen to do more of it so you can drag them back well maybe we 'll have to have another one squeeze another one in before um daylight savings ends fantastic we 'll see you then cheers or a park run beforehand correct so earlier on the interview so yeah i have previously been running pro um i have previously been running grafton street oh i 've had a few years off but keen to get it up and again so i 'm really excited about the yeah the young fella and the youth trying to do stuff for the community and get stuff happening again so it 's pretty exciting i 'm glad for the turnout even with all the rain forecasted and the rain beforehand we 've had a huge turnout so it 's been great to see the community so i 've got luke stamford here grafton tigers star player [Music] x-star player so he 's just come back from grafton street oh with his two kids how 'd you go oh look we had a great time you can hear in the background maybe some hysterics from all that running but overall they did really well a good bit of fun for the family nice so you 've been dragging your kids along for a few years now and they keep coming back without too much kicking and screaming well they told me today streeto rhymes with burritos so they reckon that maybe getting burrito bar afterwards or something there 's a potential sponsor maybe i 'm not sure what that 's about all right well big part of the street oh is having catching up afterwards for food so i might be able to sway him thanks a lot luke and i 'll see you later great job all right so this is part of the geelong cats they 've just come back from streeto how 'd you guys find it did you get to run around we got to run around a little bit at the end yeah do you like running around yes and first we were walking yeah is that because your dad was a bit slow [Music] she didn 't want to run ruby didn 't want to run why didn 't you want to run ruby because my legs didn 't feel like running well that is a very good reason why not to run you know what i know street rhymes with streeto rhymes with freedom yeah you guys got anything else to add awesome well i think it was great you guys came along and i hope to see you again soon cheers back for street oh one night only i plate to decide the run at this time so 15 decided to set the course and get it going again and i noted today before it started you was a bit nervous about the rain is a bit concerned about the number of people that turned up but it was a huge turnout so how 'd you find that max ah yeah surprise to be sure but a welcome one it 's good yeah um yeah yeah yeah we don 't know the final numbers yet but so max is excited with the turnout and you 're happy to keep running again next year oh yeah that would be good to uh yeah have something that happens every month is it or like i don 't know whatever you used to do it yeah so generally it used to run once a month the second friday of every month except for the first one which tied in with jacaranda um so why did you start straight up again maxie just just on a whim you know for real yeah i guess i just wanted something to do so yeah i and um we 've got the final guy coming back now so keelan burch here so um he 's done grafton park run quite a few times he travels up from will google he 's actually the first person to clear the course entirely which i was blown away at so he can move all right um how 'd you find today yeah it was good it was nice to mix mix it up between grafton and southgrafton get to a few areas that i hadn 't been before and yeah challenged myself to see if i can clear it all but you did today as well so it 's fantastic so what do you like about the grafton streeto format i like that as um you go through different parts of the drafting that you wouldn 't normally go to but there 's also that mix between navigation and running that keeps you on your toes and keeps your mind active and kind of takes away the pain of smashing out a run on the streets totally agree is there anything else you want to add about streeto before i can talk about studio there 's sortel strudel if anyone 's interested in traveling down we 've got three events starting on next wednesday which is in the back today the 16th about the 16th and then um two weeks after that on a wednesday afternoon and they 're the same format as the streets up in grafton and keelan also set up an event called um the end trail or in peak sorry and um max and i did that earlier well last year it was an awesome event and he 's got a wash pool running now as well do you want to give wash pool and yeah sure so we 've got um an event west of grafton up the range called wash washable world heritage trails and that 's on the 27th of march with a 9k 25k and 50k trail run and then um there 's a few more trail events coming up there 's one that goes from red rock to cross harbour along the beach which is a 45 kilometer beach marathon in on the 10th of april and then after that you can keep your eye out for on later in the year to be announced what 's the best place to find more info about that is that the um cost trail runners facebook page or something else yeah we 've got instagram and facebook trail runners and also on your general running calendar websites awesome well thanks again for coming down and for your support good luck with the events yeah thanks thanks for all the volunteers who put all the time and effort into setting a course and making it a good puzzle thank you okay so how can people uh find you if they 're interested in following along and finding out when the next uh next street o or street orienteering event is so generally the streetos only run over summer so it 'll kick off again in october our main source of getting the word out there is facebook so we 've got grafton streeto facebook page there 's also grafton runners where we share that information on there so we should kick off again probably around jacaranda and valley sign and tint are um there 's an instagram account now too but i don 't know about instagram wonderful thank you it 's good having um having younger ones

    "text": "welcome to clarence media 's candidate q a where we interview each of the aspiring candidates ahead of the clarence valley council election to be held on saturday december the 4th and this morning i 'm joined by phil belletti good morning phil good morning bill how are you good thanks uh so with only four councillors standing for re-election there 'll be a lot of new faces on council you hoping to be one of them i guess what 's your vision for the next term of council the next vision is really looking at the council has been more actively involved in in all the the initiatives that are happening in grafton and that and the whole valley um you know we 've seen the bureaucrats over the years take take front sleep and we really need a the counsellors to be even allocated specific projects we need to be focused on the future we need to also say to people and businesses around australia that we 're open for business we 've got a unique opportunity now covered as bad as it 's been has presented an opportunities in the big cities and um and really we we now have an opportunity to um to present ourselves as as open for those opportunities it 's not just about housing it 's about jobs so we we as a as a community have been welcoming we 've we 've had a number of initiatives over the years you know with the highway upgrade the new jail and the bridge um i keep on saying that the the the the bridge is really the only um initiative which was specifically for for the valley um the um the jail has been a been a great boost um for jobs but it 's state infrastructure so is the highway it 's state infrastructure so we need infrastructure now that people are willing to invest in but we need a plan we need a strategic plan that presents to anyone that walks into our community always thinking of walking into our community it presents to them the opportunities so we need to clearly identify pictorially you know the the commercial areas the retail areas what our expansion potential is um i a critical mass in my opinion for the whole valley of around about a hundred thousand um we can get more than that fantastic but we need a plan to get to that now the plan really needs to look at the major centers and how they are all going to enter into interrelate the the issue we 've got is we 've got a community which is this is willing to expand we 've also got an aging population and we should be using our older people more wisely and giving them opportunities so what when we talk about how we 're going to expand we need to really say okay here is our new commercial areas here are the retail areas here are our growth potential for residential areas now we have some flooding issues so we need to present areas that are above the the one in 100 flood flood zones we also need to preserve our existing assets like the old jail we need to really build on our on our um our redevelopment of our grafton based hospital we need a freight hub you know of those initiatives from for many years we also need our state federal and local accounts representatives to sit at the same table and work together for a single objective and the objective really needs to be they need they are the funding bodies essentially okay so state and federal they need to understand where we want to go and how we 're going to get there but they need to get off their backsides dare i say it and work for us and not work for everyone else we need to be very insular in that regard and make sure that they understand that we 're going to put the pressure on them and you know whoever the new lot are coming in federally we need to really hammer them we need to make sure that they clearly understand that we 're not going to sit back and this is what the new councillors need to do they all need to say okay every time they have a conversation they need to say the state and federal members that you know this is about regional australia this is about not taking away from from the big cities but but re reinvesting in in the regions but in order to do that we need a lot of infrastructure here and i think that we 've got we 've got the quality of people we 've got people who are accepting of of development and businesses uh really and and private businesses are really key from the chambers point of view we were also pushing things like you know government departments and all that sometimes that 's not realistic but at the end of the day in order for this this to survive our communities to survive and thrive we need to look at that critical mass we need to have a plan to get to that critical mass we need to make sure that we keep our kids here and that they have jobs paying jobs not the differential between regional and sydney that that 's rubbish you know we need to have proper paying jobs so they can stay here we need to bring them and educate them here i 've lost my son to brisbane because he went he 's stayed here we need to really grow our population but we need a council that 's willing to look at the economic development more than what they 've already i think they 've done a really good job okay but we are now in the next phase of where we want to be and we are it 's a unique opportunity we 're gonna have a new federal federal government we 're gonna have um state government in the next few years we 've got a new premier in new south wales who seems to be very progressive you know so he 's not willing to sort of like to stand by and let the world go by he 's going to be out there grabbing everything we need him here to talk to us about what the hell we can offer them and what they can offer us all right so yeah obviously sorry i can go on today so i can really go up a day we 've got very clear objectives and vision there for that answer and um yeah as also you 're so 've got a lot of experience in corporate governance you 've been very actively involved the grafton chamber of commerce um you obviously know what you 're talking about tell us a bit about yourself and where you 've come from well i spent 25 years in the territory government doing everything from i ended up finishing up in infrastructure management so i do understand about capital investment i do understand about how important infrastructure is when you 're building a community when i relocated here i was consulting for many years um i i worked um on the intervention you know with the federal government um as a private private um contractor because i had the experience with indigenous communities that 's my other passion as well i i really want to see the indigenous communities in the in this whole area who are very rich in their culture be able to be more sustainable give them job opportunities we need a cultural centre we need things like you know integrated aged care with them as well and home-based care but we from from my perspective i spent many as well but i 've been i spent seven years in aged care in grafton i 've have a real passion for we 've got an aging population the whole australia is an aging population we 've got to look after our people when it 's not no longer acceptable just put them in a home and forget about them no you 've got to you 've got to build activities you 've got to generate the revenues provide them with the opportunities so that they are not stagnating we we really need to look at how we 're going to manage our aging population i 'm also a graduate of australian institute of company directors so i 've got a i got a degree in business uh from from new south wales universities and stuff um so i 've i understand how an organization should function how a board should function and how councils should function and councils to me should be functioning more like a board would do with all the governance that 's required and um and the understanding that you know we are we are here we we if i and i 'm coming from a bureaucrat i 'm an ex bureaucrat okay we need to have a good blend between the bureaucrats and the elected councillors and we need to help everyone understand that the elected councillors are the ones that should be setting the scene setting the road map and really approving the strategy forward we need to all work together um and that 's where i can bring those sort of skills because i 've been there and done that and i 've really understand how the two can can meld together but more importantly how we can as i mentioned before how we can get the key government levels to the table and we work together as a as a as a unified group to actually achieve what we want uh so all right um probably just about out of time but i guess uh just you know talk about a couple of other things maybe uh grafton streetscape um yeah look you 've touched on that as well um you 've obviously been involved in projects to do with grafton cbd as well as to the entrances to town and things like that yeah they um i think um there 's a new planner in in the council and he 's got a lot of vision and that 's that 's really healthy the we we need to create grafton and the whole valley as as a as a destination and we 've got some unique natural resources here and the council 's done quite a good job with some of their websites and the planet 's way and all that sort of stuff so now we need to provide people with a destination which will fulfill their other requirements you 're pulling people out of sydney you 're drawing people out you know people go to the gold coast why do they go to the gold coast no not just for the beaches it 's the shopping it 's the amenities you know you 've got apartments you can take your family you 've got resorts so we need to really think about how we 're going to manage that future with the infrastructure and therefore we 've got to is one aspect of it the the waterfront development fantastic you know we really need to uh link all of those um and and therefore when people come here they they they will have opportunities to you know go canoeing or go cycling go forward driving we 've got a beautiful um yamba you go to the beaches and many waters all those sort of places we 've got everything here and we 've got the mountains as well and the inland and the hinterland so i you know i chose to come here 16 years ago because that 's what attracted me to the place you know we had all these at our doorstep and yet we 're still only three hours away from from brisbane and six hours away from sydney so where else would you want to be yeah so you 've got a vision obviously for 80 or 90 or even more thousand people uh in the clarence valley what would you say to the amber voters who are fearful of the emblem becoming the next byron for instance and they want to keep it the would happen i think that we can really work closely with that community no one wants to see another gold coast byron byrum to me is i don 't understand the attraction to byron but i can tell you how on my other board that i 'm on with north coast community housing the prices for um the properties and all that around that have just um they 're out of the average person 's reach so you know yambu is sort of is getting pricey but we need to make and improve the access to yamba but we need to give the amber people an opportunity to to actually link with with grafton more so and vice versa but development is going to happen um and but we can manage it and if we we all sit down together and work through the issues i 've developed satellite cities um with the planners in the territory we 've developed schools i had sites set aside 25 years in advance so you know you can do a lot of things now and set like a road prep road map or going to work but we 've really got to be sincere about it and you know we 've got some really good local councillors from that area so they they have got as much say in everything as as everyone else so we really need to make sure that that the gamba and the clank um aren 't forgotten you know this is not just about grafton this is about the whole valley um i think those days are gone where um each had their own individual council now it 's one council and as i said you know we all have to work together because we can provide a destination which will give people opportunities from the oceans to the mountains okay well great thanks for joining us phil on candidate q a great thank you _"

    "text": "hi deborah novak and uh thank you for joining us on clarence media 's q a with the clarence valley council candidates thank you bill you are one of the few current councillors standing for re-election on saturday december the 4th you 've been a very vocal member of council during your first term and here we are at the grafton community farmers markets which you coordinate but for those of us who aren 't 100 familiar with who you are please tell us a little bit about yourself okay i have lived in the clarence valley for 35 years i worked for the daily examiner for 25 of those years as a visual journalist and weekend sports photographer i have i 'm a mother of three i run two farmers markets the yama yamba morning farmers market and the grafton twilight farmers market and on top of that i am also um a part of a number of organizations that uh advocate uh for the agri-food economy here in the clarence valley alrighty i also said i haven 't finished it i all sit on i also sit on uh um it 's a really i 'm really passionate about that project all right so you 're definitely a busy woman yes and you 've just endured a marathon first term in council five years yes two two uh postponed election dates as well yes uh what do you feel have been your biggest achievements in your first term on council i think surviving my biggest achievements i think have been i think my biggest achievement has been enabling the community to have deeper conversations with their council to get things done and i 've in the background so i like to work in the background and enable our community to uh go after the things that they want to achieve so there 's a whole lot of processes uh for them to go through and teaching them about those processes is what is um able has enabled them to actually get success and i guess also what are some of the biggest things you 've learned that you can take into next time should you be re-elected okay so some of the things i 've learned is um council next year is that they will have training for the first time so specific training on how to chair a meeting uh how to um be a a a role model within the community as per the code of conduct there 's a whole lot of high level skill sets that the new counsellors will learn whereas the previous um like this current council they are things that we actually had to teach and learn ourselves and of course you make mistakes and but sometimes those mistakes can be very costly and um and can um result in um sometimes um disciplinary actions so perceived or not perceived yeah all right and uh so you had no doubt no question about standing again for re-election oh no no doubt whatsoever i have really i 've loved every minute of it i love um and whether i 'm elected or not it 's neither here nor there because before i was elected i was doing things and advocating for the community i was already a champion um you know for certain causes whether it was uh the justice for norma been afraid to step up and have those hard conversations with authorities on behalf of our community so now uh what having being a counsellor it doesn 't um change the fact that i can still have those conversations it just it doesn 't make it easier or harder it 's just it actually expands my whole knowledge base alrighty uh as many as five of the current nine councils won 't be standing i get the impression some of those were counting down the days even last year uh everyone seems to be ready for a fresh change yeah look you know i am you know five councillors not sitting that 's a pretty that 's a bloodletting really because it 's um that gives a whole new conversation to council and i think you know people what i 've come to see is people actually don 't understand uh the processes of counsel and that you know as an elected counselor my um i have to be really careful what i say in um in the public i can have a private and public view but i 'm once a vote has been taken we you know we have a democracy we have to stand by that council resolution uh but if not uh we can put a notice of motion or a a council um resolution forward sorry no resolution but i forget what the other term is but we can um there are ways to go around that but it 's very complex uh what we do it 's very the relationship between counselors and um uh the staff is very complex as well we 're not we don 't have we 're not supposed to have a relationship with them either it 's and that 's the the things that we need to marry manage when we are um uh you know when we live in a community because we have you know we have the you know the the general manager over there and you know staff over here we have to be really um mindful of you know the conversations we have with um stuff well we 're actually just simply not allowed to but sorry the other thing i was going to to you know um you know overturn something yup all right so we 'll be a fresh start for the new council uh what do you believe will be the biggest issues facing the these uh people serving the next term uh i think there 's a couple of uh issues there 's issues sitting with the ombudsman at the moment that um are not public uh and that 's um i mean it has been publicly discussed um within a council meeting uh but there are some issues there 's not a full-blown investigation yet but there are matters sitting with the ombudsman uh so that will be interesting to see what happens there i think uh climate change and um our food bowl here they probably that the food bowl uh conversation and um how we manage business and employment here is going to be the biggest thing to drive the economy because at the end of the day we 're moving into a new era of doing business whether it 's through the digital economy uh but one of the steady influences for over 150 years has up that conversation and spread that you know that um that economic love further so with the farmers in manufacturers or you know production i think that will hold us in really good stead for the future okay and um uh as well as a new council there 'll be a new mayor is that a position deborah novak could entertain nominating for look you know it is such an unenviable job where you you know it would be very very um a very very difficult job i 'm not going to say yes and i 'm not going to say no i will just um because whoever is elected and we don 't know i might not even get elected you know but you know i 'll just uh see what happens um on the day that the mayoral vote comes into play and um yeah i just yeah i 'll wait and see okay and is there any other reasons uh you haven 't told us about why people should vote for deborah novak rook you know this um when i was voted in last time and i worked i have worked really hard for the community for 35 years since i 've lived here so whether it 's been you know the pnc surf club rugby league farming arts or culture i have always been a part of the community and working for the community in one way or another so when i ran last time i didn 't do how to vote cards i didn 't do any core flute boards i did nothing like that because i just believed that if the community thought i 'd already stepped up i would be already you know i would be noticed right and and those people who believed in me um would vote for me and so fortunately over 2 000 people voted for me so they got their 2.85 an hour worth because that 's what i get paid 2.85 to be a counsellor um and i just think this time because it 's not about you know no amount of money i spend could convince you know someone to like me to vote for me i would like to think people will know that i for me or not but i 'm what i 've learned is um not to uh be so sensitive um and feel hurt when people disagree with me or you know vice versa but i 'm really comfortable going in and going hard and standing up for our community whether they 're the prime minister or whoever you know i like to think that i back our community and that 's in this you know if that 's what the community wants happy days and just because i 'm a woman doesn 't mean i 'm going to shy away from anything so more than happy to you know step up and back the community oh great well thanks for joining us deborah and good luck on september december the 4th thank you _"

    "text": "[Music] we used to live right around the corner now we reside right up the stream how far do [Music] good morning clarence valley it 's bill north here for clarence media welcome back to council q a last night we had the first ordinary council meeting with clarence valley council and joining us is uh the mayor ian thailand good morning bill and good morning to all your watchers no worries thank you and yeah how did you find yesterday 's meeting uh quite efficient well yes that 's one word i guess i was very pleased with the way that the team of councillors worked together through the day they were very collegiate and we took some important decisions which we 'll talk about no doubt but uh yes it was the first meeting of the new council first full meeting and in mclean and i thought that it went very well you uh so you know it just seemed like much more made it look easy i went through the business papers and ticked them all off which ones were going to be spoken about and off business paper and i 've been doing that for a very long time as a mayor and it enables the councillors where they all agree on something to just adopt those items by consent and then we focus on the important issues that require debate and i think yesterday there were 33 items and we probably debated 14 or 15. so that 's an efficient way of truncating your meeting on the one hand but making sure you focus on those important issues yep and even the preparation process a little bit different now without the two committee meetings that were previously held on the tuesday before at an extraordinary meeting in in january we decided to change the meeting cycle process and the reason for that was to try and better inform the councillors and bear in mind there 's four new ones let them ask all the questions that they have on all the items on the friday morning before uh and they feel less inhibited to do that in that sort of a a more informal session can it 's run by the acting general manager and development application matters actually physically inspected them and that too helps you ground truth the issues and and i felt that the full day friday was very beneficial in terms of the ultimate decision-making and the councillors exercised their power to make decisions at that duly constituted monthly council meeting okay great and also some new committees are being formed as well yes most committees are being reformed but there are two new committees that the council determined to establish yesterday one is a biodiversity committee which is due to the heart of the deputy mayor greg clancy but the council supported that and we 're also concerned given the loss of the tourist information centre at south craft and that we wanted to step back in to the tourism space we 're establishing an economic development and tourism committee and build a as you know the former trc office is very strong on that but but we just want to engage with professionals in tourism to help us to better promote tourism because it 's a big industry for the valley and the council yesterday the team was really process of expressions of interest for all committees um all positions in our vacant and so these committees are not just made up of councillors no no definitely not uh yesterday we apportioned councillors and that was done really really well i thought very collegiately a chair and another councillor in most committees and the two that the council that were nominated by the council uh will determine which one of them will be chaired whether they might alternate the cheering or whatever but now we we go out and and we seek expressions of interest from the total community and that 's really important the council doesn 't possess all the knowledge we need to get external input this is also about transparency about openness about doing things differently so previous committees didn 't have this sort of structure with external people yes they did but some of them had become a bit tired one one committee that we didn 't reform yesterday was the aboriginal advisory committee and that was at my behest as a volunteer in aboriginal communities over the last 20 years i wanted us to the various aboriginal communities in this valley and there 's only seven percent of the people of this valley who are aboriginal so let 's get get out we 're going to go out and talk to them about how they 'd like this committee to work things like representation issues how and where they meet and so on so we 'll we 'll go to the five aboriginal communities in the valley plus we 'll go to corporations land councils and the like and resurrect that and and give direct access for the aboriginal people of this valley to the council my personal view is that the mayor and the general manager should attend those aboriginal advisory committee meetings without having a vote your observers only they make the decisions we take those decisions back to council for consideration so that 's what we 're hoping to do in that one all right and uh so back to we 're talking about tourism uh it was revealed that the visitor information center has been sold was that um yes a bit of a surprise to some of the councils to provide an information report on the status of that matter and ms black came back and told us that it had in fact been sold so therefore we didn 't have any options to unwind that without obviously facing some considerable costs so that particular horse is bolted bill okay and there 's no indication what that site will um who 's bought it or whatever no i don 't know that i don 't know the price and uh really you know that 's commercial and confidence i guess for now but it will come out eventually one of the things that was voted on as well uh was um a third position on the um review for the acting general for the general manager yes and um and gender equity came to quite a bit it did we were conscious of uh we 'd been alerted to employment equal opportunity uh provisions and we felt that it was important for gender equity that the third council or nominated person bear in mind that the office of local government guidelines indicate that mayor and deputy should be on memory i think it was councillor toms and now the acting general manager will appoint her nominee for that four-person review committee and it will meet early march and will review her performance and interestingly actually all three of the female councils did nominate for that committee they they did i thought they 'd be a bit more organized than that but anyway we got through that okay uh one um issue brought up uh was put on the table was the rural lands mitigation yes um that 's a an intended 20-year plan to safeguard the rural lands of this ten and a half thousand square kilometer valley um there 's some important it 's an important policy that we want to see uh comment on because 69 of all our lands in the valley are rural the rural one rural two or rural three another six percent of conservation land so three quarters of all the land in the valley uh is if you like rural farmland and and we want to preserve um the the quantum and the quality of farmland uh i 've talked for example about ultimately losing so much cane land that the mill becomes unviable so they 're really keen to support the policy that it 'll address other issues such as red tape in in rural farmlands and the like but i 'd encourage everybody to to get hold of the policy and uh to have a good look at it uh it 's about our future in this valley and does it re-emphasize as well um council 's stance on not supporting industries that are non-renewable fuels i can 't tell you off-hand bill but i would presume that that 's a natural corollary if you 're protecting your rural farmlands but you know we 've got a um a um [Music] what 's it called sorry we 've got a mental block the um solar panels solar farm sorry and and up where i came from there are probably 15 of them on the go and you 've got to locate those where they 're not on riverbanks where they 're not visual eyesores but there are appropriate places to have them and we need renewable energy it 's a time that 's what we have to do but this policy i believe you make a good point i believe we should go to that and consider that okay all right well thanks for joining us uh councillor tyler may uh hopefully this is a monthly occurrence just um i 'm looking forward to talking to you the morning after each council great i just i 'm really concerned that all the people know what we 're doing on the one hand and if they 've got concerns about what we 're doing we want to hear from them yeah no worries and council q a will happen every week where we do catch up with the mayor after every meeting and also the other councils during the month and other uh sideline commentators so stay tuned and thanks for joining us thank you thank [Music] you we gotta get out of the house and reconnect [Music] we we gotta get together more often than we do we gotta get together _"

    "text": "hi everyone i 'm here with fiona from momentum collective this morning they 've had an open day and grand opening of their new premises in grafton on dobby street so fiona would you like to tell us a little bit about momentum collective and what you 've been doing in the local community and what you now offer with the new premises absolutely so momentum collective is a community organization and we 're based from southeast queensland down to coffs harbour we offer a range of different services we offer services in the ndis or national disability insurance scheme space we offer community programs domestic violence assistance homelessness assistance so we offer a wide variety of services in grafton we 've been in primarily working in the domestic violence and homelessness space and some work in the mental health space we attended a couple of forums where we heard that there was a need more a need for increased services in the disability space we 'd been doing a little bit of work in that space so we started raising our profile talking to people about what they wanted disability and respite or short-term accommodation we started going along to meetings talking to people got offered this fantastic house and here we go it looks quite large so i mean how many it 's very big i think it 's got nine bedrooms and for us what that means is that we can offer a wide variety of services we uh when we first moved in we modified the bathroom downstairs so it 's upstairs and downstairs and it 's very important to us of course that everyone can access our space no matter what sort of disability they have so we modified the bathroom so we can provide services downstairs or for people that are more able-bodied we can provide services upstairs so like great options for us and for the community okay fantastic um so there was a bit of a gap in the community in terms of respite for for carers yeah absolutely and it 's such an important thing for both the people with a disability and their carers to be able to just have that opportunity to have a break it means that family are getting a break the other gap that we heard about was support for young people with a disability so we 've started some after school programs and they are just taking off like it 's people are we 're knocking on our doors for those programs okay so what what do those programs involve so they 're from three to six of an afternoon and i mean obviously for our service to be viable we need people to have ndis funding so people can if they 've got ndis funding they can pay to come along their funding can pay to come along to our groups we 've got things like one of the programs that 's called getting dirty and it 's working there working in the garden there 's art and crafts there 's cooking because we 've got this lovely garden veggie garden a couple of chalks so you know that that stuff is great uh we 've got art and craft because that 's always a whole lot of fun i was having a bit of a sticky beak at the stuff we 've got great things that people like too and i guess the likes of the the gardening and the cooking and that that also in turn helps in in terms of helping them to be a little bit um self-sufficient when they get older and they if they have the opportunity to to leave home their valuable life skills all of our programs are based about around both increasing people 's opportunity to be in the community learning new skills and having a good time because that 's really what life is all about isn 't it so yeah yeah yeah okay um so you mentioned that momentum collective is based from southeast queensland so how many people are employed we 've got just over 500 staff across the our footprint um and a whole lot of them are support workers which is fantastic yeah that 's fantastic so yeah we were a little bit late getting here this morning but the grand opening um i noticed as there was live music and it was just ice cream and and all sorts of things so um great morning yeah we had a janae did a welcome to country which is always beautiful we had um the local mp chris galactus was here there was um three or four councillors that came along and um yeah sausage is all lots of people going on tour we took people it covered makes life always complicated so we took people on small group tours through the place and everybody that went through loved it okay now with with the restrictions looking like easing a little bit it 'll life should hopefully get a little bit easier and it might make it easier to run some of your programs as well because i imagine that was very difficult it was very complicated over the last couple of years and we had to do all sorts of creative things in terms of places that we went and it 's making our groups smaller and all those things because we got there you 're dealing with people who to a certain degree i guess already feel a little bit isolated absolutely and scared people were very families were scared of what covered might mean for their family members did individual support instead of group support went into people 's homes help them with their shopping those things that just out for those of us that are able to do things it was easy not so easy when you 're caring for someone with a disability yeah yeah okay um is there anything else you 'd like to add have we missed them no i don 't think so we are very excited to be in grafton and the clarence valley so we 're really looking forward to being able to grow our service and make a difference in the valley yep okay great thanks for your time thank you thanks _"

    "text": "just one thing that 's really important and part of the message to get across is like politics is something that up until now it 's it 's not that inspiring for many people to get involved in so i 'm not just trying to be a part of politics i 'm trying to help change politics and and that 's about inspiring people to have have conversation about the things that matter to them get involved have conversations with your friends and say okay well what are the things we want to change and interested in yeah be interested in it and and that 's the way we can really change things in canberra so so whoever it is you vote for start thinking about it and get amongst it good afternoon everyone leah here for clarence media i just popped over to the markets this afternoon to get a few things and i bumped into hannah best luke now the election hasn 't been called yet but hannah beth is an independent so she 's here today introducing herself and hoping to get back um here on a us a bit about yourself where are you from and what do you do thanks leah i 'm a i 'm a senior lecturer in science and agriculture i work at southern cross university i live in evans head a little north of here a nice part of the world oh it 's beautiful it 's beautiful there and i 've got i 'm grazing a family there i 've got two little kids four and seven and i 'm part of marine rescue as well i 've chosen to stand up as an independent candidate because i 'm just not happy with what i see in politics and i think our region could be represented a lot better in canberra okay so what sort of things are you going to be um talking to people about and pushing for what what sort of platforms are you um wanting to represent what issues are you wanting to represent yeah absolutely so i 'm in grafton today because i 've been speaking to people about the housing crisis and also about health yeah so look that what i 'm learning is roof over their heads their mental health quickly declines and there 's a really really major problem in our electorate in terms of housing affordable housing for people not not just the poorest in society but housing is a critical issue that 's got to be addressed and i think rapidly we need long-term solutions and short-term solutions for housing in this area but also health you know the health systems that we have are poorly connected and we could do so much better in terms of connecting our mental health services our youth services and having better longer longer programs that can be supported for much longer periods of time to make sure that our young people are getting the support that they need in mental health and housing as well i actually lived in um in youth house when i was a teenager um i 'm a senior lecturer at the university now but back then i was pretty you know pretty lost 16 year old and the support that i had by um you know having that social worker who can can say okay well this is important so looking after the young ones but also the regional economies this area has got some really important regional industries we 've got sugar we 've got beef we 've got macadamias we 've got the arts some beautiful music playing here today and so how can we strengthen those regional industries is is a really important thing to me look i 've been working with farmers for more than 10 years now and working in regenerative agriculture but with all different types of farmers across the region and across australia and farmers need support to be able to undertake practices that are going to build resilience on their farms um in terms of resilience from the shocks and knocks of global markets pandemics [Music] yeah yeah look i was i was teaching a unit on exactly that through how do you build resilience through drought fire and flood and i got to the end of it and the last module was politics and i went ah okay well we 've got to get amongst it so those are the key things that i feel really strongly about and future which is housing and education um obviously i 'm in the university sector but also um protecting our regional economies and climate action that supports and works with our farmers so it can be an opportunity for them instead of something to be concerned about yeah okay no no sounds like you 're gonna be busy no it was great to meet you here today and i 'm sure that um when it gets a bit closer we 'll have a more in-depth discussion with you i don 't know whether anybody else has signed up for the the local electorate yet he 's one of the first candidates to sign up yeah thanks thanks so much leah yeah i really love to see her see about better politics and look this is something that the community can be involved in so if anyone 's interested in volunteering for the campaign or just hearing more about what i 'm doing having me come along to your community groups or your business group i really want to hear what 's important to you so thanks so much leah okay thank you _"

    "text": "[Music] good evening everyone i 'm out and about here on friday evening in the main street of grafton and i 'm going around some venues that are part of the live and local uh gigs that are on this evening so i 'm here with phil and he has coordinated it so i will get him to give you an idea of what 's going on in grafton tonight and yamba tomorrow night yes so live and local is a music industry development program it 's co-funded by clarence valley council and the live music office which is a federal body which advocates for changes in regulations that can help um live music sort of be part of the high street so tonight we 've got four venues running with well there 's 30 acts playing over the two nights tonight in grafton and tomorrow in yamba and we 're just outside heart and soul we also have the surf shop down the road the clock house and uh diosa whole foods okay so 30 artists that 's um quite a few artists that are that are playing um um i know most of you won 't see this in time to get down on friday night but uh maybe you can get to gamba tomorrow night and check some of the places out so what are the places in yamba tomorrow night so in yamba we have the last rights bar which is opened just before christmas and is really dedicated to live music this is a great thing for yamba and the clarence valley there 's also sassafras restaurant and the wobbly chuck brewery so they all have live music it 's free to go to all the gigs as well so as i said they 're funded by council and the live music office and this is just the step one in a project which also includes professional development workshops for musicians and also an industry forum where we get together with business owners and council and look at ways that we can collaborate to better support the live music industry going forwards well we 're new to town we 've just moved here from sydney and we were cruising the streets recently and saw when on and we thought that 's pretty cool let 's come and check it out well i think it 's wonderful because um as musicians as you know with the covert we just haven 't been able to get gigs so last year the whole year i had three gigs which is way short of what i 'd normally do and so it 's a wonderful incentive and it 's lovely to be out playing again how was the crowd down at heart and seoul they were awesome they were put on a really good night down there everyone was super receptive and enjoying the food and the beers and the music so yeah was great and um what did you think of of the idea of council putting this on and having the four different venues and lots of artists um i thought it was a really good idea especially coming out of coven um there 's obviously been a lack of live performance and and gigs and that sort of stuff so i thought it was a really awesome initiative to not only get the artists out but performers and that sort of stuff so i was really excited to be invited to be a part of it what do you think of what the council 's done for us here this evening i think it 's a really fun happy occasion and just lovely to see everybody out and about and enjoying themselves yes fantastic it 's just great to see live music uh happening in the clarence valley and uh great to see this initiative happening really yes and there 's so many people out this evening isn 't it i 'm amazed i barely recognise grafton let 's see more of it yes so good definitely i really love being able to play live so yeah it 's great the the workshops for the musicians um what what are they going to be like so these online workshops are with industry professionals from around australia so we have for example an artist 's conversation with anya tyrell who 's a successful artist who 's toured internationally it 's based in the northern rivers we have a publicity talk with a top publicist and pr team well and these workshops are really about building capacity of musicians who are working and trying to make a career out of music in the clarence to network pick up expertise and tips and then sort of reach their reach beyond the clarence valley into the outer sort of echelons of the music industry we 're loving it we actually met years ago at a music festival and so seeing live music is a really big thing for us so we like to support local music yeah that 's so sweet yeah yeah it was wonderful but i got a great reaction because i 'm a singer-songwriter and i do some covers but i mostly do my own music and they responded to my music so i was very happy so it was wonderful that 's fantastic so you 'd love to see this happening more often yeah i was just talking to nat my friends saying like i really hope it 's a something that they do in the future because you don 't see you know stuff like this happening grafton very often and the streets filled and i really hope it 's something that they they continue to do yeah it 's awesome i mean it 's down the street there 's a number of different venues it 's very chilled and that 's a perfect time of year the weather like this evening it 's beautiful it 's perfect i feel a bit overdressed actually jeans but anyway there you go you 'll get used to the graft in summer it 's beautiful anyway have a great evening thank you so much thank you thank you it 's been awesome i 've just bumped into people that like were at heart and soul when i was singing there and we 're gonna do the rounds and try and see as many artists as we can so i think it 's yeah the whole night 's a really good idea okay yeah well thank you and have a great evening thank you i understand that you make amps so we 're going to catch up with you on another occasion and and um go into that in a bit more detail so we 'd love to yeah johnson 's dr johnson 's handmade vintage amplifiers wonderful that 's out here in the clarence valley that 'll be coming soon thank you thank you you 've got a uh a diosa pizza to take home with you yeah they 're totally the best yeah they 're the best yeah okay well you enjoy your evening thanks thanks so much there 's quite a few artists out and about so you 've hung around to listen to a few other people as well well i 'm responsible for the pa system because that 's mine so i can 't really go anywhere just in case which i know it 's a bummer but i wanted to do all of that but i 've got to stick around so but it 's okay yeah okay no um hopefully there 's more of this happening because it seems like it 's a great initiative to have this happening in grafton and from looking around this evening while i 've been out there look to be more and more people turning up as the evening goes on yes that 's true that with so many and then so many came in while i was playing so it was wonderful so really good okay excellent and have you got another gig lined up do you want to let us know where your next yes i 'll be it 's a while away uh but i 'm sure i 'm going to get more gigs before that but i play every year at the camp oven festival at nimboyda and i love it fantastic i play with the band there so and i 'm sure with restrictions easing you will get more gigs lined up in the next month or so yeah i 'm sure i will wonderful thanks for your time well thank you for interviewing me wonderful cheers [Music] what should we be looking out for over the coming months i think the the message particularly to business owners in uh in grafton is that um it 's actually really easy to have live music in your premises now in fact there 's been a significant regulation change in new south wales that means that uh low-risk low-impact music like the sort da exempt there 's no licensing requirement so a surf shop a clothes shop a hairdresser anybody can put on live music and bring new customers and a different type of audience into their business so that 's a great opportunity really and i think if any uh business owners were thinking i 'd like to do something different you know maybe once a month or every now and again now they really can so i mean they should talk to council and counselors you 've got to point them in the right direction as to how to do that no it 's fantastic that council has um is funding the musicians tonight um that that 's a great thing for council to do for the local community so we look forward to seeing what happens next so keep us up to date with any projects that are happening thanks for the chat thanks very much _"

to be here neither tea and coffee during the breaks we 're at libya we are on the run i love it all right first up tonight uh this is in honour of cole marsh and bruce green and it seems to be um a bit of an unfortunate theme there are always people unfortunately sick but leaving a legacy and cole and bruce certainly did the mclean show society cole marsh and bruce green memorial award is the first award tonight and the recipient is chosen by members of that mclean show society for excellence in agricultural sports so the award is named in honor of these two men and uh it 's been so surreal to come here and not have bruce here he was a tremendous member and part of the team here for the sports awards council and um it was certainly a shock it 's been a little over 12 months but to cole and bruce uh certainly the legacy lives on he was always part of that two-week raffle that 's for sure and you wouldn 't really see him without a beer in his hand and bruce 's son jackson green up if they are here to present the inaugural coal marsh and bruce green memorial award are either of them here in the room tonight we do have both of them yeah please give them a round of applause as they come up thank you and just a few words as they both do come up on bruce green he was involved in so many committees in the clarence valley none more so than the mclean show society and he joined the horse management committee way back in 1978 what a trooper on a trip to the sydney royal show in 2000 with glenn and mogul brahman the stud uh he got inspiration and a seed was planted and that seed grew into what would save the ailing show and bring it back to the show 's full glory and he also put together the australian flag ride which he was lucky enough to co-produce with his daughter shannon these shows were also seen in grafton and lismore [Music] and no matter what it was whether it was mclean show camp draft rodeo or work dedication and love that he put into all the events illustrated how much he really cared for him and his community he had such a passion for these sports awards i remember he would always send me a text asking when we 're going to the bunnies game and i guess that 's one thing that uh sits in my mind was that we unfortunately never got to do that but um he appreciated everyone 's commitment and hard work and um the sportsmanship which was always incredible he had a larger than life character i 'll tell you that and uh was respected and loved by his family friends and community he truly lived a full and eventful life he worked hard and played just as hard let 's remember him in peace and for colin marsh he was a life member of the mclean show society a sword of its committee having become a committee man in 1975 and he believed in the role of agriculture in the community and loved being part of the team it was a gentleman he was quietly spoken he was hard the right bloke for the right job and the right tool for every single occasion was in the back of his you marshy was full of knowledge when it came to his beloved mclean showgrounds and like a footballer playing on his home ground if it was an event coming up you would always find him at the show grounds either fixing something or supervising working these he was particularly well known for getting the trotting track to tip-top shape for the mclean show and he 'll always take it upon himself to ensure the fence lines in the yards were clean and the gl the grass was cut right underneath cole 's legacy will continue to loom large across the show society camp draft dog trials rodeo and sports council he was the one to get things done and to guide others in making sure all the necessary jobs were covered to guarantee a successful result the winner was close mates to both of these men and the winner goes to robbie sutherland [Applause] right can i please hello congratulations rob rob with the with the wood bridge and 've got everything ready for everything that ever happened there and there 's a lot of stories and i think we should talk about them after over in ring because that 's what they would like to do i 'd like to congratulate him rob he was uh the third part one of these uh party that was uh always there doing things and it thoroughly deserved this this award and it 's been an honor to have known rob and bruce and cole over the years congratulations [Applause] the douglas colin marsh edward bruce green better known as greenie and margie could not be greater mates than they were from with me on committee i was on committee with colin for 45 years and as late as yesterday afternoon we had an email to the go society about some that they couldn 't accept a plan that we 've been working on for five years on a set of new stables i went through my phone and i almost dialed cold because for 45 years anything like that cole would be the first person i would talk to and information that we got yesterday it would have been pretty colourful his reply and as i say 45 years with colin and about 38 with bruce and before those two we lost three or four other committeemen it 's left an amazing hole in the events of the mclean showground which i am heavily involved with and live for as some people say it 's my second home three years ago getting ready for the show my wife said to me your mother will take the caravan in and stay there i 've been there for a month that 's working me with colin and bruce these people was so committed committed to committee it was unbelievable whether it be a working b or a meeting or whatever they would be both there and there was threats other things i did with ruth one real memorable occasion was at the sydney royal show about 25 years ago i was standing with bruce in the grandstand and my daughter was riding in the heath harris trick riding team and they did around and hippodrome which is standing on the horseback of the rodeo when it finished bruce looked at me and he said that brought a tear to my eye which you did mine as well but i could stand here for an hour and talk about bruce and colin as i said colin has been a very dear friend of mine for 45 years and so became a show society member and if there was a problem he only had to look sideways and call it be there and he was full of support for whatever decision was made mary 's held and did he get upset one special night at the mclean show we had a big problem with the trotting fraternity it was all hell broke loose the stewart refused to steward the last two races at the show because it was that rough and we were in the stewart 's tent with colin and the one of the truck drivers said that i was only a mate of the other side of the trotton fraternity and didn 't call let 's go that was probably one of the only times that i ever seen colin really stirred to get this award the first award and i would just like to say thanks to the support council committee and everybody involved shopping world and everyone involved in these things and thank you very much [Applause] [Music] congratulations well deserved robbie and uh just a special mention to judy who is also in the room tonight as well um unfortunately there are a few tributes that we would just like to quickly note from the clarence valley sporting community since our last awards it has been a little while we 'll just take a second to pay tribute roma brotherson was a lifetime servant to basketball and grafton and the inaugural max god be award recipient in 2014 we also had bruce leonard and he was another lifelong stalwart of the grafton basketball association i still remember bruce when i used to rock up and play some casual basketball which i 'm sure most of the room would have as well even the traffic light parties is anybody old enough to remember the traffic light parties in here he was uh he was always there great man dick richards years seeing him there fantastic to see um and just i

columnist for the daily telegraph and finally 16 year old grafton netballer olivia rogers a tribute for all of them and um and just a moment to take in i guess how lucky we are to be continuing with

winning club will win a video commercial shoot and advertising package with clarence media actually left the daily examiner in august last year um after leading the transition to digital which um everybody in the clarence valley obviously appreciated so much um there was still a couple of people left from the daily exam are still there but there yeah i 'll put it on the record now there 's not one single person that was working at the daily examiner when we ceased printing still working for the daily examiner which is sad so you know to fill a void uh was one of the major reasons that we you know emma cholla and i started clarence media um basically to fulfill the glaring gaps that have been left by um no longer having a seven six day a week daily newspaper and many people would have seen last year that we covered the council elections for that very reason because you know and now the feedback after the election was a lot of people didn 't know the names on the ballot paper because they used to find it out in their daily paper so we uh we reached out to an websites were able to see that um you know interview video interviews with every candidate um you know all 16 of them 14 of them came to a q a live stream it was live streamed like this one just as rushed into the last minute but probably yeah i think for more reports it came it was from those involved it was very successful only two of the council uh candidates couldn 't make it and one of those their new mayor ian tyley has has um you know even acknowledged to me that he uh was impressed with what we did so um you know tonight is our second uh second go at it i suppose and something we 're looking to plan and do in the future is to host events and live stream uh events sporting events in particular um and and obviously i 've been involved in the sports awards for many years and helping to organize them it 's something that we 're hoping that we can sort of turn into a more professional venture as well as our website clarencemedia.com.ou to provide regular mission is to provide high quality media production solutions for regional businesses sporting organizations and business and community groups so that means yeah we can also do video advertising and help promote your organization as we will for the winning club of the year which is the mclean manta ray swimming club [Applause] there 's a bit for you here wow thank you thank you thank you it 's amazing no worries there 's hello everyone wow wait go team [Music] now as as a i think this is a really good sign of our our committee um our beautiful secretary tinil woodland prepared a speech for our president but he 's had a huge day so i 'm the treasurer and i 'm up here speaking my name 's louise and i 'm going to change my glasses so it is a privilege to be part of such a great platform for community sport even more so to be part of such an amazing club we are honored that we 've been recognized as a club regardless of placement so tennille congratulations everyone we 've won what we as as a whole new committee is inspiring and encouraging and personally i just like to say i 've been involved in lots of committees over my lifetime and i have never enjoyed this one as much and every single committee member is carries above you know it 's like everyone 's above exceptional in the role they play and i think that 's what 's helped us achieve so much in a short time and so we 're really excited about our future we have exceptional swimmers ruth everest who 's an amazing coach and at our table she 's been with some of our swimmers today and liz moore and i think a great example is one young swimmer hayden white he 's just recovered from a broken arm i think he 's just had his cast off he 's swum today in lismore and he won which is nobody expected so i think that 's a great example of the spirit we have experience and accomplished coaches a committee that is full of strengths to enhance our sport the facilities community and club as a whole working together participation and its sense of community in the past 12 months and we are excited to keep growing and making it the best we can for the children and families into the future and to hopefully grow into a competitive force within the swimming community thank you for the opportunity to be part of clarence valley sports awards and to show off our club thank you [Applause] a very very proud club and rightly so um you did mention the olympian uh now ruth everest is actually going to come on stage for a quick q a rue please grab applause for our olympian in the building [Applause] excuse me bruce bruce does she use that one can she use that one can you ask me [Music] yeah you can stand in front of here you 're right you 're safe you 're safe with me no hard questions okay um i think for everybody in the room they say olympia we haven 't in the room ruth tell us about your olympic experience and and i guess what you can give back to the club now well actually when do you know bombs off the derby and board excuse me and then luckily for me don talbott was a local coach so he took me on board and so i went there and started training with him and i was only about 15 and the hard work that we had to do with him got me into the mystic team actually they were only going to select six swimmers but they took seven and i was because i was so young they let me be on the team anyhow i ended up in rome at the olympics and my roommates were dawn fraser and lorraine crap so i was only 15 years old so that all started started like that and then carried on for another two years and competed then for australia for the commonwealth games in perth and after that when i came back don talbott my coach said to me what do you want to be i said i want to be a physique teacher but he said okay now over there put me in the pool and started teaching me to be a coach so that i went overseas for four years with ilsa conrad zuma mcgill and um at the time dawn fraser and all them got banned from swimming so linda said no i 'm gonna swim the english channel so did a little bit of that with her stayed overseas for four years ended up in south africa where i started coaching swimming and then when i came back to um sydney don talbot took me back on board again coached with him under study for him for six years and then he left to go over to canada so i took over the coaching at the auburn swimming centre i coached there for 30 years and honoring my retirement 20 years ago 30 years ago forgetting i 'm 78 this year so anyway they um when i retired from the auburn swimming center they renamed the center after me then i moved up here to the clarence valley and went along to the mclean pool just for a swim and the former people said oh come and catch us i said no i couldn 't even catch a fish to swim do you learn to swim so did that then we started next thing the squads have built up and everything so now i 'm putting in you know stuff that i 've learned for years and years and years but luckily i 've got great management with michelle the pool is going really well and as louise said you know the swimming here is really great and today i 've been coaching this morning i 've been up to lismore today we had so many winners here today it was unreal and then come back here for tonight so i can 't believe that all this has happened and um i 'm up here i love the clarence valley um very very happy i 've got a beautiful home in ashby i 've got koalas wallabies blah blah blah but i really enjoy swimming and so that 's about it so thank you [Applause] the olympic experience this is incredible is it almost was it almost a bit of an uh experience like molly o 'callaghan where we saw molly swim the heats in the relay and then not be similar yes that 's right i swam the heats of the relays i was only 15 years old and i think i don 't know who i swam for but the whole experience was fantastic and i still have great memories and like i 've done quite a bit of public speaking but i haven 't done it for a few years but things that i remember nothing to do with swimming but in those days they had little men going around the olympic village on little vespa motorbikes and one day this guy said i 'll hop on the back of the vespa so hopped on and he took me out of the olympic village out to the colosseum and next thing he 's coming up and say oh look i said no take me back olympic village olympic gold village you know so went back there but i had great experience and like dawn fraser and she 's still a great friend of mine and when cove at all came in like she 's the type of person she rang up and said are you all right you i can i could write a whole book about everything but you know people say oh write a book write a book no just whatever happened then in those days has carried on in my life but swimming has been a great um it 's just part of my life that 's for sure but i 'm really grateful now that i can contribute back to the community and today like we smash them up in liver uh okay thank you oh well just work hard my coach don 't tell but he was everything to me and now the thing is if you 've got a love for something it 's hard work that 's for sure but the other day um yesterday i had my neighbors come and renovate my kitchen a bit and i figured what he said to me uh i 'll forget anyway it doesn 't matter that 's the advice work hard yeah work hard okay i like it nice and simple please give a round of applause when she walks through saying who 's everest talk about being humble and i feel like plenty of people want to have a chat to you about some of the stories from rome it sounds very exciting uh but any athletes perfect um i 'm sure athletes you know if you 've got the opportunity to to speak to ruth before she does leave tonight um there would be definitely some good strong advice that i 'm sure you could get um and some wise words off her so very cool that we can have her share the clares valley sports awards with us tonight now it is time for the anytime fitness junior team of the year um for that lucy ryder and sarah langford from uh

creating a fresh fun-filled family vibe in a third grade with most teams comprising of there 's plenty of father-son combinations i 'm told so they feel that even a father-daughter combination with lance and caitlin chevalie a grandfather son and father combination in mel tim and harry and then we also the ages range from nine uh through to 74. so that is quite the the age gap but i love of wisdom that would have gone through in that team now coots defeated brothers in the grand final they chased down 144 with lance chevalli who averaged 322 for the season i have a feeling maybe he needed to go up uh upper grade scoring 40. he 's too old scoring 40 and uh and captain scotch hard 35. uh next up was the coots crossing croquet peter death and wayne gutky teamed up to win the new south wales ricochet title coots crossing croquet 's club 's first ever state champions and the grafton opens men 's hockey side grafton achieved their best result in the new south wales men 's hockey championship since 2013 so they finished fifth in div one brushing aside northwest sydney sixth one in the play-off for fifth spot brendan purser captained the side um fielding 52-year-old legend robbie green who was part of grafton 's 2009 triumph and uh it was the grafton 's youngest ever side um evidenced by the fact six players were selected in a new south wales under 21s team so um nathan sinner rhys cooper tyler gaddies jake eli faye was grafton 's leading goal scorer with four for the tournament which is really really great and we 've got lawrence first grade cricket they won their

ensbig doug harris ben hill luke manny ben shaw and andrew davison converged for a reunion of sorts joining existing players nathan anderson and jared ensby simon harrison and luke maloney um they put

the final series was washed out the team also reached the crca t20 night cricket grand final uh to kaby copenhurst premier league cricket now they ended a frustrating run of outs by winning the clarence river cricket association premier league title since their last title it was back in 2012 2013 so that was uh a drought broken they who was captain in the 2012-13 he turned back the clock with 61 not out in the semi-final and guided his side to a six wicket victory with 53 runs in the big dance against brothers and the win was set up by opening bowler bradshaw who took five for 38 off 16.1 overs as dekalbia restricted brothers to a mediocre title of just over 100 on 102. uh the yamba men 's bowls grade 3 pennants now they were crowned zone 1 champions in 21 but missed out on vying for a state title after the finals in september were cancelled due to covert their plus 84 differential was the best across all six grades in the zone one finals at least but not uh last but not least again but women 's soccer side they were the newly formed yammer breakers women 's side they finished the regular season of the north coast football 's women 's second division as undefeated with eight wins and four draws 26 goals for four an unbelievable effort for a side in its first year of the competition so with that being yes there we are perfect all right lucy do you want to read out

nominees now um lynne rudder will present these medals i 'll get linda come up the front and the next three nominees is harriet woodrow for sailing so she is the current big river sailing senior champion and also the original secretary of the clarence valley sports awards it was lynn who replaced uh harriet as she stepped down she rarely got to come to the opportunity because of all the um the competitions that were on big river sailing club 's regatta was generally on at this time in november but now you get to sit back and sort of enjoy the ride um it 's great to have you here and whilst you come up to stage i 'll ask you a quick q a hello thank you who would love nothing more would you hurry harry how long have you been starting for him why don 't you talk so much um i started dinghy sailing when my daughter started sailing in the year 2000 um previously to that i 'd done any competitive thingy sailing yeah so it 's a um later in life slightly later in life um okay is it is there adrenaline pumping like when you 're going out in the ways it 's so unpredictable today it was honking 20 plus knots yes and there was a lot of swimming going on for anybody who hasn 't tried sailing what would you say to them oh give it a go yeah um dingy sailing a lot of people think oh you know sit back on the deck of a yacht and sip champagne dinghy sailing is nothing like that um if you ever watch any of the olympic sailing or um the 16 or the 18-foot skiffs on sydney harbour that 's the sort of pathway to that kind of thing um yeah it 's it 's exhilarating it 's energetic it 's athletic um and it 's a bit like oh probably surfing and kite boarding all those sort of things you 're really in touch with the elements that change all the time so it 's unpredictable um no two days sailing are ever keeping you fit harriet looking great i love it harriet woodrow there um next up we have jake cronin for cricket if jake is here please oh no he 's not here um but if there is somebody who could come up and collect his medal that would be fantastic uh he captained the clarence river representative team to the north coast premier league one day title um in their first attempt actually at that competition and also to the minor premiers and runners-up brothers he was also the competition 's leading run scorer with 376 runs averaging just under a half a ton with 47. and our third athlete is mitch christensen and i know mitch is here i 've seen him already today um now on april 18 he set a new ocean record of 25 75 seconds in the men 's 200 meter team 37 classification that in itself deserves a round of applause because he 's definitely looking at the next olympic games [Applause] now mitch 's classification wasn 't actually included in the tokyo olympics but he has his sights set on 2022.com games in busy 2021 and now you 've got a few more events you 've been speaking to me this morning this afternoon and you mentioned you currently sit tenth you need to get into the a how far are you off that time oh about point three a second so close and you 're trying not to catch covert whilst you try and qualify for these but for the for the paralympics in birmingham the comm games i should say what happens with the classification because you were explaining to me it might be a little unfair yeah it is so it goes like on the world record from like say even the handling you know like the record so i need to beat him by like running about one second or like 10 seconds and he runs 12 flat that 's true yeah i feel like you 're already cutting down your times extremely well which is great to see so basically in the commonwealth games they combine some of the classifications but at the olympic games they keep the classification separate so we need to keep our eyes peeled feeling fit and firing and ready to go aren 't you congratulations on your nomination and we will just take a short refreshment right grab a drink go to the

other people well there are a lot of people here who give a lot to their sports and most sports can 't operate unless you 've got the volunteers the people that spend hours and have been uh talking about you know all their sports and and all the time that they 've put in all the volunteers have put in and you know without those volunteers those sports don 't survive you know i mentioned there earlier of building numbers up from about 35 to 100 and something i remember a little girl who did that with squash you know but you 've got to have the volunteers to put in the time and i think every

this is our third year that we 've been one of the sponsors and uh i can certainly say that we 'll be here for a long time to come it 's a wonderful concept so thank you so i just might mention quickly some people would have been in the room for the first time some people have been here since it started so just quickly the previous winners have been roma brotherton kerry godwin terry west cheryl canaine kathy walls lynne rudder ken mourn and this year is rhonda adamson [Music] sadly rhonda can 't_''_6879.119 be here tonight so would someone please come forward to accept her award thank you hello speeches congratulations thank you do you want to say a few words okay we did have a few words left for ronda on her behalf and she was unable to make it go out to her and her family at this challenging time in the meantime the fellow decade copperheads club person inchard just took the award on her behalf but the mother of four her dedication to sport in the clarence valley dates back to when her two elder sons were playing rugby league for the south about to remember the 80s and then they were playing soccer they got involved in administration rhonda really took over in that space coaching managing roles she served as a club aid association registrar for more than 10 years she 's made a life member um and uh of the south sorry there 's just a little bit tricky to read here but she was maker club member of many clubs and the clarence river soccer association before it was then changed to the north coast football association she ran the soccer canteen at rushford park for 30 years meanwhile in the summer months she was involved with the south services club alongside bruce baxter and there was plenty going on there as well it seems to me that i didn 't know rhonda other people 's lives and i know it 's been a common theme tonight but everybody has such an impact and whether you 're a winner or you 're a runner-up you 've made a positive impact and i think that 's so important and i think that 's what sport does so it 's really beautiful to see a couple of years ago her contribution was even featured on tv coverage of the big bash in a regular segment that actually um gives acknowledgement to the hard work of volunteers behind the scenes so i wish she could be here i 'm sure we all do and i 'm sure she would too but remembering her and i guess um celebrating her she can 't be here tonight unfortunately let 's give her another round of applause i 'm sure only a couple more wards to go we do have the two e 's lions raffle so there 's about five more minutes to buy any more tickets is that correct gents uh so you can catch any of those tickets at the back and that 's the final 're while we 're going i think everybody will agree we don 't want

from lower parents sports council and their affiliated um clubs and that 's with the three representatives on the committee t ryan tim mcmahon and tracy morin settling on a winner so the ernie mueller was widely respected and known as the big poem and despite no kids of his instrumental in stirring up a little initial interest in the development of the yamba sports complex the award for leadership in administration of sport was initiated in 1993 when ernie muller passed away and no person was to receive it more than once a memorial stands at the seventh hole of the yamba golf club so i 'll get you to announce the winner the early mother award um [Music] obviously ernie he was tied up in a lot of things in the valley here he is also a very very staunch lion and i 'm a member of the lions club and we have an ernie muller award also so ernie 's well known around the area uh for what he had done thank you okay the ernie muller award the tui 's earning mother award for 2021. it 's now 2022 but it 's 21 and the outstanding achievements in sailing it 's harriet woodrow [Applause] this is somewhat embarrassing um [Music] the sailing club has been part of my life um for the last 22 years um the last 14 i 've been the commodore which is actually been a real pleasure because i 've got a wonderful committee of people that just do what they need to do when they need to do it the club 's got a terrific ethos we all just pitch in and do what we need to do when we need to do it so for me to stand here i 'm standing on the shoulders of other people and i 'd like to really acknowledge the rest of the members of the club in 2018 we lost our clubhouse and the same storm that took out the showgrounds pavilions and the bottom pub so it was a massive undertaking for us to rebuild it was completely demolished and rebuilt that was a huge effort for our club to all contribute to as well um along with the help of some local builders of which one of them is in the room thanks to the o 'keeffe um and i think there 's a little family connection there too um so yeah our club 's going from strength to strength and it 's it 's been wonderful and um yes so a little bit but anyway and to everybody else that 's contributed here tonight that 's received awards participated given to your clubs and sport generally fantastic effort everyone and thank you [Applause] congratulations all right that wraps up this evening really appreciate everybody turning out um and i would just like to lastly say a huge thank you to all the sponsors um particularly the bolo for hosting us tonight in grafton shopping world and and clarence media but we always turn up and of course the sports awards committee who are here um when i think the world sort of felt like it was caving in on all of us we 've all been through so much we 've covered and we all have our own issues but for all of you here tonight it 's amazing and i think sport brings us closer together whether you feel like you 're part of an individual or a team sport so just lastly i 'd say that sport i feel is a savior for so many of us and that 's why we 're all here and we get that chasing after a ball or um being in the elements of something like sailing um or even reaching your mac 's heart rate like like mitch does our senior sportsman of the year it brings you so much more than just a win or a loss um it 's it 's like a religion it 's a culture and it gives you purpose and that 's why sport is incredibly special so if you didn 't walk away a champion know that you 're walking away and you 're leaving a legacy better than you can here before tonight and for all of our champions congratulations because you ultimately deserve it and i hope you come back and you hopefully win another one because you 're now being the hunted so for all the runner up to leave here tonight and know that you can do one better next year um but if you aren 't an athlete you 're a coach or an administrator or a volunteer you 're still part of it and uh we can 't_''_9011.92 be here without all of you so from the bottom tonight and i hope you enjoyed it and we 'll see you next time thank you yeah folks if you uh if someone hasn 't had their photography thought can you go over to the black curtains and thank you and don 't forget to look on the walls in the future for a shopping world we 'll give you men 's photos [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh man [Music] all right [Applause] oh [Music]

    "text": "so for the past month clarence media has been covering extensively covering the clarence valley council election it 's been one hell of an election a different one from uh what we 're used to seeing joining me today is another man who 's been covering the election uh former deputy mayor of the clarence valley craig howe he was deputy mayor from 2010 or most of the period from 2010 to 2016 and when he caught wind that there wasn 't a lot of meet the candidates happening he decided to start a facebook page clarence valley meet the candidates um that was before we announced that we we did hold up meet the candidates in grafton but um it 's it 's certainly helped to building conversation and giving the councils a voice heading into the election um so i guess craig just tell us a bit of background as to why you uh did create that page yeah well i think you 're pretty much covered it was it was something like when i 've run in in various election state election and council elections always been to get your name out there and get you get your ideas and your profile out there um and i kind of thought there 's a lot of new candidates and there 's not a lot of information and people were talking about the lack of information on facebook so i thought well why not you know it 's not hard to do you set it up and it essentially runs itself as long as people behave themselves which they sort of did yeah so yeah how was the response from uh firstly the candidates themselves and also the the social media community yeah well the candidates were pretty good i we didn 't get all of them obviously but but i did invite all of the ones that had social media i mean the way they choose to engage with with the communities up to them it 's not something that we can you know demand or expect but i think the ones that were on there i think certainly gained some some traction out of it particularly the new ones i mean a lot of them have polled but but i think it helped because they were able to get their their name and their face and their voice out there so um they were pretty accommodating and being a busy time of year for them i think they did a pretty good job of answering most of the questions we tried to trickle them at them a little bit rather than bombarding them but um you know they usually seem to have they had set times at night they 'd come on and they 'd answer four or five questions at once and then we wouldn 't see them for a week but they but they got the job done and the people on the group themselves were all pretty good the questions were all reasonably sensible you know there 's like there 's always going to be some out there once but but there 's still questions and and they still they 're still worth an airing whether whether i agree with the questions or not wasn 't really the point it was what they wanted to ask whether it was relevant to local government or ones they would answer and which ones they sort of decided not to because they were a little bit kind of not in their belly wick you know which is fair enough and i think it went quite well all up yeah all right um so the particular topics that you felt that um are particularly engaging or yes got a particular reaction um you know this time around yeah no look it flipped and changed i think transparency has been a big thing but i think that 's been a big thing for a couple of years not just coming into the election i think that was um one of the big ticket items that continued to come up regardless of what the question was ask there was a lot of things around what are you going to do to make council more accountable to the people and more transparency to the people that 's standard for i think the way people think about government in general now um interestingly rates i asked the rates question didn 't the council 's the candidates answered it but didn 't get probably passed that 's that 's locked in now yeah the srv thing 's over and no one has any any mind or intention to bring that back up again so i think that didn 't really come into the election sales it was really more about getting to know the candidates i think and the environment obviously was given that only four of the existing candlelight stood for re-election a lot of new faces yeah heaps of new faces and like i said the environmental stuff was was fairly large it was probably the biggest in terms of number of questions um i guess there was a few that i didn 't didn 't put through to the page because they were the same as questions that were asked previously but they kept repeating so that showed that people were interested in you know not necessarily um well not developing they just want to know how no mining and things like that yeah no mining was big it was also about da processes and how are you going to guarantee that the da 's not don 't happen but so they 're pretty sensible questions um and i think they 're well answered by the candidates as well and they were pretty honest about it too i think i guess on the transparency thing there is a well yeah of the candidates look like they 're going to be on i guess you 've got tiley day smith and clancy from just from the top of my head that all really would be suggesting reform that 's a pretty big word to throw at a council um do you think there 's any chance of a major shake-up happening it depends what what what they mean by reform really bill i mean they say reform a lot and i 've heard reform a lot but i haven 't had anyone say what reform they actually need i mean some say there 's a reform needed within the within the staff of council councils don 't have a lot of control over that you know they can control the general who 's the general manager and obviously they 'll need to employ one at some point the next three years in for two and a half two and a half is it yeah so it 's not a very long time so i 'm assuming they well i 'll have to do it they can 't have an acting general manager for two years i wouldn 't think but they might i don 't know but that 's really you know in terms of reform of that the other things they can do around staff is only create policy you know change existing policy change how we how the staff interact with with ratepayers from a policy perspective um but they can 't actually direct stuff what to do so and that that becomes a general manager 's job to then enforce that um but i 'm not sure what other what other reform i 'm waiting to hear it 'll be interesting to see what reform i mean there probably is something needed um but what it is and what form it takes that 'll that 'll be interesting i mean greg 's probably along the lines of more along the environment i 'd suggest um being the the platform and he 's never shied away from that i think he gets a fair bit of respect for me and a lot of people whether you agree with with some of his philosophies or not at least he 's standing up and saying this is what i am and this is what i stand for and this is what i want to do and that 's pretty impressive um so yeah the reform interesting from from those guys because ian 's obviously been away for a while so i think his experience is fantastic but i still think he 's going to have a little bit of homework to do to find out what reform is necessary unless he 's going to take someone else 's word for it i don 't think anyone 's that kind of guy i think he 'll do his own research all right i guess talking about those two clancy entirely obviously entirely there 's been no secret there that he 'd like to come in and become the man um clancy has publicly said he 'd like to be deputy um and that from the existing candidates it possibly has that support as well um yeah it 's hard to tell i guess you know the the mayoral election 's a funny thing i mean i 'm a supporter of a popularly elected man myself and i guess one of the reasons for that is because i 've been through the rgb and the politicking that goes on behind the scenes in the mural race when when there is actually a merrell race i 'm not sure the greg has because i don 't think there was too much of a mayoral race in the last five and a half years um but there will be this time i was look it looks like it all depends who puts the hand up but yeah he 's certainly got the runs on the board as any experience um and looking at greg 's how to vote card i suggest he 'll probably be the one who 's running not with with them because you don 't do that but but they 're sort of the mayor deputy mayor ticket if you want to greg 's had a vote card only had steve pickering at two then then it had an entirely bill day so that i think tells a bit of a story um then i guess it depends who else puts their hand up now deb novak 's been very non-committal about whether she 's going to going to do it or not i think she might be waiting to see where the tea leaves for um karen thompson said she 'll run but i 'm not sure that you know the way she polled will help her very much in the council chambers in the mayoral election she 'll say that the numbers don 't matter and you know what they don 't um that 'll be interesting they 'll be yeah i 'd say probably right now he 'd have to be the favorite and and if he gets across the line i 'd suggest greg will probably be the favorite for deputy mayor but you know i think um jeff smith 's talking about putting his hand up for deputy man now after he 's piling which is an a that 's a big call for a rookie particularly if the mayor happens to get sick or something he 'll be right in the deep end i interviewed jeff yesterday and he didn 't mention it but i guess i heard a bit of i haven 't_''_490.96 asked him but i have heard from from other media outlets i guess that that he has mentioned that but he might be just thinking about it too and testing the waters i think that 'd be a big call for a new guy but he 's told very well so hold extremely well yeah to you know obviously recognition goes a long way as well yeah it does it does and and but that where we live doesn 't doesn 't transfer to a merrell vote or a deputy will vote and i think he 's obviously picked up there was richie 's vote had to go somewhere and the question was whether it was going to get spread out or whether it was going to plonk itself and it looks like it 's not all of it rich 's that allison waits and peter johnson have perhaps taken some of ritchie 's voting they 've definitely shared in some of that i 'd suggest allison 's probably picked up some of the national party vote i mean she 's made made known she 's running as independent but she 's made no secret the fact that she 's a member of the national party and and and i guess on peter 's defense there he has run a very solo independent camera 100 yeah and then look he made i actually had a speed talk with him before the election and he was quite honest with me he said he said before before we you know go any further i want to tell you i mean the national party was up front but i think he 's a very very how can i put it maybe a moderate member of the national party i think pete is more about academics um and numbers and and and analytics rather than politics and i think he 'd be he 's going to be fantastic good to have someone like that on cancer statistics he 'd be your go-to if you 're a counselor you 'd be listening to what he 's got to say i think yeah and so speaking of the polling and the makeup of council it looks like it 's tom 's is probably in at this stage and it 's a a bit of a race between ellum and peter ellen being one the existing councils and the new guy from almara steve pickering yeah yeah maybe again i guess the unknown is because there was so few how to vote cards and the big vote was was in grafton i 'm not sure the karen 's 100 there yet um it just depends where those preferences go i mean if they lean on ash gibbons she could get him yeah you know because there 's a lot of votes there to give out do you want to just explain i 'll just give a rundown quickly um so that when i just look before our meet up today the progressive quota at the moment is 2 900 which is what you would need to be automatically on four the only two above that but tyler clancy waits johnston day i suppose looking quite comfortable yep um and then tom 's one five seven nine pickering one four four five lm one four one seven and gibbons as you say a little bit behind there one one two one um do you want to just give a quick explanation of of how the preference system works is there such a thing as an explanation of how the preference system works look basically basically once someone gets their quota whatever votes are left they then distribute pr the preferences from there so so from that jeff 's got a lot of votes to give so is it all of jeff 's five five seven no no no the ones the ones that get counted to get him across the line don 't get counted so it 's okay some preferences account in some ways especially when there 's no how to vote card i mean how to vote cards obviously are only a guide for people but people who really want to vote for somebody usually follow them um card in your number two then you usually pick up a lot of those i mean i 'll make those secrets back in my first term in particular i picked up a lot of richie 's yeah um two votes because i was on his out of ocada too and then that got me on council the first so on a federal level and things like that we see the bottom the bottom person will will go out and their preferences yeah that happen that happens too yeah that happens here too but there 's not a lot i mean if you have a look at the numbers there 's not a lot of votes to distribute there so i don 't know that they 'll they could make the difference because it 's very close there at the bottom particularly between um peter and steve um so do they go top one then bottom one then next top one yeah good question i 'm not 100 sure on that i 'm pr i 'm fine peter johnson knows peter johnson 's done a really good if you 're interested a really good um facebook page yeah and it 's and then the video is still there for people to watch but i 'm fairly confident what they what they do though is they 'll allocate the preferences from the top first and once they exhaust then they start dropping people out yeah and then and move them up and that 's from memory because when i when i did have to look at it look at it when i was running but the big ones are going to come from top and i think for pickering it 'll depend when clancy gets his quota you know if he gets it right at the end or if he doesn 't get he doesn 't quite get there then then pickering won 't get much advantage out of his two spot yeah um jeff had no one no one except himself at one then he just said number whoever you want so and i think deb was the same so they 're the ones that are the unknowns they could absolutely go anywhere on trend they probably go to peter johnson that that demographic that that steve that um jeff had i don 't know anyway they could go anywhere and if they land on ash like i said there is a possibility that karen and peter ellen could both miss out you know and because there 's a lot of votes there yeah and it wouldn 't be the first time that sort of things happen in politics it 's unlikely though i think um toms and pickering will make up the last two places that 's my that 's my tip i think i don 't think peter will pick up enough preferences out of grafton to to get him across the line but again i could 've been completely wrong okay uh so obviously yeah the work that you and i have both done in our separate um platforms has helped a lot of people in that are connected on online um become more informed this election i 've had lots of feedback about that but evidently uh the word on the street as well for those people particularly the arm on facebook and things like that a election until election day yeah you know a lot of informals because people just oh i 've got to vote i don 't know who to vote for um yeah what would you possibly put that down to i 've got my my theories yeah there 's a lot of things i think and that that happened in both of my elections as well but not to the extent that it 's happening now i mean obviously the fact that we don 't have a daily newspaper anymore and and and that really does affect particularly obviously the upper river more so possibly than the lower river but definitely up here grafton and a lot of the outlying areas um whilst the weekly papers are doing a pretty good job it 's not the same because you 're not getting the flood of information you 're certainly not getting the quantity of information that you get in a weekly so i think that 's probably a big factor because that people are used to the examiner telling them where to go and where to look yeah and now that doesn and where to look and i think there was a lot of people from out of town from smaller places like dundaraban and embroider that just said we 've got no one come to visit us nobody saw us none of the candidates come to look at us we have no idea who they are yeah and you 're right if they weren 't on social media essentially they were making things up as they went and they probably voted for the ones they knew truth be told that probably is an advantage for the for the incumbents i 'd suggest unless they really didn 't like them so it 'd be interesting to see when it 's all done and dusted how many like you know what the deficit was between the number of registered voters and the number of people actually voted absolutely yeah i think the informal vote 's about seven point two percent now i think last election was about six percent but the number of people that didn 't even even walk into vote yeah and look looking at the numbers now it looks like you look at how many votes have been counted i 'm trying to think from memory but it was wasn 't even 30 000. i think there 's 38 000 registered voters so it 's going to be a big number and that 's a bit of a worry um particularly for the people who didn 't know and missed out who maybe wanted to vote but how do you how do you fix that that 's the question i guess and we live in a time where a lot of people are very um you know jaded by politics et cetera yeah but i think we 've been you know we 're fortunate that this a lot of candidates for those that are aware of who they are really probably a bit of a refreshing bunch um you know a lot of people with with the right attitude moving forward yeah community and things like that you think that we you know we 're in pretty good hands well it certainly seems that way that the from the answers that i saw online on facebook and and also you seem like their heart 's in the right place and their intent is the community regardless of whether a member of a party or not um and you know what every the whole time i was on council i never had an issue with party members voting party lines i don 't think here in the clarence valley that 's an issue it might be in the cities but it 's not really here yet and i hope it stays that way but no i think you 're right bill i think there 's it 's really diverse and a bunch of people but they seem like they 're fairly willing and wanting to get on with each other and work well together so hopefully hopefully it 'll happen i mean i guess the first test will be the mayoral vote um but look there 's always going to be disagreement what it comes down to is how they handle that yeah you know i mean i used to look at it as the same as the game of footy you know you win some you lose someone once the yeah yeah you walk away and that 's that 's the nature of the beast um hopefully the nine of them can do that and just put a defeat in their pocket and come back two months try again and yeah you know win everything you know i mean greg shaney can do that he 's he 's taken quite a few on the chin this term and and he still keeps coming back and he and he 's still fairly pleasant to pretty much everybody so that 's the type of person that we need i think on cancel yeah good okay um all right well thanks for joining us craig it 's been a pleasure having a chat with you about uh dissecting this plants valley council election uh only what the 20th um 12 more days we 'll we 'll have a definite result it takes a long time to count preferences obviously it 'd be nice to have it before that but that 's that 's that 's the time they 're working on so and uh good job um you know on behalf of the to to um you know to spread the word about the council election and yeah thanks people well i find interesting myself that 's good all right _"

    "text": "well welcome back to clarence media jeff smith you were the first of our candidates on the candidate q a and now the first council of threw into council stopping the vote yeah yeah exactly uh who 'd have thought that uh i don 't know where did all those votes come from um interesting interesting times tell you one thing i 'm getting all these people uh wanting to be my facebook friend all of a sudden but people that used to cross the road to avoid me and i 'm getting these invites into all these events these exclusive events so i don 't know what 's going on but no it 's great and it 's been uh i 'm overwhelmed i was quietly confident i 'd get in there somewhere with nothing in the nine but to be leading and and so far out it 's been uh it 's been overwhelming really yeah i 've got to say it must mean that people really like ice cream well something something like that i think it 's just though many people were looking for a name and 12 years in business you know you 've got to do it right and you 've got you 've got to be trustworthy and you 've got to be accountable otherwise you 're not going be in business and people see that and the other thing and someone raised it the other day they said maybe there 's a lot of young people who have known you through the shop who are now 18 19 20 year old voters so maybe there 's a subset of those young people that are voting for me i don 't know uh i guess there 's some stats on it somewhere yeah the impression i 've gotten is there are a lot of people out there that didn 't really know much about the election yeah and didn 't know many of the names on the ballot paper and you 're one of the names they do now exactly exactly familiarity and we spent 12 months you know campaigning really because of all the delays to announce yeah yeah that 's uh nearly two years ago so it 's been a long the streets beaming little face yeah it 's been quite the garden ornament i 've got to now go and collect them all so that 's a bit of a task as well and has been how 's the reaction been from your immediate family and friends yeah yeah oh yeah a lot of congratulations and uh oh yeah we knew you 'd do well we knew you 'd do well and i think rob and my wife is is absolutely relieved that the thing 's over and now we could look at some fresh ideas and a bit of a change and it won 't be so uh um or well it 'll be all consuming but in a different way yeah well i guess you know the accounts not complete there 's still probably two or three councils that are not certain of their fate you must be relieved that you can now mentally prepare yeah for life as a counselor exactly exactly yeah um yeah there 's no sweat uh failing me dying or killing someone i 'm in so all good yeah looking forward to it got a fair idea of how that uh the makeup of council will look like how do you see you where you fit into that you know yeah yeah look it 's a good contrast actually the way it 's forming up you 've got uh three or four of the past counselors who will get in um great they can there 's a bit of continuity there you 've got two that have really returned who have been in council and returned to graft uh to the clarence valley i mean and and they 've done it because they 've seen what 's been going on and have been motivated by that so they 're pretty much in and then you 've got three or four absolute newbies who can bring some fresh ideas and a totally different perspective um in it as well so there 's there 's um yeah new fresh stuff for you as well as people who have been there done it i think it 's a nice combination yeah i i of the brand new ones it looks like allison waits peter johnson also certainly yeah and possibly steve pickering steve pickering here what do you think of those three yeah yeah yeah they 're uh they 're great to deal with and work with i 've got to know them a lot better through the uh through the meet the candidates i knew steve a little bit we had some meetings and stuff to do with art and jacaranda and that and um and and allison and and peter through the shop so yeah but we got to allow them better and and a good combination too you know you 've got art gallery um real estate agent school teacher ice cream man you know so a broad spectrum of them a fairly good cross section exactly exactly okay um and everyone knows how work hard you do work here at ice cream you 're obviously not going to be able to vote the same amount of hours look look it 's part of our escape plan from the shop we 've been at this for 12 years it 's you know it 's great and it makes money but we were only already knew something was going on and we said look we 'd love to uh to hand this on to our staff that would be the ultimate for me because they understand the culture they understand you know the shop uh if they don 't want to go ahead with it there 's some other ideas maybe we sell part of it maybe we do some sort of management thing i don 't know franchise or something anyway there 's a few different options we can use and there 's different components to it as well there 's mobiles there 's manufacturing and there 's the shop itself so um our plan is have something finalized by about june 30. so okay we 'll see what happens yep and uh so two and a half year term coming up um once you get you know hit the road running with that first meeting early next year one of the what this may be three main objectives that do you have to do first off for sure for sure well yeah one of the first things is to pick your uh been phone calls there 's already i think uh the entirely angry clans who have indicated they would like a bit of a stint as the top roosters so we 'll see if someone else puts up their hand that 'll be interesting so that 's number one get some guidance there uh i think longer term we need to look at the general manager uh the acting general manager laura black 's there but that needs a total review as well as that i 'd like to see a little bit more well a lot more really devotion to the basics right we 've got our we 've got our new council building we 've got our art galleries our super depots we 've done all that let 's let 's move aside let 's get back to basics fixing up roads uh sewers gardens cleaning streets you know that 's the boring stuff so a little bit more focus on that and it 's interesting i 've listened to the lismore mayor who 's just got in and he got in on exactly the same ticket so interesting sharing some more time with me jeff yeah it or counselor counselor smith i like the sound of that and good luck in your first term well thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "hi everyone welcome to clarence media i 'm lea and i 'm here today with justin and joanna from clarence valley council and i 'm here today to talk to them about a great new initiative that 's just started in grafton called load local love so i 'll leave them to explain a little bit more about the load local love gift cards awesome thanks leah thanks for uh welcoming us along yeah i 'm justin putz i 'm the manager of culture community and industry with the clarence valley council and we 're really excited to be launching the load local love gift cards which is a initiative that has been pulled together by the team in the industry engagement and our tourism team which is joanne is a key part of and she 's been the the lead uh orchestrator of bringing the initiative together and it 's really exciting it 's um i guess the load local love card itself is uh here we are here is a debit card where you can give it as a gift especially at christmas time where can load anything it in the clarence valley community so and i guess that 's the key aspect that the council is trying to support is supporting the local businesses within the community so you load the money on your card you give it as a gift and then all that money that you 've loaded onto the card comes back into the community and promotes the economy in the clarence valley so how many how many local businesses are there that have signed up where you can spend your card so uh this year we 've got 120 businesses so we yeah it 's fantastic uptake we we sit 120 uh we thought that would be um reasonably ambitious but the uptake from the local businesses was huge so we 're 100 uh sold to our local businesses so we 'll see how it goes uh the indications from business at the moment is there is more um interest and there 's a desire to have more businesses come on board next year so that 's going to be quite exciting so yeah and um do you know what type of businesses have signed up i 'll hand the mike over to joanna she knows all about that thank you justin um we have a great mix of businesses to um to be honest we which which is what we wanted we have the sector of activities tours we have retailers as well as food and beverage outlets beauty salons pubs everyone across the board that basically has had significant loss during the covert times which is what this project is all about to support the businesses that have had loss so really anybody who receives a card should be able to find somewhere that they 'd like to spend their money definitely i mean with 120 businesses you 'll be end up scrolling through and you have many options that 's for sure yeah and i guess the important question where can people get the cards to to give to people yes yep yep good question so the easiest way you jump on the uh my clarence valley website where we have all the businesses uh listed where you can browse to get the actual cards to put money on you where you can purchase a card or on the clarence valley council website and you can also if you prefer walk into the store we have all our new local news agencies as load up stores as well as the grafton gallery where you can go get a cart and and put money on it yep so there 's places downriver as well that that applies it applies in mclean and yamber and that as well not just in grafton and south grafton yes absolutely it 's all of the clarence valley and what we made sure of is that we 've been everywhere to sign our businesses in a variety of uh locations so from woolai you know all the way mini everywhere all the way back up here and all the way up to yamba as well and i luca yeah no it sounds like a great idea to help the the local businesses um i guess one thought that i had was in the lead-up to christmas people often will buy gift cards either for family and friends or um to give to people in in need great opportunity to buy gift cards that rather than going with the big guys for your gift card buy gift cards that will people will appreciate but will also help the local community um i think it 's a great idea in terms of helping local businesses the small ones as well yeah absolutely and the key to promoting our economy uh in the clarence is jumping behind this this initiative they are a fantastic way to acknowledge staff who have done a great job if you 're a business and you want to give them something uh as a as a christmas reward yeah a loaded local love card is a great gift and you can load it up with whatever amount that you want it you want to give so the greatest christmas presents birthday presents thank you presents you name it um you can use it and it puts that that hard earned money back into the clarence valley uh and it promotes the the businesses here uh who have been doing it tough supporting the community over the last sort of 18 months with well even bushfires this time two years ago there were bushfires yeah so i popped into the news agent yesterday and picked some up and i might just get you to hold my microphone so i can show these cards they 've got cardboard um gift i don 't even i 'm having a blank on the word hangers so that you can give your card looking like a gift and i 'll just show some of the examples so um we 've got um merry christmas uh another merry christmas shop local gift card gift card um there is a happy birthday as well um and i understand there are some local themed cards coming sorry yes absolutely there will be um it 's just been um a bit delayed on the printer but it 's on its way i 'm expecting the delivery any day now and um it will be um the same design as on the cart so i 'll be the um the my clarence valley one basically shop clarence um branded ones yeah okay great um is there anything else that we need to tell people it 's loaded up you can use it in multiple stores so say you put it you put a hundred dollars on a card you spend fifty dollars at the cafe and then fifty dollars at the beautician that 's that 's easy enough that the charge for the card itself is is integrated in the purchase of the case okay so when you put when you want to give a gift card for twenty dollars it costs you twenty dollars it doesn 't cost you twenty dollars plus a five dollar processing fee it 's just yep that 's great and also to add on that um you can jump online and track the activity of your cart and also once it 's loaded on you 'll see your opening balance and then you can see how much one you have left by jumping on online you put in your card number and your pin and you can track of how much money you have left on your card that 's good because there 's nothing worse than getting to the checkout and going oh there 's not enough okay wonderful well thank you for your time and um have a merry christmas yeah likewise thank you very much for uh inviting us along it 's been great thank you _"

busy schedules to join us this evening we haven 't had an incredible response with 14 of the 16 candidates here with us dr ian tyley the candidate who boasts by far the most experienced in local government of the candidates sends his apologies he has quite a valid excuse uh he 's in armadale in the midst of his final week as mayor of armadale regional council meanwhile jeff fuller is a late apology due to work commitments but here with us starting from over on this side we have grafton podiatrist don scott palmer 's channel resident and former mclean shire councillor bill day our youngest candidate grafton 's ash gibbons current councillor and former daily examiner editor yambas peter ellum owner of ice cream in grafton and former allison waits current councillor of the greens coots crossings greg count clancy uh the to my left the longest serving of the current councillors seeking re-election karen toms south grafton maths teacher peter johnston cold stream gallery owner in almara steve pickering current councillor and organiser of the grafton twilight markets which are on here this evening yammers deborah novak former grafton chamber of commerce president phil belletti well-traveled mclean resident warren lang and maclean designer peter hansen thank you all for your decisions to seek election to represent your community while it is no doubt a fulfilling experience it is also no doubt a terribly challenging one and sometimes thankless and would certainly not have been a decision any of you would have taken lightly before we get started i will call on a man who needs no introduction but for a change he 's going to get one clarence river cricket association grafton district services club third grade major premiere kutz crossing gloveman and much to my ir 202021 wig keeper of the year for coots crossing and of course he 's one of the five outgoing councillors the longest-serving mayor and one of the longest-serving councillors of clarence valley council i thought it would be appropriate to invite council williamson to share some advice to the new candidates on what to expect and how he thinks things should be should be going forward taken forward our guests here have got some living up to do richie during his eight-year tenure as mayor he helped instigate the mayor 's 11 versus president 's 11 cricket match at ella mobile which we never lost and i 'd love to see that reinstated which we never lost so padding up for coots again this year mate uh yeah i will be bill i sure will if we ever get a start that is yeah well i didn 't see you there at the trial game on saturday look trials probably not my thing we 've been you 've been part of clarence council clarence valley council since around the time of amalgamation yeah ian tyler was your mayor at one stage what was the highlight for you um i don 't know if you could actually put a single highlight of achievements that the current council and the former councils have been working to achieve and that 's long-term sustainability and i think we 're all but there were a you know it 's a photo finish and i hope the next term of council uh will get there and i think they will uh it has not been easy uh for example my colleagues uh whom uh served on the council will recall the big issue at the last election was a special rate variation and uh there were not too many meet the candidate evenings that weren 't absolutely chock-a-block so it 's a bit different this year and i guess covet 's got a lot to do with that but i think that 's you know one of the long-term i guess goals that this council has almost achieved it really is a photo finish honestly and uh the next council i 'm sure will be able to achieve that i think uh the infrastructure that former councils have been able to deliver for our community and that 's always uh a big ticket item for the for them always and i think that 's been something that 's been a real highlight if i could highlight a few of them i guess the the new grafton library uh the upgrade to the mclean waterfront uh we 'll soon see the grafton waterfront precinct plan come to fruition and i guess more recently the long-term water supply than embroider system i guess is something that this council should be very proud of because it hasn 't uh it hasn 't been easy not cheap i have to say it 's been a long process uh the last term a five and a half year marathon through through drought fires storms flood covered and lockdowns i don 't envy you guys right now are you glad it 's over uh no yes and no uh what you 've just mentioned there i think is when local government shines the best frankly in times of crisis and in times of natural disaster and we did see the worst natural disaster we 've ever seen in those bush fires they were just absolutely terrible and i have to say uh i think clarence valley council did really look after its residents and ratepayers the best of any council uh that was affected by uh those fires so i think in terms of uh natural disasters i think that 's when local government shines the best and the longest frankly i think they you know they do a good job there 's a lot of really responsible uh officers of council that you know go over and above to serve and protect their community in those kinds of situations right uh so the next term it 's only a two and a half year term coming up so what does the new council need to do in that time oh look that 's going to be a matter for the new council i mean they 'll they 'll set their priorities as a group they 'll work through the community strategic plan and that 's the document that will guide the council for the two and a bit years that they 're there and i 'm sure there 'll be changes uh there 's absolutely no doubt there 'll be a what the group by resolution decide is the best for them so look i i just um i just hope that they continue on the long-term financial sustainability of of clarence valley council um look we 're not we 're not and i believe that this council 's not handing the new council a hospital pass uh they 've you know they 've done the hard yards and it wasn 't easy i 'm sure my colleagues who are standing for re-election uh will cast their mind back to the first couple of meetings after the election it was tough going you know it really was but collectively uh they came to a decision to move forward and since then i think the hard yards have really been done we don 't want to be like uh other councils that are you know at least more city councils you know not the best shape armadale city council is under an improvement order by the uh the government they 've got a financial controller in place i mean we don 't we don 't want that we don 't want that candidates here who have not previously been elected members of local government two uh seeking re to re-enter a familiar environment in a very evolved era uh what 's your advice to those people um i think well my advice is and i think you hit a nail on the head uh with all the due respect uh it is it is a different world for local government now to what it was previously but i 'm sure those two candidates seeking to be re-elected will have no trouble in adapting so if they 're elected i 'd i wish them both all the best the biggest challenge as as an elected member i think anyway is is a balance balancing a community want or expectation versus a an organisation that may not be even lawfully able to do what the community expect them to do getting that balance is difficult it is frustrating at times but when you do find the balance it 's extremely rewarding okay and uh to the four current councillors seeking re-election uh peter ellum karen toms greg clancy and deborah novak anything for those they have nothing but my respect they have nothing but my well wishes for the upcoming election uh and if i you know if i would cast our minds back to those first probably six meetings of this term they they you know i don 't want to talk on behalf of anyone else but they were pretty rough uh you know there was some they were rough and tumble there was you know the landing gear was down and we 're coming in for a crash and burn there for for a little bit but we um look we we all got around the table we worked i think collectively as a team not everyone always gets what everyone personally wants if you can find a give and take situation as as we did in those very very early meetings um you know the rest should follow all right and uh finally while i 've got you in the hot seat don 't worry i 've saved the tough questions for for everyone else here in this room but your father was the last mayor of pristine watershire yeah 's next for richard williamson any truth to the the to the tilt at the national seat of clarence or or even the feds in a couple of months time no definitely not defense in a couple of months time i think kevin hogan uh well kevin 's already pre-selected so he 'll he 'll definitely be the nationals candidate for whenever the state election is uh federal uh other federal election of eager pardon uh look there 's a local government election there 's a federal election um if if chris reed contests the seat i won 't be um but if he doesn 't um it 's something that 's always interests me and i probably will ever go but you know that that 's a matter for chris and i i haven 't had a discussion with him about what his future might might hold he could very well stand again if he does you 'll have my support and and well wishes okay all right well thanks very much for your time richie and all the best for the future mate thanks bill and good luck it 's a challenge but i 'm sure you 'll you 'll enjoy your short term you 're welcome on clarendon and on behalf of thank you richie and uh on behalf of the clarence valley community i 'd just like to say thank you to all the departing councillors for their time serving our community mayor jim simmons deputy mayor jason kingsley councillor williamson councillor andrew baker and councillor arthur leicester and councillor baker sends his apologies tonight so now let 's get into the candidates q a live forum and find out who 's going to win your vote uh a show of hands um for a show of hands to the live audience who knows they 're voting for so hopefully uh hopefully tonight 's forum will get you closer to that decision we 'll see a few more hands raised at the end of the night as we alluded to earlier only four of the current nine councillors are standing for re-election so it will be a fresh change and the composition of that change is up to you in the lead up to this event to our website and also various community pages on social media who are very engaged in this particular election some of whom are no doubt watching tonight and some part of our live audience uh we have assembled a collection of questions that we think are going to sway the community 's vote and for our live audience there will be opportunities later in the evening to raise your questions and please i know a lot of people don 't have the internet or don 't use it very much but this live stream will still be available on our website up until election day so i really encourage you to play it back for those people and of course we 've also got the previously recorded 10 minute interviews with every single one of these candidates up on our website as well don i promise we 'll get to you and the format well we 're hoping clarence media 's candidate 's q a loyal forum will play out a little differently to the classic town hall style speech fest uh reaching those who don 't want to sift of the names on the ballot paper who they are and what they stand for all the candidates have been briefed on the structure and on the whole i think everyone well maybe a little daunted will embrace it and it should make for quite an entertaining evening i think yes we are looking for short sharp answers so first off one question will be directed at each candidate on a previously selected topic of their choice selected in random order or from these q q codes cue cards they will have the opportunity to speak for one minute and for each question up to two more candidates will be given a minute response perhaps a third if it seems necessary who speaks will be determined by me based on who raises their hands first after the candidates questions there will be some hot topics on which up to four councillors candidates will be able to speak for up to a minute each after that we 'll throw it out to our live audience who can direct candidates specifically to candidates if they wish or just have them open to a screen in front of us here which will count down the clock each time that so they 'll be able to get they 'll be able to gauge how they 're going for time i would try to give some leniency but please beware that my audio man my audio assistant jared has the power to switch off your microphone at a moment 's notice uh persistent breaches of the time limit will be taken into consideration uh when selecting candidates to speak so because we want to make it fair for everybody and i will be also monitoring how many times each candidate does speak so if it 's the same candidates over and over i might ask someone else give someone else the opportunity to the candidates please don 't see the time limit as a challenge to see how many words you can fit into a minute but rather try to remain clear and calm and i think that will be the key to winning the vote of the clarence valley residents here tonight and tuning in part of the role of our leaders are that and to the point we 're looking forward to seeing what unfolds hopefully it doesn 't descend into chaos we 'll try to keep things in order and i hope you all enjoy the show all right so the first question good one to start with bill day what does clarence valley why does clarence valley council need reform i 'm not sure is that working yep okay um thank you for calling me first um your local council is meant to be the closest form of government to local people you expect your council staff and councillors to be open to be helpful to be honest to be transparent and accountable but clarence valley council is a closed shop it 's the most secretive local council in my lifetime council senior staff refused to answer simple questions from local residents i know i 'm one that has met that brick wall council senior staff also refuse to answer simple questions from counsellors when my questions have been denied i 've tried to get a counsellor to ask those questions brick wall again residents who persevere with questions get banned staff the new south wales information and privacy commission has conducted two major investigations wrap it up if you can finish the finish finish your point into clarence valley council and release scathing reports um no local council in our history has been so con condemned uh clarence valley council is way overdue for reform okay thank you bill we didn 't uh yep so karen toms would like to respond thank you bill um and to you bill i don 't agree with you 100 there are some points in there and of course there are people like yourself who 've been treated very badly and for that i apologize to you despite it having nothing to do with me um i do feel i am a little responsible being one of the um counsellors and the governing body but it 's operational and you can 't actually direct that but in saying that our customer service staff i believe are excellent they 've fielded over 66 000 calls and they have a 98.1 service excellent service satisfaction so whilst there are some people who have been treated badly that it 's not acceptable i think you 're making it more of an issue than it is in terms of the entire uh population of this valley which is 52 000 people not everybody is disgruntled great thank you karen um anyone else want to speak on that topic okay moving on next one peter johnson how will you seek to meet the young the needs of young people of the clarence valley well hello clarence valley as many of you all know i 've been a teacher for 28 years and i 've spent a lot of time with young people and first of all i think the main thing is to listen i plan to go to every high school with the principal 's permission to speak to the young people and ask what they really do want but things i know that we should be doing we should be improving our footpaths we should be improving our cycle parts so that people can cycle safely just to and from school or cycle to and safely around the area so that 's in all of the big i 'm really excited about that i 'd like to do in january is something i 'm going to call clarence valley get active we 're coming to the end of coving and it 's now a time of hope and what i 'm planning to do is get all of the clubs and societies the sporting organizations the voluntary organizations to come together perhaps here and in mclean and invite the people of grafton mclean to come and to join up those clubs so we can get going again after kobe it 's a time of hope there 's so much more i 'd like to say but i 'm out of time thank you peter thank you for sticking to the the guidelines there uh anyone like to respond to peter yes greg clancy yeah thank you bill um just letting peter know that um i moved a nom which is a notice of motion you 'll all get to know about noms regarding cycle paths recently a few months back now and that was came from the community of cyclists who are really concerned about where the we also part of that motion was to review the um the policy on cycle paths and access so there 's already some work done there but there 's certainly space for more work if peter is on council thank you yep and steve pickering uh yeah i would just like to say it 's really important that we engage with younger people in our community one of the things i do through my my work with the coldstream gallery is we promote younger artists creativity we sponsor our art workshops and also with the lantern festival which i 'm organizing with uh events delivered in elmara we 've already engaged with our three local schools it 's really important that we we get the kids active and doing things and that 's something that i find as a something that 's really important to me and i 've been focusing on it since i moved to the clarence valley so thank you excellent and now deborah know back thank you i would like to see in the next elected term whether i 'm elected or not is our council their students who are interested in government or the three tiers of government to our council meetings whether it 's the committee or the full council meeting encourage them to participate in contributing to the community strategic plan that way we actually get it in writing what their needs are great all right well thank you we 'll move on to the next question warren lang do you think clarence clarence valley council functions efficiently and what changes need to be made within good evening council valley uh president so this uh my response is based on my own experiences uh as a resident of mclean and talking to the local people that often a good key performance indicator uh for a high turner of staff will see that the council has lost engineers planners and good environmental staff this is left with often bad decisions being supported by other bad decisions and which distorts the truth and is not transparent and they often refer to the privacy act or similar in their responses look this can be seen across most council uh departments planning and environment and in particular application is is unreasonable and it distorts the business investment alone so this needs to be an improvement in that area there it either complies or it doesn 't comply okay and that 's all i have for that okay thanks lauren yep anyone like to speak on that particular topic of council efficiency yep jeff smith look um as far as efficiencies go parts of the council work brilliantly take take for example the parks and gardens the lawn out there and the gardens are absolutely immaculate but then saying that the salt the signage and and some of the paint job it just needs help there 's there 's toilet public toilets that are cleaned very well and yet there is absolutely obscene graffiti that has left for months and months and months we 've had uh we 've had numerous uh tourists and visitors come through the area they all experience this we what we want is is uh workplace reform or almost almost empowering uh the frontline staff to to take action on some of this stuff whether it be um identifying of potholes or cleaning it just needs to be actioned and the people to be empowered and i think that comes from the top and middle management of council great thank you jeff anyone else and peter johnson again okay well i 'm a mathematician and i like data analysis and i look like looking at numbers and so efficiency is something i really would like to promote within council i think my skills will be very useful there i don 't know if there 's any of the other candidates really that have quite those same skills and so that would be a useful addition to the team but i 'd like to benchmark our council against other councils that are similar across the state to see the way the places where we 're doing very well and the places where perhaps you could be better because the wonderful thing about efficiency is if you can make efficiency savings you can make the money that you do have go further more potholes can be fixed but the same amount of money allocated so i 'd like to work on that and as a that thank you and uh peter hansen thank you i 'd like to say that graffiti is a measure of social cohesion and it would be a lie to to erase it all and present ourselves to so clean an issue i think the um the potholes are a much matter of the bigger cars we 're seeing all over the road and their bigger tyres and the bigger wallets that are running them and they need to put more in on value in return in their taxes thank you okay thank you peter all right moving on to our next question karen toms financial responsibility is something you touched on in our q a interview in yemen explain your thoughts on council 's need to be much smarter in terms of how it spends its money thank you bill and i just want to let everybody know i didn 't put forward a question but it 's interesting you chose that one from the interview i 've wasted five minutes five seconds um it is important to me fine the financial sustainability of our organization is is paramount the we can give our community like the potholes we certainly like richie williamson said earlier we 've certainly done the hard yards and we 're getting there this year we 've had an unprecedented amount of grant funding uh actually 35 of the 175 million um total income uh 62 million it 's very difficult when we get that sort of money thrown at us to actually be able to do everything that is a challenge in itself so perhaps that 's why the the basics are being let down a little um but we 're certainly on the right track and we 've got hell of a lot of money and a lot of infrastructure coming in that we will need to look after into the future which my time 's up can i go one little bit thank you which also will create um uh challenges for us as an organisation because of course when we have more infrastructure we 've already got over two billion dollars worth we have to take care of that infrastructure so there are costs whole of life costs involved there but we first elected in 2008 so i think it 's it 's a good report card okay thank you karen firstly we 'll go to peter ellum yeah thanks thank you can you hear me yeah thank you we are in pretty good financial shape we leave this term with a 2 20 21 consolidated result 19.319 million surplus um karen mentioned that we have over two billion dollars worth of net assets we 've also paid down debt by 34 million dollars in this term um so and and the the good result is buoyed up by the state and federal funding that has come our way mainly for community infrastructure but we 've actually employed or in the process of employing project managers to ensure that they 're properly scoped and well executed the new administration center came in on budget and again no external borrowings done from a strategic building reserve and internal borrowings which will be paid back all right thank you peter ash ash gibbons yeah look i just really wanted to mention that while funny and granny is a great thing for all of like be mindful that anything that we do choose to do with that money is that we have to pay for the maintenance of that as well so that 's a huge decision that the councillors have to make moving forward that the decisions that they make with what 's going on with that money is that we can actually maintain that spending at a later date to keep that infrastructure in place okay and bill dave surely no one here has forgotten the special rate variation the srv that so many candidates in 2017 promised would never happen and then voted for it as soon as they were elected they promised to spend it totally on the roads they 've certainly spent it but not on the roads they promised to find eight and a half million dollars in savings peter was talking about savings but they didn 't provide those savings to offset the srv a requirement from my part and a promise to the community but after devastating bush fires and in the middle of the greatest pandemic since the spanish flu they 've found eight million dollars i ask you to drive past that extravagant monument and also count the potholes along the way okay [Applause] a popular response from our live gallery here and just finally uh greg clancy on this point yeah thank you um just for the record um it was a difficult time 2016 we had this proposed 41 srv and and i promised not to support that because it was extreme i did promise that i would only support an srv after the first six months of my tenure and only then if i if there were no other alternatives i stuck to that promise in the process we could have shared a lot of staff but we were not able to do that without creating a lot of services being discontinued etc in fact the natural resource section suffered greatly and i think warren over there was mentioning that as well so i battled hard to try to keep the natural resource section there so if you if you don 't increase the rates at times then you have to shed staff and we could not we we shed 27 staff which i was really not happy with but i was prepared to do that rather than shed a lot more stuff okay thank you greg all right next question is for alison weitz mining in the clarence valley independent on november the third the 12 councils who responded unanimously opposed mining in the clarence catchment this week you vowed to oppose calls to ban mining on the north coast please enlighten us your position okay so good outcomes mean attracting jobs i think the clarence valley and all councillors have to make sure that we create jobs in the area as well we all know there 's got to be mines you cannot have wind solar and hydro projects without having the mines you can 't run cars you can 't have net zero without the mines um i didn 't say that i was for fully the clarence valley what i said is i would not say no to the minds without the further information from the government which means the environmental services the sorry the reports that come through i haven 't read them yet so i do as well before i make my opinion on that but it 's going to do sorry 35 million dollars a year it 's going to bring into the clarence sally for four years rejuvenation for the last year for all the issues that was caused about 90 years ago so i do believe that we do need to think about it very wisely as a council because it will bring jobs and a lot of money to the area okay and for that zero as well we do need mines thanks i 'm anticipating some responses to this one you look this way first okay greg clancy wants to speak first thank you as a foundation member of the clarence catchment alliance and an executive member it is quite clear to me that the community of the clarence do not want to see the clarence river damaged by the potential of mining which is a short-term gain as alison pointed out it 's only for a few years we have so many industries that rely on the clarence we also if if we have major spills which are happening everywhere can suffer but not only that the river is so important to our three nations our three first nations and also to the ecology of the whole area so it 's too risky yes we need to mine the clarence catchment alliance is not against mining but it has to be done in the right place we 've done the research go on the clutchman catchment clearance alliance facebook page and website and you will find all the information you need if we wait for an eis it 'll be too late it 'll get approved and we won 't really get a say in it thank you okay i 'll cross to deborah novak thank you um so for those who haven 't been paying attention for the past couple of years the clarence valley council has a resolution on its books that does not support mining so that resolution is locked in and solid with 10 000 signatures and if 10 000 signatures means nothing to you well that would be fairly concerning to me the big thing around this issue of mining is that if you bring sector in our community which is has the largest number of employees and the largest number of businesses in our valley so why would you knock out the most important assets in our valley for a very small minor part mining councils believe in zonings and they do so so that you don 't have an industrial factory put next to your house obvious reasons i don 't think it 's too much to ask the state government to zone the state and rule some areas out for mining and if you were going to do that the area that you 'd rule out would be the area that 's full of rivers the northern rivers i i we all change our attitudes there was a time when i thought there must be some areas in the clarence valley that where you could allow mining but i saw where kevin hogan the federal national party member for page has supported the ban on mining and the clarence and i think the community has said very very clearly as as established by kevin hogan they don 't want mining and i with the community and i i suggest that we ask the state government to put in areas that are zoned no minds all righty uh maybe one more response on that question steve pickering i i would like to say that i 'm opposed to mining within the clarence mineral mining within the clarence catchment for the reasons that our fishing industry our agricultural industries and our tourism industries are way too vulnerable for a mistake to happen i i don 't have a problem with mining i think we already have mining in the clarence and in fact the out of the workforce of the clarence 0.5 of our workforce is employed in the mining currently so that 's already there it may bring in money into the clearance but that money won 't stay maybe won 't stay in the clearance and when if we look at the exploration licenses that have already been announced and that are using um those have already been breached and those those mining companies have already been penalized for those breaches if they can 't stick to what the license says in future and our our future agriculture and and fishing and tourism industries are just way too valuable to jeopardize them thank you steve okay everyone 's doing really well sticking to the time limits here i 'm impressed uh next one phil what are your thoughts on medical services in the clarence valley and what needs to be done for these to be improved thanks bill okay medical services are not the responsibility of council but the reality is that we need to advocate we need to have a shared vision with the state and federal government every one of us will need a medical service at some point grafton based hospital has been promised 260 million dollars for its upgrade we are at a point where mclean um needs to be needs to have millions of dollars spent on it we need services in in in yamba we need the villagers to have their own services as well so we need to make sure that we advocate for those sort of things and that 's why we need leaders leaders that are going to stand up for the community 're only one vote and we 're only one one one person we have to have a shared vision and not be drip-fed by the federal and state governments because there 's a massive gap massive gap in in the planning so we need jobs we need to really make sure development is managed thank you very much okay thank you phil all right anyone else want to talk about medical facilities peter hansen thank you bill um i believe that such rigor in planning and as my neighbor asserts is also required in many other areas under council jurisdictional guidance such as river health i 'd suggest um community housing is another one it 's state funding federal funding it 's local initiative that 'll see these things up and running okay thank you anyone else and warren don scott good evening everyone um as a podiatrist i see medical emergencies on a daily basis the claris valley is missing out on a lot of university trained people we need a university college here in the valley we 've missed out in the past it 's now time for come down here again and set up a campus at the yoka health they have university trained students coming up from wollongong as part of the registrar group and they 're trying to educate the young doctors in the oka health centre okay thank you move on to the next question steve pickering i 'm going to say it again the unofficial mayor of almara uh why have you nominated run for council and what do you hope to achieve if you 're elected uh thanks bill um i 'm a doer i 'm not a talker i own and operate the coldstream gallery which is a premier gallery in new south wales i volunteer for the rfs the scs i 'm president of the progress association i 'm on the cultural committee and also a member of the clarence round table i brought my community together to create a plan for our area and with my leadership we have secured 3.5 million dollars in funding to make almara even more livable and sustainable into the future i fought to save the almara pool i spoke up not just for to save one of the few community facilities left in elmira i created a plan and presented it to council who still voted to close our pool to save a few thousand dollars i 've spoken to a lot of people and many of them in the valley feel ignored many of them have struggled to get information or assistance with problems from council i want to be their voice and i want to do more for my community and if elected i 'll stand up for all the residents of the valley especially the forgotten those in rural areas and our small villages i want an open transparent council where decisions are made in the open not behind closed doors i want a council to spend on goods and services and trades in the clarence valley i want to see a quarterly report to show the amount spent locally every dollar spent in our value means more jobs for our community okay thanks dave anyone like to respond to that yep peter ellen i think steve i think steve pickering would make a great counselor all right um yeah a wonderful community-minded person but one thing i 'm going to just mention that he may not be aware of if he is successful and becomes a counselor do you know steve that you won 't be welcome at the round table anymore did you know that councillors are not welcome at the round table now that 's an interesting thought isn 't it that has to change okay all right next question ash gibbons you are the youngest candidate and could be viewed as a vote for clarence valley 's young people how can you use your connectedness as a young person to help improve council 's perception in the community thanks phil look i think we are um we live in the 21st century so i think we really start need to be innovative um social media is a huge presence that a lot of young people use and it 's one avenue that i 've really used for my campaign and it 's relatively really um cheap for for council to use so that 's one way that i think you know we should really be putting and be innovative in the way that we think and the way we do things and to make things easier for our customers let 's see you know what we can digitize as much as we can um obviously that could be a bit of a concern for our elderly community and that kind of thing but if they can get online and they can go to the libraries and that kind of thing instead of them sending in um the information and then it has to get scanned we 're starting to save costs in all different ways so we just need to be innovative on the way that we 're thinking and start to um be smarter work smarter not harder all right thanks ash anyone else like to respond to that bill day um thank you ash and that 's all well and good but we should remember that there are people who aren 't computer literate there are people who seek their information not from the council website which is very very difficult to um to maneuver and um council used to spend a lot of council business was advertised on a regular basis and when the daily examiner went west and went digital um they have been absolutely opposed to advertising development applications and council material in our only well i think there 's a couple of new papers coming along but the the independent newspaper which comes out weekly and it 's free has been a desert for council information they 've just recently started to advertise a few things in it but it 's essential that council communicates with the people not just through social media but all forms of media okay thank you bill anyone else okay next don scott so just some background don was barred from mclean and yambers meet the candidates events and forced to move his podiatry practice to an all-inclusive medical center due to his vaccination status this is a question that 's come from joanne enslow who 's watching on the live stream she wants to know whether any candidates are prepared to take a stand against vaccine mandate mandates qr check-ins and other restrictions of freedom in our community so don i 'll ask you not want to see mandates for vaccines i have a medical issue but i tried to get an exemption from it and they would not allow me an exemption through the new south wales health department or my own gp we should be free covert is a thing of the past on the 15th of december everything 's going to be open and free and we should be free right now the virus does not know a date the virus does not know the weather change the virus does not exist if you look at your own i 'm very angry about this the virus is very much a non-event in my mind i have done my science and sorry millions of people allow them to answer the question not covered they have died of many things all right okay anyone else want to speak about covered um karen toms thank you um look i i am all for our community being vaccinated and the reason why it is opening up on the 15th of december is because the vaccination rates are up into the 90 now i 'm one for most of my life about 40 years rheumatoid arthritis if i got covered then i would have probably more than likely died because of the medication i 'm on that suppresses my immune system so i feel that as as a community it 's irresponsible to say it doesn 't exist when we know there are millions of people all over the world who have been buried in mass graves because of this disease so to say it doesn 't exist um and uh and ignore what 's happened in the world for going on two years close to two years i i i 'm quite surprised to hear somebody actually say that the evidence is there and we need to protect our community and if having a vaccine protects the vulnerable in our community especially the elderly and people who are sick then please have your vaccine thanks anyone else want to speak on vaccine mandates peter hansen thank you bill um yes it 's obvious an advantage to the community of as many as possible vaccinated because it reduces the overall risk of suffering a life-threatening illness who cannot have it and they 're at risk and that is their lookout i believe they do the best they can avoid company wear masks as it might be anyone else next jeff smith uh you 're a business owner in prince street in the grafton cbd what is your vision for this precinct so i was on a working committee for two two days i think it was and there 's some grand plans for prince3 as far as uh redevelopment and uh rejuvenation i 'd like it to see a big the whole that whole cbd area become a vibrant hub connected to the riverfront what what it 's starting to happen is some longer term vision which has been desperately needed rather than just sort of chucking ideas here and there but it 's now there is a coherent plan that 's now in place there 's uh we can now go to the state government for funding with something under the arm and go look he 's something awesome it 's going to link with the river it 's going to blow people 's minds parks of of grafton and with that comes uh the economic benefit of course but also the uh the the social benefits and the mental benefits of people uh out and about and reconnecting and and being part of a community once again okay anyone else want to speak on the grafton cbd uh peter ellum yes um i i know that a lot of good planning has gone into it jeff and uh if grafton wants to regain its status as a regional city which was stripped away from it and downgraded to a strategic center in 2016 by the current state government it needs to do to do that it needs to link the cbd with the riverfront upgrade it needs to strengthen the grafton airport tarmac and get stage one of the aquatic center done as well grafton should not suffer from a a cultural cringe that 's why the admin center refurbishment something that was 14 years in the in the making and and will drive greater efficiencies and local subcontractors on that project were something in the order of 95 towards the end of the for right to for grafton to regain its um mantle as a a regional city and i support all of these okay thank you peter anyone else wants me greg clancy yes um i think the the plans are very good um i personally have discussed at workshops that i 'd like to see more emphasis on restoring uh some of the local native trees that are native to susan island which you can stand on the end of prince street and look at i think that would make it more attractive for tourists to come back and not just see jacaranda 's but see what was here for thousands or millions of years and that can be a real attraction it would bring the wildlife right into town and there 's already wildlife here but there 'll be a lot more and also link up with the first nation people because the island is extremely important as a woman 's place and i want to see the the ecological aspects and the indigenous cultural aspects highlighted now i think they are to some degree but i think we could 's good to see that it is being redeveloped and i think that will be good for the tourists and for the and for the locals okay anyone else we 've got bill sorry deborah yep deborah novak thank you um i really love the idea of uh improving grafton cbd and i was just recently i was just reading last week that grafton used to be called queen city of the north along with the clarence river as the the queen river of the north as well so i thought these were really great assets to include in the cbd plan but grafton cbd um is a really exciting place as it is now and it 's just going to get a whole lot better as the person who runs the grafton twilight market i see these amazing people come out every week out of the woodwork out of the offices and from around our region to our park to market square every week and market square was a hundred years ago and 50 years ago the place where political meetings used to happen so i 'm really glad i look forward to seeing the development of the cbd and to see it grow and gather momentum into the future and into the next council all right and uh finally also bill day but um we haven 't heard from you allison so yeah go ahead thank you um i think that 's fantastic especially what 's going to be happening in the cbd of grafton let 's not forget south grafton as you know our agency is in spring street skinner street it is thriving there as well there 's a lot of businesses that are now open there we have four hairdressers and a barber in one street it 's just amazing i want to see south grafton to actually grow as well so let 's put some support into south grafton thank you okay and very quickly bill i believe crafton cbd grafton riverfront and south grafton would be much better served if council got its tourism act back together i manage the clearance i managed the clarence river tourist association for more than 20 years my team and i put tourism in the clarence valley centre at south grafton was one of our greatest achievements we won many awards at both regional and state levels what 's clarence valley council done clarence valley council sat the community board that governed the crta the council slammed the doors of the visitor information centre shut and there it stands at grafton 's front door decaying just like the service straight station across the road i want to re-open the the visitor information centre and i want to get tourism back on track in grafton and in the clarence valley okay thanks phil that is a question we will be re returning to later so you might get another opportunity to say a bit more about thoughts there um so next question and i 'll just say also probably i 'm giving a little bit of leniency to some of the existing counselors because they 're kind of responding sometimes to you know things that they already have an understanding what 's been happening so but yeah certainly some of the councils some of the candidates that we haven 't heard from yet um yeah yeah so don next we 've got greg clancy uh what are your views on ecological sustainability and is council currently uh environmentally sensible in its decision making um i 've just spent five years and three months fighting hard to try to protect the natural ecosystems of the valley often to very unsuccessfully i might add but also at times successfully it 's been a real challenge and i 'm really looking forward to if i am re-elected to working on a council that takes ecological sustainability much more seriously in saying that i think there 's a lot of good staff who are doing what they can below the surface and i commend them for that because it 's not always easy but i have been very very disappointed at the pro development attitude of at least five and maybe six of the current councillors and i 've had very little support but there 's a couple of re-nominating councillors who have supported me on a number of issues and i thank them for that but if we don 't look after the ecological sustainability of the area then everything collapses all those and the natural world and we 've got to be sensible about it thank you okay thank you greg who wants to speak on ecological sustainability phil belletti i actually agree with greg even though you know we may have some differing opinions on on the development i 'm about managed development i 'm about creating jobs for the future you know i 've seen systems created where you can you can have a balance between the two now i know it 's very difficult but we 've got to balance it out the reality is that we all moved here i moved here 16 years ago because of the environment because of the beautiful pristine environment a river that you don 't even see a boat on you know i don 't want to see that changed but i 'm also on boards where i can tell you now there are big corporates looking at um ticking all the boxes for for for investments and their regional focus okay so what i said at the previous meeting was we 've got to be careful we 've got hard and nosed about that sort of thing because they will take over and then they will just do whatever they want and they can circumnavigate councils and state governments so i agree greg all right anyone else jeff smith okay i agree totally with uh with greg that um we 've got to protect what we 've got here it 's absolutely unique this river and um and we don 't want to see a change of what i 'm sick of and i 'm not anti-development but i want to see imaginative clever development i 'm sick of seeing these developments where it 's wall-to-wall houses any stick of vegetation is removed we 've got gutters virtually touching gutters lawns backyards that are so small you 're never going to plant a tree in it let 's let 's let 's not create more of these these developments let 's do some clever stuff there 's there 's the space there there 's the if the will is with council we can have decent-sized parks we can have size size uh street areas of vegetation that uh that than continuing to create these these mass developed jammed in development matt yeah mass developed for places to abide in and to pay you know banks for the rest of your lives so let 's just do it a little bit more clever thanks all right oh yep sorry well you 're getting there karen but you could speak again you could save yourself for later yeah all right next question for peter hansen uh why do you believe uh we have turned our backs on our first highway the clarence river and what needs to be done to improve utilization of this important resource thank you bill is it now too dirty for fish this river a house and block prices flying through the roof enormous motor vehicles for personal use cows with absolute frontage a river is all but forgotten except as their view and which has its own special tree clearing option live stock grind down the banks causing serious siltation choke its logging is again increased and the river 's discoloration shows such an increase three months after floods in march of only catfish at mclean mining and its refining on site by chemical treatment and dammed residues wherein there is any support for our once famous and now nearly dead fishing industry and recreational fishing fresh is best fish is more beneficial nutritively than beef apparently fishing is an industry that employs many locally when it when the waters are wholesome many of the world 's rivers now outpouring fouled waters devoid of oxygenation consequent of algal consumption of nitrates devoid of useful nutrient known as black water anywhere the fish are all gone the jellyfish predominate barely edible jellyfish and chips anyone all right thanks peter anyone want to talk about the first highway the clarence river the mighty clarence deborah how could i talk about the clarence river the midas mighty clarence riven when i was at the yama farmers market yesterday i was talking to two lads from coffs harbour and i was explaining to them that the river as the dolphins were going by um is 400 kilometers a hundred islands and it is our bloodline and it 's what gives us everything and keeps our environment our culture our first keeps us thriving everything needs to focus on how we maintain that health how we look at it what we do on the river is all very very significant to the future of our generation the next generation so it 's really important that we look after as custodians along with our first nation people okay all right anyone else next peter ellum so you 're seeking re-election what achievements from your first term of council can you highlight to show why you deserve to continue as a clarence valley councillor thanks bill well um some of the community community wins in the first term were a notice of motion um waving all council fees for all bushfire affected residents rebuilding that 's um uninsured and insured because of the high costs of doing that roundabouts for yamba road stopped the push for traffic lights in the gateway to that tourist town james creek road and mcintyre 's lane bitumen sealed led the crackdown on illegal camping not only in yamba but coastal villages and that led to three extra ranges and in grafton i championed the grafton regional art in that cultural fund and we landed 7.6 million dollars for grafton now that 's a gallery that 'll rival any regional gallery in australia and it 's the kind of thing we need um iconic uh development like that to attract people more people here okay good thank you anyone want to respond to peter 's answer there i think this is our last one deborah novak uh one of three new count one you were one of three new councils on the previous council and i guess you most of all endured a steep and well-documented learning curve how has this made you stronger and even better prepared for the next term of council what a great question hey look it 's um it has been a steep learning curve learning about um the processes of local government and it 's not something i 've witnessed or experienced before um it has strengthened my resolve to champion our community a lot more it 's made me a um being elected council has certainly opened my eyes to how to do things better even in my own business world how i can champion the community much broader and much wider and strengthen my conversations with them to enable our community to understand the process in which council works so i feel over the past five years even though it 's been the worst five years for our community i believe in terms of all our natural disasters it 's been some of the best five years because it 's actually brought us together as a community it showed our strengths it 's showed us that we actually have a backbone as a community and and i think for a lot of those people who 've leaned into some of those hard conversations it 's shown it has shown the people outside of our region what we 're made of and that 's what i 'm really proud of working with those people in our community to you know amplify our voice okay thank you deborah greg clancy yeah thank you i think that um the nine councillors um or any that haven 't served on council before will find it quite uh an eye-opener when they take up the and um but you know bureaucratic areas and that for a long time run my own business as well but when i got on council it was like nothing i 'd ever experienced before it is rewarding i wouldn 't still be here i wouldn 't be re-nominating if it wasn 't it 's but you know the five years three months has been also quite a challenge in a lot of ways which i won 't go into now but i do think that the candidates who haven 't been on council before i 'm just saying be prepared because it 's nothing like you 've ever done before no matter what you 've done in life and things like the code of conduct can really stifle what you want to do the expectation of the community is that you as a councillor can go and fix that pothole or whatever and there 's a lot of unrealistic expectations out there but it is really rewarding and i you know hope to see some of you on the new council thank you okay all right yes warren lang look meeting with councillors after hours in regards to what was happening at the front of my place road works or proposed new works by local government in a situation when i moved to mclean there was issues with illegal clearing of vegetation i contacted the environmental defender 's office i uh sought a response from the councillors and that 's where i was going back to debra novak was the only one who responded to an email in regards to that but was all i was provided with really was an enforcement policy that the guidelines by which council should respond in which that 's been an ongoing issue because there 's some what closed the door on me is what bill day said that if you want to engage in any conversation in regards to a complaint the council just just not doesn 't sorry does not know how to engage in that conversation right it 's all about consultation and it doesn 't matter what you want to do if it 's an inquiry if it 's a complaint the shutters come down and they don 't want change right and it 's all about culture so all right it 's all about culture so okay i 'll leave it with that thank you we might be able to revisit some of that as well a little bit later on so that actually build day yes sorry more more comments here i 'd just like to congratulate the four councillors who are re-nominating at other forums you 've told us how you were bullied and disrespected in the current council i 'm not sure why you haven 't gone down that track tonight but i just hope there 's no bullying and i hope that everybody 's respected on the new council okay so i think that wraps up the initial part of the evening where we 've canvassed every one of the candidates and allowed some responses i guess before we continue i 'd just like to let you know a little bit about clarence media where the clarence valley 's new interactive news source connecting the community with local voices local faces local ideas and local news that is valued and relevant

once again thank you to our sponsors liberty south grafton liberty service station south grafton dm timber flooring yeah but tiles and a couple of questions from our live audience specifically from the south grafton progress association who have come to this event for their monthly meeting so robert robert cook is going to on behalf of south grove and progress association just asked two questions that okay yeah look this one uh we haven 't touched on it tonight but uh crime in the valley um seems to be a bit of a kept quiet situation but uh i asked the councillors that uh prime directly affects the lives of clarence valley residents so how can you make changes to keep citizens aware of the types of crime happening in their locations and provide clear feedback of what police and council plans are to put those offenders or to have those offenders apprehended okay sorry karen karen toms thank you very much for your question earlier in my term we used to have a committee called the crime safety committee and i was on that committee and so were the very high ranking police officers from the coffs clarence area you might remember mark houlihan he was the top cop then from all over the valley uh luka yamba grafton south grafton and we met alternatively from down here to the lower clarence it was more a sharing of information actually about the statistics very detailed where the crime was happening maps all sorts of crime domestic violence theft and they had a handle on where it was and also it was an opportunity for the members of that group to put forward their concerns that sadly stopped and i 'm not really sure of the reason but not long ago the councillors from this term may recall a meeting we had with the police with joanne reed and some other high-ranking senior officers came and they are planning on re because it 's not a clarence valley initiative it 's a police initiative and they are planning on reintroducing that but to be honest with you i think covert might be the reason why it hasn 't moved forward yet but hopefully it will soon okay well hands everywhere we might go down here to phil first phil belletti robert thanks for that question because um if you recall about i was president of the grafton chamber of commerce and we were able to get two hundred thousand dollars for grafton southcraft grafton we also put cameras in in omarosa so we set the businesses up in in coordination with the um the the cots command so joe reed um and dallas levin were part of our group now the council had actually put cameras in in other places as well which is which was really good to see so we 're able to coordinate some with them um and we need more we need to the the feedback we 've got is that they they have um reduced the crime a lot over the last three three or four years we would have loved to have got more money and and done the whole valley but um it 's it 's very hard to manage that and the chamber we we managed it just with our volunteer resources so we were lucky we had businesses that were able to assist so crime is is is very important and and the council to to a degree has provided funding and was not taken up but we as a business business chamber we were able to get out to all the businesses and that that seems to have worked very well okay and uh now peter ellum robert um i actually attend the richmond and tweed byron command uh quarterly meetings of the community safety consultant committee in my day job and um all of the mayors are represented there uh as are most of the chambers of commerce so i see no reason why uh clarence command can 't_''_4935.04 be reconstituted and uh i know chris galapas actually comes to the richmond command meeting in person sometimes so yeah i see no reason why that it 'd be a very valuable thing if we could uh reconstitute and the new council might might take that forward back to the uh superintendent all right and final response on this question greg clancy yeah i want to approach from a different angle i think we need to look at why there is crime i think we need to make sure the support services for people with drug and alcohol problems um and lead to crime we 've just got a massive jail built out here at uh glenugi and it 's so sad because we 're locking up so many people when we should be trying to find out why they 're creating the problems why they 're committing crimes and i know that some people need to be locked up there are some people that we just can 't risk having out in the community but i 'd like to approach it from a different angle and certainly yes we need to talk to the police and the police i believe do their best but we also do need to look at why people are committing crimes and try to assist those people that are ending up in the courts all the time i 've been over in the courthouse and seen at times and these people go in there and they in a lot of ways say their own worst enemies they need help [Applause] all right uh robert did you want to ask another question or someone robert again from the south grove and progress association uh jobs this the blood supply to every vibrant healthy and self-sufficient community if you were elected how would you contribute in a measurable way to improving job situation in grafton and in the claris valley okay deborah novak there are 4 000 registered businesses here in the clarence valley and over two and a half thousand of those businesses are a sole trader if we could organize or coordinate a clarence valley something like a business chamber to support those sole traders and imagine if those two and a half thousand sole traders employed one person there is a lot of work there and i just think that as i 'm assault trader i know how amazing it would have been if i had had support maybe 20 years ago or even 10 years ago out there helping me to grow my business but instead i had to kind of back myself and grow it myself but i work with a lot of um 70 small businesses at the moment between two farmers markets so what i 've done in my time as coordinator is actually enabling those small businesses to scale which that they can actually grow their own businesses because they cannot rely on a lot of other enterprises to support them so it 's about um creating services or something that can support these sole traders most of all because i just believe in them so much and i believe that they are the backbone of our economy and that includes the farmers in there as well thanks deborah peter hanson thank you bill i believe that we have a great availability for employment if we put ourselves to reinvigorating our river of course it will employ many i believe uh and well to their pleasure or interest and enjoyment a green call perhaps of youth who could be clothed and at some expense so they will have some decent clothes accommodated and enjoy the sense of productivity and input into the community which many value more than merely slaving for someone else for very little meaning [Laughter] okay uh first we 'll go to jeff smith yeah i 'm very pro uh small business i am a small business owner myself i employ seven uh casual staff and can help but there 's two two things now over the years council has made it a lot easier but i 'd like to see it um uh at the council make it far easier for small businesses to start and to thrive and and to cut cut away red tape as i said there 's been a lot of change but there 's more to do as well as that there 's another point that i 'd like to raise i 'd like to see a strengthening of the um councils by local policy so that they can actually seek out local providers local suppliers local service providers and and purchase goods and services from them first even if they 're slightly more expensive but rather than rather than bringing in outside you know suppliers of stuff let 's um let 's keep the demand here and keep the money here and keep it churning around within the clarence valley all right and finally uh bill day well i believe that council should look after and listen to existing business operators people like jeff people like robert make local value ad they 're if if they 're successful they 're a beacon to investors to come along and open more businesses small businesses rather than looking for a miracle new industry we 're always looking for miracles complex problems really have simple solutions but but by looking after your existing operators is a fairly simple thing to do and a new industry has to run the gauntlet of environmental issues as we 've spoken about tonight the other issue is tourism let 's get it cranking again all right okay karen quickly on that topic thank you um look it 's it 's not actually up to council to create jobs it 's up to people entrepreneurs create jobs that 's the reality yes we need to have a more enabling council i happen to know there 's a man sitting over in that in the gallery out there i 'll call it a gallery who gets extremely frustrated with counsel now here 's a build-up builders build homes we need more homes sorry for someone who said they don 't want them too small we need them on huge problem but i 've heard from many of our builders that they have they come up with brick walls and make it very difficult and when that we make it very difficult for builders to build homes it costs money it costs delays and i think i might be sort of talking about you tonight here robin gibb and i know you ring me a lot and tell me about the frustrations you have but really we need to take our hat off to the people who actually are good job creators entrepreneurs and we need to support them and many of them are financially excluded from from the banks because they don 't have the collateral so that 's where my work with grameen australia is going to make a big difference to people who are going to be able to get small loans without all the paperwork without all of that more like a trust ring a trust thing and if you read the australian yesterday there 's a great story in there about that so that is going to be coming to grafton soon watch this with us this evening your eager mate um from the south crafton progress association as well if you 'd like to ask a question go ahead i would like to know if you uh get elected to council would you vote on your own personal opinion or would you vote for the benefit of the 50 odd people in the valley the 50 odd thousand people in the valley okay yeah we 'll start with steve pickering i i would approach every decision with an open mind robin and i look at all the the evidence from all sides and if the community were going to be affected by the decision i would talk to that local community and i would make a decision based on my experience my knowledge and also the the information that i received as part of the decision-making process so i would make the best decision that was uh for the community as it as a whole okay anyone else any of the new candidates want to speak yeah ash ash gibbons yeah robin i 'd just like to answer your question that if i my beliefs my reason for electing is to act on part of the community and put their best interests first so that 's how i would answer um to your question that i wouldn 't really um base my decision on my beliefs it would be beyond what 's best for the community and allison weights yep thank you for that question um as we know that i am not a sole trader i 'm actually a company so i actually would like to employ more people here just want to make a quick comment um the government does have job maker as well which we do use that in our agency just to answer your question um i would never go in there with my own beliefs i think we all know that because i 'm one of the only ones that will stand up and fight for jobs like i said i 'm the only one that said that would like the minds here and every meet the candidates i 'm actually the one that says i need more information before i say yes or no so i what they need and what they want as well not my own beliefs thank you okay uh we 'll hear from one of the former the current councillors greg clancy yeah thank you bill yeah look certainly i i always have and always will vote in a way that reflects the good of the community i have strong views and they are supported by a percentage of the community everyone in the there 's a whole lot of different views in the community i represent the people that are concerned about the environment and concerned about small villages and and the community generally and i could you know i saw the reaction when i said that i do represent the community well i do and just because i have a different view to people who want to see this area changed bring in big industry growth brings with its problems it 's not you know this jobs and growth mantra really is a problem and i know that people may think that i bring my personal views in but i also bring my professional views in and that 's what five and a half years okay uh all right yep and um sorry peter peter johnson i think for me the most important thing is honesty integrity and being able to sleep well at night and i want to do the right thing for everybody and somebody once gave me the advice in a difficult situation just do what you think is right whatever that might cost okay and phil baleti all right well um okay you can go after bill bill day okay one of my favorite sayings councillors are butchers and bakers and candlestick makers hopefully good ones but they are elected to reflect the views of the community that 's not in isolation they should also and particularly listen to professional staff but they must be able to trust their staff and if they can 't they have to to to make changes and that 's a complex process but anything that council decides must be lawful and in fact staff do not have to carry out any resolutions of counsel that they deem to be unlawful so sometimes people think that counsellors can do any anything law and it 's usually a combination of factors listening to the staff engaging the community and then making sometimes it ends up making a personal decision on the balance rarely is it all black and all white it 's often a balance okay all right thanks bill and phil bledy i 'll make it brief um one of the other previous um meet the candidates i think jeff smith said that um um you know we we as anyone on the new council we should all go and visit every village in the valley to get a get an understanding on on what makes you tick what what ticks you off i think it 's a fantastic idea because we 're all coming from a different perspective and we really need to understand what 's what 's going on i mean we were at i 've presented to the grafton south grafton progress association we did the glenn road progress association and we 've spoken to um you know the various chambers of commerce now the reality is we need to make decisions for the whole valley and it everyone 's got that experience so we need a shared vision and that 's that 's what 's critical to me all right how 's everyone going it 's all good might get onto some more questions now the ones i like to call the hot topics all righty uh firstly though we 're here in market square you might be able to hear the xbt passing along unfortunately i don 't have any questions about trains maybe our live audience can bring them up later but firstly i 've just got a question to everybody if you just answer it very simply and briefly it 's from josephine waring who submitted it to our website uh even if candidates are not funded by any party for this election can they please state whether or not they are members of a political party i suppose we 'll start from don scott down here and work our way around yeah i 'm a loose member of the national party i 've had no support from them and i 'm just supporting myself [Laughter] i 've been a member of two parties years i bailed out i if you 've ever met eddie o 'beed you might understand why and um i joined the liberal party for a few years but i haven 't been a member of a political party since about the year 2000 i 'm a swinging voter i am running as an independent and i have no ties to any political party [Laughter] i 've been a member of the australian labor party since 2007. i work for a state labor member janelle sapp i have not sought endorsement from the ilp because i prefer to operate independently as a counselor and i don 't think anyone can actually find an example of where i 've let party politics enter into the chamber and um i am fully self-funded not do not seek donations nor receive them uh yep i 'm completely independent nor have i ever been a member of a political party and that 's a good point i don 't accept donations because it gets a bit muddy i 'm completely self-funded and a privateer yes i 'm a general member for the national party not hold any position all views of my own as a local resident and a business owner i care about the outcomes of our region first i 'm committed to working with anybody and everyone to benefit our region and push back against anyone not working the best interest for the clarence valley yes i 'm the only candidate that is supported by a political party i 'm supported by the greens i ran in 2012 as an independent everyone thought i was a green anyway so i thought well i might as well join the greens being a green is good because i 'm not tied down to having to get approval for everything i do i 'm first the councillor i 'm second degree i use the resources of the greens they have good legal advice um we we are part of a community of green councillors throughout new south wales there are over 80 councils with greens at the moment after this election that might be more and there are mayors and deputy mayors who are greens and they are showing that being green does not mean as a counselor and so i 'm proud of being a green i don 't bring party politics into the debate in council and um but i have green leanings anyway so i obviously will be arguing for the environment for the community all righty karen oh thank you okay i 'm standing as an independent and i don 't accept donations i fund my own campaign and it 's on a very weird little tiny fund but i will disclose to you tonight that i was a member of the national party in 2011 i was actually approached by steve cansdell when he fell on his sword and resigned if i would join the national party and stand for pre-selection for the seat of clarence and i gave that great consideration and decided that i would do that that it was an honour and it was just a step up from being a councillor richie williamson also stood but the results are out there and chris galaptis won the free selection and went on to win the election i stayed a member for a little while but i jumped be independent i 'm an independent thinker and i also didn 't like some of the things that i saw against women there thank you okay well i 'm a member of the national party um that said the national party doesn 't endorse candidates and local elections it 's the only party that doesn 't and i 'm completely self-funded and i 'm completely independent nobody 's told me to stand nobody 's told me not to stand so i 'm independent and i will act independently for the best of the people of the clients uh i 'm an independent i 'm fully funding my own campaign i went to a labor party meeting maybe 15 years ago and i was also a paid employee of shooters fishers farmers thank you i 'm an independent i 'm self-funded and should i disclose i when i made my debut when i was 16 i was presented to gough whitlam [Laughter] thank you i 'm a self-funded independent [Laughter] i 'm a self-funded independent [Laughter] yeah look i 'm not affiliated with any political party i am self-funded but i 'm not affiliated i have been a member of the greens for one year i do sponsor greenpeace and the wilderness society however great all right there you go and just for the record clearance media is also independent and will take donations uh okay we 'll take one more question from the audience right now from uh john haggar thanks can everybody hear me flapping around everywhere don 't call an ambulance it just happens okay on the subject of health something 's come up tonight we 've discussed the relationship between council and the community we 've discussed some of the things that council 's done the community is not so happy with okay what we haven 't really touched on is an underlying belief that seems to pervade clarence valley council that might is right and as an outlook and as a philosophy that is fundamentally flawed until that 's sorted we 're going to continue to have exactly the same problems that we 're having now back in oh when was it not long after ashley took over as gm council employed a mob called voice a staff survey these are some of the results and these were questions that were only asked to clarence valley council not the other 50 or 60 councils they 'd surveyed just here and they asked them just here because we 've had this problem for as long as there 's been clarence valley council and it 's never ever been sorted see what i mean okay okay and these are some of the answers less than half the staff said they felt safe raising grievances [Laughter] only 40 percent believe those grievances were handled a quarter of the staff said they 'd personally experienced bullying in the workplace more than half the staff said they 'd witness bullying in the previous year that radiates out in the way that council deals with local people and then it 's merit back again so john what 's your question for the candidates [Laughter] okay the question i had was if you 're elected would you support a full review of council structure with an increased emphasis on building bridges between council and the community [Laughter] while simultaneously producing promoting healthier work it 's an essential that underlies this entire valley and if we want to have a healthy valley that bridge has to be mended on all sides thank you for your time thank you john [Applause] firstly we 'll hear from karen thompson thank you john and thank you for coming out tonight because i know you haven 't been well today look do you know what those statistics you 've just shared with us it 's the first time i as a governing body a counsellor have heard those statistics and that 's shameful and but i know that you have people who share things with you and i 'm actually okay with that because i think people who are being bullied and mistreated need to do those sorts of things it 's not acceptable i personally have felt bullied myself in the chamber and i know there are others here that have felt bullied so back to your question it is it is a requirement for a new council to review the structure of council once it 's elected so that is a requirement to review it okay and start again in fact an organizational structure has just happened this year and i voted against it i was unhappy because i felt it needed to wait until a new governing body but anyway it 's a numbers game and you don 't always win but yes of course i don 't want a wrecking ball to come in and do that to our community to our staff who are our community they are also those not quite 500 of them anymore about 470 something but they are all people in our community too and they need to be taken care of and continual restructures are very destabilizing and that doesn 't help people who are already feeling unsafe and concerned for their jobs some of them have no choice and stay because they 've got mortgages etc and nowhere else to go that 's a terrible situation to be in of course i will support having a looking at look at that and building bridges with the community which i 'm trying to do all the time and it 's difficult and it 's a shame that it is right suppose that means the strongest does it i 'm not sure the might is right but um yeah it 's it 's not acceptable and i don 't think anybody sitting here as a candidate would think it was or is and and i certainly will take an undertaking to um to work on that because that does the the culture of an organization starts at the top and the culture i have been unhappy with and it does seep down to the staff and and it 's very upsetting to hear that people are feeling that way it 's not good we are employers and we have responsibility to those people thanks karen i afforded a long answer to a long question um does anyone else want to speak about that bill day bill day first well to sum it up it 's a toxic culture in that council i 've said many times tonight this council needs urgent reform and john i would like to thank you for bringing that forward um i know that it went longer than you intended but you 've got the not one person you need a team to do it around this table uh and there 's an entirely couldn 't get here tonight he 's had a lot of um when i was on mclean shy council we replaced a general manager we restructured the council we overturned a toxic culture that was 1990 but 1997 98 99 but the the the things that were done then still apply today okay uh firstly [Applause] warren lang yeah but i 'd also like to uh to thank john that was really well spoken and it was clear i agree totally but also look i can say that the the council considers and describes the values and behaviors that they work by and run by the acronym of strive that is safe teamwork respect integrity value and engagement that 's what they say that they run by well that is not what we 're hearing from john and i totally agree we 've talked about this before engagement they don 't want to engage they don 't know how to value well i don 't know where the value is because so integrity and respect respect the community and the citizens and have and listen to what they have to say that 's respect we do need change you will get change you will get change and that will happen thank you uh firstly deborah novak thank you mr hagar for that really relevant and important question um and look uh i certainly and i know every counsellor and anybody that is um going to be elected to the next council would support a review of some of the workplace practices i guess but more importantly about what the staff are actually feeling because they are our backbone they are the ones who turn up every day and give hopefully more than 150 which i do see them a lot of the staff i do um you know they 're amazing but there 's um you know there are some issues there and i 'm very very aware of those but i think what we need uh other than a review are some policies in place that actually can enable our staff and that is things like a whistleblower protection policy any staff that see and want to report any wrongdoings okay we 'll have we 're going to get two more responses on this question it 's uh opened opened a bit of a can of worms here peter johnston okay well i i believe strongly that everybody has the right to feel safe and be without fear in their work environment and their home environment and every environment they 're in and it 's very sad to hear the the figures that you gave us john on that and uh clearly people who are in those situations don 't work well and that 's going to affect the efficiency of the council we spoke about that as well today but i 've been involved in schools has very much involved the analysis of staff and students happiness and well-being and bullying came into that and obviously within schools bullying there 's a there 's bullying in every school in the country but there 's a difference in the way the schools will deal with that bullying and i 've i 've been fortunate to be in schools that have i would like to bring those same uh principles and procedures we 've used there to see if those could be used in council i still have a lot to learn i 'm going to be a new councillor if i 'm elected and i have to learn how the council procedures and policies work but i think i 've got something to offer here from what my experiences in schools okay and the last response to this particular question greg clancy yeah thank you john for your question um there 's no doubt that there are issues that we need to deal with we do need reform i 'm hoping to be part of that reform um i 'm quite confident that of all the candidates that are here i 've met most of them i don 't know them all really well but i 'd be very confident that the toxic nature of the previous five years and three months will be gone i 'm really hopeful of that uh and and confident of it and i think it starts at the top starts with the councillors to to make sure that the general manager who has the responsibility for all the staff because we have very little to do directly with the staff so it 's up to the general manager to make sure that he or she sets the right tone for the for the organization and i 'm all for reform and i will support reform in relation to that we have lost so many really good staff in recent times and maybe for a whole lot of reasons but i 'm really concerned thank you okay [Applause] so sort of while we 're on this sort of a topic uh of one of the questions i have here is in may 2020 councillors unanimously approved a review of council 's unreasonable complainant policy which cited little to no substantial change however it subsequently has resulted in several community members being barred banned from communications with council will any candidates here tonight consider raising a recision motion to reverse this decision can i speak on that one sorry um i 've actually i certainly will but we don 't need to do a rescission motion need to rescind something if it 's within three months of that resolution so there won 't need to be a recision motion just a review of the policy and it definitely needs to be done it 's used and abused by our staff in fact i 'm putting i have requested an extraordinary meeting this week to try and get three residents taken off the band list they are not allowed to call council if they ring and ask a question they 're told sorry we can 't talk to you unless it 's an emergency they were banned for reasons that have now been disclosed as wrong we didn 't uh you might have read the independent last week we did not uh we refused to give them some information and and it turned out that council was wrong they were banned for being too persistent and asking too many questions and asking for too much information i wanted the general manager to release them from that ban before he finishes tomorrow i was told he can 't do that it needs a council resolution so i 've make to hopefully get them released from that band because they are ashamed and feel shamed because no one in the staff they 're on the naughty list and it 's not acceptable all right good yeah bill bill day you want to speak about uh this topic of banned the naughty list i 'm on it and you don 't have to try very hard i had a meeting with the acting general manager and the mayor uh five years and three months ago and uh they said to me you don 't agree with our policy on tourism do you and i said no i don 't and they said we 'll agree to to disagree from now on we will not answer any of your outstanding current or future questions goodbye and that that ban has stood for five years and three months no review nothing it 's a disgrace [Applause] one more response here from deborah novak thank you um bill uh so as the person who 's uh co-signing the um uh extraordinary meeting uh yes it 's very disturbing to see uh a council a weapon for you know not for good uh and as a councillor who 's been threatened with that as well and i 've also been suggested to me that i asked too many questions it 's a bit disappointing that you know um we have a not staff but a fellow counsellor who says that i ask too many questions so i think um those policies uh yes it needs a review and i 've supported our other members of the community who 've had that used against them as well so it is a very painful process and it 's a humiliating process to think that you cannot come into your council building because one staff member yields an axe that is just disgraceful one person right so um oh sorry robin um it 's really bad that one person can make that decision and it 's based it 's an abuse of power in my opinion and in this particular case i didn 't know bill was on the banned list through the unreasonable complainant conduct policy um but um yeah but they can just use it like to like councillor novak said they don 't like me asking questions either so wonder i haven 't_''_7158.88 been banned too but it 's it 's it 's disgraceful and it shouldn 't happen and we need to talk and communicate not ban people and she doesn 't even know if she 's allowed to go into a library because it talks about it talks about council buildings mr hager was banned for 12 months he 's on the naughty corner but he was let out he was actually let out early i 've been told i 've been told the general manager needs a resolution if i want to instruct him to release these people so i have no choice but to put in an expression sorry an extraordinary meeting request i 've got no choice i would rather he just do it all right we might we 'll just move on to another topic now um given that yeah we look mindful of time we did start a little bit late i hope everyone 's happy that we might finish a little bit late but not moving here 's a question what are your thoughts on clarence valley council 's management of tourism and visitor information centers and where to from here might start on this side of the room i 'll go see pickering first when uh the visitor information centers were closed down i was extremely disappointed when i moved to the valley the first my first port of call was the visitor information centre i received personal service uh the council then closed the visitor information centre so i was forced to start up my own visitor information center supplying information to tourists and visitors to our area i also um i put my own ads on social media promoting not just my my business but the whole area the village um and the clarence valley i really want to see the visitor information centers reopened especially the one in south grafton and i 'd love to see the visitor information center at ferry park mclean uh re-staffed with people um to answer the questions we 're getting so many visitors coming to the area and uh online activities just are not the same the human contact is what people are looking for so we definitely need to do something about it was a bad decision in the first place and it 's taken way too long to get it resolved we need a new council to redo this [Music] peter johnston i remember many years ago my family were traveling across australia we were visiting from the uk and on that journey we came to the grafton tourist information office and i think i must ask you bill uh you were the one who set that up but uh who is involved with that because we we really had some great service there and when we decided to move to australia as a with a doctor and a math teacher we could have gone anywhere we wanted to in the country but we remembered very positively our time in the clarence valley it was a great place to to come to great place to to live in and we had a great welcome and i just fear at the moment people coming to the clarence valley won 't have that welcome at all than something that people travel through and for that we need excellent tourist information services [Applause] greg greg clancy first you 're sorry bill as i i just wanted to speak because i was one of the councillors that voted for the new way of tourism i was fairly new on council it was put to us that it was the only way that we couldn 't afford to keep running the vix the visitor information centers i was i was sold that idea and i went along with it a bit reluctantly but i went along with it but over time i 've began to think well no we 've probably done the wrong thing here and so the south grafton visitor information center has been up for auction up for sale in auction and i 've repeatedly voted against any motion to get rid of that i think even if it wasn 't used for a vic it is a resource of council which the community basically paid for and we really should keep it so i have changed um and i think we need to do a will be and how we can uh you know have people in those vics if we do reopen them but i 'm well open to suggestions and to work with the new council on that one now i think uh it would be remiss of me not to ask if bill day would like uh the final response on this one i 've got nothing we were just too successful visitors loved it loved us loved the visitor information centers locals locals loved us because they got good service but we were governed by the community fancy camp caravan park operators motel operators people who run a business having any idea about tourism council knows it all so they had to destroy had to destroy it we produced tourist books and maps um 180 000 tourist books full color books with maps and information um all self-funded paid by advertising not one cent came out of uh anybody 's council 's pocket for those things we produced tour planners handbooks for coach companies we produced special interest brochures every village as steve refers to almira had its own brochure glenn um shipwrecks of the clarence bird watchers guide i actually got one i conned my way into the calypso caravan park where there was a council employee and asked for some information and i was given a bird watches guide that was stamped 2001 and had for further information the old phone number of the um of the tourist information center and the phone number of the chief of the bird watchers who had passed away and that and and what did we get in front of it in instead of it we get a website that 's done very poorly we need that but we need it to work properly we 've got these touch screen hubs have you ever tried to ask a question from a from up from a touch screen have you ever tried to print anything out not every visitor needs to go to a visitor information center our brochure is how material was sent out to every caravan park every motel etc no point in people expecting people to go from my luca to south grafton to get a brochure they were available everywhere a lot of work to do and it 's part of the economic development unit somebody said earlier council had no business had no responsibility in business what on earth does the economic development unit do nobody knows all right thank you bill okay we 've got an audience on the back road have a look at the sign welcome to clarence valley you 're driving from ireland have a look at the sign [Music] [Music] oh so i guess we 're looking now talking about the amenity of uh entrances to the the the cities uh and how and and that obviously affects is part of tourism uh warren lang i 'll just go quickly back to the information centers most of these information centers around australia which i 've been to many are all profitable it 's a hub it 's profitable they it 's cultural the arts they take a percentage for the bookings for the accommodation quarters people run interstate tours regional tours from these places and it 's profitable so it 's quite simple i mean for business interest and business investment and for particularly centre ideally suited for that type of you know infrastructure so it 's as plain as day thank you yeah you are you 've spoken the most out of everyone this evening what warren 's saying is true and the south grafton visitor information centre was profitable who paid for it the business community paid for it back in 1989 uh the council 's adopted a special rate levy not applied to residents not applied to pensioners not applied to farmers but commercially zoned property and it 's worth over 250 grand a year there 's no visitor information center it goes into the general fund okay they steal it so something to consider if uh visitor information center 's going to sway your vote now did you want to speak peter yes peter hansen the entrance into mclean we have a large sign saying where the industrial estate is and it leads on to it now a no through road going up over hillcrest and down traffic i 've seen four cars while i 've been walking the bicycle up there because the signage has been inadequate uh the there somewhere okay um go to jeff smith this is one of my pet hates and loves look uh as i said before council does a lot of good stuff the parks and gardens absolutely immaculate but the signs the the one atlanta i actually put on my facebook page it 's full that 's it 's sort of 45 degree angle and it 's it 's absolutely putrid um it 'd be better off removed there 's a sign on the corner here that i look at all all day from my shop and it says 1983 tidy town grafton it 's actually peeling off and rusted and decayed it 's time to pull the thing down or either take it to the tip or give it the historic society the day of the 1983 tiny town 's over let 's let 's just let 's just remove some of this stuff and while we 're at it can we get a coat of paint on the sea park toilets we 've had thousands of visitors looking at the illuminate and uh if if anyone wanted to use the and it 's absolutely obscene a 10-minute job with a roller it 's just those little details the little details and we 're just not getting it right all right running hot over here right oh so steve see pickering next okay i just got a comment regarding the entrance to the clarence valley so there are probably some bad signs around the place but what i 'd like to point out is the fact that uh i worked with the department of transport rms and also clamp clarence valley council during the construction of the m1 motorway so anyone that 's approaching the clarence valley from the south or the north will actually see signs dedicated to elmira there are dedicated almara exit signs as well as dedicated historic village signs and that 's because i worked with the department of transport rms and also the clarence valley council to ensure that those signs were erected to make sure that the visitors kept coming to through the clarence valley and stopping in at on mars if i can do that for a little village like elmara imagine what i more response on this particular topic from phil belletti okay um i 've been fighting as part of the chamber of commerce i mean we 've got this wonderful service station that 's dilapidated i 've been uh ad nauseum gone through to council about what 's happening with it and everything is gets gets pushed by the bureaucrats now i 'm gonna ask the councillors exactly who the hell runs the council is it the councillors or the bureaucrats if it 's the bureaucrats why are we elected what what are we doing we 're not acting like a business we 're not acting like a corporate we are just being and i 've seen and i 've been there and supporting a number of number of number of councillors and the bureaucrats seem to be just taking control and then bamboozling people about what they should and shouldn 't do now if i get if i get elected um it 's it 's it 's actually scaring me now because if we have no voice we 're just we 're just sort of like tick and flick now we need to make sure that the bureaucrats and we are the ones that elect the um the general manager that 's critical culture starts at the top okay i 've got the pressure on both sides of me here for the response from one of the current councillors it 's been interesting listening to the candidates and i really commend you that you 're standing up but you are in for a very big culture shock yourself the roles and responsibilities of a counsellor are nothing like what you think you can do you can 't_''_7974.159 go out and paint the toilet or even order somebody to paint the toilet or change the signs how it works in new south wales we have a we 're we 're the governing body sure but we only employ one person that 's the general manager we 're not even supposed to talk to the staff under that so we can only direct him we can only direct him through a resolution we can 't direct him as an individual counsellor although the mayor has oversight now there 's a thing called that the government new south wales government makes us use and it starts off with a community strategic plan 10-year plan and the community contribute to all of the things in that 10-year plan then the next one down is a delivery program and it 's usually a four-year cycle which is the same as your term then you have your budgets to to actually do those delivery things that are on there that 's how it works we don 't direct fixing um potholes toilets all of those things i wish we could but we can 't and you and you 'll soon find out and you 're going to get bloody frustrated and and greg as well yeah look um the last five years and three months has been difficult for the councillors to because there was a divided council it allowed the staff basically to have more power than they should and that i was happy with but that if we get a council now that works together as a team we 're not going to agree on everything but generally as a team that we want will solve some of these problems councillors will take back the reins that we should if we have the numbers yes if we got the numbers but you know i 'm confident with the candidates we 've got here i haven 't found any of the candidates here that wouldn 't want that i believe you know i can 't speak for them but i do believe we 've got a great opportunity here to change that it is up a lot of councils are run by the general manager or and the senior staff but i believe we will have the ability after the election to take back control and work with the general manager and the executive in the way it should be all right right so we might just change the subject all together now there 's been a that was a bit of a slog there um everyone came happy for a couple more questions all right um so firstly well many people have been following the clarence valley council meet the candidates facebook group created by former deputy mayor craig howe uh craig was unable new south wales schools delegate to junior new south wales rugby union but he did give me his blessing to ask some questions from his page and this one comes from helen robertson his name might sound familiar to some of the councillors are you prepared to take a stand against da 's that are not supported by adequate access to resources such as open spaces public amenities infrastructure public transport medical services and shopping centers perhaps we 'll hear from one of our new candidates firstly warren lang look with any any development application it 's got to be supported by quality research and environmental impact assessments and it 's got to be quality control what we want is quality infrastructure and you 've got to have the services to support that but it 's all backed up with with adequate research or appropriate research and knowledgeable people i don 't like the word expert but those who are knowledgeable and qualified in areas that have the main impacts to that that that development so i 'm happy to to support the development that 's supported by appropriate research 'm an engineer so i look at plans and i can visualize things in 3d and i think what i would really want to do is imagine the plans that come before me the development ones and think is this where i would really like to live i 'm thinking about where the parks are going to be are my children going to be safe walking to school or getting to the bus is there going to be access easy access to the shops and those sort of things and i think that 's what we should be looking at thinking is this somewhere where i would really want to live and if it isn 't then we need to look at it again because the developers are not there to for the long term or even the medium term they 're there to get the short term to get the profits and then to move out get people to move in but not to look at the long-term thing and as a council that 's we 've got to think about we 've got to think about where that time we 've got to be able to look ahead for that all right um oh and deborah novak and then we 'll move to the next question after that so just in regards to da 's uh they are very aspirational comments but the reality of it is um when a da comes before council um it can be either approved by delegated authority which is the general manager or comes before council for a resolution and it 's all a numbers game and those numbers are five four or nine so um five four or four against so um it 's uh and it 's a you know council clansly clancy spoke about um his professional um qualifications and one of the things he did bring to the council there was to educate a lot of the councillors around environmental aspects and i mean even if you don 't win the numbers what you do is you can have a platform to actually educate the rest of us about what your professional standards are all right and on significant developments is it time to start serious planning on for its location adequate i know karen has views on this uh we 'll go for steve pickering first i 'll just go quickly on this um yes we need to start looking at a plan and uh once we 've got a plan yammer 's going to need a second entrance at some stage and we just need to start the ball rolling and karen first okay thank you um yes the plans are there the land a lot of the land has been purchased there 's still a little link that hasn 't been but it 's not a short-term thing it 's been going on for at least 20 years that i 'm aware of and longer it 's going to cost a lot of money there 's money in the budget for some investigations of 150 000 that 's been there for a couple of years and it 's shameful that that at that resolution hasn 't happened but my uh my thinking is that that bypass starts on the western side of the oyster oyster channel bridge we are in the amber it really we road in right from the highway or at least lift the road in up so it doesn 't get blocked and cut off and we can 't get people out to services such as hospitals so there 's a lot of work to do there but you are looking at possibly a hundred million dollars to do that because it 's probably going to need to be an up in the air road over land like you can see on the highways there 's a lot of land bridges there and because of the terrain along there um and there 's some pretty uh orchids in one section and some other things that i 'm sure councillor clancy will talk about so there are certainly some constraints but we do need to do something and start thinking about the future okay firstly uh deborah novak did you still want to speak that 's it fine greg clancy yeah thank you um i really i 'm really keen to not give people false hopes and people want to reopen the embroider power station it 's not going to happen you know 't like what i 'm saying and you can say you don 't like me that 's fine but the fact is it 's not going to happen same thing with the amber bypass the the actual cost and the environmental impact is just so great but what we have been at a workshop we have been briefed on this and what we have been told is that we should be looking at ways of improving the existing yamba road so and there may be opportunities there for that i think that 's much more realistic let 's be realistic let 's not live in pie in the skyland it 's you know i 've done work on the remnants of the yamba bypass um proposed area and it is full of threatened species if we were to knock all that down which we shouldn 't because that 's going to affect the the actual natural environment around amber we would have to be paying large amounts of money as compensation for that so there 's a big cost there so personally i don 't believe it will ever happen yamba road and trying to improve that and whether there was ever money to bring the road from the highway in you know that you 'd if you really want to make amber more accessible you 'd have to do that but at the moment the flooding of the amber road and the luca road are real issues okay all right uh probably just one might make this one more question and then we might try to wrap things up so does the clarence valley have a serious case of nimby syndrome short for not in my backyard and should we be doing more to support national progress on industries such as solar farming mining and water sharing anyone like to speak first on that i definitely will read it uh should we be doing more to support national progress on industries such as solar farming mining and water sharing they have to happen somewhere but we say they can 't_``_8587.28 happen here all right deborah novak some comments coming from out the back there um look you know those um things that you 've spoken about already so mining um but i believe uh our community um and the solar farm has just come before council as a petition as well our community should still have a say in what the how they want their place to look like and how because they live here and the same with mining as well because the mining has threatened the river before in 1974 and um and i believe that the voice of the community should still be heard and it shouldn 't come at the expense of um state government okay yes greg i didn 't catch anyone out keen to uh push all those agendas um there 's nothing wrong with being a nimby when you live in the clarence valley this valley is just so important to be preserved in its natural state as much as possible we have we 've we 've damaged it we 've cleared nearly 90 percent maybe 95 of the floodplain vegetation we 've put in agriculture and sugarcane and everything like that so it 's not pristine but what we 've got left after all this development is still worth fighting for said earlier to the industries but it 's we are also in an area called the mcclay mcpherson overlap which is in northern new south wales and southern queensland and it 's the floras and faunas of the southern temperate areas overlap with the floras and faunas of the northern terresian areas that makes this area this northeast new south southeast queen land very very special we have more biodiversity in this area on in a lot of groups than in the wet tropics and the wet tropics are very very biodiverse so it is right to be nimby if you 've got the natural resources the natural environment and the community that we have here all right right i will thanks very much uh bill day your last comment here i was just going to ask why do we want these industries you just mentioned three industries and why what what are they we have industry we have businesses let 's look after the local businesses and and value add those why are we always looking for this golden solution that that it creates more problems than it solves seeing that there 's 10 000 signatures on one can we ask the opinion all right does someone from the public want to speak on this issue i would like to say that you know we have a beautiful valley but we 've got a lot of area around here and we need businesses here we need something here we need to to find jobs for our youth back in the early 60s i remember when we had a bad downturn we lost about 78 of our youth we didn 't come back got a lot of old people probably is old people are going to be looked after but they don 't spend money and they just exist where young people they spend money and help the place to grow but god says if we don 't grow we 'll be non-existent here and as our final word from robin gipp um and just to finish it wrap up i i think we 'll just give everyone one last chance to just tell the voters why they should vote for them and we 'll just go around the table a councillor to help in the valley and that 's basically it to help people in the valley i want to build a council that 's accountable and transparent and most of all a council that you can trust [Applause] i want to be part of a council that 's innovative has responsible spending and responsible decision making during the last term i 've tried to be a voice of reason and uh common sense on the council not sort of aligned with either of the two groups so i try and keep an open mind and look at all the information almost dispassionately and then make a decision and i speak my mind in council whether and if people like my approach they 'll vote for me if not they 'll vote for someone else yeah i 'll echo some of bill 's comments there that uh we 've got a council that uh has lost a lot of trust i want to be part of a team that that reap helps to rebuild that trust it 's going to take a long time i want to see accountability within staff and the way it interacts with the general public is a return of respect and dignity um so my name is alison wades as we already know so vote me and i 'll make sure that i work for you the whole community in growing jobs and making a change for our future thank you [Applause] yeah i support generally what the other candidates have said particularly about the reform and making council more accountable and friendly to the to the public um i 've been on council for the last five years three months and i 'm proud of my record despite the fact that it was a very difficult time for me personally i was bullied i didn 't have a lot of support on a lot of issues but i 'm back hopefully to be re-elected and hopefully to continue the work that i 've started and i want to continue looking after the environment and protecting our lifestyle and particularly looking after the river and caring for the people thank you thank you um i 've decided um to re-stand because i there 's got a good reputation of standing up for my community and being a voice when for them when no one else is listening i have been very disappointed with this last term i have lost trust in some of our senior staff and i know that 's a terrible thing to admit but it 's the truth and it is correct it 's hard to build back trust but i want to be part of a council a new council where we return to serving our community that 's what the council is for we are here for the community and we are to serve and that 's what leadership is about and i think some leaders forget that we are here for you and no one else we need to to get back the confidence of our community i don 't believe we 've lost the confidence of everyone i don 't think it 's as bad as some think i know they 've had personal experiences there are good things in there we 've got some amazing staff and i just think they deserve a better go as about that survey and we need a leadership team now that will work together as a team and not be divided because when you 're divided and you 're on the side that the numbers are low you can 't do anything really so please consider voting me back in because i it will be my pleasure to continue standing up for you thank you we 've got a lecture team of nine people to lead this clarence valley for the next two and a half years and i 'm looking around me at the other candidates here and i can see a great group of people but we need to elect a team with a variety of skills and abilities and as you look at your team sheet think about me i 'm uh i 'm a mathematician engineer and scientist and i bring skills and abilities that quite a few of the others here don 't have so please make me part of your team in the sport i play the first name on the team sheet is the goalkeeper i 'm actually a goalkeeper so please uh hard for my community and i 've pulled my community together really successfully with a vision for the future and i 'd like to expand on that and take it throughout the entire clarence valley i want to see a council that 's accountable and transparent i want to see a council that has true leader true leadership a council that people can look up to rather than look down to i want to see a council that 's progressive responsible and i want to see a council that respects ratepayers money and spends it uh in in targeted sensible ways so remember one steve pickering [Applause] wow that 's a lot of hard acts to find really i 'm very inspiring coming um all those words um i 'm not going to say vote one deborah novak i 'm going to say please vote because i don 't want you to give up on your council and i don 't want you to give up on democracy because your vote matters and we want to hear from you and it 's really important that you understand that we when community and i really don 't want you to give up on us because that 's what i hear probably the most out of my five years people have given up please don 't give up just vote at least vote for nine of us [Applause] i 'd like to see a shared vision of all the councillors i 'd like to the council to take back control of the entire valley we need to make sure that we are not second-class citizens when it comes to bureaucrats we need to manage development we need to manage our environment we need to juggle a lot of things but at the end of the day we need to have a team here and i think we 've got a very good group of candidates outstanding actually so we need to make sure that when you 're when you 're elected you 're electing leaders and leaders that want to share and understand the whole valley because you know everyone comes from their own perspective but we need to make sure that you know we listen to people like like the john about um the the you know the council and how it operates so we need to make sure that we listen to you guys and get it right this time [Applause] i 've always worked in a team environment and i think that there 's a good selection of candidates here it 's important that you vote for at least five for your vote to be formal and that 's most important um and yeah look uh yeah just uh be vocal and be out there and select who you think 's best to represent the community transparency honesty integrity we 've all talked about that and hopefully we get that with the new councillors thank you [Applause] i feel a sense of responsibility to make a greater contribution in developing on community values i i hope everyone enjoys a sense of involvement and votes i i have another string by way of contributing in the community i 'm working on development of small boats kayaks and canoes for personal buildings so i 'm looking at a small boat building school which i think will greatly enhance the um enjoyment a thing to motor around on and plug fish from thanks all the best in the future okay [Applause] right well that 's all we have time for so thank you to all the candidates for making your time available here with us tonight i don 't think i 'm any closer to knowing who i 'm going to vote for after that because uh there 's more than nine worthy candidates i think but yeah it 's certainly um yeah it 's it 's um it is sending a positive feeling about the future um that we can a fresh change as council needs and it looks like that 's what it 's going to get so and also thank you to everyone else who made the effort to come

everybody for coming to south grafton progress association thank you again to the candidates be sure to follow clarence media on facebook to stay up to date with everything happening in this new media space this is will north signing out for clarence media have a good night my [Applause] i think there 's a great need for reform from my long experience in local government some 58 years reform in the organisational structure in the the culture in the attitude in work practices uh in service levels across the board policies need to be reviewed and this council could be in my view a whole lot better than it 's been in recent times look there 's reform is definitely needed um that that doesn 't mean that everything that council has done in the last five years wasn 't good there were some good things some very good things one of the things we haven 't done well is communicate with the public with the public um what the public wants um and i know that might only be a minority of people but it 's a significant minority i don 't think enough councillors actually communicated with the public um only two of us of the existing councillors were actually on facebook on a regular basis um i tried to tell this council where they were going wrong in tourism the mayor asked me to prepare a written plan i did a 10-point plan over many hours didn 't even get acknowledged when i gave it to him i then had a meeting with the acting general manager and the mayor and they said you obviously don 't support council 's policies on tourism i said no i don 't and they said well from we will agree to disagree from now on on we will not answer any questions that you put to council staff about tourism now that 's pretty typical of how they treat anybody the kindest thing you can do to anyone is give them constructive criticism but clarence valley council don 't want to hear it just fair representation throughout the actually looking from the outside so uh look i 've only been here a couple of years but generally looking from the outside looking in i can see where there 's um well a need for change and i think that we can do things better i think we can become more efficient and across the board uh bring some life in into it and uh uh having the ability to contribute i think will be beneficial but uh um there are plenty of good candidates out there with some views but i think it is time for change and yeah looking forward to that opportunity well i think it 's a very exciting time for us for for starters with the hopefully the end of covert the regulations now we 're at a new start it 's almost like it 's a spring and we 're going to be restarting a lot of things and a lot of things to grow and perhaps some things that weren 't working so well we can leave alongside and some new things that might be a new good idea a new way because it was so divided um or polarized and sometimes dysfunctional um you know we had losses in there as well and this is what i didn 't like about this particular council it was very adversarial it was win at all costs there was never any room for compromises i saw it when i put compromise initiatives forward oh and another big win i think for yamber was stopping the push for three sets of traffic lights on yamba road and um yeah bill i 'd like to see um some council support a lot more projects in south grafton it seems like the poor relation to the grafton area in particular like i was talking to you earlier about a skate park for south grafton and particularly probably situated down at down here at beresford park would be an ideal place for it we see so many kids traveling the long distance over the bridge there to get this to the skate park which is a great facility for grafton but there 's a a huge need for something like that in south grafton and that 's just of stuff that south grafton needs that grafton 's got i was concerned about the vision toward a future a healthful region um with a healthful river and a viable fishing industry and i thought that there was a big blockage in the council it wasn 't allowing any real anything but the idea that um bulldozing things was employment that um that was uh you know just a job was employment whereas actually employment is a real uh product of schooling and opportunity through their this bullying in schools that 's a difficulty for many to actually get attached and i have been speaking to a lot of the local businesses on the main street they would like a council that allows them to do more things so to utilize the footpath to be able to sit out there with the customers with their eating and drinking and also just be able to put some displays out there as well and i think covert has sort of pushed that where we want to be alfresco sitting outside also with our shopping and our clothes on the outside as well you know like coffs harbor 's doing they 're building up so they 're putting apartment blocks above cbd and above businesses yeah look let 's start to be a proactive council not reactive and that 's i think you know the biggest thing that you know we can you know try and do um if we can be proactive um we 're going to be so much more you know so sustainable in that region uh yeah look what i 've um what i 'm finding and talking around to people is there 's a there 's a lack of trust with with council at the moment there 's um there 's a lot of anger and what i 'd like to see is is council getting gaining back that trust and being seen to work for the people and to look um to look after the people and to respond to their needs and i it 's going to take a while it 's going to take a few years it 's taken a few years to to develop this this trust and lack of trust so i on there the nine and we all work together we all listen to the residents and and we form policy and opinion and and action for to respond to those people uh and and their needs and to get back to see council get back to the basics of why they exist and there 's areas where they where they 're dabbling in or they 've been in and they 've um really we 'd be better off just focusing in on on the nuts and bolts of it and get council to do what they 're what they 're best at but some things that i would really like to see uh um we already have a lot of tourists and visitors coming to the area and i 'd like to see those tourists and visitors spend more time in our rural areas rather than there seems to be a strong focus along the coast i think that with the purchase of the neboya power station it gives us an opportunity to to increase visitor numbers to the emboyda area through white water rafting as well as heritage tours it 's not actually generating electricity i 'd like to see um more attention brought to our smaller areas and villages there 's a lot of focus on our main capitals and uh mclean yamba and grafton uh i think there 's a couple of issues there 's issues sitting with the ombudsman at the moment that um are not public uh and that 's um i mean it has been publicly discussed um within a council meeting uh but there are some issues there 's not a full-blown investigation yet but there are matters sitting with the ombudsman uh so that will be interesting to see what happens there i think uh climate change and um our food bowl here they probably that the food bowl uh conversation and um how we manage business and employment here is going to be the biggest thing to uh drive the economy because at the end of the day uh we 're moving into a a new era of doing business whether it 's through the digital economy uh but one of the steady influences for over 150 years has been the conversation and spread that you know that um that economic love further so with the farmers in manufacturers or you know production i think that will hold us in really good stead for the future they need to understand where we want to go and how we 're going to get there but they need to get off their backsides dare i say it and work for us and not work for everyone else we need to be very insular in that regard and make sure that they understand that we 're going to put the pressure on them and you know whoever the new lot are coming in federally we need to really hammer them we need to make sure that they clearly understand that we 're not going to sit back and this is what the new councillors need to do they all need to say okay every time they have a conversation they need to say the state and federal members that you know this is about regional australia this is about putting us on the map this is about putting jobs not taking away from from regions but in order to do that we need a lot of infrastructure here and i think that we 've got we 've got the quality of people we 've got people who are accepting of of development and businesses uh really and and private businesses are really key what 's important to me as a counselor is uh transparency and accountability and i think we 've been lacking in that this last term which upsets me a little and i think we need to learn respect some of our community members are treated quite badly and you know we 're even banning some community members through our unreasonable complainants policy and it actually um upsets me greatly that you know they ring up to find out something and they haven 't even put in a complaint to be honest they 've just requested information that that um they 're they 're actually eligible to get under the gipper act and and we 're not doing what we should do and they 're treated very badly and and that just upsets me and i i continue to fight for the and remember why we 're there and leadership is is about respect and serving serving the community my primary reason for running is i want to be a contributor to reform of the council i think there 's a great need for reform from my long experience in local government some 58 years reform in the organizational structure in the the culture in the attitude in work practices in service levels across the board policies you _"

    "text": "welcome to clarence media we 're starting to get into the home stretch now of candidate q a and today i 'm joined by grafton 's allison weights thanks for joining us welcome thanks for having me okay so just tell us a little bit about yourself and why you 've decided run for council yeah definitely like i said my name is alison waites i 've been here in the clarence valley since 2011. rose two boys and we 're from coffs harbor originally so i moved here for some friends and just a life change and i was working in social housing in cross harbour at the time and i thought this is a beautiful place to live and to raise kids and we 've been here ever since okay great so yeah like i said you 've got a bit of a background in community housing these days you 're running your own real estate business um you must be across the the housing issue the housing crisis that we 're facing in the clarence valley and all over australia what 's your solutions to those issues real estates that supports um crisis accommodation like i said i 've worked in community housing we were the ones that wrote tenancy guarantees so i actually understand where tenants that aren 't working full time and can 't financially afford certain houses they can get support so i 'm all across that and i actually do work hand in hand with a lot of agencies in the area we do find that there 's a lot of families right now that are couch surfing living on the streets living in their cars or with their families we 've got five bedroom houses where there 's only one person living there now so there 's a lot of things that do need to get changed and it needs to start from a community real estate and also state government as well okay there 's a lot of crisis there really is yeah so there 's there seems to be a shortage of viable places to live people that normally have always been able to live somewhere can 't find somewhere lit definitely we 're getting phone calls literally every day day there 's about 90 applications per house so there 's a lot of people you 're finding right now because the property market has gone up a lot of owners are selling which means a lot of agencies want the tenants gone and then they 'll be homeless so the issue is we don 't have enough houses for the population so we do need growth we do need one two bedroom apartments being built family homes as well and um so we need to make sure that we 've got the facilities to to be okay and the jobs obviously but we do need a lot more houses to be built otherwise we 'll be finding this crisis will be getting worse and i think having um with the bypass that did push up the rent prices and then when the jail came there 's a lot of workers that came to town which means the local residents were being pushed out so we really do need to make sure there 's a lot more land developments happening but we also need to make sure it 's in yama needs to grow too much because i know there 's a bit of issues with that one but there 's not enough facilities as well so medical facilities shopping centers you look at junction hill fantastic prime spot for that to be but we do need shopping centers medical facilities and more shops at junction hill way too you know to be able to you know look after those areas and all those houses being built and do you think also we can uh re-imagine the way our cbds look and feel oh definitely we can always change and always grow and i have been speaking to a lot of the local businesses on the main street they would like a council that allows them to do more things so to utilize the footpath to be able to sit out there with the customers with their eating and drinking and also just be able to put some displays out there as well and i think covert has sort of pushed that where we want to be our fresco sitting outside also with our shopping and our clothes on the well but also you know like cross harbors doing they 're building up so they 're putting apartment blocks above cbd and above businesses you look where i 'm situated in spring street here in south grafton there 's a block of land now available why would you not utilize that to build a business down below and a high rise of apartments you can house 50 people with that you 're bringing more people closer to the services definitely i think that 's what we need to see and there 's a lot of people that don 't have cars as well that actually do need services and then you 've got families that actually if you built more houses around the cbd the businesses become busier um the services actually you know can open more as well because i would love to see local businesses open after 12 o 'clock on a saturday and also open sunday because at the moment a lot of people are leaving town to go get a coffee and to go shopping because the businesses aren 't open but unless we 've got actually want to utilize those businesses they 're not going to open so i think we do need to bring more residents to the area into that cbd area all right yeah okay so any other major hot topics that um that you 'll be pushing for uh in your candidacy yeah definitely so um a lot of people see on social media there 's been a lot of questions being asked and saying what can you do to help me um so i have been helping um the guys at glenn ray to do with the railway and done with the historic value of that so we 've been working hand-in-hand with um nbn news and a few other people as well to make sure that we 're supporting glenn ray we 've also been working so we want to push that as well so we 're going to try and support them if i 'm elected into council we 're also been helping um the brooms head guys as well that with the camping grounds for over 70 years so i have said to them that you know we can have a meeting and actually change it around so they actually can utilize that at christmas time um the airport now this is a major one because i really would like to see our airport expanded and actually utilized correctly we 're one of the main areas for bushfires with the drought relief and all that kind of stuff it can be utilized for the services for scs as well but also i deal with a lot of the farmers here and we 've got the aluka sardines you 've got the prawns you 've got the trawlers you 've got your macadamias your blueberries you 've got a lot of agriculture and horticulture here in the clarence valley how fantastic would that be if they could utilize our airport and go international and export everywhere can you imagine the money that would come back to the clarence valley a more money which means more jobs and yeah it 's just growth and that is fantastic so we should be utilizing that airport a lot better than what it is so it 's starting to touch on of look across harbor that airport is amazing what they 've done down there but it 's for it 's for our use it 's first so we can travel all around australia so we can still do that but we 've actually got the best opportunity where we 're between the gold coast between cross harbour and also armadale and glen innes where there 's all the horticulture and agriculture and you know you 've got your meat you 've got absolutely everything with manufacturing so why not do that you know i 've spoken to a few businesses and they 're happy to get involved so i think that 's actually you know we talk about the council saying it 's a 300 000 a year expense can you imagine how much money we can make if we get those businesses involved yeah great good jobs yeah and uh one more thing uh not obviously in this this particular election there 's not many candidates that are really pushing um groups or you know ticket items and things like that you 've actually one of the few candidates that tickets yeah definitely i think it 's essential i think um before i was running for council i didn 't know that you had to pick five otherwise it 's a donkey vote so you want to go one two three four five out of the 16 candidates i will be displaying probably in the next two weeks of my how to vote cards and who i would like you to preference i think it 's a great idea because if we don 't get the number one spot it goes on to preferences but also if people go one two three four five down to 16 the bottom people will miss out so we want to make sure that you vote for who you want in and second or third preferences so you have to have five minimum all right okay and one question i have asked many of the candidates is um mayor deputy mayor if you were to get on the council any aspirations there well you just never know it all depends on who 's the nine because obviously it 's the nine that vote in want to stand up and then you never know we 'll see okay well good luck on december the 4th this is uh bill north for clarence media thanks very much _"

    "text": "welcome to clarence media 's candidate q a today i 'm joined by mclean 's peter hansen thank you for joining us thank you john now just uh quickly um tell us why you 've decided to run for council well i 'm probably redundant already i was concerned about the vision toward a future a healthful region with a healthful river and a viable fishing industry and i thought that there was a big blockage in the council that wasn 't allowing any real anything but the idea that um bulldozing things was employment that that was you know just a job was employment whereas actually employment is a real product of schooling an opportunity through there this bullying in schools that 's a difficulty for many to actually get attached okay so uh as you sort of alluded to there 's only four of the current counselors running for council perhaps some of the ones that are not running were very pro development you 're very much going to be taking an environmental type of a stance it 's not that i 'm anti-development there 's a peculiarity putting houses in there to the vast spread and there 's a type of development which enjoys a community aspect a closeness of friendship and perhaps smaller vehicles consequently okay and uh so you have a real affinity with the water uh peter was a head of the river champion in his early days um yeah obviously the river you think is central to the current valley central to everything it 's always been a necessary necessity in everyone 's lives is the water and a good quality and a quantity as we have here is the greatest asset one can hope for it 's recreation uh food source of food and even with the declining fishing industry here and much fish being imported for consumption uh it is yet productive we 're watching boats being pulled up on the riverbank decommissioned burned losing bits of heritage um boat craft also without consideration and you 're concerned about logging developments upstream well the logging is an enormous impact on the quality of the water from the march floods we 've had months of filthy water in mclean um and off is a sign of nutrient in the water which is ancient nitrates i believe which probably are fostering the jellyfish more than anything and it is the jellyfish are running the the fish generally because we 're overfishing okay and uh so drinking water is a a source of contention in the lower clarence in particular you think that 's contributing to that issue uh drinking water has always been a point of contention i think adam and eve um adam their sons um cain and abel who had the big problem with the quality of water and that 's some thousands of years ago and the sahara desert is now there where they were fighting so we haven 't_''_181.28 resolved that one yet and i don 't think religion 's getting its philosophical message out there as much as um it 's do it our way finger wagging so quality yeah absolutely quality of water we can last into the future even with problems with overheating and things if there 's a viable quantity of water around at least for agriculture even if we 're not eating meat and water to produce than vegetables yeah well there 's uh yeah all right so i guess you know you 've obviously got some clear views and and about how things should operate how what change do you think you bring to council i don 't um know that i can actually individually bring much change it 's a matter of persuasion uh you have in such situations as um the educated man the um the resources that you 've reached through as you 've become educated which you 're referencing so argument persuasion the ability to elucidate to to make a familiar recognizability in an argument that others can can look into rather than what 's the opposite everyone in their own boat and barging around saying i know what 's best discussion it 's it 's everything the ongoing dialogue yep yeah okay all right well any closing words why people should vote for peter hansen on saturday december the 4th just get a capable bunch of people together this time please so that we have a future prospect in here that is environmentally aware looking toward the future up in the range where you don 't see it all you 're worried about is the next door neighbor in town here and uh you eat the food from the farms and then um you fight with the farmers apparently it 's a big last word yeah okay all right well good luck peter nice to have a chat with you mate thank you very much bill wonderful to invite me _"

    "text": "our next guest on clarence media 's candidate q a is south grafton 's jeff fuller thanks for joining us how are you bill so what made you decide you wanted to run for council um well i 'm bored in brendan grafton um i wanted to do it a couple of years ago i sort of opted out and i thought this is the goodest time as any to jump in and have a go okay and so um i guess why why what what sort of counsellor do you think you 'd be why why do you think your services would be valuable to council um bill i think i 'll just i would just make sensible decisions um i don 't come from any angle i didn 't come from any party affiliate um i 'd sort of be i 'd make any decision on its merit and sort of um yeah it just makes sense sensible decisions that 's what i think sensible um you know um development decisions i know that we need development and you know decisions are proper this hard decision 's gonna then and you say born and bred in grafton just tell us a bit about yourself i 'm born in bed and grafton born and running me hospital which is now units um so worked in grafton most of my life in currently i 'm a support worker um i have done i 've been a manager managed a homeless service um i 've got a bachelor of social science degree i 've done a bit of study um i 'm separated that 's a bit of family rockets and three kids and i 'm really into the sport aspect so anything to do with council supporting sport and supporting south grafton um i think i 'd be very much behind all that okay yeah i 'm aware that uh yeah you 've got kids that play golf and exactly right quick um so you live in south grafton that 's right are there some particular projects in south grafton or things that you think need to be done in that particular area um that perhaps council 's fallen behind on yeah bill i 'd like to see some council like the poor relation to the grafton area um in particular like i was told talking to you earlier about a skate park for south grafton and particularly probably situated down at down here at beresford park would be an ideal place for it um we see so many kids traveling the long distance over the bridge there to get this to the skate park which is a great facility for grafton but there 's a a huge need for something like that in south grafton and that 's just the tip of the iceberg that 's like a microcosm of stuff that south grafton needs that grafton 's got yeah right oh just a secret pet one of mine is that they could turn mckittrick park into a uh you know hosting nrl games big footy stadium i thought of that too and um just develop a country park generally put like a bunk house there and have it like you could use it for um development academies academies of some sort you know put some accommodations they have kids having camps there and stuff it 's a really go and watch night cricket there every wednesday night and there 's hardly anyone there and i think this is just gorgeous so i guess um you know for people that are considering who they 're going to vote for on election day on on december the 4th 16 candidates all feel that they deserve a vote why should people vote for jeff fuller um bill that 's a good question i just i 'm stable um i 'd make i 'd be voting every um i 'm a real supporter of the clarence valley not particularly south grafton i 've worked in mclean so i know the whole clarence valley like i 've been here most of my life and they 'd be getting someone who i mean i used to work at the council so i know how councils operate i know the culture of a council um i worked in council for 11 years one was grafton city council i 'm really interested in the politics of the council generally interested in politics anyway but i wasn 't um an advocate for the amalgamation i thought there river and one council downriver so i really followed it like that and um so you 'll get me i 'll be making the hard decisions but also be i won 't be sort of uh i don 't know off the of the gun type of thing i 'll be just making proper decisions like sensible decisions all right good to hear yeah and good luck on election day great thanks a lot bill appreciate it _"

    "text": "today on clarence media 's candidate q a i 'm joined by another former daily examiner editor and one of the current councillors peter ellum thanks for joining us thanks bill and thanks for uh providing this forum for all the candidates no worries i think it is a valuable thing for the community uh so this past marathon five and a half years your first term on council um just tell us a bit of this back story of peter ellen well um my wife susan and i uh came down here for work to take on the examiner and coastal views in those days and i 'd have to say those six years were probably the most enjoyable of my 30-year journalistic career it was a great paper and uh had a lot of history to it and a lot of loyalty as well and uh um a good a good staff as well you know when when i had had stuff um the media smaller staff that i had as well was also fantastic but yeah yeah um so in many ways it was like a homecoming the alums um uh pioneered um uh the clarence uh they came up from mangrove mountain uh and um they they were horsemen and teamsters so they um they they um they did it pretty tough but now there are elem scattered all over the clarence and richmond valleys uh they were um they worked in forestry on the railroads they were teachers uh like my father and louis ellen his cousin many grafton people will know of lewis um really he was the family historian and a lot of the ellen men fought in world war one uh about 20 of them from both valleys uh including my grandfather thomas who was fought in france and was in the wiring parties out in no man 's land and he was company caught a master sergeant for 41st battalion in lismore and he had a brother william who sadly died in passchendaele uh towards the end of the war interesting story there he was being nursed by a british nurse um and they were quite william and uh then he was killed and subsequently my the brother the the younger australia and um so plenty of history there 's a lot of history though and peter ella mobile the cricketers uh they used to play against sheffield shield sides and uh there was another a member of the family who had a coach run going up to the northern tablelands and um thunderbolt the bushranger used to ride with him at night for company not not holding him up you know riding with if they were mates all right so um fast forward to this i guess the last five years and you 've been on a council that i guess has probably been best described as testing at times um and only four candidates standing for re-election there 's going to be a new look yeah tell us what this means during that five and a half year term um basically i i stood because i wanted to give back to the local community who 'd been very good to our family i 've got three daughters and uh you know people have been very kind and over the years and i 'm not a joiner of clubs so in in that regard and i 'd like to see myself as a voice of reason on the council and someone who 's been active uh some of the achievements that i 'm most proud of were a couple of notices of motion there one that waved all council fees for every bushfire affected resident during the black summer bushfires that 's uninsured and insured because there was a big yawning gap there when you go to rebuild it 's much more costly now so i know i know people who lost their homes in the fires and uh and thankfully that was unanimously supported by council also they told me i 'd never get james creek road sealed or mcintyre 's lane but i put together this fairly forensic nom that uh and there was a review of priorities there both of those roads bitumen sealed during this term and also trials stemming from that were trials into better gravel mixes when we grade roads i and i also in response to resident concerns about how our coastline was being trashed by illegal campers or freedom campus started a and wildlife and um community representatives and that led to um the trial the the you know the signs where people were fined um probably not as many as i would have liked but it also led to three extra ranges they don 't all um prosecute the camping side of things one 's a parking officer and the others do you know dog complaints and neighbourhood disputes etc um yeah and sometimes it 's a matter of um taking an ethical stance so i i was one of the few councillors who opposed the townsend brothel proposal um that was approved but fortunately the the um the applicant there had built sanctus brewery which is a great uh you know much more positive way of using that a piece of industrial land um and i convinced the council to go into an air expressions of interest um process for to to secure the 7.6 million dollars for the grafton gallery redevelopment that was being targeted for having half its budget slashed which i don 't know where that would have left one of our iconic attractions and i fought but that helped save glenn ray pill from closure um and uh supported riverfront upgrades in mclean grafton and and almira and uh yeah so there are you know that 's just a record of um action basically as i see it uh in this council because it was so divided or polarized and sometimes dysfunctional you know we had losses in there as well and this is what i didn 't like about this particular council it was very adversarial it was win at all costs there was never any room for compromises i saw it when i put compromise initiatives forward oh and another big win i think for yamber was stopping the push for three sets of traffic lights on yamba road and um thankfully the mayor jim simmons voted with uh you know the around but i think that 's a better uh gateway to yamba than um three sets of traffic lights otherwise would be looking like coffs harbor which is just gridlock yeah and you you 'd know what that 's like yeah and i guess grafton took the honor of the first traffic and they 're welcome to that honor so speaking of entrances to yamba i guess one hot button topic is the second entrance to yamba uh it 's been on the in the on the back burner for let 's say 20 years is a time that was brought onto the table and that 's seriously considered well i 've consistently argued in council for um you know proper planning to be done there and it 's an absolute must if yamba is to grow population wise and there is you know the the controversial rezoning of west jamba and other you know the canal development and there 's park avenue uh if all of those uh you know if if all of those people come here over the next 10 to 15 years we don 't want to end up like byron playing catch-up you need to make sure not just for new local residents but the visitor population as well that we 've got infrastructure there and i see a a second local you know second access or a local gamba bypasses essential it 's going to be the last council meeting i argued that it should be put on the federal uh election wish list and sent off to the feds i just couldn 't believe that it wasn 't there even if it was for more planning uh and get us towards construction but i have you know it 'd be tens of millions of dollars but probably a very important thing that has to be addressed and not left on the back burner yeah okay yeah and yeah so again um you know there 's going to be at least five new councillors on this council yeah yeah looking at the range of candidates probably won 't be as polarized as before perhaps and what do you think um how this new yeah well i think i think important yeah i don 't want to tell people how to vote because um you know it 's that at the um uh at the uh uh pleasure of the the people basically whether you get re-elected or elected but um uh there are some good candidates there and i think they 're they look um what newcomers and people who are prepared to work in a collegiate manner more as a team you know put put behind us the bullying the misogyny the cheap point scoring and the the dysfunction because all of these procedural points of order you know i know where they came from they didn 't come from me um and you know uh we can get through meetings uh a lot more um you know efficiently i think so you do have some former councillors you know from the mclean shire days and uh armadale yeah uh current uh who are steeped in local government and uh they you know they have um a lot to offer but then you know after talking to some of the new candidates they also have a lot to offer you know um steve pickering is one and um you know i 've had conversations with some of the other um grafton-based councillors and uh it 's important that we get a geographic um split in there as a balance so that both you know lower and upper clarence well represented all right i guess that whole clarence valley you know and i 've supported many you know grafton initiatives you know because i see them you know it 's a major center and we need to um probably take back our regional status you know which was stripped from us yeah yeah yeah liz moore suffers from that too you know the the withdrawal yeah withdrawal of government and some corporate services so just finally peter i guess just a closing word on why uh voters should vote for you on on saturday december the 4th well i think they would have um people who have watched council closely would have you know looked at how i 've dealt with issues and i i don 't uh it sounds uh counter-intuitive but i don 't go out there chasing votes i 'm not going to tell people what they want to hear just for the for for the sake of getting that quota people know that i 'm a plain talker you know and i i 'll um i 'll i 'll tell it as it is in that chamber and uh i 'll you for the benefit of the valley and not get bogged down in in what we 've had over the last five years it 's been quite confronting at times and uh i know that it 's taken an emotional toll on my some of my other fellow councillors and i 've uh in the background given them support moral support i can deal with them i can deal with that kind of um you 've been an editor you 've got to have a hard skin that 's right bill that 's right all right well thanks for joining us and uh yeah good luck on election day thank you _"

    "text": "today on clarence media 's candidate q a i 'm joined by warren lang from mclean thanks for joining me warren no worries bill thanks very much for inviting me and uh so yeah tell us a little bit about yourself and why you 've uh put your hand up to run for council look um firstly look i 'm a sixth generation australian with uh scottish heritage and uh well not quite the reason we moved to mclean but there was a uh some some backgrounding there but uh look um we moved here a couple of years ago and uh now that i find that i 've got the opportunity to to run and given i 've got the time to do that that uh uh look i like to see that some fair representation across the clarence valley for the council or as a councillor and also to to provide well i guess to be able the ability to influence some of the discussion and to see that the local government concentrates on what their priorities and responsibilities are and not being sort of too far from efficiency into the whole program and see if we can uh yeah have better representation i think okay uh so how 's the news been received in the mclean community the people you 've spoken to that you 're running so well actually it 's quite positive feedback there from the people i 've done um not so much a door knock on three and half thousand people here but i 've done letter drops here i 've talked to probably 50 to 100 people here in the last couple of weeks and look they um they appreciate that somebody 's actually going out there and going for walking having a chat and look they 're they 're quite keen to um and look forward to the upcoming election purely to uh see uh and to be vocal and to to raise their points of view um they feel that um that that they haven 't uh had the opportunity to raise some of their views uh given that the well consultation may not be part of what or the best from from the local government in regards to consultation uh yeah the ability to to walk in the door and have that discussion particularly uh yeah just with a range of views anyway that uh the ability to have consultation there and maybe for somebody to represent the local people it 'll be great now you have extensive experience in engineering and infrastructure projects across australia just tell us a little bit about that background and and how that will benefit how you could use that to help benefit the current council well it doesn 't matter whether it 's uh the projects that i 've been involved with are defence projects energy projects and they range from the northern territory western australia and victoria tasmania the educational facilities i 've worked for two engineering consultancies for 14 years in western australia health projects for the australian government national aboriginal health strategy projects look in each of these projects there is an element of local government and state government involvement in regards to consultation with the local people it might be representing landowners and you know on behalf of uh international and you know companies and australian companies purely the people but also what the local government requirements are so i think that there 's always been an element of consultation between myself and and the local government so that 's where i see my background not working for council or working for a local government but purely in having the ability to to consult and to um to reach out and on this occasion on behalf of the residents and the community in regards to expressing their views and for them yeah to realize maybe the opportunities that are there okay great so i guess on election day on the 4th of december why should people vote one for warren lang ahead of some of the other candidates well look there are some quite good candidates don 't worry about that but what i think is that that just fair representation throughout the clarence valley um that um with my experience and it 's actually looking from the outside so uh look i 've only been here a couple of years but generally looking from the outside looking in i can see where there 's um well a things better i think we can become more efficient and across the board bring some life in into it and having the ability to contribute i think will be beneficial but there are plenty of good candidates out there with some views but i think it is time for change and um yeah looking forward to that opportunity all right great well good luck on election day warren and nice to spend some time with you uh and yeah if you want to see all the any uh interviews of candidate q a just head to clarencemedia.com provide your feedback via email william clarencemedia.com _"

    "text": "today clarence media is in beautiful hawaii or should i say sunny amber the most livable town in in in australia and home to one of our very own councillors karen toms thanks for joining us karen you 're very welcome bill thank you for giving me the opportunity no worries and uh yeah as of uh the people running for council there are four previous councillors running again and you 're the longest serving of those uh certainly um got plenty of experience uh should people vote for you on election day i have yes i was first elected in 2008 so i 'm probably the veteran that 's staying on although there are a few newbies who of course have a lot more years behind their belts but yeah i 've um this is this will be my fourth term if i 'm successful in getting re-elected okay and so for people that might not be that familiar with who you are just tell us a little bit about yourself sure okay well i 've lived in the clarence valley we moved my husband and i and my a bit of a lifestyle change and ended up managing the most beautiful place in the world almost is woody head camping ground in bungeelung national park so we also were tourists for years before we moved there to manage the park so we turned our dream holiday destination into our working place and it was an honour and a privilege to look after that wonderful camping ground yeah so we 've been here for 20 years okay great uh so yeah they 're going to be at least five new faces on council a couple of those potentially returning from from other generations but um what do you think that would be like having a fresh uh some fresh faces on council look i think it 's i think that 'll be great because the five councillors who are retiring have wanted to retire for some time and of course with the election being postponed a couple of times that 's made it a bit difficult for them so i think they 'll be pleased when their job is done and of course if you 're not really wanting get the best out of people when they 're not happy in their job so i think it 's going to be great that we 'll get potentially nine new councillors i 'm not taking it for granted that i will get reelected i hope i do but of course you know you can 't take that for granted it 's a democracy and the 16 candidates so that 's wonderful and i 'm really happy that there 's four women this time that 's great included yeah so hopefully we might see more than what there was two on the previous council yeah sadly we lost two at the last election two but it 's always it 's really important that we have a diverse a diversity of candidates because um they 're supposed to be representing our community and what our community looks like and our community is about 50 50 in gender women and men so yeah i think it 's really important to have more women on the council because that 's the reflection of what our community is so i 'm really hopeful that the um get on this new council yeah okay and uh what do you think some of the biggest challenges that will be the new council will face well i think financial sustainability is always one of the big ones um and we have millions of dollars being thrown at us at the moment for uh capital works projects which is all very wonderful you know we 've got 31 new bridges that are happening and and lots of other projects which is fabulous but of course it does it does make other it creates other issues for us as a council whole of life costs and perhaps even extra staff to run the you know things the community tree lands drive center when the library is in you know it 's great but it also has a negative and we need to be careful how we manage that those grant funds and but you know no one ever wants to knock them back but we do have to be careful and the financial side of council is something that i 'm very interested in because i 'm a businesswoman and have to live within our own means and uh and i want our council to be financially sustainable and spend less than our income that 's what we need to do okay okay and um so speaking of capital works and things like that what about here is a yamba local the um the amber bypass is a big issue here what are your thoughts on on that yeah look the amber bypass has been on the agenda for i 'm not sure a couple probably more than two decades probably longer than when i arrived here i think it 's important but it 's not the be all and end all because it only starts once you get over the oyster cove bridge so we 're still going to only have the one lane from the highway all the way through palmers island into yamba and over the oyster cove bridge so i think the reality is we probably need to be a little bit more ambitious and look at other ways of coming in off the highway having another route in off the highway which isn 't going plain we you know yamba is a flood plain but there 's been arguments from staff for some time that it 's not needed yet but we need to make sure that we don 't wait until it is needed because the planning that 's involved in things like that takes years and we still haven 't acquired all the land that we need to do the section from the oyster cove bridge through to angary road so we 're still a little way off but yes it is important and i thank the the councillors way before us to at least get us to this stage yeah okay and uh just from your most pre recent term what would you list to some of your major achievements oh okay well um the roundabouts would be one in yamba um they started off as uh they were it was resolved council had a resolution that they were going to be three sets of traffic lights and the community the amber community did not want three sets of traffic lights so i put forward a recision motion and we had an people with placards and we managed to reverse that decision and the reality on the on the on the roads now as we have three wonderful roundabouts so i 'm really happy that we were able to reverse that decision because the councillors who supported it um weren 't from yamba but the yamba community were determined they did not want traffic lights and i 'm really happy that we were successful with that one and also the ceiling of james creek road and mcintyre 's lane there were two gravel roads that were community wanted sealed and especially mcintyre 's lane i 'd fought for at least 10 years with notices of motion and community community meetings on the side of the road and i found an old clipping just recently and i saw people in there that are no longer with us anymore which was sad but um but i felt relieved when we finally achieved that as well but it 's an indication of how long you fought for it yes yes i 'm a bit of a dog with a boner if it 's something the um to fight for it if i can okay yeah and so yeah just to wrap up uh yeah on election day saturday december the fourth why should voters vote vote one for karen toms well i hope they 'll give me their number one vote what 's important to me as a counselor is transparency and accountability and i think we 've been lacking in that this last term which upsets me a little and i think we need to learn respect some of our community members are treated quite badly and you know we 're even banning some community members through our unreasonable complainants policy and it actually upsets me greatly that you know they ring up to find out something and they haven 't even put in a complaint to be honest i 've just requested information that that um they 're they 're actually eligible to get under the gipper act and and we 're not doing what we should do and they 're treated very badly and and that just upsets me and i i continue to fight for the community i think we need there and leadership is is about respect and serving serving the community and i think you know we need to remember that and i think that 's been lacking leadership 's been lacking and serving the community so please vote number one karen toms okay thanks very much for joining us karen and uh to find out to watch more of our meet the candidate q a interviews uh just head to clarencemedia.com thank you you _"

    "text": "welcome to clarence media 's candidate q a today i 'm joined by lower clarence 's bill day welcome bill thank you bill and uh a man who was once on mclean council for many about a decade tell us a little bit about your history i was born in mclean but uh and educated in mclean but uh i traveled overseas for a number of years i worked in a number of places different countries and i 've had various businesses in uh various towns around australia but uh the lower clarence mclean and yamba in particular have always been home to me i 've never felt at home except when i 've been back here and i always come back and lick my wounds and vow i 'm never going to leave again and i 'm now retired and i 've just renovated my house at palmer 's channel and i don 't ever intend to leave okay and uh when you were previously involved with council you 're heavily involved with tourism is that an issue that you 're keen to see brought up in council tourism with the way clarence valley council has performed and obviously i believe i can make a difference and that 's why i 'm standing and certainly what they 've done in tourism has been disgraceful but it 's i 'm not i 'm not a one-trick painting there 's a lot more a lot of other issues more deeply disturbing than tourism okay do you want to sort of highlight what some of those are that um well certainly what challenges that the new council will face one of the greatest issues is the lack of accountability the lack of transparency and using tourism as an example rather than it being the primary concern that i have with my 20-odd years of experience in tourism where we won many awards and we did many good things i tried to tell this council where they were going wrong in tourism the mayor asked me to prepare a written plan i did a ten point plan over many hours didn 't even get acknowledged when i gave it to him i then had a meeting with the acting general manager and the 's policies on tourism i said no i don 't and they said well from we will agree to disagree from now on on we will not answer any questions that you put to council staff about tourism now that 's pretty typical of how they treat anybody the kindest thing you can do to anyone is give them constructive criticism but clarence valley council don 't want to hear it okay so yeah obviously a need for a bit of transparency on council and a bit of change there perhaps and i was also aware obviously a local paper is printing many of your letters clarence media will welcome those in the future um so um i 've never hid my feelings i believe in total honesty total transparency and i 've written many letters to the editor during the time the daily examiner was a printed newspaper and with the independent now and uh i 've never tried to hide what i think and some people appreciate that some people don 't like it the council don 't like it so how do you think uh yeah the like is it what 's been the reception from people that in your circle about you running for council everybody running for political office gets what 's called candidates disease and people come up and pat you on the back and you think oh heavens above i 've got five pats on the back i must be doing well there happens to be 30 000 people in the electorate and some of the people who pat you on the back just want to make you feel good and they 're not going to vote for you so i 'll i 'll leave any predictions and i 'll i 'll i 'll see if i 'm not elected that 's fine there 's plenty of good candidates i want to be elected i need number one votes to get elected i 'm not backing off from that but more than any one person we need a good team of new councillors and not just new councillors there 's some very good current councillors who are standing again very good council for only four standing for re-election and as our viewers would hat in the ring some new people what do you think of fresh obviously more than half accounts will be fresh faces what do you think that means for clarence valley moving forward i think it 's great but you have to have you have to combine experience with new ideas and i 'm very confident that we 're going to see an excellent team um running the new council it 's a council of five councillors you must be able to count to five to achieve anything and i 'm extremely confident we will get five or more councillors who stand for reform and restructure of the current council and that 's essential okay all right well good luck at the polls on saturday december the 4th and thanks for joining us i hope luck doesn 't come into it bill okay _"

    "text": "today on clarence media candidate q a i 'm joined by council nominee peter johnson good morning how are you mate good morning bill it 's great to speak to you so um yeah what 's uh what 's driven you to want to put your hand up for council well my family have lived in the in the clarence valley now for nine years we moved here from the uk and uh we 've had a great time here we were moving to australia we had a choice of various places to go and uh clarence valley just ticked all the boxes it 's a great place to live it 's got the best beaches i reckon in the world it 's got wonderful national parks lovely people great culture and of course a wonderful river so this is just the right place for us but having come here i 've had such a good time i want to give back something back to the community and i think the best way for me to do that is to stand for council become a community representative says i 'm well first of all i 'm a teacher and most of the candidates are actually business people and that 's a good thing it 's good to have business people but everybody being business people that may not be such a good thing so i represent diversity and i i represent young people as well because i 've worked with young people for 28 years and i think i know what i can what i can do to help but also i know how to listen and how i can how can liaise with young people in the council so that 's one thing i represent i 'm also very much a people person so i 'm i 'm used to dealing with people and working with people from every background and every age and ability and i think that 'll be something i can bring to the council here okay and uh you also emphasize here that you 're really strong on community involvement trying to get the community active well i think there 's two there 's two sides to being a counsellor um if you let me to be a counselor to go to council meetings to make planning decisions and those sort of things and i suppose what i see the boring things but the thing that will really bring joy to me is being a community representative you elected me to be a community representative and to go out and and represent people and to try and make the clarence valley better and that 's what i 'm really looking forward to do and that 's the thing that brings most excitement to me okay we 're very good now you say the boring thing is that all the procedure but you 're certainly not going to have any trouble handling all of that being from what i 've heard a a top class math teacher extension maths you 're all over that sort of stuff well thank you that 's very kind of you to say i mean i i i do like maths and i think the financial side of the things will be something i 'll have a good understanding of i 'm also an engineer that was my degree so uh look at planning decisions i 'm good at looking at technical drawings and and uh seeing besides you know to visualize what the drawing represents so i think that 's something as well that i 'll bring to council i have to say unfortunately within teaching we 're very used to paperwork too and that 's one of the things i can expect a fair amount of in the council so there 's there 's that side to it but as i say the real joy for me is actually working with people and that i think is going to be my joy in the council okay i guess one of the things standing in your favor is the fact that there 's five councillors not going to re-stand for re-election and many of those in the grafton area in particular um what i guess what 's your outlook the fact that it 's going to be quite a new looking council um what that should be mean for the current valley well i think it 's a very exciting time for us for for starters with the hopefully the new start it 's almost like it 's a spring and uh we 're going to be restarting a lot of things and a lot of things to grow and perhaps some things that weren 't working so well we can leave alongside and some new things that might be a new good idea a new way to go forward we can bring forward so one of the things i 'd really like to do very early on is to have a an activity sign up day and i 've actually uh i 'm in the process of organizing that at the moment it 'll be in in january we 're probably going to be in the grafton market on a thursday night and i 'm just sorting out a location in mclean yamba but i think i 've got somewhere going and the idea is we 're going to invite clubs and sporting organizations voluntary organizations all of these things to come and set up a store and encourage the the people of the valley to come around and to see the things that really interest them clarence media be great when it gets closer and uh because one of the wonderful things is when you when you start looking there 's so many amazing organizations and things that are out there i mean there 's you know from coot 's crossing uh croquet club to uh to the uruguay land club that go around and deal with the environment to you know the performing arts clubs and and everything else there 's something out there for everybody and what i 'd really like to see is people of the valley really getting involved in these things because we need the people to be involved we also need people for the voluntary organizations as you know i 'm in the rfs but the ses is looking for more members there 's of course marine rescue there 's things like meals on wheels and something else i 'd really like to encourage a lot of the clubs struggling to find people to be secretaries and and treasurers and those sort of things and there 's a lot of retired people perhaps who who can 't do other things but they 'd love to see them get involved perhaps in these clubs perhaps they 're not they 're not ready to play uh soccer anymore uh you know i 'm in super aldi soccer but it would be great if we had some people to come on the committee there and uh to help us out even if they 're not players so so that 's something i 'd really like to like to do and that 's something we 're going to do in early in early january excellent all right okay well i think that 's covered quite a lot there peter thanks a lot for joining us and good luck in on september on december the 4th thank you very much thank you and if you want to find out more about uh follow the all the candidates just head to clarencemedia.com.edu and get in

    "text": "today 's guest on clarence media 's meet the candidates q a is steve pickering thanks for joining us steve thanks bill and uh i hope you don 't mind i 'm going to give you the unofficial tag of mayor valmara thanks bill i 've actually heard that one once or twice before thank you so just yeah tell us a little bit about some of the work you 've done in recent years in this township so i moved to almar about five years ago before the bypass happened in elmira and the clarence valley and i wanted to see a plan i wanted to see a vision for the valley and also for almira after that bypass opened i wanted to see a direction so i called a town meeting and through that town meeting we engaged with the community and also council and our state politicians to put through suggestions and ideas as to the vision that we 'd like to see for the whole the whole area um the the the process was all documented by council the plan was written and uh we 've state government grants to to put that plan into action we 've seen small pieces of it of it already happening and i 'm really looking forward to to the once the tender process is over and construction starts the vibrancy that 's going to occur in in the area as well as the uh elmara will become a much more pedestrian friendly location will be more welcoming to visitors and tourists with dedicated um parking for large vehicles and and also uh free camping for um rvs and and the like at the show grounds okay so yeah you 've proven yourself as a bit of an organiser in the community uh why have you decided to now run for council i already do a lot of work with the community through my work with the ses and rfs and the clarence valley cultural committee and i 'd really like to be able to expand that work that i 'm already doing throughout the valley even more i think that by becoming a counselor it 'll give me the opportunity to see the projects through instead of just coming pieces it would allow me to to work with more people and to actually go from where to go and i 'm really looking forward to that so do you have some specific examples of things that you 'd like to get involved with an overall vision for the valley well some things that i would really like to see are we already have a lot of tourists and visitors coming to the area and i 'd like to see those tourists and visitors spend more time in our rural areas rather than there seems to be a strong focus along the coast i think that with the purchase of the neboya power station it gives us an opportunity to to increase visitor numbers to the naboya area through white water rafting as well as uh heritage tours possibly or a museum aspect um through the power station if it 's not actually generating electricity i 'd like to see more attention brought to our smaller areas and villages there 's a lot of focus on our main capitals and uh mclean yamba and grafton um there 's a lot need and want changes to occur in their areas they they have a vision and uh that they would like to see documented and i really like to help them um go through that process and and see uh how we can improve uh the whole valley for everybody that lives and works here okay and uh so you on the campaign trail you 've been out and about in the community how have you um found the response to steve pickering running for council uh it 's been great um i 've really enjoyed the process so far uh even after the initial delay of the election back in september so with the lockdowns and different regulations it 's been difficult to get out and about to uh to all areas and to meet people but i have been spending time in some smaller areas and walking around markets and having people come up to me in shopping precincts for instance i 've had lot of people coming to see me uh at work as well and uh the response has been overwhelmingly positive people are really keen to be managed how they how they would like to see it managed what their visions are what their problems are what their concerns are uh people are really open and free um to talk to me and they have been doing it i 've learned a lot about uh issues that i had never considered before and i 've already been helping some people through those those issues and i 'm looking forward to doing that with more people in the future okay and uh if people want to find out a bit more about yourself how do they find you so you can come to my website at stevepickering.com.u there 's contact details there i 've got a blog there 's some videos i also share all my social media posts

ago now so you now have the honor of being our first guest on parents media 's q a with the candidates so welcome well thank you for having me yeah so hopefully third time lucky will actually have an election before the end of the year and a new council sworn in for the first time since 2016 in the scheme of things that 's been quite a long time it has it has been long it 's a long time in waiting but i 'm a patient man and i know look there 's councillors that want to get out they 've had enough and there 's a lot of candidates who want to have a crack at it and get in and maybe make a difference and i 'm one of them all right so yeah there 's plenty of calls in the community for fresh blood and as you indicated a you think a fresh new direction will be good for the clarence valley look i 'm talking to people and yeah they 've uh there 's there 's a element of trust that 's been lost and uh the current current crop of nine councillors there 's only going to be four re-run and i think it 's it 's just time it 's time for a change and i 've been talking to people and they go you know there 's going to be at least five new faces and they 're going you know good good to see you the the councils that are in there they 've got other other plans they 're getting tired they 're getting fatigued with it all and it is it 's a tough job and i can see that i 've been to a couple of meetings and followed them on on zoom and on the various platforms uh facebook etc and um yeah it 's it 's a tough gig but uh i 'm kidding we 're keen to have a go and there 's a whole bunch of new excellent so you 're the proud owner of ice cream here in grafton uh inventor of the jacaranda ice cream uh a former president of the jacaranda festival tell us a little bit more about jeff smith jeff smith you know jessica came to grafton as a young man 28 years ago i was out of work for eight months uh my mom was hanging out with my pants i was wearing thongs i 've grown a beard very tough to get a job applied for 52 different jobs couldn 't get a start anywhere finally finally cracked it with the den grafton and district business enterprise centre run by john pollinger uh still good friends with john and uh in a way i went it was like once i got a job suddenly i had jobs so i ended up having three different part-time jobs there 's been all sorts of things i 've done in insurance salesmen i 've done tafe teaching i 've done house restoration work there 's been a whole string of stuff and yeah we 've really settled in i 'll tell you i here all righty and tell us uh jeff in a nutshell why you personally have decided to run for council well look every everyone i speak to and myself including we 've all got to have rights with council i know they try their best they do a great job in certain areas but other areas a little bit lacking or i could see a new vision this just needs needs some imagination and a bit of energy there and i just want to replicate what what i have helped to achieve with the jacaranda festival it was the same sort of it was tired it was going nowhere going backwards very quickly and myself and others we 've got enough people on board to to change that and change it in a big way and you saw the results in 2019 uh look i know the council area is a much more ambitious project it 's far far bigger and complex than a jacaranda festival but i think i 've got something to add to it and uh and would love to be part of that team to take you own a shop here in print street grafton cbd what 's your vision for the streetscape and future development of this area look i was part of a workshop a couple of months ago to help reinvigorate print streak i 'd love to see it become a destination we came up with a there was a whole bunch of plans it was a two-day video sit-down workshop came up with a whole bunch of stuff like to see it uh become alfresco dining quirky imaginative shops local theater being played opportunity for busking opportunity for night life uh to return to prince street and to take it away from just being a thoroughfare to being being a destination so um yeah looking forward to that and of course that 's going to require state government funding and grants and stuff but at least the plans are on the table and we can start to move forward with this and just make something special for the for the people of grafton and do the whole clarence valley again do you think there 's options to open up prince street remove that uh yeah look that was all part of the the this two-day workshop there was uh looking at different different ways of parking uh widening the footpaths taking it down to one lane each way there was a whole bunch of stuff came out as well as shading trading was an issue access to market square was an issue as far as pedestrian crossings go so all that was addressed and if you want to have a look at the plan it 's pretty impressive so looking forward to that it 's a it 's a longer term plan but i think we can push that forward now within the next couple of years okay and what about rb parking in in the cbd as well that 's been an issue as well definitely needed you 've got a large parking area over the back of the saraton and behind the library there i think that can be really looked at as um as some sort of rv parking uh there 's there 's is areas there 's space here and there but uh just needs a bit of with regards to that and also know that um one of your pet peeves about grafton and i guess is uh the the tidiness of the area yeah it 's got a bit of a grotty look uh i 'd spend a lot of time in print street here and there 's this there 's council signs that are appealing there 's a bit of a grotty footpath look there 's there 's garbage and stuff and it 's it 's embarrassing when you have um visitors come and they go yeah this is not not the tidy town of old uh so like the shopkeepers they they do their best but really we just need a bit of help and just a bit of an attention to detail a little bit of a repaint here and there and just the parks and gardens immaculate you know they do a great job but just they just fall we fall short a little bit on some of the areas like yeah just that attention to detail okay about half of your constituents are in the lower clarence uh what are the uh look one talking to people is the development of yamba and where that 's going i personally i like yeah is popular because of the way yamber is now you know i i wouldn 't love to see another byron bay or another committee gold coast going up in yamba uh where a few people make a lot of money at the detriment to the people today who live there and the residents and tourists i 'd like to see it stay stay very similar but keep the character keep that beachside holiday character going it 's important to tourism mclean similar there 's uh there 's issues there not quite as uh intense as the amber but uh it just needs some planning and a bit of bold and brave vision and just to stick with it and not be pressured to um to make another another intense development site as i said where a few make a lot of money and it 's really it 's just becomes another another one of those coastal towns that is ordinary okay i guess one potential bold ambitious project would entrance into amber yeah i i haven 't looked into it in great detail but maybe that that needs to be reviewed again it 's been on the table for i think 20 or 30 years and yeah maybe that uh that as part of an overall vision needs to be looked at okay uh now obviously covert has been a really testing time for everybody in the world we 've experienced quite a unique situation here in the clarence with uh well going no cases for 18 months and still being subjected to various lockdowns and then as soon as we do get a little cluster uh the new south wales government announces freedom day uh other things um you know other times have been excluded from the queensland border bubble do you think from a regional perspective the pandemic has been dealt with appropriately uh look the the covert pandemic plague as i refer to it it 's been um it 's been a major worldwide shift in inhabits and and all sorts of each country each region has had its you know its way of dealing with particularly the clarence valley we 've we 've lived in this little bubble here and been covered free basically the whole way through except for the last couple of weeks suddenly it 's flared up we noticed a big big drop in sales and people people i think were doing the right thing they were staying at home they were going into line and getting tested they were they were um they wanted to nip this thing in the bud before it expanded too much so i think the people of uh the clarence have responded brilliantly to it uh as a whole look there 's always in hindsight there 's things you could have done better but at the time this is this is unprecedented sort of stuff and um and the government and the council have done the best they could and really we 've come out of it pretty well so pre-covered all the talk was about you know house places like grafton going and cape with the bypass and that 's been completely superseded by exact covert do you think how do you think grafton businesses there been an element of resilience there uh in regards to covert yeah yeah yeah definitely look there 's uh there 's there 's been a lot of a lot of government money thrown thrown at us to help us out and that 's been excellent uh there 's been businesses that have been marginal anyway that are struggling but those that and it 's it 's a challenge for any business and you 've just got to be adaptable and that 's that 's the view that 's why i like small business you can you can change and flip and flop very quickly to adjust to the changing environment and that 's exactly what we 've done here and others up and down the street have as well and indeed the shopping centre so uh really they 've adjusted and they 've done it done very well and it 's a credit to them and it just shows how the quality of business people in this whole region okay uh and do you think is there any other important things you 'd like to bring up ahead of for a split second [Music] uh yeah look what i 've um what i 'm finding and talking around to people is there 's a there 's a lack of trust with with council at the moment there 's um there 's a lot of anger and what i 'd like to see is is council getting gaining back that trust and being seen to work for the people and to look um to look after the people and to respond to their needs and i it 's going to take a while it 's going to take a few years it 's taken a few years to to develop this anti this trust and lack of trust so i 'd like to see a team of um diversified people getting on there the nine and we all work together we all listen to the residents and and we form policy and opinion and um and action for to respond to those people uh and and their needs and to get back to see council get back to the basics of why they exist and there 's areas where they 've um really we 'd be better off just focusing in on on the nuts and bolts of it and get council to do what they 're what they 're best at okay and finally we will see a new mayor for clarence valley council after this election with current mayor jim simmons and previous mayor richard williamson both indicating they will not run for another term if elected are you willing to throw your hat in the ring for the top job and why uh look definitely not mayor uh and probably not deputy mayor because look i 'm i 'm fresh and new at this if i get on i 'm a newbie i 've got to learn how this system works and uh and definitely spend two or three years working that out there 's there 's plenty plenty to do there 's others that i know would be keen on those jobs and would be happy to support them but yeah let 's learn learn how the games played and and how we can act best for the people maybe if there 's a second term thanks for joining us jeff and good luck thank you well thank you very much _"

big warm welcome to everybody here and a big thanks to the two girls jess and laura for all the hard work that they 've put into organizing this ceremony i think that i will start this speech with a thank you this year has been very hectic and with all the recent covert changes and the numerous decisions around individuals and community safety it has been hard and a trying time thank you to all of you for attending today changes have been required so that we can hold this event this is re required patience commitment and perseverance thank you to those nominated for the work you have undertaken over the last year by have undertaken significant work to help and improve the places that you work and live in this during a time of significant impact to our daily lives thank you to the people who have decided to join you here today on this occasion you and other family and friends for those who nominated the people we are here to celebrate today with you are either their support network or inspired by their actions this year has been a wild ride we started with drought we had the worst fire season in living memory and then to do with a worldwide worldwide health pandemic on the bright side we ended up having a good season with bummer crops and good prices in addition we have been very fortunate that we have been able or can continue to feel relatively relatively safe as we go about our daily lives yes there has been some minor inconvenience but on the whole we here in the coleman shy have been able to continue our lives relatively relatively unaffected and for this we all need to be thankful thankful that we live in a country where our leaders care and are prepared to take make decisions to protect us a country where people take the advice of health experts and work together to protect people a country where people are concerned about their neighbor or mate and take the appropriate action for the best for all concern so while we have had a year that 's tested us i think we should remember that we are lucky and have a lot to be thankful for i personally congratulate the nominees and remind them that it is one of the hardest decisions council have to make every year to choose choose one person over another when we believe that all worthy worthy uh probably a holistic accolade now take the opportunity to introduce our ambassador for the day professor wiener says professor vina is an internationally recognised material scientist engineer and inventor revolutionary recycling science she is renowned for pioneering the high temperature transformation of waste in the production of new generation of green material in 2018 greener launched the world 's first e-waste micro factory and in 2019 she launched her plastic micro factory a green materials and products made entirely or primarily from waste vena also heads the arc industrial transformation research hub for green manufacturing a leading national research centre that works in collaboration with industry to ensure new recycling science is translated into real-world environmental and economic benefits in 2019 she was appointed an inaugural director of the circular economic innovation network by the new south wales government through the office of chief science and engineer ladies and gentlemen please welcome professor vegan [Applause] thank you thank you very much uh john and i want to first of all begin by acknowledging uh the traditional owners of the land upon which we meet um and that 's the variety people pay my respects to elders past present and emerging and i do want to take this opportunity to thank of course everyone here in the colemanshire to give me this privilege to come and see this beautiful place i have to say i 've only spent a day here arrived here yesterday with my husband rama and i think what we were blown away with is uh the the friendliness the the to be inspired and i think that 's really what uh what we do so well as as australians we listen we learn we help each other and i think as as we 've just heard from amir we have actually been so amazing as people while the world has actually suffered so much as australians we have come out of this relatively better off compared to so many other people in the world but that goes to fundamentally one important point the point that we actually have god values the shared values in which we do care for each other we do want to know how people are doing we 've always been conscious of fact that our first responders our frontline workers everyone who has actually worked extremely hard to keep us safe in these rather challenging times and that 's the reason why we actually as a community have come together and have come out of this relatively safely and on that note i 'd like to of course acknowledge the fantastic work that shire does and and i 'd like to of course acknowledge the mayor general manager and the team of amazing counsellors and and and everyone who actually works so hard in recognizing that to care for our people means to care for our land our environment and this is really in a way the story of what we 're all doing in our own little ways in which we can contribute so our story at unsw has been very much around how do we actually go about recycling taking care of our land our environment because nobody wants to see their world around them polluted everybody wants to have a clean place to live fresh air to breathe how do we achieve that at the practical level and this is where of course again the spirit of collaboration and working together actually delivers benefits to our communities so i do want to acknowledge and thank the fact that there are so many australian businesses who 've actually participated in this journey of research and collaboration but i think for everyone it always has started for all those australian businesses who support research starts off with that passion for knowledge and passion to make for everyone for future generations to come so i think that 's really the passion it doesn 't matter whether you live in a small community or in a large city it actually is what brings us together we know very well that by the actions that we choose to make we are going to actually create a better planet for everyone and it 's not just about how we inspire australians but in fact i 'd be bold enough to challenge all of us to think about how we might be able to inspire everybody else on this planet and i think to me that 's the one thing that i keep hearing time and time again as i present some of this work in different parts of the world that really australians are so innovative and this is something that we need to stop and and think about that all of us in our own different ways bringing our creativity and our passion to solve a whole range of challenges and the fact that we 've just had all these challenges put upon us in the year that in a positive manner and we continue to think about how are we going to recover from this what do we need to do to help each other so i think we are as a country an inspiring source of of innovation for everybody else in the world to find out you know often we hear when we talk to friends in different parts of the world so what have we done differently what makes us so different as a country and i think to me the answer lies in exactly all of us sitting here today that as a community we come together we in fact talk about what we 're doing and we talk about how we might be able to help each other and inspire each other the fact that we can do that at various community levels is in fact the story of all of us living in our communities again whether you 're in a small town or a large city we do see that time and time again and i 'd love to share a couple of those examples with you as we started environmental challenges whether they are for a waste glass or plastics or textiles and as we were building our partnerships and getting to know a lot of our local communities in sydney a tiny council and i stole this particular council the hunters hill council in in sydney in fact the reason why i chose that particular example to tell you the story about is it sort of reminds me of where i am here today is again a tiny council that 's looking after its communities wanting to play its part in showing its innovation and showing its leadership so when they approached me for the first time a few years ago asking for whether we might be able to showcase some innovative products that are made out of recycled content and could we actually put that in their little pop-up library that they were just about to set up in their community shopping centers and uh and that 's when i said well gotta come and have a look at this space uh this this sounds really fascinating so of course you can imagine that when i walked one one had to think about and imagine as to what it might look like i actually thought this is going to take a long time before this place is up and running but i can just tell you that spirit of collaboration came together so quickly that in fact this little pop-up library in the council which is indeed from what i understand is the first one they 've ever had in their council is one of those examples that shows quite clearly when innovation and community spirit come together the kinds of things that actually can be delivered are quite mind-boggling and in this case we 've never really taken our products out into community locations so the fact that this was actually the first place where we had our green ceramics a combination of waste glass and textiles and we 've taken these two very different materials combine them together and produce these hard wearing ceramics that we put them into their kitchen bench tops it actually made us so proud and it also made us realize that if we didn 't have that kind of community our science into practice and that 's really what i love about all my conversations about the inspiring conversations that i 've had over the last day here is everyone wants to see those those incredible practical solutions people want to know more about the science and the technology and the fact that we 're running these micro factories at unsw we 're producing these how are we making that happen but that 's not the only important bit of course the science and the technology and the manufacturing is important but i think the most important thing is the fact that these partnerships have allowed us to show how these products can be practically deployed what that then means is for us as a community we can actually tell each other different ways in which we can care for our environment by using these recycled materials and products in our everyday lives given we have a long way to go we still have a while to go before a lot of these kinds of manufactured solutions become mainstream but here 's another part of the little secret that you tell you that in fact in our green ceramics micro factory one of the first micro factories that we 're going to be setting up and running outside of unsw for the very first time is coming pretty close to you guys so it 's actually being set up as we speak at kuramundra for us that partnership with the local operators and the recyclers in kuramandra gave us an opportunity to actually show to the rest of the world that yes you can take a micro factory which is which is what we 're doing at unsw to show how the science works but you can take that out of the university and you can bring that into different towns and cities and you can operate and produce highly engineered products that are fit for purpose so in this case the fact that we 've created these green ceramics that are actually going into many different applications shows that we all need to come together that spirit of collaboration and helping each other is where we know we need that support from operators like the ones we 're partnering not only taking all those waste mattresses but actually manufacturing these kinds of innovative products out of waste textiles so it gives us actually enormous hope and it gives us enormous motivation to talk about how science can actually deliver practical real world solutions that can have a huge impact on lives of people not just from point of view of environment but the other important point about creating all those important jobs in our communities because i think that 's really where the excitement comes in when people want to work in their communities they also want to know that i 'm making a big difference at a global level so yes it might be a micro factory producing small quantities of these types of waste still pretty big for a for a micro factory it actually reproduces significant quantities of products but it 's enough to show to the rest of the world that what we can do as communities when we come together to show partnerships between local governments between businesses and of course universities and education sectors it actually goes to show that ultimate example of so it 's that very much that can do attitude and i have to tell you that all of our students and staff at unsw the smart center are so super excited about the fact that we are going to be running and starting up this micro factory in the near future right here at kudamandra is actually what inspires them to think about studying science and engineering it means that they can start to see what the future holds for them so as young people who care for our environment are thinking about what do i do in the future that actually allows me to continue to care for my land for my environment can i actually have my innovative spirit my creative spirit come in and make a difference not only to my own life and to my own business but to my community there are so many different ways in which you can start to think about that community spirit of recycling of manufacturing and this is why we started out these micro factories because what we wanted to show is that the products and the ability be fit for purpose so not everything has to be a mega factory you can actually start out small and you can grow big but the important point is are you creating products that are fit for purpose so that in fact shows that by doing these micro factories we are recycling our waste but also equally importantly enabling small businesses to come together and start developing new solutions and that 's really how our partnership started with this company in kudamandra called mattress recycling australia mra was really all about collecting waste mattresses so it meant that you know we had to recycle those materials otherwise a lot of that waste fabric would have ended up in landfill and this is really where of course our journey and our stories of research start they start with these small examples when we listen to so many people who are really passionate about the fact that they don 't want to put things away into landfill they actually want to see how they might be able to play a part in recycling our materials and our spirit of collaboration has actually more so as a result of these this kind of support and inspiration from industries big and small we 've actually shown that it is possible to have world-leading technologies and scientific solutions born in australia being taken to the rest of the world and i think that 's where we can show to everyone in the world that australia might be small in terms of our population but we have a big heart and i think that 's the important message here we bring our heads and our hearts together when we start to think about how we might be able to deliver a huge impact on the rest of the world and i think that 's what we do so well as as our spirit at the local level takes on a whole range of innovative ideas we can inspire the rest of the world to actually come together with us on this journey of caring for our people and caring for our environment and for me it 's been an absolute privilege to be here today and to share with you some of our stories and learn who are here in this beautiful place doing what they do so well and inspiring the rest of the country so thank you so much for this opportunity and for this privilege to be here today um thank you john and professor veen for those words

    "text": "Professor Joseph Drew here from UTSA since my last video Felicia I believe it 's on the new water and sewer prices now if you 've watched my other videos my wife 's video and particularly you know my approach to things if you 're one council you have one product at one price just the same it doesn 't really matter where I go to buy a violet crumble that pay the same price I unwrapped the chocolate bar and I get the same chocolate bar and no one ever ever contributes to the awards the cost of my chocolate bar nor do I expect anyone else to pay for part of my chocolate our same deal with council services it is a little bit more complicated water and sewer than what waste is because there 's some guidelines that we must follow first of all the state government tells us we must fully recover costs plus get a return on capital what that means is we get a little profit now clearly that hasn 't happened because our water fund and our sewer funds are about to be present to do the work that we need to do on the water pipe still a cool mantra and the sewer plan to come to go the prices must give you strong signal so you use your water carefully the supply charges must cover fifty percent of the total revenue so you will remember your water your water charge notice comes in two sections there 's an access charge just to be hooked up to the water grid we 'll have the potential be hooked up and there 's also supply charge for every thousand litres or one kiloliter we charge you X number of dollars now what this is saying is that my supply charge needs to be high enough so that it doesn 't so it covers at least 50% of the total revenue that really puts a floor under the minimum price I can charge you for your supplier charge I 'd like it to be lower than what I ended up recommending but because of this real at Karthi number four is that I need to encourage you to conserve water there needs to be two increased by at least 50% so that once again forces me to charge you a certain amount of money and cross subsidies which were rampant previously must be removed there the reals we must play by it in every you must play by so let 's have a look at your current water charge most of you on the standard access which is 20 millimeters formerly CUDA mundo is paying 371 per you gonna go to 30 I 'm proposing 400 I need to get enough money to finish the water pipe work and then I need to have enough money in what we call our capital reserve so if something goes wrong our pipe bloke blows up or pump stops working we actually have money to fix it because at the moment we don 't essentially now there 's also some non-standard access that 's very few people have these they 've got bigger pipes because I have bigger water demands for some reason those people the price goes up by the square of the diameter if you cast your mind back to primary school mathematics you 'll remember diameter is twice the radius so just trust me on this if you don 't want to go back to your mass it all I need to do is work out the proportion that the diameter increase by Square and then times up by 400 and that will give you a perfect increase in price that 's perfectly in line with the extra volume award here you can carry through those pipes and that 's what I 've done here so all these figures worked out simply by I 'll give you an example the 40 mil part I went 40 divided by 20 I squared that to get 4 I times that by the original price 400 that gives me 1600 vacant charges will be the same as people who don 't have vacant plots of lien we charge from the full rate that 's because these people obviously won 't have to pay usage costs because they have no tax on their lien but it 's reasonable that people with vacant blocks of land do pay a charge because when you go to sell a block of land water it can be hooked up to town water that gets you a premium you actually get more money for your land so it 's not unreasonable to ask people to contribute a little bit towards this premium that they 'll get when they eventually sell their land or when they hook the house up build a house and hook it up and wanna use the water so supply charges this is what happened previously CUDA Manta just had one they didn 't have the two tears that we 're supposed to have 225 for residential 247 for business so there was cross subsidization happening here we were slugging business for more money for the same amount of water now the cost of providing a thousand liter water of water to businesses precisely the same as providing a thousand liters of water to your house there 's no reason for the price to be different it was a cross subsidy there was even more so the case for community organizations they were paying much less at this cross subsidization real say quite clearly that we 're not allowed to cross the tiers are supposed to go up by 50% then and they 're now recommending two tiers so we needed to change that too so what I 'm recommending is 2 per kill Anita for the first 39 kilolitres per quarter now the reason why I 've gone to 2 I experimented with a number of different prices but I had to make sure I met that real which was I got at least 50% of our revenues for the supply charges and unfortunately water use goes up and down with the seasons and up and down year by year depending whether those droughts on or not the only way I could guarantee to get at least my 50% was setting that fee at 2 once I set the fee for the first tee at 2 your second tier just is the logical conclusion it must go up by 50% so the lease it could be was 3 now why have I gone for 39 kilolitres per quarter my idea is I want people who can 't afford to pay the extra for the water to be able to avoid of water so I looked at the stream Bureau statistics data the average number of people per household in the new kudamon Facundo areas 2.3 I rounded it up to three people to be generous and to make sure we 're looking up the families the bear in mind is the number of people in your house up your capacity to live on this water increases for instance you put the washing machine or on for whether there 's one person 's washing in there or there 's three people 's washings in there there 's some sort of the economy 's if you get more people in the household so anyway I went off three people and the minimum water that 's usually the maximum order that sort of allowed to be used usually in drought scenario is 140 litres per person per day that 's what it is in Temara so times that 140 liters per person per day by three times by 365 for the number of days and year divided by four to turn it back into a quarter because your bills are quarterly not daily 39,000 litres per quarter at the lowest tier so people who can 't afford a big increase they can reduce their water use to that and now that 's used in a lot of drought stricken places like MLS and if they do so they 'll get their water in a lot of cases cheaper than what they 're currently paying for it you 'll recall kid Amanda was 225 I 'm proposing 2 steerer for going to go than what they had previously unfortunately so that 's the reasoning behind those charges now it 's always interesting to see what other algae 11 councils are doing but bear in mind just because these councils are charged in these fees doesn 't mean it 's right you can see quite clearly some of them are abiding by the guidelines and they may not have the budget emergency y 'all having they may have money in their capital reserves for water and don 't have to do much work we 've got the opposite situation would hardly any money left in a couple reserves heaps of work to still do so up to 160 to 79 you 'll see these are in your tears I don 't like that I like quality is that way you don 't get a nasty surprise and that very last bill of the year yes Valley for a TD remand what I 'm suggesting and higher supply costs starting at 14 kara 215 lots cheaper a thick supply costs much dearer for the whole lot Caban yeah the same as I 'm suggesting but deer air supply charges so I understand it 's going up for a lot of you I 'm very sorry about I hope it doesn 't cause too much pain that you can see that I 'm pretty well in the ballpark you 're not being asked to do anything that no other people and similar sized councils are having to do so what is come to Tate as I say goes up and down with the seasons and a sensitive surprise and then we have years when we had droughts and floods and things like that that 's what really box me into that 2 price I was trying to is a certain amount of money we must get to be able to finish the water add to work on the water pipes include Amanda I need to get it and I need to get money back in those all-important capital reserves because if I don 't get money back in there and the pump blows or pipes below we don 't have the money to fix it we can 't_''_565.09 be in that situation so I hope you understand what I 've done what I 've done now let 's have a look at sewer charges now I think that 's probably already occurred to a lot of you that one community all lives on one thing on the wind another thing so done the guy their water fees went up but their sewer fees are going down and that 's the opposite for CUDA mandra so if you look at what 's happened previously CUDA mandra 's paying for 54 Gundagai was paying 800 that 's despite the fact that you were one council one product one group was paying twice as much as that but it doesn fees should have been harmonized day one after the forced amalgamation by the administrators they 'd been done then we 'd be in much better financial position than we what we are now end it would have been fairer for the last four years but we can only deal with what we 've got so I 'm trying to fix them now for you my proposal is we go down to 700 vacant previously paid far less particularly in Gundagai I 'm proposing they pay half the access fee and there 's a similar story to the water connection if you 've got a block of land you 're selling it has access to sewer you get paid quite a big premium for that block of land when you sell it now if you 're going to make money when you sell it land as only fear that you contribute towards the infrastructure of the sewer plant in particular undergone needs to be fixed which is required in order for you to make this extra money now it 's half instead of the whole because unlike water there 's no the fee for Suez dead so let 's look at what happens around the traps Leaton 600 yes Feli 700 cow 723 so those two are similar to me Caban 600 bear in mind these people might not have budget emergencies like we have we 've got millions and millions and millions of dollars to spend on Gundagai civil plant next year it must be done we have insufficient money to get that work done then we got to make sure that we 've got money in case something else goes wrong now I was told we need a certain amount of money I wasn 't aiming for 700 neat it just happened to be the number that gave me the money that we need to do the work that we have to do so once again look guys you really do have honestly have my sincere apologies for I know it 's a lot of pain this is pain that 's been decades in the making you can see that your fees will weigh Jeepers than other similar councils all these years and certainly for the last four years so we can do the things we have to do so you can have the standard life that you want to have or need to have sewer surgeon work has to be done we 've got to bring in this additional revenue as I said now look unconsciousness worst possible time level as far as business and councils very conscious of the got hardship provisions if you want to people doing it particularly tough at the moment look right into the council and they 'll sort something out some relief for you now on the last night it 's quite a sad no I must say goodbye as you know I 'm a full-time academic I haven 't been a full-time academic this year I 've been full-time working for khuddam and redundant guy up until next Thursday and I need to get back to my work that 's pouring up around the ears and I 've got a high court case to prepare for that I 'm an expert witness so goodbye but I 'm not forgetting about you your counselors know how to get hold of me your sure that we 're sticking to the plan and everything 's going well I 'm sure we will and I 'm sure we 'll deliver great outcomes for you and I really think you for your time over these last three months bye _"

    "text": "that 's a drew here from the University of Technology Sydney I have two final videos for you to do to do for you the first one this one is on the waste chargers and the next one I 'll be looking at the water and sewer charges and then I have to sign off and go back to being a full-time academic which is my normal job so let 's talk about waste when I go to buy a violet crumble at Willie 's a Tim lift I pay the same price as I did for the violet crumble at Woolies CUDA mantra and as I did for the violet crumble will Lisa come to God I unwrapped the chocolate bar and I found the same chocolate bar inside yeah I think like the government 's a lot part of that with one local government we have one product and should be at one price I think most of us can agree to that as a general principle we don 't expect other people to chip in and pay from my chocolate bar expect that if I 'm consuming that chocolate bar the actual cost to make the thing to transporter and overhead costs of the company and I think we can agree that that 's reasonable to for our local government now previously the waste charters that these two councils were very very different you know as I 've said before this should have been changed day one after the forced amalgamation that 's quite strange and I don 't think it 's been his right that we 've been paying two different fees for essentially the same service for the last four years so khuddam and residents were paying for two hundred and ten dollars per year undergo residents were paying for 36 plus an additional 58 for an organic waste charge vacant charges of both councils were actually the same than in both cases they weren 't sufficiently high to cover the course and I 'll talk about that in a minute business waste charges were very different kudamon they were charged on a per service per pickup basis where 's that Gundagai low is same as the domestic waste services and at Gundagai the rural have a office of local government 11 councils doing these are cancels they 're supposed to be similar to you bear in mind that they took charges might not be covering the cost Eva else clearly weren 't by the size of your waist capital reserves so I 'm not saying these the right ones I 'm just trying to give you idea of the going price only turns to 75 plus another 54 yes was 397 plus another 120 that 's the dearest one there Kara 's 45 for 25 and carbon was three hundred and eighty four dollars what am i proposing well they 've got to change clearly because we had two different prices and we should be playing one price one chocolate par one castle one price so there is an increase here for domestic waste we go from 410 into Amanda and 436 in gonna go up to 456 you know can you please bear in mind that every year prices go up by a fixed percentage anyway often CPI to take into account the fact that money 's worth less every year that 's up every year so they would have been going up 2.6% anyway we 've only tapped on a tiny little bit extra on top of that to make sure that we get the money that we need to do the urgent work that needs to be done in your waste facilities the green waste has just been increased by that percentage the real waste has gone up a smidgen more now that real rural waste charge pays for work that eventually has to be done to these tip sites at some stage the hole is full we need to thought iwould planet with trees and get it back to a standard that the Environmental Protection Authority is happy with that cost millions millions millions of dollars therefore your average domestic waste customer that price of fixing the tip remediating the tip gets included in this large cost here so part of that prices to pick up your bins and actually transport them part of it is your contribution towards remediating the tip winners eventually for and the real waste charge is essentially the same thing we 're just asking everyone we 're gonna have to fix the tip side at some stage we 're gonna have to fix places like board hill where we transfer on transport some of our rubbish it has to be remediated and when it happens as millions of dollars of work that has to be done that same charge I believe should also be levied on vacant land now I know they 're not using the rubbish service but you 've got to remember that lien that has council rubbish pickup services available to it gets a premium in its price so when these fake vacant land owners sell them they 're lien they 'll get essentially more money for the land because it has access to counsel rubbish pickup so it 's only reasonable they pay something towards the cost of doing that businesses as I said before I don 't expect anyone else to contribute towards a cost my chocolate pal there 's in the purse sometimes we find that businesses get slugged more because there 's a perception that they have more money but what that really means is if we slap towards the costs are picking up your rubbish and that 's not fair that 's called cross subsidization it 's just plain unfair particularly at the moment when some businesses are doing it very tough so same chocolate bar same price so what I 've proposed this as I said there 's some work that needs to be done by the Environmental Protection Authority to meet their requirements we don 't have a choice on that therefore very good at environmental grounds and we must do the work to keep the community and the environment safe and there 's work that needs to be done for workplace health and safety we need to make sure that people working in our waste facilities can do so safely without being put at risk Council has moral responsibilities in both those areas and that 's why I 'm asking for a little bit more money off you to get those things done that need to be done quite urgently Council also needs to make sure that when the time comes and we 've got to do the remediation work at the tip board have the millions of dollars that we 'll need in the bank now we do have money in our waste reserves about 2.5 million dollars but if you can imagine how much cost is involved in fixing the tip sites when we finally fill it up and leave you 'll realize that that 's only a drop in an ocean so we need to be prudent and sensible so we 're not passing on a debt to the next generation to keep putting aside a little bit of money year in year out so when this work does need to be done we don 't have to panic like we are at the moment with people little whole heap of things will actually have the money sitting there to do the work so there will be as some other changes there some of you aware council doesn 't do the recycling facility work at the kingdom under tip that 's done by a organization called Lara who an incredibly worthwhile organization but they haven 't had a contract with Council there for about five years they 've been on a to be able to plan their business going forward so what we 're going to do is we 're going to go out to what 's called competitive tinder so basically what we do is put some newspaper ads out saying what we want people to do for us and asking them to tell us the price they 're prepared to do it now there is a competitive tendering arrangement that means that other organizations could tender for that work and conceivably winner if they have the best price and the best value for council we need to make sure that ratepayers are getting the best best value they imagine most of you like me you 're really really hoping that Laura keeps the work because they seem to be such a good work wild organization but Oh Laura understands they have to be competitive they understand this is a business arrangement they understand that the residents and ratepayers need to get good value and I 'm personally I 'm pretty confident I don 't have any in size groups here but I 'm personally pretty confident that these guys 15 years I probably know it better than us better than council I 'm pretty confident I put in a winning bid but they understand and we understand that at the end of the day best value for counsel particularly at this Junction where we have a budget emergency also there was talk about harmonizing the bins the bins of bigger thundergirl include a mantra and council was thinking that paying for those bins I put a stop to that a because we don 't have money be-because Gundagai residents brought their own bin so it 's only reasonable you buy your own bins and see because some of you might actually be happier with the smaller 120 later Ben if you don 't need a bigger bin such a waste of money to go and buy you a bigger bin so what I 'm proposing instead is look if you 're a family or whatnot and you need the bigger bin and you 're prepared to pay the cost price for it Castle we 'll give you that bin at cost and start picking up the bigger beam if you 're happy with the 128 or bin you have now you 'll just keep having it and you won 't have to pay anything I think that 's pretty fair for everyone kit fees will be going up a lot about tip fees in the past most will be going up a few going down some are three still in the past we haven 't always covered our costs and what that means is if you 're dropping off mattress and you only paying 22 to get rid of it but the real cost is 48 it means that everyone else is paying for you to get rid of them mattress really not fair is it so we 're resetting those fees at the tip so they actually cover the full cost of us to deal with whatever it is that you 're bringing to the dump planes to extend services it has talked about putting food scraps collection in amongst a green collection those just talk about another service for cardboard and paper they all put on hold obviously we 're not in the position at the moment you for five years forget about anything new when things are settled down we 'll have a look at it again and if it 's prudent to do so we 'll sort it out then these bulk curbside pickups I understand that happened in cooter wonder in the past but not done to go I think I 've got that the right way around there stopping a lot of councils did do a lot of councils are moved out of them there 's a few reasons for it is just plain done unsightly it looks terrible for weeks every year here with everyone 's rubbish out on the footpath be presents a risk to the community we 'll all that rubbish lying around the dark people will trip over stuff that can be blown by a strong wind can be blown out on the road something from heaven excellent it 's really quite a dangerous practice I don 't know why ever started and see it 's incredibly expensive to drive around with a truck with several staff the jump on and off and pick up your stuff and put the future or go back to what we always did in the past cursing mine back five or ten years ago before these things became trendy we just put our rubbish in a trowel or the back of the Ute and we took it down to the tip the ourselves which is what I do it 's what a lot of people in the area do anyway you know obviously some people are going to be disadvantaged if you don 't have a towel you you 're too elderly to do it yourself but hopefully your friends or families that 'll help ya know what everyone helping each other out we all have to deal with this budget emergency so you know your neighbours too old to take it down don 't have a car to take it down and you 've got a trowel and you 're taking some stuff down yourself you know bet you take their stuff down as well okay now I 'm well aware and so it 's cancelled that this is incredibly bad timing the coronavirus coming up which has impacted a lot of if you 're one of the people who have lost their jobs at least through this or you 're one of the people who have sadly lost their business because of government policy changes federal government policy changes well then we will put it measures in place to help you out if you need the fee not to go up to help you get through it or if you need relief on the fee Council will be establishing a way for you to do that but please bear in mind that if we give you relief on this fee it essentially means that everyone else is paying a little bit extra to cover you so only if you need it if you do need it of course we want to be there to help and support you but bear in mind that by supporting youth we 're really asking everyone else to pay us a little bit extra now thank you so much for your time I have another video on Water and Sewer little coming out the next couple days and then I 'm afraid I 've gotta say goodbye bye for now thank you _"

    "text": "mr. Joseph drew from the University of Technology Sydney I know a lot of you have been watching my videos and thank you very much for having the patience listen through them all and I enjoyed meeting a lot of you at the public forums recently last couple of weeks during those public forums I told you quite clearly that your council and its current configuration is not financially sustainable into the mid term long term now I 've been doing some work since then produced a financial sustainability report for Council and it 's pretty obvious to me that you 're living in what 's called fiscal illusion that we 're not sustainable we do have a budget budget emergency now don 't penny it 's nothing that we can 't fix but there 's gonna be some changes and they 're gonna start very very shortly and I need you to be aware of why I 'm doing this and why I 'm suggesting this and how harsh it 's gonna be and what sort of timeframe until we get down to herbicide when things get better so are essentially in la-la land and you 've been in la-la land for four years for four years and some affirmation you 've been getting new things you 've got a bigger council you know new toys new playgrounds and library upgrades and Aquatic Center upgrades and all sorts of things and your rates haven 't gone up and your fees and charges haven 't gone up now that 's not reasonable we all know that if you get something you have to pay more and if you don 't pay more what actually happens is eventually you get to the stage where you 're almost running out of money now we 're not running out of money tomorrow if we don 't change radically in the next year or two they 'll be changes starting this financial year and July 1 we don 't change radically we will run out of money and there 's communities in Australia always rural communities because they 're the ones doing it tough such a central darling Shire Council where the state government decide they 're running out of money they stepped in that administrator comes him with a razor and he slashes he slashes staff he slashes services they decided in Central darling Shire Council that and one of the reports at the airstrip that 's used for the flying Royal Flying Doctors was a luxury wasn 't essential they decided the cemetery was a non-essential luxury and they planned to cut that they talked the community buses they planned to get rid of the post office it was run by the council only because the last operator went broken the next post office was a hundred kilometers or more away it 's pretty grim and I don 't want you to go through that devastation I don 't want your staff to go through that devastation and we 're not going to your castle was a hundred percent behind this plan we have a plan we have a good plan a strong plan to make this a stronger council and you 're gonna come out of this looking like the best rural council in this country but it does involve some pain I need you understand why I need you to I really need you to understand is this isn 't anything your councilors are responsible for GM is not responsible for this your financial officer is not responsible for this a lot of this goes back to the amalgamation certainly in the early period with the administrators a lot of money was wasted a lot of hire ongoing expenditures not locked you into them they will be a weight around you for many years and then also some of the other things go back decades and decades and decades like your water pipes and khuddam and Renier sewer system in Gundagai these problems have been building up over decades and they should have been dealt with earlier but look that 's no one 's there 's no nothing to be gained by blame there 's nothing to be gained by plane by panicking either it 's no one person 's problem that we 've all got a pitch in and fix it so I 've showed you these graphs before and it 's quite clear you 're spending well over ten million dollars a year more since amalgamation than what that 's fine if you 're getting more money but you 're not yeah this is probably your typical operating revenue here this revenue is actually appears higher and this year because what we call capital Graham 's capital grants is when a state or federal government gives your council money and says this is the money to build the new playground and under God and they 're only allowed to spend it on the new playground and come to go they 're not allowed to spend up and paying wages day in day out or buying consumables that the council needs new mowers and fuel and stuff like that so it makes things look better like they are these capital grants but it doesn 't do anything to fix our problem our problem is that we 're not getting enough operating revenue to cover our operating expenses at day-in day-out expenses our wages are consumables and you simply cannot start spending ten million dollars a year extra and not increase clear increase your revenue and be a viable proposition into the future that simply can 't continue these are 'm going to show you a couple graphs in a minute these are our g11 councils the office of local government groups you into councils that are similar in your i OG 11 group hilltops your neighbours in death yes felling is another danger that 's in there you 'll know what those councils are life and how similar they are to you this is your operating performance ratio when the decision must be made to the magnate councils we were told that one of the key ratios was this one and that amalgamation was going to improve it and it hasn 't look at these graphs I 'll explain how they work the bluegrass 2017 yellow grass 2018 green grass 2019 this is what 's called a box-and-whisker plot what 's in the rectangle is the middle 50% of councils above the rectangles a top 25% of councils below the rectangles the bottom 25% of councils the gray line here is the median that 's a middle number if you put them in descending order and the cross is the average I 'll show you in the yellow graph average just like a cricket this average that 's the middle so you 're the straight line that 's next to that graph as kunam and redundant guy and as you can see in 2017 which was a strange year it 's a bit longer because of when the amalgamations are done it 's not a particularly good one to look at you earned that by odom 25% of councils 2018 you were the very bottom Council 2019 you in the bottom 25% of councils going now it 's normal for these things to jump around a little bit close but it 's not normal to be in that bottom of quarter all the time and you 've been in there too long and we 've got to change it we 've got to turn the ship around and we are turning the ship around from next financial year which starts first light onwards his nexus for Asia here 's another one you 're not going to like to hear this this is your fees and charges as a percentage of your expenditure so how much of your council 's the better and more sustainable yeah and you 're pretty close to the bottom quartile you 're the very bottom got a little bit better here but you 're still well until that bottom 50% basically your fees and charges are too low you compare yourself to surrounding councils you 'll see that pretty quickly you can pack leader magnitude under though you 'll see pretty quickly sometimes it goes one way sometimes it goes either way your charges and fees were too low for too long and because of that we 're now running out of money to do the essential work that must be done so let me give you some examples so I 'm comparing you hear yes Valley one of your neighbors I 'm not saying they 're right there perfect or anything else just giving you an idea of the going price so four ways for your rubbish bins kunam under is payment for ten gun dealers paying for ninety four yes Valley is paying five hundred and seventeen when you add up those two numbers you 're paying less than the going rate you surprising to me that we don 't have enough money to do the work that we need to do on the tippet moment look at water cut him under 371 gun to go to 30 yes Valley for eighty you 've been doing it for decades and decades and decades it 's not surprising to me that Nick we don 't have enough water to finish the work fixing the water pipes that we 've got to finish at Kurt Amanda same with sewer this one 's particularly disturbing because Gundagai resonance of pain twice as much as cooter restlessly I know in water his opposite way that it wasn 't quite that much of a difference I firmly believe one counsel which you are now what we like or not until the boundaries Commission makes the decision one council one product one price always give the example violet crumble crock Latoya child enjoy if I buy my violet crumble from Woolworths CUDA mantra I expect to get the same violet crumble at the same price as if I go down to Gundagai and buy the violet crumble from the work but you haven 't been paying the same price and that 's got to change and that makes these feed changes even worse yes Valley seven hundred bucks is probably the going price when you look at surrounding councils I 'm not saying that surprised that 's going up too but realistically you 've got to be paying close to the going price to be able to afford to do the things that must be done and there 's work to be done and they 've done to go still works here 's the novigrad explains things again this time I 've got your rates and your fees and charges in and you can see 2017 so strange years I say you 're in the bottom 50% 2018 you 're pretty close to the bottom 2019 you know the bottom 30% will say your rates also and lower than a typical council so I showed you this table was before the new harbor noise rates that 's not increasing your race that 's just making them equal between the two old chart of chives you compare yourself to the about a hundred bucks less for residential rates about three hundred bucks less for farming at five hundred bucks less for business well you can 't_''_627.98 be getting less revenue and expecting to have enough money to do all the things that Noel do your little council has to do now I 'm sure it hasn 't escaped you 'll notice that our genome which is what Gundagai used to be you know LD 10 which was what khuddam under you used to be the rates were cheaper so it 's quite obvious that as you get bigger you go from right to left the rates go up so all the who hire about will make you a bigger counseling you 'll save money we should have been a little bit suspicious about if we looked at the rates now bridges for rates for different types of councils but it 's what we 've got now at present you know g11 counseling your rates are much lower than overall of g11 councils that 's not a problem getting less revenue as long as you expenditure slower but it 's not as well and I won 't display them here but the mo report which you 'll be able to read in a few weeks time and your pretty average for water your pretty average facility pretty average of the road this is everything else all bad things or sport grounds recreation grounds community support that we give all sorts of things aquatic centres a lot of what council does in fact and you can see in 2018 you in the top 25 percent so you 've got below average revenue but you 've got way above average expenditure you 're in the top half here probably in top 30 percent in 2019 so low average revenue way above average expenditure that 's got to change clearly staff expenditure of heard a lot of people talk about what 's happening in staffing since the amalgamation we 're pretty average which is good I don 't plan on any staff losing they talk about I believe ever taking a job offer person there 's enough hassles the life as it is without adding those sorts of complications to people 's lives and drawing board to reduce staff wages but we cannot have average staff wages if we 're going to have below average revenue deviations for budget your council the last two years has been going about 30 percent over budget other means is we do a budget before the financial year we say how much are we going to spend been spending about 30 percent more now the reason why I bring this up is it 's not a slackness none of these problems are caused by your council or your council workers you 've got a great group these are problems that come back to the amalgamation and some problems come back decades with the warnings all of these but we can 't spend 30% more when we 're planning to spend and still have enough money to pay our bills it 's as simple as that you can 't spend 30% more this year and what you 're planning on spending because you run out of money anyone would now part of the reason why it 's happening is we 've got some community groups who are asking for they 're gonna have to get less help in the future we just don 't have the money they need to start adjusting themselves now you as taxpayers are paying for that help help that you give to these community groups and they 're all good valid worthwhile causes but you need to hold them responsible they need to become more independent self-reliant and part of it 's also these stronger community funds which I really don 't like you know you need playgrounds and getting your new rock wall and a new push bike truck and all sorts of things as a new toy descending from heaven every week there are problem no problem because they camouflage the true situation they make it look like you 've got more money than what you have you don 't have much at all their problem because you 've got your council building new playing arounds they have to do it the state government tells them gives them the money and tells them you must spend that money on doing this and it must get done they 're doing that instead of rubbish right getting your water in yes all right give him the pricing right as price and should have been fixed up day one by the administrator but no one wanted to give you the bad news the day after a forced America motion so it 's just lingered on for four years rates have to go up remember we were prevented by law for putting them up for four years but now we know longer prevented and they 'll have to go up the other things your counsel needs to be focusing on not on this drunken community funds and the other thing that I hate about stronger community fancy say entrench this fiscal illusion yeah average person in your town sinking oh wow we 're giving you all these new things new aquatic centers new playgrounds new this new that someone else in your using every week in the newspaper and my rates haven 't gone up and my things haven 't coming up isn 't this wonderful well no it 's not wonderful because it 's not reality we 've been living in la-la land and reality go through some pain i warned you at the public forums it was coming and it is coming you 're saying here 's cuz what 's called the long-term financial planner right sure it 's in too much detail but basically councils plan how much revenue and expense you 're gonna have over the next ten years and what their financial position gonna look like three lines we 're particularly interested in i 'm looking the same fifteen councils go live on their line is the mean or the average like the cricketers average the orange line is the median line that 's the middle number if we put them in ascending order you 're the dark blue line and as you can see for the next ten years we 're planning on having less revenue than average less than typical revenue that 's fine that 's great for you guys keeps you fees down but it 's not gonna work unless our expenditures less and as you can see from this graph we 're expecting to have slightly above average expenditure versus well if you 're gonna have less a high expenditure in other councils you 're going to get this deficits as far as you can see so these are in thousands of dollars 2021 we 're planning on having a loss of two point something million again 2020 to elude planning on losing another two million 2023 we 're planning on losing your number one point something million and so forth well there 's a limit to how many years you can lose millions and you 've been losing them for the last four years before you run out of money and we 're getting to the crunch point we 're all working very hard we need the council your counselors and we 've got a great plan and we 're going to avoid the crunch point but we need your help and that 's why I 'm explaining the situation to you now it gets even worse if you take that as capital greater you know the ones I really don 't like the special community funds and all those sorts of things take them out you see the real situation they 've been camouflaging the lose four point something million this year we 're gonna planning on losing another three point something million the next year we 're planning losing another three million the next year well anyone can see you can 't_''_1030.81 do that for many years before you run out of money things have got to change and they are changing they 're changing from 1st of July this year now we have to respond to this emergency I cannot have your community devastated like Central darling so I will not allow it to happen your counselors will not allow to happen and all your staff who are great bunch of people you really should value them you 're very lucky to have it and they won 't allow that to happen we 're all going to make sacrifices to make sure it doesn 't happen but you 're gonna have to sacrifice too we all need to be part of his team with it your waste charges are going up not a terrible lot and it 's not quite as desperate some other things your water charges are going up a fair work we 've got no choice I analyze I have every dollar I think about with new charges up and I 'm trying to make it as low as possible but must get enough money to keep us afloat you still charges are going up for khuddam under residents slightly down for come to go residents that 's just gonna happen it will be what 's called a special rate variation this is when we apply to the minister put your rates up more than normal now we were prevented by law from doing that for four years window longer prevented from doing it we have to do it I 'm really really sorry but we have to do it and they 're going to be very high increases at the moment I 'm planning on having huge increases in order sending sent and another 17% and another 10% that won 't happen next financial year in the financial year I 'm hoping and I 'm very confident because you 've got such a dedicated group of counselors and staff that I 'm gonna avoid those awful numbers we 're sacrifices and keep those numbers down you 're gonna help us keep those numbers there but I 'd be lying to you if I was saying you 're not gonna have double-digit percentage increases in your rates after the next financial year because you got it just has to happen there is no way out there was I 've taken castle we 'll be cutting back costs significantly to memorize this cost but we will not be sucking any staff I do not believe in it but we 're gonna cut Harry every dollar we can find if there 's a dollar that doesn 't have to be spent for the next five years we 've got a critical time of three years but there 's an austerity period of five years so for the next five years we 've got no spare money in fact we don 't have enough money for those five years if there 's a dollar we don 't have to spend we 're not gonna spend it that means your service levels are gonna go down your footpaths more I can get murdered as my tan be filled in as much I 'm pretty confident you guys are gonna take you understand the situation we 're trying to do your best play our best for you and we are doing our best for you and this is the best and you 're gonna have lasting and standards of services and we just have to cope we 're gonna get through this five years we 're going to be the best rural Council in the state if not the country because we 're all gonna understand that council is not a bottomless pit of money it 's not a bucket that we can keep pouring money out of and when everyone understands that staff residents customers everyone understands that will be much stronger will be stronger for decades this bad experience is going to make a stronger and better favor as soon as the pressures off the budget we 're going to take the pressure off you moment we can we will everyone 's firmly committed on this if that means we have rate freezes down the track we 've been reduced freeze down the we 'll do it but for now for the next three to five years sorry guys we 're all going to be paying extra what can you do you can join the team you can be a friend of the council remember that old war ad don 't ask what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country we 'll stick the word council in there don 't ask what council can do for you ask yourself what can I do for Council I 'll give you an example two old lady down the road from different a farm she walks down that same three kilometres road that I walk down every morning for exercise and she has a bag with her she picks up rubbish she does that save council money to make a community look better we can do those lots of things when a dope knocks over your rubbish bin if you can clean it up yourself clean it up yourself when your footpath needs mowing if you can 't mail out yourself burnt yourself if you 're new in a moment or cricket pitch at the moment if you can mow it yourself know it yourself you need viração '_''_1310.72 off council I 'm sure they 'll lend one to you mark yourself yeah if you need some work done on the show grounds or something like this so only someone in the show ground committee can do it themselves yeah we 'll provide you with materials or tools if you really need it do it yourself every time you help council you 'll help in your community and you 're helping yourself every dollar is important we have a new man foreign accounts in council every dollar counts we 're not going to be saved by some great big silver bullet we 're gonna be saved by day-in day-out decisions hundreds of decisions for this communities were your staff when we have a choice to spend a dollar or not to spend a dollar we 're going to choose not to spend it and that 's what 's going to save us that 's going to reduce the pain on you join the team effort be part of the the council help us make your views on this boundary reform knowing yeah I 've told you straight out I think your best bet is to the Dean Malcom oh I think a lot of the problems go down to the Malcolm motion we 're still suffering from it will be suffering for many years even if we do get D amalgamated now at the boundaries Commission saying you don 't have to write in another submission I reject that totally we need to bury them in paper write your one line put up a video about how to do it say where you want to be about X time algum at it or be DML committed say why refer to the legislation we bury them in paper they will have to listen to you if you know someone isn 't writing the submission in the opening next week I think the council 's got some details off from the website about you know someone 's not writing submission get them to write a submission I do not want you ignored this time but I can 't do this for have friends you all have family tell your friends and family to get off the fence write the submission that will help but it won 't save us from this pain and save us from some of it that it won 't save it for us from them all of it now we 're gonna get there through this emergency I 've written a lengthy document your counselors great group of people your staff absolutely brilliant they 're all behind this plan 100% we 're going to survive you 're not going into financial administration have your counselors were allowed to have a new staff we 're allowed to have it 's not gonna happen you 're not gonna be devastated we have a plan we 're gonna follow the plan we 're gonna win we 're gonna try it but we need your help we need you to help us help you this is your time to join the team thank you so much for your time and look forward to talking to you in the next videos bye _"

    "text": "they professor just drew here from the University Technology Sydney been brought to my attention that some people couldn 't make it to the public forum last week I know those other things on obviously but also we had the corona virus and some people chose to avoid public gatherings and it 's being requested of me that I 'd give you some of the information that was communicated during those forums for people who couldn 't attend now I 've already given you the first part of the forum that 's in the video about one of the amalgamation cuz what I want to concentrate on here is the second part of the information obviously I 'm not going to spend an hour in the video I did in the forum I 'll give you the main points so there 's gonna be continuing ongoing savings and ongoing costs associated with the D amalgamation so if we look at the first row here employee savings you 'll see that their savings from the first year but they 're very lumpy is a big jump in history there 's a in Year seven what 's going on there well as I said in my report and I said to you previously I don 't believe in false redundancies and I believe we should destroy someone 's life to get a so called efficiency people aren 't efficiencies they 're people are people with mortgages and dependents and children and wives or husbands so what I do is I model in what 's referred to as natural attrition so I know the age of these people I know when they gonna retire the year after I expect them to retire I motto in the saving from their position not being filled when they leave so that 's why it 's rather lumpy near if I wasn 't constrained to that we 'd have a lot more savings a lot earlier but from what uh people have met in the community no one wants to see anyone be made redundant over this mess let 's do it in an ethically morally justifiable minute there 's also additional employee cost we 're going to need some extra staff so a lot of you we end up with two councils we need one no cows in each in each account in each council we only have one executive assistant we end up with two councils will obviously need a new executive assistant and there 's a couple out a little positions that have to be altered or amended there 's additional governance costs I 've actually got zeros in here what this is about is going from our current structure of nine councillors with men a deputy mayor to a structure of Gundagai with five councilors one of which will be the mayor and khuda ' mantra seven councilors one which will be the mayor no deputy mayor 's I 've reduced them down to the bottom of the remuneration scale there 's a there 's a scale of payments that can be made to councils I put them down the very bottom it actually saves a little bit of money three thousand a year but consistent with what I 've done throughout this whole process I 'm giving you the worst case scenario sand rather than banking that 3000 savings I just put purely on a survey for one week of mileage now there was a key staff member that travels between the councils a lot that was away that week so the real figure is probably a little bit higher no I 've done is multiplied it through by the Australian Tax Office Alette allows that they give per kilometer of travel so that 's the cost of the tax mean says it costs us to travel a kilometre in a vehicle now what 's not included in there so that 's the cost of your vehicle fuel maintenance of the vehicle depreciation of the vehicle what 's not included there is a staff time of course so if a staff members spending 45 minutes to an hour Maxima Road they 're not working for you and Adi amalgamation there being a lot less driving and your staff members will be sitting at desks doing what they want to do serve you the best way they possibly can instead of sitting behind a steering wheel being bored out their brains not being able to serve you while they 're driving additional assurance the new order committees are kind of coming in that 's the projected costs of those things additional grant income the only one are putting it so far as the Lord regrets now I haven 't indexed it so what that means is I haven 't put this number up as time goes on because I 've got no guarantee the state government will they probably will but I can 't guarantee it so let 's not put it in remember with everything I 'm trying to do I 'm trying to give you the worst case scenario so there 's lots of capital grants you 'll know that we 've missed our own ISM parts for operating your grants that we missed out on they 're not in there because I can 't guarantee them so once again this is a gross underestimate I know it 's an underestimation I want you to be pleasantly surprised because this amalgamation saving you far more money than you anticipated and costing you far less than what you anticipated so I 'm giving you worst case scenario conservative prudent estimates additional income main source of great income for councils for local governments particularly rural councils they get a lot of financial assistance grants money comes from the Commonwealth government from the federal government but it goes from state government Greeks committees now back in 2006 the federal minister at the time declared that following the malcolm ation for four years following an amalgamation you couldn 't get less in your than what you had what you would have got if you 'd been separate councils the bind amount as if you 've been separate council so case I would calculate to demanda they 'll calculate undergo separately and then they would add them together and you have that protection for a period of four years the reason why it came in was the 2003-2004 New South Wales amalgamations cost a lot of problems because a lot of New South Wales local governments following amalgamation realised that their grant income which they relied a lot particularly in rural areas went down substantially so the federal government stepped in and made this real that for four years you have to be protected well that likelihood your grants will come down we 'll go down substantially that 's why the protection was put in there in the first place because we know they usually go down now I 've been in contact with the Grants Commission several time and they won 't give me sufficient detail to work out how much it 'll go down by but I 'm almost certain it will I haven 't modeled him because I can 't be sure of it but there will be additional fans involved in DM alga matting which means you 'd be better off the amalgamated savings from eliminating diseconomies of scale as I 've told you previously I 've modelled it it 's about eleven percent per annum so it 's costing you eleven percent extra every year because your council is bigger then it should be it 's now inefficient it 's got diseconomies of scale as a economic to them now that 's a lot of money eleven percent of your budget north a little money but I can 't be sure of it I 'm not running this both for these in all that 11 percent so I 'm like KPMG who locked up Warren I didn 't I know you 're gonna save money I can 't tell you precisely how much it 's gonna be might be 5% might be 6% it 's better not to put it in at all but if you have the worst case scenario and get pleasantly surprised by the outcomes from demethylation now second last row here you see then annual savings first year you 'll be behind normal second year will be slightly better third we 're starting to save money by the time we get to the temp you when lot of these senior staff have left and we haven 't read them you 're saving about four hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year now what that means is that as you know your council is no longer long-term financially sustainable by the New South Wales government 's own metrics you 've got consistent deficits when you exclude capital growth which is the New South Wales government preferred measure of operating position there 's a lot a lot of budget pain involved in that that 's happening in a few years time where we have deemed know if you use time very very shortly whether we have d amalgamation or not these will be going up rates will be going up it just has to happen we 're short of money now what I 'm saying to use under a D amalgamation suit scenario there 's four hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year at least less pain than what they 'll be if you don 't do your mouth Amin now over ten years I 've just added them up as we 've gone cumulative savings 2.4 million dollars so two point four million dollars less pain if you do your mouth about it then if you stay in your current structure and remember that 's a worst case scenario normal likelihood I expect you to be much say much more than two point four million dollars we went over 20 years it wouldn 't just be double it bit closer to triple because the lonely savings come in as you can see Midway and towards the end of future because that 's all we really have control over that 's consistent with the fact that the council 's do ten year planning so there 's some other questions that I get asked all the time how many councils I told you five Tunder guys seven to demander he should sit on the ignore call council now I 've looked at the legislation that appears to me that the governor can proclaim the existing mayor the mayor gun to guard the existing daphne mere the mayor khuddam under that the existing canal sellers can be considered duly elected to the areas of where they live will have a few vacancies of course two vacancies include Amanda at in Gundagai and one vacancy in Kidd Amanda I believe and those vacancies have to be filled within three months I 'm proposing this amalgamation D amalgamation happens on the 1st of July that would be the best time because systems in a council set to in on the 30th of June every year for the financial year so there 's a lot less work and a lot less stress and a year we 're going new to your magmatic councils if that is done the legislation says that vacancies must be filled within three months we have local government elections in September anyway so there 's no need to have an administrator we 've had administrators in the past to whom I believe I understand that at least one of them was an absolute disaster I don 't see why your voice should be silenced I don 't see why you should have an administrator I can 't see any legal impediment to for your existing councillors to continue to represent you interest throughout this process when should the amalgamation occur 1st July is what I think we should do I think it can be done if we can get a decision quite quickly from the boundries Commission in the minister I 've done all the work in my report that needs to be done it 's much more detailed than the reports are read during the 2016 amalgamation so I read most of them I 've given much more detailed information much more robust much more reliable it allows for get this the amalgamation done on the 1st of July I believe we need about 8 weeks prior to the 1st of July to do the work that has to be done to start off with new new councils for the new financial year what should happen with service levels well from the day that your Dean amalgamated you go back to exactly what you had prior to amalgamation four years ago there 's only four years ago we all remember don 't expect anything extra expect to go back to what you used to have and indeed during that first twelve months I believe each council should look to see where they can reduce service levels and where they can reduce costs what will happen to rates there will be a need for a special rate there under either scenario we whether your D Martha made are not rates have to go up there 's been far too much damage done to your budget over the last four years for this amalgamated Council we need to do significant budget repair work very quickly before we get into trouble now less than what they will be if you 're not to your mouth about it as you saw previously it 'll save 2.4 million dollars over ten years so at least so if you 're not d Amalgamated you can look forward to an extra 2.4 million dollars of pain over ten years if you aren t amalgamated they 'll still be rate increases but they may not have to be as severe well they won 't have to be as severe fees they 're going up to some of our fees weren 't covering our costs that 's clearly not sustainable nor is it ethical and some of our reserves are short most of you know we did a lot of work on water include a mantra we do about to do a lot of work and sewer in Gundagai that has to be painful and they 're big ticket items millions and millions of dollars when we have to build up there is a reserve so we can give you the services that you absolutely need it 's as simple as that I don 't like recommending fees too much damage has been done over the last four years learning your way to fix this damage is to put up rates and fees so what I 'm getting to here is that a lot of people are under the delusion you can have a deem a the motion and everything goes back to the way it was prior to 2016 no we 've still got a lot of pain to go through because we 're gonna fix this I believe we can fix this mess I believe both communities can feel a lot better off and have a lot more control and a lot more knowledge and feel a lot closer to local government and we can end up with the two best local governments in the state I firmly believe that if we can only get people to make good decisions now now in relationship special rate variations it 's normally a lengthy and expensive process I believe under the legislation the minister can direct I park here the people that real and special rate variations to consider that you 've already met the requirements which will councils and it 'll make it cheaper and more streamlined we can get these rate increases in and start repairing the damage that 's been done over the last four years now attitudes of residents ratepayers I put up a video about the survey results from the public forums I did I think that 's very important you watch it I think that it 's very important a lot of weight decks given to those surveys results these are people have been watching my videos who came and listened to a one-hour forum they are as well-informed as anyone on the boundaries permission or anyone in the state government would be you 've been given the best information that 's available and the decision that was overwhelmingly made by people who were well informed is that they want to DML me it 's your local governments your decision I say you guys are perfectly capable making good decisions that you make the decision last this time because last time the decision was made made by other people and it was a really rubbish decision as we 've all learnt to honestly you 're not financially sustainable long term at moment don 't panic it 's not a short-term issue but long term you are not sustainable you used to be prior to amalgamation the only way you 're going to have adequate equitable and proprietary is for us to make drastic changes I believe the boundary change bendy Malcolm aiders is a very important passed part of that process and there 's quite simple guys back in 2016 people said that it was good enough to upend your lives for saving a 3 million dollars over 20 years based on some nearly rubbish consultant work that was never gonna be true it was just pure fiction and bad fiction at that I 'm sitting here telling you I 've got a detailed report that they 'll up shortly you can read it for yourself where I showed conclusively that you 'll save 2.4 million dollars over ten years now if it was good enough to upend your lives and go against the community 's wishes to save three million over 20 years well then it 's certainly good enough to you in order to save 2.4 million dollars over 10 years now this is really important I 've got two very important things to say first of all your current councillors your men in your deputy mayor your councillors your staff you can 't GM your senior directors they 're not the ones that put you in this position it 's not their fault they did the right thing they got help when they were faced with a big mess when they realized what a big mess they had in front of them they got help which is what I 'm doing for you now it 's not their fault it 's the fault of people who made some really bad decisions in 2016 and shortly after the amalgamation the second thing I want to say to you is get off the fence you 've got all the information in your net now I need you over 40 amalgamation all your four remaining amalgamated you make the decision it 's you the pair 's a consequence but get out there make sure your voice is heard and the best way written submission saying clearly what you want them why I 've put up a video showing how to do that when you 're out in the community when you getting served at a shop or you 're talking to your children or grandchildren or your friends talk about this this is the biggest decision that will face these two communities this generation get out there get off the fence make sure your voice is heard and make sure that this community get the best it can get and I believe the only way you can get the best outcome is if you the community are driving it thank you so much for your time bye _"

    "text": "today Professor Joseph drew here from the university technology Sydney I 'm here now to give you the results of the Community Survey I did which followed the community forum now I personally believe that the voices are most worth hearing are the voices of people who have gone and got the facts and the people at the community forum were given the facts I talked to her about now kudamon really was about now is worth questions as well they availed themselves all the facts then they made the decision and what I 'm here to do now is to present you with what these decisions were I personally think that the decision should be made by the community I know we all know that had the decision been made last time we wouldn 't be in this terrible situation that we are in at present now the decision that faces you right now is not a perfect one there 's risk there 's cost involved and email the motion but I 've made it quite clear that my view is the best way forward for the community is view is not anywhere near as important as your view your views should be the ones that are given preference and particularly the views expressed in these surveys because these are people who have been presented with evidence who have thought about and talked about it as very intelligent and let 's do questions about it these are the people with the views of these people and I think that these are the views that we must give the most weight to in our decision-making so I 'll go through what qu demander said first and then we 'll go through what Gundagai said so where are you in favor of the 2016 amalgamation clearly the far majority had put them under people that turned up and I think that 's a representative community of the representatives sample of the community it 's certainly very representative of the community who have gone to the trouble to avail themselves of the facts and it 's quite clear that most of those people weren 't in favor of the amalgamation this is something that 's very important for everyone to remember Gundagai in 2016 and i agree with him bakudo mandra we 're every bit as much innocent victims of 2016 as what the Gundagai people were the coud amount of people had a good plan they did what the government said their wedding got themselves a part in hard and they put a lot of work a lot of effort into it and then though ignored I 'm determined you 're not going to be ignored this time but the killer man drew people had the rug pulled from underneath him and in some respects so more victims of the situation and not Gundagai were so most people were not in favor 2016 6 were in favor and 5-1 decided the next question is do you think ad amalgamation will save money now I gave you quite precise data during the forum I 've gone to a lot of trouble to research I understand some people won 't believe financial projections because we saw how absolutely ridiculous a financial projections were last time I can assure you that people follow my plan these things will come to pass you will save much more but I understand that some people won 't believe me that 's ok it 's your voice that 's important not mine so 12 people don 't think that demag nation will save money and for undecided 54 believes that will save money this is where it gets really interesting those people who don 't think it will save money clearly still think that the best bet is for us to DM our mate this is the question to cut Amanda are you in favor of the amalgamation and overwhelming majority 64 out of the 69 responses for this particular question say that they in favor the amalgamation three people aren 't there will be always a 90 that hunt in favor and that they have a right to be heard just as much as everyone else and I want them to be heard just as much as everyone else and two people are still undecided now the full boundaries Commission report will be on the council 's website hopefully Monday or Tuesday next week when you get it you can read all 60 odd pages of it these undecided people will be able to make up their mind then but as I said the really interesting thing for many is that a lot of people are basing this decision you see it in the comments I read the comments when every single one of our surveys returned and it 's quite clear from the comments it 's not just about money the money is important because that 's what the legislation says one of the principal decision-making criteria should be for the boundaries Commission but for you guys is not the most important team some of you don 't think the email commercial save money but clearly those same people think that you should still be nevertheless d amalgamated and a lot of people have written things about the friction that 's causing in community that uncertainty done happiness the problems with council culture the problem with the this new mega council just been too big and complex a beast for people to wrap their heads around and they 're all valid comments and I agree with a lot of them okay let 's see what Gundagai 253 said 94 suggests three were undecided at time fine it 's pretty clear and it was pretty clear if you read the Boundary Commission deliberate report from 2016 that the community never wanted to be amalgamated the Boundary Commission delegate made some ridiculous and ludicrous comments in his report to any reasonable person who was looking at the evidence in front of them a sophisticated survey done by an independent survey company there was no doubt for any reasonable person that Gundagai never wanted to be a mark about it unfortunately it seems like our boundaries Commission delegate at the time not the people making decisions now wasn 't a reasonable person so people in the Gundagai didn 't want to be amalgamated no surprise there do they think that the amalgamation will save money once again despite like now quite some detailed evidence and showing me how my projections are very conservative I 'm giving you the worst case scenario let 's do a group of people who believe it 's not going to save money some haven 't made up their mind fair enough most people think two dancers and the question are you in favor of deregulation the far majority people want to see a DML commotion those people who didn 't believe that the amalgamation will save money are still telling me they want to see a DML emotion and this is how you go back you read those comments those comments can be made to about free friendly available to the boundaries Commission if they request them from us it 's quite clear that it 's not about money it 's about identity it 's about political voice it 's about the social cohesion or lack of social cohesion these days it 's about a lot of the criteria in the legislation it 's not all about the money this D amalgamation proposal so look in some it 's perfectly obvious to me what the people who have been informed who have been given all the evidence what they want they wanted e amalgamation now whether or not they listen to you really depends on whether our boundaries Commission and our politicians making the decisions in the molder Plato here in the red or and his famous work the Republic said that no democracy is mob rule that the average person doesn 't have the competence doesn 't have the ability to make good decisions and they need to be ruled by their betters in fact Plato said you needed to be ruled by philosopher Kings because you were incapable of ruling yourself yeah I don 't agree with Plato I 'm with Aristotle over here Aristotle said the best people to make decisions are the people affected by the decisions he believed that intelligent adults given reasonable information could make good decisions about their lives and a whole heap of different things and come up with good outcomes that was also the producer position of probably the most famous political scientists of the last century Robert Dahl that 's my position the people I talk to are some perfectly reasonable questions very intelligent people obviously given this a lot of thought I have absolute faith and the ability of those people to make good decisions and I just hope that we do the right thing we don 't believe in Plato we believe you very much for your time you _"

    "text": "today Professor Joseph Drew here from the University of Technology Sydney I 'm giving you some advice about how to prepare a written submission to the boundaries Commission now we need to be very clear here that submissions you 've done previously back in January all things you wrote on the survey from the other night when I was down there we 're not talking about these things the boundaries Commission in all likelihood will ask for written submissions at that stage whether you 've written something in the past or not you need to sit down again and write something very clearly to the boundaries Commission about what your particular position is and for your voice to be taken seriously and listened to you need to ensure that when you write about your position you refer to the legislation because the boundaries Commission must make their decision based on the legislation and if they are buried in paper which is what I want them to be I want them to have no doubt about the opinions of the people in both communities and the paper trail refers specifically to decision has to be and under the law they will generally generally have little choice in in the way they propose to decide things so it 's up to everyone me your council your council staff your councillors each person in the community to make sure that everyone who once they 've always heard sits down makes a written submission in the format that I 'm about to discuss with you if you don 't put your view down in writing you will all likelihood be ignored like you were last time do not rely on turning up a lot and saying things on the day and not being held as evidence put it in writing let 's bury them in paper Lieberman and no doubt about what everyone in each community wants done and why they want it done so my proposal to you is a single piece of paper no one wants to read pages and pages and pages single piece of paper in this sort of format it doesn 't have to be precisely these words one or two lines maximum I want to stay amalgamated will and here you will refer to one or two of the matters that are covered in that legislation the boundaries Commission must base their decision on and I will go through them very very shortly so I have been through this legislation before with you in one of the very early videos these are the things that the decision must be based on financial advantages or disadvantages so you might write I want to stay amalgamated because I believe there 's a financial advantages in doing so all you might write I want to be D amalgamated because I 've been provided with clear evidence of financial advantages arising from D amalgamation do you see how these sentences get put together now on this point why I 'm thinking about it the final draft of the boundaries Commission report I did for council will be out Monday I want it to be on public display as soon as possible after that time preferably Monday afternoon you 'll be able to get it on the website I hope and you 'll be able to read that and cite specific evidence from by the boundaries Commission if you 're citing evidence if you saw if exciting and robust financial evidence it 's going to be incredibly difficult for anyone to dismiss you no matter what your opinion is remember I 'm not personally invested in this I don 't bear the consequences of what happens all I can do is get the facts out to you which is what I 've been trying hard to do it 's now up to you guys to make your views known no way that can 't_''_256.669 be ignored so your your reason might instead be about the community interest or the geographic cohesion so you might say I want to say amalgamated because there 's a strong community of interest between cooed Amanda and Gundagai people and the geographies very cohesive or you might say I want to be deal amalgamated because the Gundagai include Amanda don 't have much in common and there 's a pretty ordinary road and a forty eight kilometres distance between the two towns you need to address these things hopefully people will be addressing different aspects of the legislation about the attitudes of residents I think that 's very important last time people said Nord survey evidence and made up their own quite strange and silly ideas about what the attitudes of residents are if you have an attitude if you believe you know that atutor of others that might be the reason you refer to in your written submission you might talk about the ability of council to provide adequate equitable and appropriate services now I told you quite clearly on the forum by the government 's own metrics poonam Andrew Gundagai council is not a long-term financially sustainable entity you might refer to that in your submission you might talk about impacts unemployment impact some rural communities you might talk about number nines not terribly helpful you might talk about though number ten which is the ability of each community to be represented under the current structure or under the amalgamated structure you might believe that DMR commander councils will make it easier for each community to be effectively represented if you do use that as your reason you might refer to the efficiency and effectiveness and the PUC report is made public in a few days time you 'll be able to cite that whatever you do they make a written submission if you know someone that hasn 't you know someone that 's differing about doing it make them put down and writing what their view is it 's important to anyone that wants to be heard is heard it 's important that we 're not ignored this time that your views are taken seriously because it 's you your community that will bear the consequences of this decision council will get the information out to you about when these written submissions are due and how to make the written submissions I will do a short video too you will definitely know it don 't be in any fear of that and will definitely definitely make time make sure this time that you 'll heard thank you very much for your time _"

    "text": "today this is Professor John surgery from the University of Technology Sydney and today I 'm here to talk to you quickly about some common misconceptions I 'm hearing around town and reading in in documents and just to make sure that everyone understands what the facts of the matter are so I 'm hearing a lot that there 's a perception that the amalgamation tivities were just bad luck or bad management by early administrators and whatnot this is not correct the amalgamations were never going to save money KPMG projected that you would save seven million dollars in the employee expenses over 20 years Gundagai and their submission to the boundaries commissioner in 2016 provided a copy of this table to the boundaries commission delegate showing that if we look at past evidence of amalgamations this ones were from Queensland just a few years earlier that employee costs actually Bros in amalgamated councils following amalgamation so the KPMG projection of savings and employee costs were never going to happen they were based on guesswork and bad guesswork but if we looked at the evidence from previous amalgamations we you saw on my video last time they have gone up it was hardly a surprise so it wasn 't bad luck that wasn 't bad management has really bad decision-making and some really bad advice that than yourself Wales government received back in 2016 there 's a perception that neither council was sustainable financially sustainable prior to the amalgamation this perception is simply not correct T Corp was commissioned by the New South Wales government in 2012 to do some financial sustainability reviews for each and every council in New South Wales it did the reviews of put 'em Andhra in 2013 and decided that coulomb Andhra was in a sound financial position that 's on a seven-point scale and it decided that the under guy was in a moderately financial Jona position on the same seven-point scale Gundagai was one ranking below CUDA mandra now what the definitions of those scales are is the critical thing so I 'll read the definition for the gander guy scale the rating which was moderate and of course kudamon was slightly better than there so if you read the t-coil document an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments in the short to medium term and an acceptable capacity in the long term so T Corp the New South Wales Treasury Corporation in 2013 was saying that both councils had adequate capacity medium turn an acceptable capacity long to them ie they were financially sustainable that is the best evidence we have wasn 't perfect evidence by any stretch of imagination now some of you are aware that in 2015 I apart with the help of a what we were told to be a local government expert from South Australia mr. claw Murray and Ernst Young did their own review this review to see is seven financial sustainability ratios which is the case of extreme Sinha ducky what that word means is it 's ridiculous to just take a couple measures to to try to get a picture of what 's happening in such a complex organization such as a local government moreover they were using data that they knew was inaccurate the population figures for labias they were using empirical techniques which they any skill trial could have told them doesn 't have a linear function associated with it a lot of their benchmarks had changed to make things harder plus they had this overarching criteria which was adequate scale and capacity and basically what that said was if you were ever suggested to be a appropriate target for amalgamation and you didn 't propose an amalgamation with your fit for the future report then you would be deemed to be not fit for the future even if you pass there 's seven financial ratios that work was completely worthless it was ridiculed in the in the popular media it was ridiculed in the scholarly journals journals as well absolutely no consequence cannot be relied on at four it was zooms assuming to be are the extremely poor work done by people that had very poor understanding of these concepts or something that was politically motivated you can make up your own mind okay there 's a concern I 'm hearing that if there 's a DM alga motion a lot of hard work by the staff particularly will be wasted some of it will that 's undeniable some of this council together over the last four years will be wasted but a lot of it will continue the great work on the asset management will continue the great work getting the IT systems up to scratch will continue those things will just be separated after the amalgamation the great work the council has been doing and educating its citizens about its financial conditions etc that will they 're all more or less pay dividends in the future too so yes some work will be wasted but a lot will survive I 've been asked many many times can the amalgamation be successfully executed the answer is clearly yes it 's happened five times in Australia 's happened overseas and in Canada as well it is a difficult process it 's not as difficult as amalgamation as particularly when the amount made entities have operated there 's more or less separate operations like they have a khuddam under them to go it it 's relatively straightforward it 's very doable there 's a concern about the cost of the amalgamation who pays well you should be concerned I will be DMA of motion but let me tell you there less than a quarter of the amalgamation cost there will be less than two million dollars and research them rigorously so unlike some of the guesswork that 's been done to this community in the past you can think that these costs will actually be the cost you incur in fact I 've taken the worst case scenario in every single line item so the picture I paint it 's the worst picture that will it will be in all likelihood it 'll cost considerably less than what I 'm projecting for you who pays well if we look at principles of natural justice which one 's like a whole legal system generally the person at fault pay so if I run my car into you you 're an innocent bystander whether I do it negligently or I do it because I get some bad advice from a backseat driver either way if I inflict the damage on you and you 're innocent I pay to put you back into a position as close as possible to what you were in in the same way the New South Wales government was driving the car the communities that could imagine gonna go would both innocent they both produced evidence to suggest that they didn 't like this particular amalgamation kudamon you had a better proposal I think with Hardin and I 'm going to go under stand alone the New South Wales government was given incredibly bad advice by their backseat drivers but irrespective they 're the ones that drove the vehicle into the community and if we followed put normal principles of natural justice they will be the ones paying for the cost of the amount measure typically however in Australia the amalgamations have been paid for by the community generally the breakaway community there 's a concern that jobs will be lost as a result of the amalgamation let me stay quite clearly very clear clearly that there will be no job losses except for the general manager 's position if there 's a deal amalgamation and all he 'll pick up one of the general managers positions in the new DA of thematic councils I don 't believe in I refuse to model job losses what I 've done is have modelled savings for natural attrition what does that mean well what it means is I looked at people 's ages we all know the retirement age I 've looked at particular jobs that need to be shed over time and I 've calculated when these people are likely to retire and I model in the savings in the year after they 've retired now if these people retire or transfer earlier great will save even more money if they don 't they will be guaranteed of their job until they don 't get to normal retirement age that 's the only fair thing you cannot write a run by committing another wrong one other people unfortunately what it means is we don 't get as many savings early up and up Union cumulative savings alone what they would might might otherwise be but it 's only moral adjusting to do I believe and I imagine the community shares my opinion if you don 't please let me know concerns about management the size and the effectiveness look you predicted it prior to the America motion inevitable given that the delegate himself on three occasions said that the council 's would have to be like operators as separate organizations one of the north and one on the south well if you 're gonna do that you need management in each organisation and then you need another level of management to coordinate the management hence you end up with bloated management like you have that 's where a lot of additional expenditure and employee cost went wages also put up as people get more responsibility they expect more pay easier management effective in the past they haven 't always been as effective as one worklight I don 't think it would have mattered how good they were this amalgamation was always going to cost more money the evidence was quite clear on that prior to amalgamation the management you have at present I 'm very impressed with I wouldn 't have taken this job if I wasn 't_''_619.36 I personally get nothing out of it in fact I 'm a little bit behind over my workplace gets lots of out counselors you marry your deputy mayor and your GM and your senior executive were wanting to do the best thing by the community I wouldn 't have taken the job as I say I get nothing out of it and I just wouldn 't have been interested there is no doubt in my mind that everyone involved all your counselors all your management want the best outcome for the community and that 's all we can ask for no one has the head cut right across this no one could possibly have their head right across it it 's extremely complicated and I 'm only just getting across it after two months of work and solidly on it but you 've got a management who cares about the community and that 's the most important thing there 's a perception of dislike can I just say I 've never heard a gun to go personal say no just like to time under people they dislike the situation then I mentioned queue time under people dislike the situation into and they need to be more vocal about that if that is consultations which will hopefully happen or marks and know if I believe it 's a Monday March the 10th which I believe is a two so the first one would be a treatment or a second one albeit undergo that can we all be very careful when we 're talking that we apportion blame where it belongs if you think plane belongs with the boundaries commissioner delegate for the New South Wales government or the previous minister or local government or KPMG make sure you apportion it where it belongs it doesn 't belong to any of the people in either of these communities and can we be also very very careful that we only talking about the situation that we always remember and reaffirm that the people in the other community your purpose perfectly fine people we 've got no issue with the people it 's the situation that we have any we need to all be very careful about our language over the next few weeks there 's a perception that there 's been a loss of grant funding since amalgamation as a result of amalgamation yes it been a stronger community grants capital grants that we need to be mindful of and the communities receives a lot through that although that although that 's a double-edged sword that 's going to be a millstone around the council whatever happens for the next decade a decade or so in increased costs for maintenance and increased depreciation coming through on the income statements of your financial statements so you 've lost operating grant money and that 's probably more important and yes you have it 's there 's a potential that you 'll lose more in the future and the financial assistance grants Act which is that act that governs the money that comes from the federal government to councils by state local government grants committees you have a protection for four years that 's about to come off there 's a possibility that your grant funding will go down after that I 've contacted the grants commission to ask them for information they haven 't provided with me whether it 's our current confirm evil way whether that will not happen but it 's quite probable that 's federal government had seen was that falling of our commotions grant fundings went down and that wasn 't a good thing for communities there 's a perception that the amalgamation will be stressful for staff yes it will be amalgamation was stressful for staff being in the state of limbo an uncertainty is stressful for staff can I emphasize just one fact the most important asset your community has is not your infrastructure it 's not the money in the bank it is your staff you cannot afford to lose your staff every opportunity you have to make things easier for the staff to thank the staff for the efforts please take it you 've actually got an incredibly experienced and talented group of staff for rural councils unusual to find such experience and talent and imperial counsels look after them because if you lose them then you really do have problems so it will be stressful but so is the current situation I think most stuff I 've done a staff survey most started giving me the perception that they 're prepared to cut the stress of the Dini to long term things will be a lot better for the community and a lot better for them there 's a perception that worries me that the amalgamation is a solution to all the problems including under Gundagai you do have big financial challenges ahead of you whatever happens it is part of the solution there 's no doubt in my mind now I 've crunched the numbers here 's part of the solution but it is not the solution whole of solution irrespective of whether d-mail commotion happens or not fees and rates will probably have to go up to repair the damage done over the last four years and changes will have to occur that 's just reality with more market I don 't like it but that 's what 's going to happen if Adi amalgamation happens there 'll be less pain than if a demerit motion doesn 't happen and I will be releasing that sort of detail on the 8th and 9th of March at those community forums I hope you can make okay one last plug for my videos here 's the link if them and to watch them please look out from every week or so the more information the community has the more power the community has the less possible it is for people from Sydney to come in and disregard your views when you 're when you 're reporting in you 're thinking and talking about facts that 's very hard for people to simply dismiss you so please get the facts and courage your friends to get the facts come to these meetings ask any questions you have and I 'll stay there all night every quality questions thank you very much for your time _"

    "text": "today Professor Joseph drew here from the University Technology Sydney today I 'm here to talk to you about the implementation of the race harmonization program that is set to be adopted by council now rates harmonization is a direct consequence of amalgamation when two councils are mouth mated they both have different rate structures different categories subcategories base rates minimum rates different actual tax rates on the dollar of land value they have to be harmonized your one council now called kid hundred undergo you all each person that uses the land and the particular way needs to be paying the same tax rate as anyone else using their land in that way now previously I had a video here talking about the the moral defensibility of an unimproved land tax where I was trying to do with this race harmonization was to give you a structure that was defensible morally defensible simple accountable and transparent you should be able to quickly understand the tax rates that paid by different categories and why they are the way they are it needs to be competitive people shouldn 't be not of the high tax rate they 'll show you later on that your tax rate at khuddam under Gundagai will remain lower than compatible councils we needed to be mindful of people 's capacity to pan but the truth of the matter is at the end of the day a local government does not know your wealth or your income it does not have access to information so we have no accurate way of knowing your capacity to pay moreover the whole idea of the unimproved land tax remember is to claw back some of the unearned wealth that accrue to you because of what the community has been doing to claw back some of that unrealized capital gain and give it back to the community so they can continue to grow we 'll continue to produce work for you in the future remember is on unimproved lien failure so it 's not the consequences of your building your house landscaping or whatever it 's just the value of your land why has it gone up it 's gone up because of things that your community 's been doing and I 'm afraid I 'm very sad to say at the end of the day with so many subcategories with such huge differences in the tax rates paid by different sub categories and paid by the different councils prior to amalgamation and also because we 've got Mullen valuations coming in this year as well rate shocks in have inevitable some people will have significant increases to their rates compared to last year it 's just mathematically impossible to avoid that I use a very complex algorithm called linear program with some certain constraints and that to make sure it was fair and the outcomes I will show you in a few minutes are the best that are humanly possible remember with the land tax it 's a responsibility of membership to a community so I miss your federal income tax is your responsibility as a member of the community of Australia your land tax is your responsibility as a member of the community of kudamon drug under guard Regional Council it is not a fee for service the in tax has nothing to do with the services you receive you receive should be paid through fees and charges on the whole the other thing to know is even if you have precisely the same tax rate throughout the local government area people will pay different amounts of tax dollars because their liens value differently now generally what occurs is that lien that is further away from town that doesn 't have memorize don 't it doesn 't have town water or power sewer services that land is usually valued much much lower than land that is close to town that has all those things that 's what economists refer to is capitalizing the value of services into the lien value so what that means is that we can set a constant tax rate for everyone yet their rate bill will reflect quite closely their access to services in any case it 's as I say we more must remember always that this land tax is about returning some unknown wealth you didn 't do anything personally to make your land value go up in price you unimproved Leanback value go up in price he 's unearned wealth created by to the community so it can 't continue to grow this will create more work for you in the future then tax theory rejects subcategory it 's the whole idea of subcategories is people say all these people get less services step further out of town therefore they shall pay a lower tax rate no sorry that 's completely incorrect they should pay the same tax rate and the fact that the land will be worth valued at relatively less because of the less access to services will mean that they 'll pay them less dollars of tax then a comparable person living close to town subcategories essentially provide a second discount to people in our own area the discounts already imputed because ylenne value is less because I have less access to services to provide them with another discount on top of that simply is double dipping minimum rates land tax theory would reject it apart from being extremely complement complex to implement in her for people to understand it essentially means that people whose land value went up by relatively less than other people in the local government way of saying it people with relatively less wealth in their land will subsidize people who have relatively more wealth invested in their land and that clearly is unjust legislation allows you to have reduced rates for vacant land that people who have vacantly in an easily speculating they 're doing it as a business to sell it later and make a profit why would a local government want to contribute to greater profits for a speculator it 's just a silly idea special rates they have them in the past and under gaya I reject them the special rates essentially says this group of people are receiving a special service therefore we 'll charge them an extra special rate it 's founded on the misapprehension that rates have something to do with services rates are not a fee for service circle special race not theoretically valid base rates base rates have done well a morally defensible a base rate really should reflect your basic cost of membership to the community it should be an equal portion paper every rate payer of the absolute basic cost to have a local councillors it cost to have your elections that cost to have your financial statements prepared and ordered the depreciation on key buildings and the wages of key staff it 's essentially the cost to have a local government if the local government did no work and what I 've done is I 've worked out that cost of divided by the number of taxpayers and everyone will pay the same base rate because everyone has the same need for a basic institution called local government have knives rapes we must be very clear on this the only reason we are doing this is because of the amalgamation there was no amalgamation in 2016 there would have been no race harmonization I write the rate harmonization should have been done in fact in 2017 its disadvantages a lot of people because it wasn 't done but back then and it wasn 't done back then because the state government introduced some legislation which prevented local governments from war from doing home rates harmonization for a period of three years that period has expired there has time to harmonize rates now the amalgamation inevitably results in winners and losers I said it before the amalgamation summer people said it as well yeah the legislation stopped you from knowing whether you were a winner or loser until now now we 're in unveiling whether you personally will winner from an amalgamation or whether you personally were from a loser from the amalgamation paranoia 's racing our race is implied by the fact that they made legislation in the first place preventing it for three years if they haven 't even accepted it to happen you wouldn 't have had the rate freed Freesat legislation in the first place it 's required by natural justice you can 't have people in the same community paying different tax rates we wouldn 't accept it without income tax well would we accept it without local government taxes it 's mathematically impossible to avoid rate shock I use a very sophisticated mathematical technique this is the best answer possible if you 're unhappy with the answer if you 're one of the losers you have my sincere apologies but the blame must fall near Malcolm Ocean who staff not in your current councillors you have a reason why you might have some shock is because of these newly in valuation once again that 's entirely outside of the control council his land valuations are done by the valuer general we must implement the new land value operations whether we like it or not what our proposed here is completely morally defensible I 'm not sure it was always morally defensible what we have in the past and it 's also sustainable so as I said our calculator base rate and then I worked out what 's called an ad valorem it 's dollars in the dollar value of land or sometimes presented as sense than a thousand dollar value of liens it 's essentially your tax rate and you will be able to see quite clearly the tax rate paid by different types of citizens in khuddam undergunned ago in a minute when I 'll show you so this is what we had previously based on the new land values if we continued the current system for another year this is what we would have as you rates 187 but he is a base rate of 241 here 's a minimum rate of 551 there 's a minimum rate of 442 it 's hard to justify why you would have different bases and minimums and here 's your tax rates ad valorem rates and you 'll notice that there were huge differences perhaps one of the bigger differences was between the residential kunam under people in town and the residential khuddam andra in the outskirts point 0 1 4 in town point 0 0 to 5 times less for people living in residential same type of land use in the outskirts and it 's also this curious thing here with businesses we had our business tax rate for CBD that of Quin 0 to 8 we had non CBD half as much the land was being used for the same purposes it 's hard to understand why this one 's particularly interesting for different types of industrial land business industrial aerodrome industrial barn Street industrial east industrial south or with very different tax rates one had a tax rate the point zero one four six number one why they will industrial what 's happened over time in in fairness is these things were implemented many many years ago and because of the rate capping the compounding effect of that over 2n new land valuations in subdivisions over time those tax rates that might have been set close to equal originally slowly stretch further and further apart from each other you can also see the tax rates between the different local governments were quite different so farmland in kudamon de was paying point zero zero to nine but farmland in serene Gundagai was paying point zero zero to nine but farmland in kudamon de was playing point zero zero one seven eight much slower rate of tax then was being used for the same purposes you know one council you should be paying one tax rate if you 're using your lien for a particular purpose so we 're going from this great big messy thing to a much simpler rate structure that we can all understand and grasp pretty quickly so three three categories required by law under the Local Government Act 1993 residential farm business required precisely the same for each category because you all have the same need for our local government and this covers the basic fundamental costs of having your local government even if it did nothing and then here 's your tax rate they had valorem now you 'll notice that the tax rates are different ideally those tax rates would be almost identical he can 't_''_842.579 be done at the moment because there was such huge differences previously within councils in between the two councils it just couldn 't be done to have the so tax rates the same without crushing certain industries particularly family-owned business now I have a plan over time that are presented to Council to slowly increase the tax rate for the farmland up to the residential rate and slightly decrease in real type terms to tax rate for businesses down to the fire to the residential rate so how that would work is as you may or may not know there 's a rate cap every year the state government tells us how many percent we can put the total tax take up by in this instead of putting each category up by 2.6 percent we would instead put one category the lowest rate taxpayer category of the farmland up by four percent we would put the residential up by 1.3 percent and the business wouldn 't tax rate wouldn 't be increased at all it would go up by zero percent what that will mean is slowly business rates will come effectively down in real terms slowly farm rates will come up and residential rates would Mars when you go down over time now if we do that over many many years decades we 'll end up eventually with a tax system where each category 's essentially paying the same rate of Taxation and that 's the fairest outcome slightly more for farms and businesses because they can claim their rates as a tax deduction which most residential people can 't do but that will take many years to do in a sustainable way we can 't crush the farm sector we all rely on it directly or indirectly it 's the base of you of your economy in your in your local government area business so we current Astoria sector popping the farm rates up by about four percent every year it 's sustainable and sensible and doable and capable for the farmers and we will over time eventually end up with a much more equitable tax system now what 's the effect on ratepayers I 've given you some what we call summary statistics here the mean is the average we all know what an average is sum up all the numbers and divide it by the number of numbers it gives you a pretty good idea of what the typical person is gonna face the median is what you would get if you put all the numbers in ascending order and picked out the middle number the quartile is the median of the first half and the quartile 1 and the quartile 3 is the median of the second half another way of thinking about quartile 1 is 25 percent of ratepayers will have increases or decreases greater than that for quartile 3 25% of ratepayers will have increases greater than quartile 3 50% of the ratepayers will sit between quartile 1 range of the changes Alcock unfortunately some great players to have very high challenges now often that 's because of the lien valuations have changed dramatically that sometimes it 's because some of these ratepayers were in sub categories that were getting extraordinary Deek there are discounts so I will give you some specific examples in a minute but there was a sub category that was essentially getting a 78 percent discount on their tax rate compared to other residential taxpayers well if we want to be fair and have everyone pay the same rate of tax which is reasonable because remember what we 're trying to do is get the same proportion of unearned wealth back off you well if we want to be raised more well those people who were getting those amazing discounts previously are going to have a big shock a big great shock and some people will be winners as I said someone has their rates reduced by 48 percent and they will be very happy ok so if we look at a thing called a store standard normal distribution normal symmetrical distribution you can quartile 1 50 percent of ratepayers will be between Court quartile 3 quartile 2 will be where the averages and 25 Senate ratepayers will be both quartile 3 if the distribution is a bit skewed which they often are with lien prices we will might likely get something like this where the median and the mean don 't match precisely on each other but for the purposes of understanding I think most of us are more comfortable with discussing the mean or the average okay so if we look back at residential the typical taxpayer is going to have their rates go up by 9.8 percent now we must remember that there was a rate tap anyway so rake happen plays any any way for every year so in any case rates were going up by 2.6 percent because that 's the what than yourself was state government said that local governments could put their rates up by so bear that in mind when you 're looking at that statistic that 2.6 percent of that 9.8 is the rate cap anyway we 're going to find that most people are compared to last year of almost 11 percent up to around almost 15% higher than last year so these are relative to what you paid last year if we look at a specific example it makes it a little bit easier to understand what 's happening so I 've took a real property of our models real data this is a real person ID identified it by putting a whole string of X 's here so you don 't know the property number it was in a residential subcategory one of these subcategories that we 're getting a 78 percent discount on their rates Texas previously now this particular property was worth a hundred and seventy eight thousand dollars and improved land value in 2016 in 2019 the order to value were general tells us that the unimproved land values near two hundred and forty five thousand now clearly by subtracting those two numbers we can see that this person has accrued an extra sixty seven thousand dollars and wealth over three years simply because of their unimproved went up in value because of what the community has been doing they were three years ago now previously their rates was 791 rumors and under the proposal their rates will now be fifteen hundred and eighty one dollars a lot more I acknowledge a knowledge that 's going to cause pain those completely unavoidable if we 're going to have a morally defensible system now what we 're essentially saying is we 're asking this person to pay an extra 800 and raise from what they previously did that sounds terrible and it will cause harm oh I acknowledges but we need to put this in perspective this person in the last three years has had generated for them by the community next to sixty seven thousand dollars and wealth from that sixty seven thousand dollars and wealth we 're asking them to pay an extra 800 when you consider it in those terms it 's not a bad deal at all and we need to be mindful of what an unimproved land tax is really trying to do is trying to claw back a little bit of this 67,000 tiny sliver of that sixty seven thousand dollars it 's trying community that created the world for this person let 's have a look at family it 's more extreme for the family and the business in the business the typical farmers gonna find their rates going up by almost 20% they 're the lowest rate of Taxation as you saw on that overview before but they 've made almost all family and taxpayers have had their rates go up enormous Lee quartile one is minus three percent so their rates are going down by three percent hardly noticeable quartile three is 41% they 've gone up by so fifty percent of farmers most of the farmers are going to have their rates change from three percent less through to forty one percent more a lot of rate shock in the phone in Category the highest change is going to be two hundred and six percent that 's the biggest user in terms of what happened with the amalgamation the biggest winner from the amalgamation since the person whose rate goes down almost 49% so let 's look at a specific example again this particular person in 2016 the land was tells us the land is now worth two hundred and one thousand that person has had an additional one hundred and thirty three thousand dollars of wealth effectively drop out the sky into their lap there are hundred and thirty three thousand dollars better off through nothing that they physically done themselves now previously their race was three hundred and thirty two dollars which was it seems very low they 're now being asked to pay a rate of seven hundred and fifty two dollars on those has gone up by almost four hundred and twenty dollars or one hundred and twenty six percent the percentage sounds terrible but when you look at the dollar amount four hundred and twenty dollars it 's not so bad I acknowledge it will cause hurt for this particular person but this person needs to consider their extra rates have been asked to pay in terms of the extra wealth they 've received from the community so from the hundred and thirty three thousand dollars of extra wealth that this person 's received a last three years we 're asking them to pay an once again in those terms it doesn 't seem like a very big ask look at the businesses your typical business is going to go up twenty percent now in the case of businesses as once again it 's about those subcategories we had lots of subcategories for businesses for Ford industrial and then business outside the seed EDM business inside the CBD and business other some of those businesses will get new credible tax discounts so one of the category is the category that the example comes from in a minute was paying one-eighth of the tax rate as their peers doing the same business operations who happen to be sitting in the CBD so they 'll effectively be getting a 90 percent discount on their taxes previously well obviously their taxes are going to increase a lot and morally defensible fear tax system so the typical business is going up 19% but the ranges are quite interesting here q1 is going to see quarter while is going to see reductions an order of about 27% 27% reduction to their rates quartile 3 is going to see an increase people are going to see their rates change from last year from either going down by about 26% all the way through to going up by 32% there is one particular loser their rates will be going up ten times that 's mostly because in this particularly instance on the person I 'll know who they are and they 'll accept the story there 'll in value went up by almost 10 times just over 10 times I think so it 's hardly surprising their rates went up they had an awful lot of unearned wealth created for them and then there 's some lucky rate payers money in the CBD of Kuna mandra whose rates have gone down because previously they were effectively subsidizing other types of businesses that weren 't in the CBD so looking at a specific example I 'm going this particular property previously it was only worth 21 ground it 's obviously out-of-towners getting that substantial huge tax discount previously of around 90% previously in 26 then lien was worth 21 grand now the value in general tells us we 're 33 grand they 've from poverty or what the community has been doing they previously played exceptionally low rates of 300 a year we 're now asking them to pay the same tax rate as everyone else in the combined local government area of seven which works out for on their lien very years seven hundred and twenty seven dollars we 're asking them to pay an extra four hundred and twenty dollars a year doesn 't sound terrible in dollar terms and percentage terms it looks horrid an extra one hundred and forty percent but let 's put it in perspective again this business previously was getting a 90% discount in their taxes they can think about how sad it is that their rates are going up now all they can think about how lucky they 've been till the last few decades they 've been paying one-eighth of the rate of Taxation as other businesses in their local government area they 've been getting an exceptionally good deal for a long time furthermore they 've had 12,000 of wealth created from for them by the community and the community in return is year rates when you consider it in that in those terms asking someone who got twelve thousand dollars of extra were created through no efforts they own to hand back just four hundred dollars of it it 's not such a bad deal so we need to look the comparison of other councils you may be aware of the office of local government categorizes councils in your in OLG eleven category over here as khuddam under the undergo council so if we compare your average rates proposal to the average rate of similar councils we find that in all instances the average rates at killed Amanda Gundagai far less than their average rates in similar councils so the average residential rate in cudamani gun guys around 700 bucks you know other OLG councils you 'd be paying eight hundred and six dollars on average farm men 3,000 roughly in other ilg 11 councils you 'd be asked to pay thirty three hundred dollars in business be nurse pay sixteen hundred and forty dollars on every in other typical similar councils you 'll be asked to pay 2,100 roughly so the for it remember is completely unavoidable this is the best scenario that was mathematically humanly possible remember that this rates harmonization is owning it occurred because of the amalgamation if you are not happy with the outcome you need to blame whoever you feels responsible for the amalgamation it 's not sudden your councillors did to you it 's not something your council staff duty is not something righted to you if you 've got rate shock there 's two big causes then the biggest cause is the race harmonization that results from the amalgamation so the main reason you 're getting shocked is the 2016 amalgamation up until now you you 've had it hidden from you whether you 're winner or loser I 've now unveiled to you whether you 're winner the other cause of your rate shock of course is the land valuation which is also completely outside of the control of local government okay thank you very much for your time and I look forward to seeing you all in a week or so when I come down to the community consultation about the boundaries Commission proposal thank you goodbye you _"

    "text": "professor joseph drew again from the university technology sydney this time i 'm here to talk to you about something that 's at the forefront of a lot of people 's minds which is the costs of the amalgamation you 'll all be aware that there 's a proposal that hopefully will be considered by the boundaries commission shortly to do magna make you demands are Gundagai council intercooler andhra and undergo council so what are we talking about here i need to be quite clear we 're talking about the one-off the amalgamation cost that they only will ever it would be incurred once there 's also another set of costs ongoing cost that will go on forever more and there 's also ongoing savings that will go on forever more indeed that ongoing savings are higher than the ongoing costs are there will be an ongoing net saving which will go towards paying off this one off the email commercial cost over time if the new south wales day government decides not to pay it so what did i do i need to be clear that this is was inflicted on the community by consultants in the past where they just plucked a figure out the air i think it was 5 million said you 'll save they 'll cost 5 million to the now array and plucked another figure out there you 'll say 3% on staff there 's a little juice you expenditure by through person it 's not that sort of silliness this is actually proper rigorous evidence i 've gone back to source documents i 've gone back to your financial statements i 've gone back to what 's happened previously to work out an over estimate for you one-off the amalgamation cost so this is the worst case scenario any time when i had to choose between the low to cost I always chose the higher cost to paint the worst case scenario I expected actual dimension costs will be much less so specifically what did i do I looked at the cost of amalgamation some of those items have to be undone in the America motion so to use those costs inflated by inflation is reasonable I looked at the cost from the world studied the amalgamations in detail and I have good records of what happened in della Tai and also in Sunshine Coast Regional Council up in Queensland and I could use those figures inflated into today 's dollars to get an idea what the real costs are likely to be I looked at existing contracts that the council has I looked at the circumstances of particular staff members occupying jobs is there a contract if there is a contract what is a payout figure I received estimates for work that needs to be done by suppliers who provided the work for council in the amalgamation also consulted with your management and your staff now as I was suggesting before I had some guiding principles are used one was that the cost must be specific I must be able to point to something particular and say this is the cost for doing X perhaps splitting the asset register when in doubt when there was ever any in doubt doubt about whether cost would be incurred or not I included a cost it 's much better to be surprised on the later when I was faced with two or more estimates I always change to hire one so an example is the ICT past I had exempt cost from dela type I had cost from you amalgamation I had an estimate from a supplier estimates from your staff I chose the highest out of that block it 's much better to be prudent to be surprised on the upside the costs have to be rigorous and they have to be reliable the last thing we want the last thing this community needs is another disaster so I had to make sure that these were as good as humanly possible as accurate as humanly possible and I almost guarantee that your costs will be considerably less than these so what are the cost here they are they come to a total of 1.75 million now to give you an idea of how that compares to other costs Delta tie in 2002 the estimates for DML the burning della tie was 1 million dollars neat in today 's dollars that 's 1.5 million dollars so it 's a little bit more than the aggravation cost there was three estimates 1.75 million two point one point two point one seven five million and three point six million provided by three different people none of them were right Sunshine Coast Regional Council is not directly comparable to what we have here khuddam under the undergo there 's a couple big differences first Sunshine Coast Regional Council didn 't want new cittadini amalgamate second they 'd had a fire sale sold all the plant sold all the ICT equipment which is huge money so to replace the ICT equipment 1.2 million dollars to replace the plaint which wasn 't including their one-off cost it should have been 7.5 million we didn 't have the fire sale CUDA moment going to God that 's why your costs are considerably less so these costs just a smidgen more than what delat are actually incurred in today 's dollars gives you another sense that they 're probably going to be spot-on and in fact a little bit over so communications and branding changing signs and things this is on the assumption that you go back to your original logos how you could weren 't and justify the expense of developing new logos for the Amalgamated councils staff expenditure with us from contracts to pay up potentially maybe not necessarily I put the fig plug the figures in there anyway I want the worst case scenario ICT as I say I had four figures to go from this mr. Hyatt I 'm almost certain or exceed although ICT tends to blow out that 's why I chose the highest figure but I 'm pretty certain you 'll come under it governance cost in all likelihood most of them won 't be incurred what I 'm thinking of particularly things like audits at the end of the existence of the food American Gundagai Regional Council there would have to be an order of financial statements my proposal to the boundaries Commission would be that that the amalgamation proclamation was read on the 1st of July so it would happen at the end of the financial year which the council would have to go through the order process anyway as of a 30th of June and therefore we can a mitigate this of extra work for the council staff and they 'll have more than enough to keep themselves occupied with for the first six to nine months anyway so I think that would be the best move asset management and splitting that register has been done since you but meand America Motors one of the enduring benefits of amalgamation if there is indeed a devaluation legal cost it 's almost certain over estimate rather be safe than sorry plant I 've been assured that each council has all the plant that they had at the time of amalgamation and they don 't need any new plant directly as a result of the ad amalgamation transition manager that 's a parrot consulting rates for a person of that expertise it will be worth every cent you pay for if you get the correct if you get a good transition manager it 's a difference between a DMA aggravation being a success and being a success other is bits and bobs comes to 1.75 million dollars so where 's the transition team so under my proposal there would be an eight week period of staff and representatives would get together to make all the decisions to do all the work that has to be done so in the 1st of July two councils could commence operation the amalgamation is a less complex process than amalgamation and many of these people went through the mouth motions so we have a little bit of experience there in the first place it 's a way of keeping the community Democratic voice throughout the process but also having a small enough group that we can actually manage and everyone can have a say and we can get the work done remember these people will be meeting on a daily basis and all likelihood for 10 links that 's why I 'm suggesting you and you have your mirror and you 're definitely mirror there and not the whole council because it 's just not feasible to be dragging 9 7 extra people into the room every time you have to have a meeting which could be several times during the day so the members would be your current GM of course he 's on top of the of the Gundagai community given their he hails from there the current deputy mayor who would be expected to represent the interests of the 200 community given the he hails from there they 're the two senior counselors that makes sense the pic the two senior counselors as a representative of your council your new general managers as soon as they were appointed and this transition manager who 's extremely important so why have a transmit solution manager sometimes despite everyone 's best efforts to come to an agreement to come to a consensus there 's going to be differences of opinions about me let 's go where staff go where money goes where liabilities go and someone 's going to be ultimately accountable to make a decision you also need some of the requisite knowledge and skills to be able to lead this process he is a complex processes a lot of work to be done there is no doubt in my mind after studying previously amalgamations in Australia and abroad that having a good transition manager having a transition team is the difference between success and failure for to be truly independent not be related to anyone down there and not to be particular friends of anyone down include him under gun to god they need to know about DML mission there 's very few people in the country that do know about it because we 've only had five they need to know about kuda mantra and Gundagai about the communities how they work about staff members know some of the staff members know the key staff members ideally already have a working relationship with them they need to be someone that 's prepared to consult to seek agreement first much better to get a consensus than to have to make a unilateral decision and indeed we don 't want it the legislation I 'm proposing some legislation which will make this process a lot easier for the New South Wales government should they decide to do it the legislation should specifically say that the transition managers is to seek consensus first before making decision that way we guarantee under law that your communities will have a voice through your mayor and deputy mayor but at the some decisions where won 't be clear where staff members should go because they 're between two councils and they weren 't there prior to amalgamation they spend 50% time in each council it 's going to be those sorts of decisions where someone has to decide where the staff member goes and that 's your transition energy you have options is an administrator you 've had administrators in the past in kudamon dragooned okay I think we 've seen enough of administrators to think that we never want to see a number one again they weren 't successful in a lot of situations there 's some excellent ones too absolutely absolutely ones I never wound up in an adult highly with very well regarded but there 's also the potential for disasters but more importantly in the ministry it doesn 't have to consult with anyone it 's not ideal we want this community to be in charge of its destiny the other option is the Minister which is what Queensland had completely unworkable the Minister has her hand as well and truly for she won 't necessarily have kudamon redundant by community she won 't be able to devote the time necessary to a DML conversion this is the best model a transition team headed by a transition manager who gets the final say if there 's disagreements that can 't_''_796.21 be resolved so if the New South Wales government declines to do so as you know and the natural justice principles I 'd I feel that the government should pay the costs one-off cost of D amalgamation but the ongoing cost but the one-off cost if they declined to do so how do you who pays in the past it 's been said that the breakaway tails are paid that was what was said in the deltoid in amalgamation in actual fact going through the financial statements I found out that didn 't pay at all was paid out of the premium Algar matter into the most of the cost in Queensland they 've actually produced new legislation to bind the new council to cost incurred by the residual Council Sunshine Coast Regional Council now that legislation could have been and probably should have been challenged in to bind an entity who doesn 't exist in law to some costs that they have no saying there 's a huge what economists call a moral hasn 't there huge potential for someone to pass a lot of cost your new communities that you shouldn 't be paying for the most practical the most efficient the fairest thing is for the costs that are incurred by particular entities for them to pay the costs so for instance in community and communications and branding costs most of the rebranding gets done after amalgamation when you have two new councils it 's reasonable that they pay for their own branding costs they have to pay for their own branding because they 're going to be very careful about those cost now people and down to the minimum so it 's much more efficient for that to happen but there 's another example where it would be better for the khuddam under Gundagai Regional Council to paid the cost that would be in the case of ICT computer equipment most of that work has to be done prior to the murder motion the contract to be paying for it once again it makes more accountable and makes more the whole process more efficient so I 've listed down there winged cost would be incurred but basically the real fund means when something 's done that 's when it will be paid for the transition manager you 'll see the first eight weeks here by the Cunha manager come to go Regional Council the next two weeks the last two weeks and Queensland didn 't have someone after the DM alga motion and I think most people would agree that they should have had someone for a few weeks afterwards just a bit down the whole arrangement after amalgamation D amalgamation the individual councils would share responsibility for the wages of that transition manager okay well our just a quick reminder that I 'm in town till mandra Monday night ninth of March for community forum I do encourage everyone to come these are big decisions they 'll have a big bearing then will I please come I 'll have a saw presentation then I 'll stand there all night and answer whatever are being Gundagai doing the same thing look if you see me around town during the day which you probably won 't see too much because I 'll be mainly working with staff on the next projects that have to be done please say hello I 'm very approachable and I 'm happy to spend time with you these are the important decisions if you know people are watching these videos please encourage them to watch these videos and I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible in a few weeks time thank you _"

very much for being an award day and I just want to say to that small Commission part business commissioners said that kudamon that Gundagai was one of the first councils to sign up and that was Marion 's work back in 2014 so congratulations to Marion met with some of the information the melmans received a noted move that council Nicholson taking the council grime all in favor now so there 's another mayor of minute the emergency services levy increase which has been in posted on council right that 's sorry well councils been subjected to a 23% increase an increase from five hundred and five thousand dollars a year for its levy contribution for emergency services which is 96 thousand dollars more than last year 's increase and the recommendation I guess outlines that our position and how we might like to move forward and obtain some state government support in regard to the impacts that that creates on us and how we might like to have that reduced etc and and take action against such a significant impulse on your budget it done lasers where we weren 't involved in any of the negotiation to talk about this prior to Christmas and it didn 't come out till after the election but 160 million widow suffer insurance of separating sent weeks after 14 the state government seeks for someone that you know if we go to supper 14 and there are only something six Washington we 've been involved in those missile talks we timing is wrong I have I have had comment our area away from here who has a ministerial is advising his council today but Linda Scott is no she 's affording the low our local government yourself I was they according to have the state government which is in their eyes pays all this year and then we can the guys talk because between the our next year but it 's a great burden again on your budget I 'm sure it 's another modified bear busting it 's one of those things have put on it good man that we got a lot of you just threw the chair that that the last some reading with our state representative this was a very vocal and very robust discussion we go every council has increases it exists at 23 to 25 percent so we 're not the Lone Ranger and the local member was lately made very aware of our decisions because our draft budgets braudy of um displays this is not represented and there 's that immediate said we would not have all ever once involved in discussions leading up to this I state member is willing to mean yeah she fully we can understand their concerns wanna said she is having a heart Port Authority no through surge it was gaining was that 75 percent was fun boy insurance premiums 12.5 or light with government 0.40 stankin but that 's different or yes it so like the tidy or ninety right so this this got nothing there or for service at all now this is emergency weapons it 's to do with clients to deal with magnifier senses because for services funded that white you know this is fairly this is what I 'm going six million I 've ever made so limit Aragon another increased heat from the rule for service also and that 'll be interesting to see it yeah this this increase includes the real fire service there 's two other components which I 'll have to check for you but but this is in that one this is the attic this section of this client like this 160 million but we time for during the sink on this morning million up machine then get it so it 's been split yeah I 'll I used to come and explain the whole world fire service and the funding there was a gamma guy council previously they say there was 75% insurance premiums and twelve and a half percent spike in local over something now before that ID for in 601 offer you know one often thing and that 's how they splitting it up they 're not going the twelve not building up seventy cause they 're done insurance of pine IV we plan for during and likes I Clementine see let 's have you so I 'll get more sugar you genius now why why shouldn 't we be objective about about the break-up because if insurance covers and paying cash from 75 to 80 percent well then over for logically should be 10 percent emphasis but consistent consists of what we previously used to fight they as I said they start baby that look a local government association is finding that we don 't painting you see and then negotiate the please and then on tighter in next week mr. mayor I 'm I 'm happy to take that additional comment on that changing split they 'll be this week I 'm pretty sure it 's on the agenda for Friday trading company meters in Sydney so we 're certainly cleaning up thing Stephanie on the again well I just think you gotta be consistent with those things yeah as I said it 's a one offer I 'm liking what so we just changed it for this one but it 's wrong are we paying over double what the stadium in two years with two years we 've been battling to try and get extra money because of the terrain there is something we do with somebody done it to take that into account zone there every council thank you for that that 's one city in life I think one of the simpler cases under fair they threw the to the general mentorship accounts of Rome tradition or the recommendation you are added for those recommendations recommendations all of my point one is resolutions that came out of the Council of workshop counsel counsel is required to place it long-term financial plan budgets revenue policies operational cleans on public exhibition requirements as such council resolved that the Council of workshop held on the 13th of May and those documents have subsequently been placed on public exhibition ready for any community feedback and appropriate changes following which then can be considered at the June council meeting so this recommendation is about endorsing the actions that we took at the councilor workshop what encourage the community to go through and certainly if there 's any issue as they 've got please make a submission further further to that first recommendation we 've got a second recommendation that we 've recognized that our budget position leaves us in a position where we 're probably not financially sustainable long term unless we have a good hard review of our existing long-term financial plan and counsel at the workshop further endorsed two tasks the general manager to put a Finance Committee together and work pretty hard over the next six months to look at some substantial changes to our business practices to see if we can address the long-term financial plan and turn it around so that 's the second part of the recommendation index the immediate environment Council my only question mr. me is that we need to be careful how we word that because the council workshops technically not a meeting so we can 't have a resolution but it was general consensus over the wording around it is that we can 't actually make the cioms in a workshop but that was worded general consensus was to expediate the budget we send it out for the and we do with it and we 'd already done fine it 's community that 's my understanding anyway happy to be corrected say you may miss it well just be mindful that when we talk about things that a counselor workshop we can have a consensus view that we can get that report out from public comment but we can 't actually vote on it yeah so it 's just the more learning was again yeah you 're voting on it now yeah yeah so the resolution that you pass tonight endorses those actions which allowed us to just put it out on yeah yeah you had vision at a suitable time frame mr. mayor interested in being another General Finance Committee and it was couple of months ago right we talked about that and and I know councillor graminoid there was a workshop about counselor Graham and I were both unavailable to go and so the next time one comes up moved out is that correct counsel drama saving accounts with Kelly all in favor item eight point one point two is financial assistance grant correspondence the correspondence in relation to a resolution made at the last council meeting we put into action and send correspondence to the list of Ministers listed in your report and today we 've had a few responses and they presented their four year I mean if you say this some on expert who was that was a gun barrel for this mr. mayor I 'd just like to say congratulations to very good leader so thank you for following that up with that resolution and that there 's the one in the council papers is from Scott mash but who says you know like you know that there 's its caretaker government so there 's nothing can be another letter and say okay you 're in now what are you going to do in the beautiful tones that you wrote the last letter yeah in your light report correspondence at the back you 'll also see some replies from deputy primitive premiers on barrel arrow the premier Gladys Barry clear senator through Geoff Mackenzie so you can see that well the responses are quite positive so I think we 've made them aware of the situation my feelings on improving the financial assistance grant percentages in particular and in the amount to increase so let 's trust that they take that on board and make the changes as I need to through legislation who I am through the joy in their bridging Mackenzie 's let-up the second last paragraph we are always interested in hearing views of counsel as to the this essential support can be do it more effectively and appreciate valuable information provide I think there 's an opportunity there to potentially line up for meeting the 30 and presenting our case through through the me I had the opportunity to speak twice in my spirit on both occasions and I can assure you is well and truly over it and understands understands the disparity between metropolitan councils where I can rise like 30 million in Sydney just with parking points and we 're struggling to balance a budget here and rely solely on facts and he is well and truly covering it and I think that 's the the crack in the door we just hope in on him there on this area we 'll just go through morning through the chair if I may mr. mayor and the deputy premiers letter please finding clothes and copy the correspondence to the Commonwealth Government and the response are so you if you seek further information I encourage you to contact center than Mackenzie 's office actually we 're operating on e suggestion maybe there 's another letter or a contact II I 'm not hopeful so I can drink happy do I produce some additional correspondence to take care of you to the counselors [Music] yeah whether we succeed in the long run we got a trolley so to the head for that recommendation so so further correspondence be seen to those particular ministers as a follow-up that recommending days and three counts of names in the council laden in favor yeah bottom 8.1 countries that draft the declaration for could have undergone to go Regional Council this has come about because the declaration of the drought areas preclude certain areas of our local government area from being draft declared and hence doesn 't open up the opportunity for significant funding that other local government areas are being entitled to under the same sort of circumstances so report outlines where we sit at the moment and it is recommending recommending that we write to the Honorable Michael McCormick and seek consideration for our complete area to be drought to clean Mike 's let me consider idea Kulemin council went to a very similar process just recently and wrote and and their area was too clean and that 's open up our round of funding opportunities for them so I think we would be a missive we didn 't take the same type of action mm-hmm council shame you don 't move that way we can 't point one point four is the information bulletin with there is correspondence that you might like to note and if you 've got any comment Happy New Year so long page 59 item eight point one point five khuddam under tourism action committees three five five committee meeting minutes and there 's a recommendation that the report be received and noted and council consider recommendations included within the report mr. may excuse mouth the late this is a non-secure futures summon a member of the mental community center the first one is on page 63 what sure can I ask you to come up to the table and be available to answer a question this is a mean one of one of the recommendations in the attack maytee minutes was that the kuda member tourism action group recommends that council supports the arts center to them under stage master plan concept so that tack can begin the contained activity including sourcing appropriate funds required from from current grant programs you might recall that that the is not the chairman we were addressed at the last forum of council meeting by suggest that that 's probably not an appropriate recommendation because councilor hasn 't been councilors haven 't_''_2039.93 been presented with the master plan to endorse and I think Sharon has probably an appropriate recommendation that might might appease both parties yeah could I just remind council that that is a concept plan at this stage it isn 't a hard-and-fast man it 's purely a concept plan and in further to that recommendation I would like to make the comment that we could preface the recommendation with something on the lines that council supports the strategic approach of the the Art Center within the confines of the site however activities outside the site need to be considered in the wider community context and in line with the council strategic planning document something on that we would support something that 's that 's where we 're going we need an appropriate recommendation I don 't think we can adopt their current recommendation so well that 's the way I 'd move that we accept the recommendation because there are a lot of things in that conceptual plan that would cross over both by taking it on board that way that we support within this site the components within the components of the sort but then the consideration of the activities outside the water strategic plan and you have a comment on that heard that my comment move councillor Shane taking the council Nicholson all in favor okay I can 't see a second recommendation music there 's the second recommendation so that Council considers the Committee 's recommendation and I think of councillor Sheen 's recommendation of there is an appropriate one for you to endorse grab the item item eight point one point six is in madam a Hall management three four five committee meeting minutes and there 's a recommendation that the minutes be received and noted just one little item whilst we 're on the bottom our whole management committee it 's been concern about the boundary or the perception of the boundary between the hall and the fire ship and I think to resolve that possibly will just made some consultation between the whole committee the RFS which is the grace MacGregor and a staff member should big beautiful happy to take that on board and get that organized council showing saying the councillor bud all in favor go at all bottom eight point one point seven is stopping being ruled over at all it 's three point five committee meeting minutes membership and the whole and fees so there 's a recommendation there that the report be received I 've noted and that the membership of the award whole committee has detailed and report be endorsed and at the scheduled higher pull higher charges attached to the report be endorsed for inclusion in our fees and charges this time that not the report later agenda event that the youth of the wardroom the company yeah so basically the the water issue the column that we went and inspected there was it was dry as and unfortunately there 's no there 's no popular for anything that sort of indicates that there could be a major problem there so we 're just watching that one closely in relation to the fencing issue a letter is it it is to be sent to the neighbor and and that site so we have a clear boundary line that we can work with me listen to that recommendation new council Stuart saving the council Nicholson won 't pay that Gary on an eight point one point eight is the matter mark Reeth regeneration group 3.5 committee meeting minutes and the recommendation there is that the report be received and noted new council changed even the council filling that item eight point one point nine is cut under Development Corporation request for sponsorship for the coup de Madrid Waddell time there and there 's a recommendation that council consider sponsorship for the fair by way of provision of traffic control in lieu of 350 they have three hundred and fifty dollars sponsorship request subsequent to approval by the local area traffic committee at its June meeting whatever the cost was very compelling last year enjoy the check we wouldn 't need trucks and that for this event last year we doing that we could die get away with general traffic control we did a risk assessment on it you know in the way but possibly five hundred dollars I suppose the work hours and one possibility is in the past the school will quit varieties being held but the day before the but subject to learn confirmation yet so last season is also a real ugly people we even find a few classes that he can an atomic tantrum all right now mr. mantis people all we do presumedly Council as an in-kind spawn so there 's no financial sponsorship as such Council would still get the benefits of a financial sponsor listed yes on page 38 yeah move counsel philip ii accounts and it doesn 't only play that item 8.1 point 10 is a council meeting action report and there 's a recommendation that support be received and noted any questions on the report through the chair if I may just on the waste collection services the al-ghani guy council had a plane when I closed the lane field tips to open the transfer stations and I believe one was tagged for aging Billy and I 'm still copy requests about that transfer station and I 'd like to know if that is considered in the waste management claims it through you mr. mee I 've also spoken to a community member from engine Hill in regards to this issue I 've investigated the history which was indicated by that that prisoner I 'm also spoken to our consultant and also reviewed the current stance of the the strategic plan and of will be incorporate and I actually support the process that don 't deserve a yeah transportation or something on waste management opportunity out there so it will be incorporating the financial plan as well so the cost of that and cost effects and all will could increase overall it needs to be a decision made by counsel in context of the financial impact is on council the former council made a decision not to proceed with the sign up there because of the additional cost and imposed on that on the for a rate base so there was a decision made not to proceed with a transfer station at agent Billy and those people imagine Billy were welcome to use the collect site and that was a financial decision made by the council at the time embody through the review then it can come back to Council for a decision later later on mr. mee yes um page 91 the design for the Turner 's Lane industrial subdivision order to mjm designs expected December 18 do we have those designs blast on you that detailed designs were prepared and Bill Moore was reviewing the final detailed designs that 's I 'll have to take the question on notice and come back to you with something accurate the funding for this is mine yeah it would have applied for funding it was based on it was based on our concept design and concept estimates as part of the grant application and subsequently removed the detailed design and those detailed designs should be complete now and we should be advancing into the construction phase based on the deadlines that we 've got in front of us for that particular site well we 've done it then we don 't get the funding we are going to proceed counsel allocated and it 's budget something in the order about 800,000 towards the servicing of that block and we 've got utilized to service those blocks and open it up for sale for future Lots with 800 beers and Michael I 'm not take the question on notice mister me the grant application was looking at all the costs associated with the site including removal of existing high-voltage power lines to a new alignment and that sort of thing we certainly don 't_''_2756.789 within our 800,000 council budget allocation have the money to do that the full scope of works so we we call under alight on the grant to do that a lot and we were successful to get through to the second stage of the grant application process and that 's worth where it sits at the moment but given that the questions and then need for information we might put a detailed report back to the next council meeting on those steps mr. mee yep sorry page 96 I 'm the owl 's will report the recommendation was to the council prepare a report for the implications of implementing the ten days paid domestic violence League and the things to be included in councils lead policy but what so good currently we 're looking at our league policies at the moment essentially people have existing leave entitlements like sick leave and that sort of thing essentially whether it be for sick leave or domestic violence and that sort of thing they can utilize their existing load balances which council has and its reserves so the financial impact I think will be minimal but we 're still doing the analysis on it and and including that within draft policies does that mean that the DV lead would have to come out of the sickly is there no provision then if you 're terribly sick as well as having experienced domestic violence you get an additional ten days so the local government award allows the general manager to provide leave without pay and all sorts of other options to help people out in exceptional circumstances but we haven 't looked at the details yet of how we might incorporate get your resolution with analysis and policies but we 're working on it through best of it sorry just in your arm the action report like you look at the one Adventure Park that 's been carrying on this document for over 12 months now detail design proposed accepted in progressing wait we 've got that many different projects happening around the place where are some of these things up to reconstruction or we like all the sake and reading that and maybe we should take it off this list yes leave it in the projects list but that that particular project has now proceeded to procurement so they 're actually purchase I think what we need only gets you to say what there 's five million thousand dollars to be spent at Jubilee Park four hundred thousand dollars for a water park into the pool we need to give some people some kind of timeline of when some of the things are happening like overcoming was past me are they about the Fisher Park lights up great they 're taking pets that 's never going to happen they all these things have been kicking around for years we need some kind of a pretty close timeline of when these things are going to happen that Adventure Park I think it someone here and over there but they we were I mean their mid to late November but because of the whole level of the color it would be like the same than the I think engine over steel is a problem like yeah but Olivia 's a lot of fun cleaning and works to be done of designs at these like that but we need to be doing a better job of informing our residents we were up to with some of these projects and I think don 't be put here good morning the community news little and other things that we have convoyed you 'd comment that we could get appropriate mater in into the community we do have our project spreadsheet and we have had counselor workshops on the status of projects and that sort of thing so to inform the counselor so they know where it 's up to but in particular if we can get some more moody releases out there in terms of where some of the significant projects and heading happy to do so look like the staff your great job and you of months we just list all our green funds that are going at the moment and where they 're up to just that people know actually how many things are happening in the whole region this look the comments part there 's nothing happening coddling people don 't realize how much is actually going on because we do a very poor job sometimes I 've explained to people how much it 's actually going on in the community you have something like this accident report but it could be flipped around every manager that 's concerned you know two weeks or week and a half before they 're moving just say can you can you comment on in yeah you want to change the status of this report put some more information that then give it back Mary and a big leave the gallic we can 't_``_3065.77 wait I 'm not heading off the staff they can only put in the information that 's provided for them I just think that we need to look at the information we give to the staff I think sometimes you can do a all tack up all those comments through the G just on right there that the safety ordered on the rollover pass is completed is there any simplification with that that we can source funding for some of that roadworks up there or even planning for the alternate pedestrian access to the cemetery look we 'll look into that and prepare a report to the next meeting I can 't remember what the detail was in terms of widths and impacts on the existing structure but we probably haven 't taken that to the next level and and then start to look at opportunity so that sort of we can access I RMS with that thing the only boy away yes Otis up whenever RMS opportunities for funding like Frank productivity greens and things I like they never be the source of reference document to support our case but we certainly haven 't progressed it to that level as yet throat check I did write it with the Racing Island estimating we had a month already we 've gotten works and said if we have this draft report and and they they may also give them a copy and move on to me on which sort of I 've got it in right it 's been something happens on the other side of the road so the existing drawings that were prepared for that particular site included a service right over the other side council only built at this stage the roadworks associated with opening Southwest fuels and and and did that component of it I think we need as a council to come back and consider what the rest of the the project would entail and how we might be able to fund that we 've talked about out of workshop level we 've talked about maybe developer contribution plans so that the cost of all the infrastructure that allows development to thrive in there is funded from development charges as it comes through so there 's a funding source available we really need to work that up as a as a counselor you think that it probably came off you know like that cherry and so on well you got that pretty well under under all the noise an pretty low any other question someone like the mood that report they did the council still taking the council they didn 't all in pay that I 'm part of eight point one point eleven on page 98 is a monthly major projects program report the recommendation there is that the project report B receives a noted and recommended changes to the project budget it 's the list that be adopted questions see what he 's gone up then here that 's been shed to the pony club I don 't know they got it for the money hey geez that master a like they were full ie would be worth at seventy sixty yeah certainly we expected that they 70 72 bought at seventy two point forty something and and Mister man worthy tonight that it 's by local contractor as well yeah actually while we on that the question in event at the weekend went off extremely relevant oh and then pick know in the end caught up on the Sadao a since last August when chairman of Christian Australia and listen waters I 've been pretty comedy that set up down here and just a community feel and she was them and she thanked very successful and other businesses and exits you 'd run so she was really really at look honestly I would like to move the council one cent Aveda thanks to Jim 's gave me and he 's coming now yes in said one of the logs there 's a login if I drag this big tree in The Gambia pipe and I get like a Carvey 's carpet to go in that 's counted up this way dog an attacker box on this end and in the middle he 's covered and if you get yeah he 's inside of him the look so that you 've got our breach carved in with a jump over and ever they are printing the back panels unbelievable no but unbelievable okay it 's something that will just our time here because I think the pleats in the mill it up just the all yeah yes cancel Philip second canceled in Thailand more on that hand of the science story whoever overnight estimated just a comment minutes that tourism action group committee have committed to write a thank-you letter to any event that happens the organizers of any event that happens include among us so maybe do the same yep it 's just on that event through the check I was up there with the Lions Club and and we do cater quite a few of those events or any year and they are growing with popularity within their organization that like unfortunately they 're not spectator events they are events for their club and by not having which I open to the public if they 're able to do it without all the insurance costs and burden that comes with the probably showing Motor Vehicles and motorsport so that they they 're looking at even increasing the use of that facility because it suits their event and it doesn 't interfere with residents or community and that so it 's it 's a great learn to count fills up the motels or coffee shops and cafes are busy it 's a really good thing it 's a venue that we can actually hopefully watch it that counselor soon the arm could RFS Brigade through the fire protection are there three or four events every year and they give quite a sizable donation to us which enables us to buy a lot of things here every day through so that 's a lot of wood we had to catalyze item eight point two point one it 's a December quarterly budget review statement there 's a recommendation there I 'm sorry read the wrong one the March two thousand Island quarterly budget review statement be accepted and that budget variations listed in the attached report be adopted page 105 it 's really through the chair um should ensure as I might only budget says December at the top yeah the recommendation says says March just through the chair just a couple of comments if I could on page 109 just about possible future change this unexpected employee costs Topsy 121 pounds and have been that 's somebody who explained this way or what that represents so they 're a combination of two hundred and three thousand in back pay that resulted from the alignment of the onto the same system the people that had been disadvantaged had the back paid and the original budget included four hundred and eighteen thousand dollars worth of savings from the plan tree structure that was discussed at a workshop in June last year those changes were never implemented that that 's um in in that one 's time Alan was looking to do a restructure and that never eventually poseidon 's when never made didn 't so I could go back to the list from the workshop and provided at a future losing was in June last male another comment it might comment we get we 'd have less that we do that for the likes of come today or that paint any better than to wear it with your hand Pacific an eyeball bloody for a workshop just with this entity information yep just wallop you going for just continue to walk on page 119 those things mixed reports are quality next record is that the one jump yeah okay I 'll to make it look dressing anything else on the quarterly report just threw the chair it 's boost the council 's funding that 's the intention with this report that I guess if you wanted to reject that we could take it out of what was adopted here yeah so the majority of expenditure reads as has already occurred and at a workshop it was agreed that but to a council anywhere we actually had performed yes do it so it 's actually documented rather than talking about something that 's have another workshop begin so you 're voting on it now so this is again some variations yeah yes after sorts of variation that 's put up as a draft in front of you and now you 've got the obligation that doesn 't miss mind the money 's already been spent no sorry so that 's Cortland yeah so there was no budget allocated for the amount of money about the 1.4 million dollars on that according to the admin yeah they Americans so that that 's that 's all y 'all_''_3910.22 used to really know Gary then all of a sudden we had a meeting dolls supposedly Pierre for his silly Shepherd there was the old ways the money going spent on that so if you 're calling is right Jim that the money is already been spent where has been allocated to as a cosigner because you 're bringing forward here a budget variation to bring in to say that yes councils now agree that we 're gonna spend them in dollars I 'm a civic center which I don 't think any of us in Britain it 's Weinstein the 700 is part of the million dollars and more question is if the money is being spent will holder Ford 's in these figures somewhere not then what we 're looking for now is a recommendation to say we all agree that we we we 've agreed and we can spend the mean dogmas of each other well I for one did not really it was a subject of a workshop here where discussion was had about how much it was going to cost to complete that facility I can 't remember the exact figures but the estimate that stage was that it was that was it was 250 and the my to say allocate a million to it I 'm happy to take out if that 's if it 's voted down tonight I can take that out and we can discuss it at a future workshop but that was that 's where that figures come from you know I remember at the workshop I said we 've got a hole in the middle of the Civic Center that we 've got to do something with and iyx Andrew I said and don 't tell us the 250,000 job just how much to put it back into place and you I think you said 110 yep 110 thousand only it 's also important to acknowledge the fact that although it says seven hundred thousand dollars that no in here that amount was actually speaking the Town Hall that 's been on other other monies being contributed to that amount so the might say 700 thousand for the Town Hall we look at that doing of way out where is a in actual fact that 's nowhere near the accurate figure that was actually spent in the Town Hall but it is been asking for some time as to what exactly have we spent on the townhall and it can 't_''_4077.15 be that hard to work out you 've asked the question so go through the go through the costs that have been paid tonight and say well this is what we spent on the tunnel I might get Tim I just get Tim to give the answer he gave me yesterday because I 'm the main one that 's been pushing for this as well as you know David and unfortunately it 's not as cut and dried as I were a wife a thought but we might just get to explain what he said he was just like about the date was so because there was never a budget approved for that for the Town Hall it was found that everything there all the expenses they had been coded to the admin building in the in the initial stages of looking into this we worked on the assumption that the the work on the admin building had been completed around July and everything from August on was Town Hall works based on that assumption it 's with in having sort of pursued that a bit more with with questions from councillors the project staff are telling us that it 's not that simple that there are transactions that 's that span that date that commitment can 't categorize just that simply so they under need to do their work to identify where where we we 're gonna have to separate those costs for a from account and accountant point of view anyway so they 're gonna have to do a bit of work to let us know how we do that looking the example kills the chrome there was the built a lose their thirteen and half thousand dollars for the main front door at the admin building because it come in after October and went straight to the Town Hall costs surely our policy is when we get an invoice that it 's got to be written on there what invoices will I know in my business I don 't if you don 't give me tell me what you want me Medical you 're not getting it oh made that we just carried the expenses to the admin building when it was another project why why wasn 't I now the costs in a crime it immediately he works out of there I just don 't get I 'm sorry but that 's that 's absolutely how we would in my department with how we would run things but I mean it 's happened here yeah go back to the problem we had the point fun last year it 's exactly the same as the plant I 'm will to me and dollar short and plain fun last G because things weren 't allocated correctly to the jobs I 'm sorry I playing fun came up to me in dollar short I 've been paying the peanuts there was a Matthew Dover spend in the Civic in the admin building and that 's where the cost of n transpose is to make it not look as bad as the other spend in that area councillor Kelly that may be so but at the end of the day yeah this is the second time major projects have happened where 't keep doing this right that would be interesting what the instructions were on the day that 's all that 's all I want to say to be interesting well I 'm not gonna blame any credence that but it 's interesting what the instructions that were given on the day so just getting back to this budget variation so this is what in the counting thing to pull weight into line via via books via quarterly budget that million yeah that 's right now we include it as a likely variation for the December another September quality budget review because we didn 't know the exact figures now that we 've got a bit more certainty about that we 've included in the body of the statement and so yes that 's a ticking the budget box and and that is including that rectification to remedial work to finish off that TV 10 that 's right but we can 't change those numbers that are in the quarterly budget review we can suddenly say I know them up and do that because we need to so I 'll move like to say that I cannot see how we can 't go through a total expenditure on both those projects the admin and the hall and allocate them out there in some cases you might have to make assumptions but over the fourteen ninety percent of the ninety percent of the cases you should be able to work out with a line through the hole or whether right at the admin bill and I think that sheet or needs to be done and put in front of us but that 's that certainly needs to happen because we 're going to need to provide that information but whenever financial statements are audited will up their back yard is in our taken up for each of those that 's it so from my point of view it certainly needs to happen but it 's not something that I can do because I 'm at the project so happy to allocate staff who are associated with that project to do the best that they can to just put those costs any other questions on that corn we budget like the moon the day so I was digging on the ball I 'm autumn eight point two point two is a monthly finance report for April 2019 to be received and noted come on sorry if I couldn 't through the G should be should be April if you could adjust that in your a resolution through the chair who I could just on page 119 touches on their plate income its move at this point in frustrating but don 't be on CUDA month ahead both had very robust plant replacement funds programs but here we are fully two years later we still haven 't got the broad according to this so just wondering you get what is the issue why can 't we get this the allocations right what we 'll be working on this some two or three months ago he comes upon I think we 're where we got behind this year is in the first four months when we were questioning it in the last year and without speaking to nicely about previous Generalmajor nothing really happened and all of a sudden mr. Maloy and Jim Swan brought forward so I 'm starting to catch up but we lost that first four months bill on page 120 the thing that hits you fair and square in the middle before it is wages budget to be currently English that 's nice you know I just have a explanation for that please the variance eads because that 's where the project management started coded to so their their cost will come out of merger money but they have to be coded somewhere in the general ledger so that 's where they appeal cancel publish if if you go back to discussions last year and we 're trying to fix the budget for the son from where we were to what happened will something be improved while have two new adults and the general made the said that at least a little yeah we were on it what so effectively that numbers a is where that numbers were in al Qaeda to smoke exactly but I 'll follow the true and then tracking it and that 's where everyone 's got allocated to and yeah it 's from a decision and that we we 're up where we originally badges on all did just one point on that business unit summary it 's something we would like to improve on we with the new structure being in place at the moment there isn 't if it 's hard to align last year 's budget with this year 's actuals and and I guess we 're only a couple months into the new structure so with a busy time with budgets and everything else we haven 't been able to expand on that yet but that 's in pipeline you get a moving second flap did I miss something kind of a general question bottom eight point three point one is could wonder Development Corporation Memorandum of Understanding there 's a recommendation there that counts on the go she ate a member of Understanding with the CDC covering the 2019-20 period and the memorandum of understanding is to include agreed activities outcomes a program for monitoring performance communication requirements and the representation requirements and relevant kemp council committee meetings mr. Mather question in the I presume that the immediate document before the qu demanded under guard not just coot Amanda but it talks about meetings with the the general manager and the staff of the of the council with the the CEO of CDs thing and I know that back when kudamon wrote in those ladies he was first up and running there was a two councillors were sitting on the CDC board bargain to see that anywhere in this this new outline I just wondered no yeah that 's right so I just wondered if we still want counselors at the babies as represented on this side they say I found out five committees Jake yep yeah yep not it was then canceled and I had done they need more sheets so it needs to be added what 's going on what 's the memory chip what 's across the business remember it has been it does but they are they are this this year they are reducing the membership in order to get more on board to obtain it was a little bit pricey for different ones but a lot of them that wanted to join they 've come along will become a member so yeah it 's at the present time that 's what I 'm not sure on the title thicker but yeah not at present math midnight Louis and they get subsidized for those government things they do symbol Miriam cranes off ill today otherwise she could probably provide a bit further background of how to negotiations have been going to date and she has a better understanding I do upheld or work so my apologies we doing it quarterly reports I don 't believe we 've been receiving any communication from them over the last couple of years since the merger so this is a case of Miriam I guess trying to establish some some protocols to make sure that counsels investment because we do invest in this group we 're getting paid for money and we 're not duplicating roles that council undertakes and and that they undertake separately within that tree they have seen that the counsel CD to look like quarterly written report see there they start when we can unpublish mr. me with the addition of councillors being on the ball would move capital Philips Economic Council vote all in favor okay item eight point four is the development applications approved by April to be noted at an eight point six point one is council water restriction policy and procedures this relates specifically to the Gundagai water articulation system the former council had some policies that never been brought into line with the standard templates of CGR C 's policies templates happy to take any question on board but it 's really just adopting these policies right but as you counsel for the one week Yes Mother agent before it successfully passed will should just continue it on yeah item eight point seven point one is the operations report for May 2009 a and there 's a recommendation there that the report be received that 's a check I am just Doug requests like time you stop it then I would save quite a few phone calls without that camara long road and wanted an improving this boat and we 've kept with Kevin away dentist to took on a leading role and did a fantastic job neurontin restaurant a few things calls from people one on the ocean side of that ride who really delight of well certainly pass those congratulations on the staff they are doing an amazing job Nicholson take my pencil write an eight point eight is the report on bomb along the Long Creek Bridge the recommendation is that council approve an amount of one hundred and twenty three thousand one hundred for the breach construction to be brought forward and funded through the 2018-19 roads budget and council approved murid are we following to undertake this construction of the new bridge it 's quite we 've used mobile polling on a number of bridges in this locality and they always give you value for money and the best price this is quite an urgency to a shop where we had an existing proposal from them the bridge has been recognized as a significant risk and Judith due to that I 'm recommending that council avoids the tendering process and accept set price as if they money price in an emergency situation well though I 'll move the recommendation just on that does that make all this I 'll be right over start with with the environmental things if what we got through to me because I can work on a pretty cool yes because now they 're already copied ask me yeah can can I suggest that Mad Max back at work on Thursday this week and he 'll probably put some media correspondence about this particular project into our newsletters and I 'll make sure that those dates are are highlighted in that down later your idea why that 's made council going no one no one suited page 160 of it an eight-point 10.1 is that maintenance of public open spaces that stop and Bengal and Wallenberg Wayne to put this report together I guess for you to be informed but also endorse that this is the way that they will undertake maintenance on those particular sites giving this review of those particular villages [Applause] Oh what outcome southern wrong one I threw a chair wine what would um on page 161 or I think that you 're going to do what roughly for a village like Valen bean and Stocking Bengal what what 's unknown at this stage in regards to an overall summary cost the work will be planned within the existing budget so whatever the funding currently exists will allow us to undertake the relevant amount of work so basically the available funds will dictate the level of the amount of work the main issue is about the taking the proactive approach and working with the communities in determining a long term strategy but how we on graft at hand so from from counsels perspective is that we need to be seen and acting as that they 're no different to you couldn 't run you 're gonna join and that they need to be involved and participate in that the maintenance operations within their village and if we can get them to participate in that all the better for us so in regard to finances it 's really on available funds to do what we can but the community is embracing their proposal this stage but also it 's a need to formalize at the moment this is one with wind and formalize so we need to lock it in the policy and regulation so we 've been carry on to the ambience oh I mean that I suppose it 's up to the relevant manager to make that determination and address the issues that he has to deal with I 'm not aware of the issues that he has I 've only dealt with the two villages which come under more control and met with those particular community groups and express their concerns and some ways that we can move forward but I certainly imagine that the other direction yeah you might you might no no no what what what we 've done in this structure that was adopted by council is we had our operational areas particularly engineering services and our parks and gardens split into locality so you 've got a manager responsible who lives in those particular localities taking responsibility so in terms of our parks and gardens wine looks after the CUDA mandra area and Andrew looks after the Gundagai area so Dwayne 's looking after the parks and gardens within the villages of wall and bone and stuff and bingo where Andrew will look certainly have to care of emotionally easier if we had the same position for all our villages and that way that 's top of ability yeah like the villages in the gonna go into the show what can 't we have what they and that 's what we want to do it oh yeah entries are getting removed matter where they are yeah so so at a management level Andrew and wine will communicate and make sure that we 've got consistency across the line that we manage our our villages wine I guess is it is he 's new to the organization and is determining a framework for how he 's going to manage his villages and now those guys are talking and there 'll be some consistency go through you know just on that I 'll mention to fill this afternoon some stage of works audio I 'd like to have it where we get the staff structure right from the top right for the person and things like this so right lines and Charlie 's job is this this this and this he 's got that one then hang on to engineering what if so we know who the exact person is to talk to about something if we get up complaint from a community filigree so so we started that process at a councillor workshop recently where we presented the new management team and told you what they responsibilities for I 've got a structure chart now that flows out all the stuff in the organization um so I 'm happy to showcase ever have an upcoming workshop so that everyone 's familiar with the key contacts and who does what in our grants action if I if I may to you mr. mayor it is important that that Andrew and I do communicate on a regular basis so you know we 've got the street free policy and all the issues we are working as a team in developing those strategies it 's just an I 'm action in a particular program at this point in time and it was important that you understand where we 're coming from regards there are methodologies because the last thing I think we wanted to do is to issues that you are not aware of so that you 're aware of what 's happening let 's dedicate the workshop go right through that 's faction you know we know that you 're collecting here one of them is not an Angels Ellison and whatever anyone job like clean set and likewise some in terms of the engineering side the roadworks that are happening you 've got Matt looking after Gundagai and mark cooking up the food of under for those guys that their programs by sitting down together and looking at what resources that they 've got available and collectively share solutions and share resources where appropriate that 's the way we 're operating as a management team but it gives ownership and pride into a particular area by someone who 's living in the area and looking after the area and that 's the structure that you as a council adopted um and that 's what we 've implemented we got the recommendations to me just people we do um on my understanding with the mall is creep breach that was didn 't fit was that it do we have do we have an update on that installation of that bridge again three mr. mayor I 've met with the local community and that issue has been rain with discussions with the relevant staff and I 'm currently addressing a whole number of issues with the community raise they 've sent me a detailed breakdown of all their issues and what we 're doing together developing a program of delivery so that 's in train now and that 's happening we 've already service a number of their requirements that they 've been Decatur that the war on being and that is one that 's on the list and will be addressed it 's going to become a tourism I come that big hotel it 's a big one I love it thanks for that mine so it 's someone lot near that recommendation new council he doesn 't Second Council Bowden all in favor of an eight point ten point two is a straight trade management policy it 's in a draft format and the recommendation is seeking to put it on public exhibition for a appropriate advertising and that all costs associated with the structure policy developed be funded from from the strictly audit budget do we have a strength tree or budget we must do yeah we do we I think we allocated a couple hundred thousand or something last year to his directory order through mr. Meade no that 's right there 's a hundred thousand dollars but was allocated we 've spent about fifty two thousand of that and this will be undertaken as part of that process because it 's one of the recommendations of the audit that 's part of this state 's main completely and which I 'll also be presented to Council the process is once this policy is adopted I will then be submitting the audit to a compliment the policy through the chair cause it might comment on page 169 item number seventeen if everybody reads that then referred back to page one six one and look at dot point one where we can remove of dead and unwanted trees but then when you go there streak-free policy in rural areas the trees that do not our infrastructure our apartment 's assets and we 've obligated if we adopt this we can 't touch the tree you know that fall on the assets which cost us thousands of dollars yet if you live in the village you can remove it if it 's done watered or did not disappoint it contradict then you go across to page 171 or than 31 I know we 've never pursued this but it is a fairly strong statement private trees that have roots that have invaded councils underground services will be responsible for the full cost of associated service and repair of the said services yet no resident can claim any assistance from counsel from the council trees that disrupt or upheaved their fences or their driveways but the council can pursue there isn 't_''_5941.33 I find that one also very frustrating yes three chair I can supply more um I think when met Stubbs gets back it would be good to have a discussion about this because I 've been involved with him in relation to some lane and land up my way with a neighbor of mine fence joining during the railroad reserve and under the new biodiversity conservation act they have huge payout so this lady came up very very good but we were just going to you know go on pull down the fence get the days as an Optima old dead tree that 's kind of fall over the fence this and that we are not allowed to touch those trees but you know I just jokingly said to us and well when this dead tree falls having the offense I 'll send you the bill seen they won 't that 's your problem but so the word common sense in relation to all these promised up is gone right up and all and she said to me they are sweating and they say of waiting for someone to make a mistake so they can silver making these f-16s I decided we just you know following practical point of view you know my neighbor commissioned a report this costing somewhere between four and five thousand dollars the gala identify which trees it could you could not go I I went along with with her thought I said don 't worry about when I form the new fence we 'll just we 'll just tied it up she said you know let the burn those if they form the new fence then I said well some of those someone else won 't mention where they actually on they weren 't on the Bandit so because there 's a thing here by all my council reserve so on the council Road reserve we are not allowed and then yeah and supposedly according to her under the Bioversity Act people cannot go on and and cut wood on council reserves either right all right she 's been rebut up our way since just just a wait in the rural area there 's a band the only thing signed it 's going to be in the private property and not under this act this yes sir mr. mayor no the act act applies on both the both on the council Ireland and also privately but we can only address the issues associated with that council lead I think that them in issues which have been raised a good person while we go into public exhibition and we wouldn 't really want to stimulate conversation and and get them to realize that there are lots of issues associated through don 't realize the complexity that no exists fish with their biodiversity regulations that come into force which now override all other policies and regulations or socio with vegetation so the purpose is is to get that feedback and then we make the relevant changes which are still have to be within the rules and regulations and statutes and exception that never sees the board on trade on the entry it 's I 've gained elders he 's gotta look out for like if he wants to do something cut it in with this same rule applied it says even here it 's not under this policy yeah exactly mr. mayor that the this this policy only deals with trees identified on council college yeah and I just that expanding on what why missing council itself had the same issues when bigger barrel the edging Billy Hill was done because over there for two days going on identifying some dead this have that could not be dropped you know different reason so there counts himself as a has more than the cost of always Thomas tough to on another significant number trees yeah through that that area why this what were they do you want to just make comment so the more they picked up both over to a bit the new essential bit because we know they 've actually right somebody who 's included I seen it done of me that about the debarred training that we 've now basically they 're not going to do yes mister made at the moment until we get a policy we really are hamstrung you know guys to how we can control other authorities who who work within the realms of council land example you know energy gas telecom etc and the problem is is that they 're actually working on or around council assets and the problem we have with with essential energy and wanna say essentially the power authorities you 're going and regularly pruning our trees is they go in with one purpose and that 's to to prune the tree and the power line but what they 're actually doing is they 're using very poor pruning techniques and what direct and as a consequence they 're removing a liability from themselves on to us because that tree becomes a why ability for us it 's our acid those trees were to prune and shape in the in the form of our eyes become quite structurally unsound and they didn 't become a risk to our community and also a cost to us now until a policy is adopted it 's hard to counsel them to go into it and negotiations with that power comes to say well this is how we expect things to be done but we have that right I mean this is our asset and the tendency would be is that gentlemen the mayor and myself will meet with senior staff from essential energy once our policies adopted and we will be requesting that every time they come in to is sure they must abide by our policy our policies developed around their rules and registration so the policy does not ignore their issues proper agricultural practices and that is no more bars pruning and etc so but it 's up to council to enforce that and I certainly intend to do that once the policies adopted in put in place with the support of council and the process has come I I really that line on you know there may be certain so certainly council is just identified a number of changes or not number of clauses that might need to be reviewed but the recommendation is that we put it on public exhibition and maybe as a council we might review those clauses and send it and feed backed away so that we get it refined so that when it does come before council into course it 's what we intend to move forward with move council they 've taken the council Nicholson I think we 're on page 182 the end is near notice emotion put forward by the men at the Callister in relation to the coup de mundo end up all weekend hours yesterday or that that brought up you said that some people don 't need that we there has moved a bit later so they taught to utilize it the pool a lot of people do work five days a week or sad des moines internet for work five days a week year the time get a bit a house worth watching like kids sports on that they go all sad days but you know they like to do things early and could go for a swim in the pool later you know so whether it 's extended Al 's or whether it 's moving the three years I think what these meal to more eleven something about know that night we probably know to look at that and other issues home three years to varimax you like to have a amendment to that that council without putting a timeframe on it you investigate all options of the looking after council own facilities in regard to whether we look at staff or contractors it some point in the future through the chair the point is right here and there in bright in front of us we 've got a multi-million dollar asset which is a underutilized because the Chancellor 's budget restrictions but the the weekends we used to have people and people from your town come across to prove them on reviews of food they now go to jail because of the hours of operation Julie a far superior to the month we need this pool facility open all the anger all that said they entered that 's my point I agree with you big ass it probably sitting there but I 'm silently there 's no disrespect meant to stop at all that we 've got to find a way an economical way to have this bill open over the weekend what is in the mayor 's notice emotion that we investigate feasibility I think look at how we can make it happen whether it 's made earlier two sections or something but I mean any report for things I don 't know I don 't know a betrayal with eyes or whatever we can do a bit of a surveyor from the play ball you know what time okay just the guy who first no no it doesn 't just have to be weekend needs to get some air we utilize that time the hope to I know the addition of the weather from Dylan action to film engine oh yeah yeah um that doesn 't sort of aunt of talked about some points that happen at the pool and the way they manage it but it doesn 't sort of support or not support the motion yeah you know I 'm happy to as I City for even one way is if we gates support by putting something on the on the website yeah so the motion that you 're looking at talks about council investigating the feasibility of extended elves operational yes and that that 's exactly what staff intended Elaine 's looking at a complete review of their recreational assets including the the pools to work out what is probably the best a most efficient way that we can offer those services to the community so it will step through a process and get that underlined and get a report back council three the chair Pike over just in regards to a feasibility study that 's fine as long as it months but the usage it requires right here and now you know this is a single there these I think you know I think what what wine so that like fifty gets for half months when they kept on trying but I just think this is something like this you know we 've got an issue let 's look at this bubbling now under itself you know them gambit Republican y 'all_''_6689.66 whatever names in six months seven months you know I just think we need to get on some of those things right thank you mister me I certainly appreciate the comment Rick turbo made and certainly know which picture from us doing a preliminary investigation into issues which have been raised here tonight the process that I 'm looking at is sending more long-term and it gives it more long-term strategic plan about how we manage not just a pool or recreational facilities throughout the Shire but I 'm more than happy and able to come up with that I suppose the interim investigation to cover some of the issues which have been raised here but remembering that at more permanent long-term investigation traits of so which is to get in that way in the other comics we 've got the nice there and Gill added an amendment to it cancel Kelly taking the council still on either part of 10.1 is questions with notice both questions are from counselor boater do on aspect thank you these questions which are actually the other way round because the first one is what components are covered in council 's disaster plan and then police described council 's recovery resilience plan came out of the small business friend conference with the deputy mayor of Li small and the general manager of a tweed valley tweed heads or the tweed we 're talking about how they were impacted by the floods and how that was massive and how you know like businesses were just you know wiped out and then moving on to the recovery plan you know where where things could get back on track again and like I the mayor and I carried on a little debate about why can 't you just ask do we have a disaster plan avoid no answers because that would have been really easy so that 's why I put in those components and I spoke to Susan about it and and actually the general manager of one of the councillors of one of the councils talked about other Easter they had an IT disaster where they were hacked and lost information for six days and Susan said we have a comprehensive IT disaster plan I just think we need to be as counselors we need to be aware of what 's in place do we have a disaster plan if a pandemic comes through what are our recovery plans so the answer is you know we do we 'll find them and they should be subject of a workshop but it is a strategy that I put them there just so that you as counselors are aware and that the community is aware that we are looking after them so the answers are adequate thank you the the the answers provided from the council officer talked about us certainly been able to provide detailed information of the council workshop but I can assure not called disaster planes yeah emergency management plans and we have a local emergency management committee we have a local emergency management officer and we make regular with all the emergency service agencies and plan on how we will manage various types of disasters such as a flood we have a specific flood claim as part of our implant we 've certainly got all those practices in place or developing as a new counsel work we 've got some more things coming together but the community can pretty much rest assured that we 've been thinking about these things for a long time we 've got a good history on how that haven 't managed disasters but happy to run through the whole emergency management plan disaster recovery in terms of business continuity and things on it 's a different kettle of fish my happended workshop that through as well we also have 50,000 business continuity and disaster recovery from the yeah so we 've actually purposely setting up the Brent and Street Depot is our Emergency Operations Center it has excellent facilities for emergency services and the appropriate council that facilities without interrupting all the other known today operations so yeah we 've been working on that for a while Glenn 's our local emergency management officer and for council so yeah we can certainly bring discussions back at a council level and provide copies of the our documentation yeah yeah Phil also we 've already we 've had a practice set up actually I 've got 200 on the line and the next meeting is going to be here the next audience in learning is here so we 'll probably do the same thing at that so when we had our meeting we actually sent it back I thought everybody could put all the cards on and set it up as if there was an emergency because if there 's a there 's a system that we use and we could utilize that computer up there too and in regard to its big big going paperless and we 're trying everybody in that but but we 're sort of kicking dolls with that other man we 're not planting lights for all sorts of things and every every put forward something that they go to so we would have an emergency plan so truck rally or emergency plan for flood or fire and because of particularly having issues at the moment which stop great my lines so we 've got on an ad already because I 've they had an issue down here on the highway with yes yes he had some sort of issues began his work out we got hit really well right now we 've got like the second new camp Takota saving the campus right the minibus [Music] we 'll follow the the order will we 8.2 contries investment report I the April so submitted as a light report in Council Nicholson all in favor item eight point seven point to a report on the council minibus with a recommendation that the minibus be retained for a period of six months and a report on the bus usage income and cost against the bus be prepared and submitted to the November 2000 on an ordinary meaning yep yes damn before the segment who 's going to make the real big license who can use use of the bus and will put it back in front of Council as I email so I will tick tack until we 've we 've got it so that it runs quite comfortable with the arrangement and if that 's appropriate and that 's entirely volunteer who are inducted into the council workplace are allowed to draw at the bottom that will be part of the guideline weight from where will it be um like who will look after the bookings of the bus so we 're looking at Mira Booker and Eli who have offered that service that they 've done previously with about my bus they 're happy to do it but we 'll write some guidelines around it and make sure that we 've got it right before we engage with them that means I then suggest because the number of things have to be put in place including the public being notified that we 're doing this trial period that it start from June and go till November so it 's a full six months of usage but the general manager could and enjoys the a few days away yeah I 'll give us a month to get that locked in the place yet there 's there 's no problem on on a short turnaround of getting the guidelines we 've got a set of guidelines already we just need to add appropriate clauses to know you to be our community so can we work absolutely that 's a distributed by a mile and if everyone 's comfortable with the guidelines after fitted back and forth we 'll adopt them on the spot and then get it gone then Charlotte well trying to violence is related I 'm through the trial yep through the chair for my I initially when we spoke about this I expressed some concerns about affecting other transport companies in gander guy and CUDA mandra I noticed a couple of things in me and I 'm happy enough to go through a six-month trial that 's what we need to do but like even when it has been in our control the routes been damaged by an unknown driver but we need to make sure those things are really sign-off obviously but they damaged it and so we weren 't those things whatever went up was in our own can probably need to make sure that miracle crew got a really set of program or policy to make sure it doesn 't come back of course because now on that yeah they 're done we don 't get any in Toronto because you can 't import oh god thanks anyway well I agree we 've got a look at the login gonna go I can 't_''_7419.94 say it 's really affecting anyone for something on the bus is small and you know text you can get good and without ever highlight places that affect people come on cragger ask when thin will be able to let the public not soon as counselors so on offer guidelines tell me that they 're happy with it will advertise it strata right through our matey offices through the chair if I may mr. Mir I know in CUDA Mundra and that service is problem has got a similar size for us and I know we regularly use it as the high school to take 't know how we 're going to complete with that and all you have to do is fill it up but yeah it 's problematic I think sorry you know they only wanna send Kendall workshop at Humber Uncle Jim that 'll do you on or something they can 't get more say comfortable can 't_''_7488.25 get enough parents to do it so they don 't go mr. McKnight suggest that we that we incorporate discussions with the staff at yearbook or who haven 't had experience with the Velma box and and know you know the current fees and charges and the administration side of it yeah three mister me my my understanding counselor Kelly is that Velma is not exclusively for the aged but Paige in particular it has particular preference to the aged and the isolated to go shopping or occasionally they may have a luncheon or something like this one was that neither come and they mainly dish user thrilled because having the Belmont that 's cool prove it although we 're gonna recommend Dyson oh yeah further chair one of the supporting letters have come access so I suggest that them practical mr. Mehra thanks to the community for their submissions it just it just shows the involvement of our communities when they when they feel passionately about an issue so we appreciate their participation and input right so we 're gonna recommend icing their new council taking the council fills all in taiga carry out of eight point seven point three is khuddam under rugby union club request for financial assistance to complete the Union Club facilities project and there 's a recommendation there that Council approved the acting general manager to investigate available options for the council to provide financial assistance to the Rugby Club in accordance with legislation under the Local Government Act through the chaired and there was a good meeting we had there too fantastic facility most important I haven 't_''_7654.04 done that costing right there hundred twenty thousand short let 's hope that hundred twenty finishes the job Council has not even though they suspect we have Council has not retained the juice to this camp as a council just too quickly so there 's no honeymoon there for two ways you can do it you can either do it through a loan or my personal preferred way would be to treat as of Sunday dinner and I feel that the outstanding amount of 120 will be repaid over five years with interest charged yearly at four percent per annum on the outstanding balance as a summary data Brandner 120 the end up going through no it was a hundred it was a hundred a hundred thousand yeah but I think they got some we had funding they had other yet other funds he won the hundred so he was wanting a hundred and these terms were like to pay twenty thousand passing interest Picchu on the diminishing scale of first year 20,000 plus four percent on 100 then the next year 20,000 plus the four percent on mating so forth I think this recommendation is just putting us on a bit of a wheel again I mean grants with counselor Graham I think we should get a resolution he now do that so they can get on with the job and fees the facility it 's it 's open up the opportunity for even international level football these like I could see women 's Test matches being played in I can 't see any reason why it wouldn 't and facilities terrific it 's also a facility and venue for the general public as well which will be another opportunity to the broader community so I mean a graduate council dream I think we should make a resolution here now whether the client agreement grant agreement or summary data I think we should put me in place and and get them on with the Local Government Act doesn 't preclude you from learning someone money it doesn 't say you can 't do it there 's specific provisions in the Act that says that you need to see local government ministers approval to do something outside the norm which is this is outside the norm so there the legislation doesn 't preclude it but it you need to make sure that you if I came to like I did bring like them in New South Wales back to their legal department there about this and it 's fine some form written agreement with them to cover that given that it was a council asset I couldn 't say a problem with it and the limitations that new ministerial things if it 's greater than 5% of your lake revenue that you 're learning but it isn 't so it fits all always requirement I am I totally agree look it 's a good facility and it needs to be finished now it could open up we 've got a few other projects boy organisation to come we 're gonna realize if they fall short we might have the same thing on their end but I suppose we probably getting more money than we out on the investment hunt so you know if they figure stack up and if someone else comes up and they figure stack up I got no problems filming [Music] through that it 's definitely no yukue play and all right here whatever council is saying I would actually I prefer that recommendation in the papers where the general manager actually goes and comes up with some options rather than trying to make an ad-hoc I 'll go no I didn 't participate in the discussion with the rugby clubs I 'm really at a loss to understand what they were in payment scheme we speak you guys work my course happy to hear other things yeah they presented a fairly simple but the comprehensive bright the end of the bonuses which their financial structure which we 've got there and they had a fairly straightforward plan of repayment and and it wasn 't complicated it wasn 't difficult but thought I 'll just go back to the recommendation so it doesn 't resolve it it leaves that still painting and I think they 're in a situation where they they need this now to continue and finish the job and again I I 'll go back to what counsel with Grimes said initially let 's you know sort this out now you 've got the option of a grant agreement Hawaiian agreement for a sundry debtor and David 's recommendation was and sundry dedicates it simple and the interest is faith and they also want the option that if they wanted pay it quicker to if a motion comes out of what counselors Jensen would second that I think that the time is of the essence mr. mayor are for the general manias managers our information cooter going along quite well on the rugby this year and they potentially could end up happening hosting a green point in that zone yeah I do that that we get great point to award for them very very quickly so even if we delay year that could potentially stop that my time the facility ready let 's come to the rainfall and it doesn 't it the grandmas on September it happens in all of us first on fire white sign thing I need if we set that in Phoenix they 've got piece of pot wait that 's what I find the si next probably well it 's emergency if you want to utilize that soon it 's gonna take two months to finish near you quickly okay just just with the Sun we did a council grand rosette was anything that was more likely smaller Mia Marie in despite we got a boy the local the date I haven 't done any very searching but like really answer if I can they they offered the interest rate at 4% and but it 's a lot better than what we are currently getting on their reserves and I think it 's only fair that they do pay interest because that is then showing the broader community that that they are paying their way I think that 's a little pain because we 'll have everyone come you know come in to us if you know certainly but all I just I 've got no problem for the 4% but I 'm just in now if we were beyond under local government under any anybody 's that we have to charge certain amount of investment rates or let alone like so I don 't_''_8150.37 I don 't believe we are because technically it is LSA and you could green the money if you wish but that wouldn 't that then would be setting a precedent which we don 't want to see so they they 're they 're prepared to pay the 4% and that that meaning acceptable and it is actually setting the first event and showing the community that they are paying their ways that they 're not giving it to nothing I don 't think we could create any more because we 're already created at something oh I 'm happy of the 4% know that if I just quickly make a comment I think everybody in the room reiterate what most Chancellor said well I asked a general manager would you be comfortable in setting up a something good as account how you comfortable with that solution it 's just a way that we establish a loan and someone pays money back sundry there is a applicable to lots of different situations can I just suggest that this being an unusual transaction I 'd run it by our auditors to see if they have a preference on the out structured well their decision basically the noises to do it either way those are the four percent whatever whatever these voices well oh I 'll move that if in accordance with the auditors that it be is set up other sundry data line agreement five-year term that they applying to us and over to the council for resolution Curtis I I think we should use the word great because we 've already given we 've already given my grain of my teeth they ought so it could be read that we 're going to give another hundred grain some smile how it comes back and says we 'll hang on the guy was a green we 'd have to pay that back so Sandra data or line full stop in the cream we move cancellous you ain 't taking the council Ryan all your visor on oh you got the you got the you got the tree taking the camps are dying rolling taiga a pretty clean them now I 'm in the second ignite autumn eight point nine point one is a stain crow oval canteen update this report was prepared by Andrew and he discussed the the proposal at last night 's counselor workshop and the information is there to be received and note anyone wasn 't there that they want to make any comments or when when when the only thing think that was ever put up in front of the groups but the yeah the second quote before the two hundred and seventy fair and I can 't remember that everything that 's new or Mia knew in so though yeah so I wasn 't_''_8365.75 I forget the yesterday that 03 me I remember the original funding amount was one hundred and sixty four thousand five hundred not found their figures and documentation at my office but I don 't count point anywhere we approved an additional second budget of 217 that that figure any way down where mr. Maris as per the information of providers at the workshop yesterday like that I wasn 't_''_8404.771 I had managers above me at the time who went and approached the GM at that stage requesting the additional funding so I can only go by the the email files that are there I remember when we met down there and we real you know we couldn 't put under that mine and we had to move it all that but I 'll they never ever come back to us with that other budget that is highlight the shortcoming that for whatever reason this council now needs to make sure that process is in place some of these overruns don 't occur and we had a successful really operations all engineering management skills that manage all these infrastructure builds are just like the parts go into is to marry if I can the fact that the the roof cost forty nine thousand was twenty three or twenty four thousand Listeria because the cheaper code couldn 't wait for eight weeks I think it 's be honest with it 's a it 's a joke if it was my build at home and I was gonna save twenty three thousand dollars where it was I 'm sure I 'd be more than happy to wait eight weeks through through the chain just in relation to that everyone 's just thinking that it 's the iron there 's a lot of other words we 're going in on that course yes it was it was higher than the previous quote but the other previous quotes were just for the tin and this arcing and not doing work so there was a lot more involved in the overall job of the route okay they ain 't got it some of those equated on the overall but like but they keep to their was so then the we put the worked out there we had two builders give us a prices on that on the work we had local plumbers give us quotes on just doing that the teamwork on its own and yes due to the time frame when we looked at everything it was yes it was a dealer option but it was also to keep the project running so yeah I do agree that that that price was high but it was to keep also to keep the job going and as I said there are other works involved not just on council Nicholson taking the council 's cute all right lady clothes OHA they were recognized in the sponsors board that was put up mention also at the opening of the facility so it was covered in that respect now you know it 's in lizard like send it to all the sporting belly Fendi I think Alton yeah just in through the miracle night just in the attachment so I had a quick look through his eyes they 'll drop fees and charges around the khuddam under so yeah that 's where we 've brought them up to industry chapter like levels and or just noted on the gonna hoist all yards we haven 't adjusted those please I know you only had one so a year or something I think we should bring them up to standard to which means a a little bit of research that I 've done which is selling head at eleven dollar seventy four plus two dollars fifty at 11 11 70 for cattle cattle into zeros fifty across the sky and envoy camps a dozen others never they it 's yes yes because we like we we would we 've moved to the kingdom under yeah please up and I 'm just following protocol you guys this is a big Andy garden or it 's it 's a it 's a community yes yes yeah 1174 plus 250 out of the scale plus to those screening [Music] yes like hey why are you weird the thing is you 're getting the bigger and better facility is yes then you 're Howard Gandhi loyalty that still providing the through the object 1170 everyday the tribe life thing now we have enquired to making it put that on by and that would prevent him by his pants like I didn 't do it we do an improvement _"

whether the interest is or not to henry and what is the nature of that interest no hand being raised no comments i 'll assume therefore there are no interests declared open forum public forum we have no one registered there 's anybody who hasn 't wanted to speak therefore we will move on to the confirmation firstly thank you apart from the fact that councilman miller got [Music] 36 of the ipads and the first report is the section three five five community meetings community minutes off the civic center reference group i 'll move that council of faith councillor walsh councillor flagging do you wish to comment on that during some sessions of the statement and the uh to me anyway the uh everything seemed to run quite well and um quite a bit of um approval from people who hadn 't been in the zephyr room before as meeting which is that this such would be available not only in the immediate area as such it will be available not only for visitors and staff in the bic but for anyone nearby who needs it mr chairman as well aware the other night by walsh with the staff and they 've actually started some training as well which to also do the first aid course only took three hours the other night and uh of course also comments i reply the resolution is in favour against declared carried item number three sorry four three five three three investment sorry about my [Music] the way our rate collection is going and that i know i think everyone might have shared some trepidation a few months back as to how often we go and we 're it 's a pleasing result so [Music] no it 's just to say that um we look like we 're in finance fine financial um stage while just prior to the end of the financial year in the adoption of any uh long-term financial planning thank you comments should i reply put the resolution always in favor all right directory for tracking operations three plus five minutes being cody accounted for the council i 'll just mention that after a relax of last year the committee will be holding the annual record competition again this year and council can look forward to coming with a vegan role and asking for council 's usual generous sponsorship [Music] all right movie but um there 's different um promotion there just at the minute that the uh we defer the matter until the june council meeting until we 've had an opportunity to be better informed about what needs to be done can i thank you for that because i suggest maybe two your points one is that we note the recommendation for the probability committee i reply thank you councillor officer fixing out my resolution i was in favor hi again claire carey item six environmental services director cara access committee minister oh of where it 's located at the moment it does doesn 't facilitate disadvantages particularly people in wheelchairs that they 've got to get off to actually the director i want to comment i think he 's having we 've had discussions with um essential energy and they 're they 're agreeable for us to remove the section of the email which will a question i 've just stopped for the account yeah council right you have a question this is at the southern end of the car park tomorrow farmers there 's plenty of people wisdom the powerful mr chairman i think that i 'm happy to accept the explanation we 've had now but i think that there is more more than just that issue i think it 's about the state of that footpath down here the you 're happy is [Music] resolutions yeah we 'll come back and do that thank you i 'll put the resolution on the access to many minutes and we 've got the supplementary resolution came out of the committee which is about to acknowledge this 20-year service or some means by which we acknowledge the 20 years of service of the committee and thank them for their contribution to the shower because it 's a committee that has achieved a great deal in my opinion because it has able to try and give access to all our community not just 95 or 90 and it 's one of the one of the committees that has lasted well um quite often you find committees drop off through lack of interest but um there 's been several long-serving members of that committee and uh i do congratulate them on what they 've done and i think it 's very uh very appropriate that your 20 years be recognized thank you i think we were planning as part of this to have a small function for them so the minutes don 't say that yeah mr chairman and david cohen i was going to make was it was about that i got certainly and i have in my diary 10 am on the 28th of june which is access committee meeting and a 20-year anniversary morning it doesn 't make sense that council acknowledges the 20 years service of the access committee can we have it so it actually tells you what it is because it 's a bit it comes out next year and second are quite happy about the actually improving um its activities day by day and we 'll continue to deal with some of those later on this evening as well so which is terrific considering that we we lost our commercial flights out there some time ago and all the rest of it but it 's continued to re-embed itself and i think that that perhaps does two things it is an acknowledgement that the councils in the past have been prepared to continue to extend their money have been important to make sure facilities got lost firstly and they do go through the process and making sure it 's improved along the way to to meet needs of sort of changing aspects of finance or something is good and it all was well i think for the opportunities that are now showing up it 's actually been going on quite a while and i think it 's it 's this actually stabilizes the whole place and gives a lot of opportunity for people to see what they can actually do there and it 's very exciting the things that are happening out there i think take off i said it last time again and it happened it hasn 't already taken off actually it 's terrific to go out there and see so much activity and it 's beginning to look a lot like a very professional place and i think we need this master plan to finish that off to actually make sure that we we get some certainty and some some structure around what we 're trying to do out there and i think it 's great thanks for on a regular basis it really is impressive now to some of the activities out there there 's a lot of things happening out there to have up that look about really developing that 's got a really good feel about it for the comment if i reply put the resolution as in favor again declare carried on number one from the general manager of the acting general manager the recommendation is that we we know be appointed okay sorry we 're pointing them sure that mr jones would do an outstanding job as he always does so the comments were i replied with director of corporate services in regards to the well i think i think there might need to be a second dot point in regards to whether we need to include in our normal process that we resolve to accept the maximum maximum i 'll move that in the second box i think when you read it carefully we do need to make a specific recommendation to council members to speak no no i do this every year so it 's a losing battle as you know it 's just it 's a nonsensical people get paid to run a cycle review every year so and i 'll speak differently from the way councilwoman is speaking about council adopting an increase such as this and and smallers abuse and a couple of hundred dollars as it is but i firmly that council council laws are worth indeed far more than that well at least miami that the work council does is important it is time consuming it needs to be done thoughtfully critically and properly and counsellors are never off duty whether they are walking down the main street or in a very small fee really given the work that you start thank you for the comments yeah [Music] being remunerated and i agree thoroughly with what council smith said about the amount of time that you can put in particularly if you are a delegate to a number of committees and they also representing council at various organizations so i i the one thing that i am pleased to see i understand from some of the news reports that superannuation might eventually be available to mayors and councillors and i think if we wish to attract a more raw variety in our councillors in other words to try and bring the age of those that are here now down a little bit the average age we certainly need to be able to make council a bit more attractive to my payment because people who are younger than us i will have child mining may well have businesses that they have to leave either through the ownership of the business or as an employee to be represented represent the community and council so i i very much believe that not only um what shall we say enticement of people to come on the council and to try and give a much wider variety of age group and also i do really hope that we can attract at least 50 females because of the money and we all do it because we 're very community involved and i think it is you know part of what we do i 'm i 'm not quite sure why we 're different to somebody in a major cbd council i can 't understand what makes me not as educated or not as capable of running a council as somebody in the cbd but or in regional centre but obviously other people think that we 're not quite the same i don 't know how that goes with um industrial relations and equal opportunity and all of the other things that we 're supposedly holding up has been very i don 't quite know how that that works but anyway i 'm um we do it we don 't do it for the money we do it for the community yes i support everything has been other local government circles come out and um and how the local government has seen in the eyes of the state government you know other people that were left to carry the vote at times and uh but we 're just going to operate under what we 've been given and nurse council favor and said no one has ever enjoyed this to as a lot of political fractions and so forth developed too where they can use i think we 're all thinking the same thing and all the comments have been i think valid and councillor plague and drove we don 't do this for for financial compensation we 're going to attract councils in the future that needs to be given consideration and i think there 's an issue around fairness equity and matching expectations of our community into how we go about being able to deliver that and encouraging people to to stand so it 's not too much of a volunteer type job and i think that people will be wise to just before they come out have a look at the the slide which councillor in carer is paid probably half or entitled probably half then the council in orange of others doesn 't seem to make sense or a small metropolitan council that doesn 't have water sewer waste airport cemetery gravel roads etc or villages is not quite hard not quite twice as much but one and a half times more than what a councillor in this region would be entitled to by way rememberations i think there 's any issue around equity and fairness that needs to be looked at by by ipad and by the member of the state government as a starting point for the comment will i reply mr chairman all the comments are wrong with both yeah isn 't it [Music] we need to acknowledge this in the sense of all of the comments are relevant but frankly you 've heard them all before many many times and it 's it 's just it 's paid lip service we 're going to go through a process here [Music] um but also obviously the people that conduct these reviews believe it as well if we just are part-timers wishes of our community and also to support our professional staff and therefore we are undervalued in my view and have been for an awful long time so all of that is relevant i think the comments that were made by councillor walsh are a little bit disappointing that there are many within this even today within these wars that came here at a quite a young age that we 're running businesses full time and we 're prepared to acknowledge that there is there is an opportunity to to give back to your community from in some ways a community that 's supported learning their professional lives as well so i think there 's there is a payoff in that part but having said all of that the point that i want to make is the one around um the mayoral announce i think the mayoral allowance is an absolute joke having been mayor here for a long time in the past you certainly didn 't do it for the money but the the amount of time that is put spent not by camp just by council 's body idea i know the conversations you and i had when you took over from me about you didn 't realize at that time how much involved how much involvement there is how many things that the mayor has needs to be on top of the variety of different functions and different roles that they do play that all takes time and the small amount of recompense for that i can remember going back from time where we had the towards 2036 and we had the the big what 's in all the restaurants sitting beside a young woman who i rated very highly i thought very intelligent or wrestling i was there at the time at that time and she said well i think you could welcome what you 're doing i said well how much do you think i asked me to get and she said oh about 100 grand and i said i get ten thousand dollars at that stage plus my and she was shocked couldn 't believe it but that 's the perception and until we break that perception down i think that we 'll continue sitting in your chair i think that there is it 's a huge role people just don 't understand it and the point that the cancer parking is made is absolutely correct it doesn 't change it doesn 't change simply because you 're a large rural council or whether you 're in a metropolitan council or whether you 're in a you know a large regional center the role and responsibility is still aside accountability is still a safe and indeed to understand director of corporate services people points in regards to cara regional library it 's right that we give um recognition in carol eisenhower for the uh the work and uh contributions she 's made of our local library decisions can i suggest that we might add one more change that counts on natural leash on the resolutions not resolution council lamellar secretary councillor smith thank you any comments or questions housekeeping no concern you having to move on council of miller i was resolutionized in favour against declaration mr [Music] i 'm sorry the lep and it 's in four dot points encounter smith thank you step in the process from our point of view with regard to the changing of the zoning of that area [Music] the area um on request of um just searching for the name of the department there was a request that the area be reduced somewhat and that that has been um noted and acted upon and um the uh that this now just awaits the general manager to sign off as i understand a couple of the other objections or the word raised will be dealt with when the va or the actual camping area comes [Music] thank you mr chairman i 'm happy to be good i 've got a sort of a word in here rather the past second has discussed between the council but perhaps i would need to stop there then i 'll explain it so that people understand this is about environmental um and it 's pretty difficult to make it clear what we 're looking for is something that would look at the potential either positive or negative impacts of establishing wetlands in that facility has an impact on the engineering aspects of resolution but secondly whether there would be some positive impacts as far as environmental advantages as well as something that was established through the chair uh the to talk about the input potential environmental benefits first you 'd have the opportunity to set up a treatment train a storm water treatment train that could reduce sediments from the stormwater being discharged so we 're talking about the block of land behind sarah jane there where originally the proposal was to build quite a large detention detention basin as a flight mitigation option there would be there could be the potential to investigate the feasibility of a constructed wetland which would allow which would be like a smaller top detention basin which would allow for the collection of stormwater sediments within the stormwater being discharged upstream to that area and also allow for the stormwater to be further polished by going through the plants in the wetland system the potential impacts on the engineering of this option the um previous option that we looked at with the detention basin had a 900 diameter um low flow storm water pipe downstream of diameter stormwater pipeline so it 's likely to be more suited towards a smaller detention-based entire web filter type option if that 's what council wanted to consider funding the um the caveat is i suppose the reason for the feasibility study would be we 'd need to do a bit more um modeling of the impacts of the wetland setup to make sure that it wasn 't uh exacerbating either the flood levels or the extent of inundation on neighbouring properties during all the floodings thank you for that explanation and thank you for your indulgence mr mayor but i think it was really important that we at least try and get it it was very difficult to put that into a resolution but as long as the understanding is that we would do that investigation the first point is the recommendation that 's for our business paper she 's probably discussing information reading about the progress of the drainage what council veteran council revolt is proposing now is we also add to that that we further investigate in accordance with the way the director 's described to further over many years we come to the point where i think we have a plan that will work and i think it 's a plan that also financially council can over a period of time perhaps we can handle financially the lack of fall from wild walker streets into the former olive grove this will be negated by the the open channel it will be a concrete available channel whatever they are playing and there will also be a subsidiary pipeline running from fragar park on down to assist with that drainage and um i believe that the residents of long island walker street uh would hope in any way that they have a positive view of this we cannot never completely remove any risk of water rising through there the one in 100 year levels is what we 're looking at the other one and uh i think that the uh this is probably the best uh arrangement that we can come to uh the i was concerned originally about the possibility of some ponding at the uh both at the end of the orchard and also down in uh lockland steel area but uh the extra piping that 's going to uh increase the flow down there i think is going to take care of that and i 'll be uh also very pleased to hear council miller 's suggestion about the wetland in that a proper wetland behind sarah jane will undoubtedly require extra depth in that in that area and that alone will take more water out of a storm event so i think all those things combining and the fact that a uh we have a pump available to assist with any grain is necessary down at the elizabeth central area business at a car park i think all of those things combined i think we can look at this with a very positive mind thanks to there i think it 's a terrific idea that we investigate our wetland and i think councilor miller for the idea uh obviously the investigation will primarily be concerned with whether there are possible negative things in terms of the flow patterns and so on but i hope that there will also be some consideration of the effect almost a very small small area but i think it 's a step in the right direction it all steps up thank you for the comments there is potentially some environmental advantages electricity procurement yeah procurement process the littlest great savings to the various councils and um i 'm not here that it 's estimated those savings for power were estimated at 2.92 million in 2019 there 's a 50 000 grant being made available at the dollar for advice for the ten councils of the uh preparation and recommendations for a contract that must include 50 renewals so um i think um when you look at the fact that if all councils support this keras portion of that would be five thousand dollars the tenth council supported i think uh i think that would be very good value for money for the comments beside the second respect i think this is a great um opportunity for us and it 's terrific that the jo 's taking it on because it 's quite a large body of work to work it all out and to go with the um and 0.2 i think it 's really important that councils look to renewable energy in terms of their electricity sources and i 'm i 'm encouraged that we will hopefully commit to this and i 'm encouraged by the discussion that we had previously which seems to indicate that it 's quite likely that the pricing will stack up i 'm just a little concerned that it looks like it 's an either all or nothing so it 's a minimum of 50 provided the pricing for renewable energy is lower than the existing contracted price but presumably then if it 's it 's not lower it 's zero and i think that 's a little bit disappointing where a sliding scale might have been i think might have been a better option i understand that we are talking about 10 councils here and we need to all be on the same page and i 'll certainly be voting for this it goes to the end of 2022. it 's something that i hope that the jo will look at in future to try and maximize the amount of renewable energy points fifty percent of councils electricity like renewable energy would that include any electricity that we 're providing ourselves from our own soil system at the moment electricity [Music] we as the report says this this doesn 't take effect until 1 january 2023 so there 's plenty of time that uh the discussions haven 't canvassed that and i would be sure that there 'd be a number of councils in the joint organisation area that would be looking to procure the renewable energy the equilibrium was greater than the existing contract so that 's one i 'll take my notice and take it back to the organisation and brief council further thank you i think it 's really important that he 's not lost yeah i can ask a question when the jenny bennett was here i asked her that question and i can 't remember what the answer was because she said it was 20 the last time they they put it up for 10 of us 20 but i can 't remember what she asked what she answered the question i did ask that question and get it so 50 seemed like a big stretch to me but anyway that 's up to you to follow through last contract renewal but the prices were excessive and so yes that 's why that was knocked out um but again the answer to the question that 's being asked by councilmember i 'll need to seek more information the existing contracted price because these renewable people there 's that much of it being provided at the moment if you listen to the media and they should be able to bring it in and achieve the price and i would be pushing that if they can 't bring this check the price we don 't go with it because we can do some of it ourselves and uh the renewable industry needs to have pressure on it to be competitive not just to feel good cleaners is what a lot of things is what i 've just felt here is that you know we need to have a renewable thing and we might pay a bit more for the privilege of it and that but they need to be elective companies aren 't paying solar rebates on any energy back to the grid now because they 're getting too much of it and um i think there 's opportunity there for these renewable people to to be competitive and if you believe in a level playing field where they stop playing stuff the government stopped playing subsidies to the coal industry and all the rest of it as well i mean tell the full story i think well how long do you have how hard the issue here is that comments that have been made about striving to get a as much renewable energy as we can and it 's one well made i 'm sure you 're going to attack that on board and these please be canvassed no question of that at all but i think also this is really designed to enable the jo to go back to the energy providers and be saying happy to be happy to at an but the ja was 50 at least so it gives the jr a little bit of a leverage in that direction but i think the more information about some sort of sliding scale is the last paragraph on page 97 is sort of i think should allow some of the ideas and then prior to conducting the procurement process for the supply of electricity and subsequent to the refresh of legal advice jr member councils will receive a pro forma report to council detailing the process and seeking the relevant resolution in other words before anything is signed off it has to come back director of infrastructure operations the sergeant committee minutes thank you councilman um um it says that the financial figures financial figures i 'm about the s would be good um committee noted the financial report and further request the following council 's finance department to determine the annual operating cost of running the sale yes don 't we know that and isn 't that part of our financial lifetime plan i think the wording is probably not i take blame for that the wording is probably not as much clarity as you could be just breaking down the cost a little more detail so you 're asking for yeah okay just those things as well so a more detailed explanation of the financials yeah of operating questions no that 's fine i just it just seemed a bit strange yeah we other suggestion is that the market reports some don 't the operators put the market reports out well there 's the council right they want to answer this better than i can but the the agents do put their own market was caught out i think some of that can be a little bit maybe not as consistent maybe could be but the other one was about the the mla and the reporting that can be faithful for the industry reportedly come in and the fact that it doesn 't appear to just appear in the land as much as it used to and the way the yard timing is it doesn 't always pick up the abc radio market as well as it should so we 're paying for service but we 're a little bit concerned that we 're not getting that service from the promoters in the council media as in all forms of media or just in the newsletter or the media i just think that that 's probably if you 're going to include them then you need to be more broad about where you are let [Music] um those questions all um all relevant and appreciated um the meeting the concern of the meeting we have just going forward that our sheep numbers might be quite as strong as they have been in previous years as people rebuild their stock numbers and um and not sell as many old sheep or or so forth plus also there 's other marketing avenues if you 're competing with but our numbers are holding reasonably well and um i don 't know how they got the general manager of where they got their fingers from the general manager of forbes congratulated care on maintaining their sheep numbers for their sailors and we 've done very well so i don 't know if we should take that as a recommendation of what it is but um but for those numbers going forward and and we have lost cattle sold and we 're still maintaining the facility which um look after if he wanted to know what the if our numbers were there on what the if the if the impact of the aav and so forth is still going to be the same or is it changed with the number of turnovers going forward our contribution to those council operators things outside of is that going to be the same is to do the marketing report that yeah the agents do do their own report as the mayor has said and it 's quite good that they are using what media means they have to do that but the mla one that we pay for is supposed to give a an honest representation between one side or the other and to what to what livestock prices are since the kilo and so forth and we generally get the wednesday um one of the company out we 're struggling to get to get one on the thursday morning with the abc where we used to get that from and um i don 't know why that 's happened it doesn 't happen you sometimes pick it up on the will be looking at other outlets of councils websites and so forth and how we can get things out there or a facebook page it 's just bringing the farming community and so forth up to that up to their speed because our producers are in front or equal to the other people the uh in the shade cover things has been an ongoing discussion with those for quite some time and we 're trying to work through that to provide some protection for the uh for the humans when it 's raining in sales but look at how that little bit of shade will also provide some cooling effect to the livestock also and that we 've definitely got to cover the whole area and so forth so that 's where we 're walking uh working through that we 've got a change of uh operators at the science kiosk and it 's people are very happy with that in the same yard 's induction was brought up some 10 years ago producers had to do a sale yards induction course for the sale yards if they 're going than three times a year and when you did the sale yards induction you would put in the card that you knew what you 're going to do when you went to the side guards and it 's never really been policed greatly but you just got to make sure that we are compliant if we have to run a professional course thank you thank you any questions yeah mr chairman just a comment i guess and thank you to counselor for that in-depth report on on the minutes but the question i have is there 's two one is it talks about finances the figures there and who 's who is going to do that and how that 's going to be done um talks about the committee has asked for those those numbers so that 's why we 'll be streaming by this department i don 't really know but i think the issue around the media reports putting the encounters in the council 's leadership i just wonder how that 's going to be achieved who 's going to have the courage of that the second question be counseled who doesn 't media we council staff general manager and public relations people who organise council meetings that 's my understanding well i guess i 'm sorry i hope will not be difficult but i guess it 's around how that 's going to be decided yes i mean the media because it seems to me there 's a lot of uncertainty about what is working what 's not working who 's going to do that an audit of that for a lot of a bit of work to then try and work out which is the best way forward as far as promoting like you know the sales and everything associated with that my my reading that we haven 't discussed my reading and that would be that the communications staff here would have carriage of that and my thinking was that i 'd be getting them to sit down with the chair of the sidelines committee and have a discussion about about what what the committee is thinking i know we 're now currently linking our website for the mla report but it 's wonderful on but certainly the staff here would have carriage on the media and that 's the way it was interpreted written but in whatever way is appropriate it can work will it go back to you to the same arts committee for consideration or come to council for consideration as to what might be adopted as far as that plan is concerned what 's the next that 's all i 'm trying to i 'm not trying to be difficult here i 'm just trying to get an understanding of what the objective is we already have been linking our website to the mla reports but i think what i 'm hearing again i 've had no discussions with the existed in media stores whether that would be the a abc or the mla we certainly wouldn 't be promoting any agents in their reports with their commercial information on those but it would just be obviously linking to existing immediate reports there 's as much as i can say without having some discussions with my own staff or with councillor me so that 's not going to come back to consider it well if you if you understand relevant and read and take it out i 'm quite happy to keep that as an end well i think you can do it the majority of whom are not counsellors the council staff members so as a it was a case of saying please counsel as an entity can you consider it that 's that 's how i how i talk when i read it providing council 's update information on the council of council infrastructure council right councilman giving you a council right has given you a very very utility overview of council and councillor i both noted very clearly it 's a council operation council owns a council has a deep interest involved in it has a significant state stake in it and as a matter of keeping council councillors and staff fully arrested the report is fairly exhaustive and the recommendations may be a little more needed but it 's our courtesy respect to council to make sure that ella 's aware of what the australia committee is trying to try to do to promote the arts and operational staff and people communication staff and locating how to deal with this and they may come back and say what you can do that 's the request yeah i would say that you already have an advertising strategy for sale so i 'm sure we did one many years ago next time we have to start our committee meeting with both the recommendation up and you 're going to be going in trouble no we 're not going to talk if it 's something that needs to be considered by council particularly if there 's a budgeted item and all the rest we need to know about it i think you need to respect that for information yeah but as i said if if the councils of the opinions will be getting the message out with whatever council does seems to be a good thing and that 's what this media thinks is um is part of the agency the agent and so forth abuses the five thousand dollars a year we 've been running some um thirty second commercials on um winning tv i think that is so there or something on prime film segment was organized by chris knight i think and so forth but we 're just looking to build on that and whatever remains we have and and whatever communication that message the council have to be able for us to hook in further and um it could be a joint effort between operators and and the council itself council is the art of the yards and um and whatever we think about the agents that operate there that they 're using our facility to build their empire and so forth but one needs the other and um and we 're just trying to strengthen our overall budget and um without spending excessive amounts of money and often as some of this new social media has been mentioned you can get across many other people 's um um resources to see what 's going on there because we are leading the side yards to the quality we 've stopped we saw the prices received report from council offices notions notices

requested from councillor kiss for your health which i moved into you move council the white technology council of smith that 'll leave madison to be granted an apology accepted off the correct mandatory favor then so i 'll declare that carrie thank you disclosures of interest and i would invite council of that staff to indicate in relation to i have been declaring interest in whether the interest is machinery or nonfictionary and what is the nature of that interest council i 'd like to declare an interest in development application number 410 in the general committee recommendations the application fabrication 1382-21 um that is non-cunery interesters and i 'm a chair of the ability network who is the launch of the dealer i 'd like to declare um an interest in item 5.2 um

invite we have two um registered for she 'd like to produce the council on either on the agenda which i assume is the immigration side that 's correct and it 's not as bad as it looks it 's just big good afternoon everyone and thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak um and before i go along congratulations on your election um or re-election as the case may be um thanks for taking on a task that i 'm sure is rewarding at times but probably very difficult at times too so i 'm here on behalf of music and dramatic society and you have before you were request for a donation to assist in defraying the costs of the um civic centre the hiring of the civic center for the staging of the society 's next production which is going to be held in june it has the working title showcase coward um a concert cabaret style show featuring mainly items from musical theatre um shows that the society has staged in the past or that some other group has staged in town or shows that we wish we could stage but sort _''_305.039 so and it will definitely showcase some of the wonderfully talented people in our town of all ages or in our district if you 'd like to share their talent if you 'd like to get on stage have a go and i sort of hope that you might come along and see the show when it 's on too so there 's june 17 18 19 and bring a friend or two or through or music and dramatic society is the only theatrical group that i 'm aware of in the shire and now we can been boast since the early 60s but we certainly go back far before that under different names and we 're hoping well i believe the recommendation is to improve our request of hoping you will as the additional funds will help keep the society in the black which of course helps ensure the future viability of the society and allows us to go on giving the opportunity to people of all wages to perform but also to be entertained by local groups the civic center is of course the best it 's really would like to say that i 'm not the only one we 're all really impressed with the upgrades that have been going on at the centre and we 're aware that there 's more planned ahead and we 're rather excited to look to using the new facility and we would commend council for its willingness to put the funds towards it and to particularly give it a shot and we also would like technology the work that jonathan wellin does in putting is putting into providing the service and the great venue and i know there 's more things happening there and the daniel hire is almost always the single largest cost of staging your show the other one that comes close to it when we 're doing a bit show is the young the royalties and it has often presented the science society with considerable financial challenge at times in the past council has assisted us over a long period of time via donation and most recently that one was in november 2020 during the whole thing for the production of agatha raisin uh when we all i 'd like to thank the council for that support um now that well we thought kobe was sort of gone but it 's not um so we have hopes of reinvigorating the m d society we 're staging this first concert cabaret style show and we hope that 'll also give the shire residents the opportunity to come out and start going to some cultural things again so i commend these requests to you i thank you for your consideration and please support thanks for your time and attention thank you and if you 'll excuse me i 'll keep going and i 'm like this is pat smith my name 's pat smith i live at 20 retro street which is obviously next door to the new bunning setup i came down this morning and talked to marissa which we i thank you very much for all your help that you gave me this morning um i did ask um a few questions but at the moment um they are not available what i needed to know but larissa insured me that she would keep us informed of a few things on it and my concern was um the um the opening hours which um they are saying that they assess 10 o 'clock they are saying maybe being a country town that they may not open to that late i spoke to larissa also about the car park being next to us with lighting will be turned off as in when burnings was closed and also the fence between us and runnings the only thing that we are worried about is our safety and security as it being a complete open area and larissa also said she would talk to bundles as regarding that we would have consultation with them to talk about our concerns which um we would appreciate and that 's about it i just because i spoke to this morning and she sort of sorted miles things out for me and i just thought we should turn up tonight saying that we had said we would come and i just think that 's appropriate that we do turn up thank you any comments or questions on these i can tell them there 's a declare and carry um [Music] um normally normally there 's the movies there but it 's not this is something that has been requested of local government fellow government family to actually formally adopt this recommendation and to write to the to those persons who are who are listed um a local member our candidates and the local government association i think it 's important that as a as an organization we lend our support to alderaan to govern new south wales in what they 're trying to do to get more funding and more certainty around funding for local government across the board landscape and indeed when you consider that the federal government collects over 80 percent of the taxes and rates in australia state government gets about 14 and the local government picks up the the tap of what 's left and we have impact on people 's communities daily lives in a significant way i think it 's appropriate that we 'll be seeking funding from more [Music] yes i think this is a very worthwhile cause if you like most counsellors would know that the funding really decreased quite markedly over the last 20 years or so and we work very hard in our our senior staff and their staff work very hard to ensure that we can remain viable but there 's always a lot more that we could do and we would like to do just in terms of part two serves the recommendation which which i fully endorsed of course we have in the past when federal elections are called and i think state elections was well invited as a council all those who have nominated to come to council and talk to us and actually hear from our own lips about our list of priorities which we 're going to develop obviously so i wonder if there 's any appetite for that to be done i know that we 're really full up with meetings and probably fed up with meetings as well but uh just just something to think about that sort of personal touch with the candidates um there 's no funding requirements from cash or accounts but at all we 're required to to send that information back to the case over the ones doing all the heavy lifting on this and it 's appropriate councilman thank you mayor west um as we 're all aware our local government is the closest form of government to the people in the report it clearly states that we have 537 local government areas in australia 55 of them reside in regional and rural areas and i was staggered to learn that local government employs 194 000 people it 's a rather large employer as a result of that i commend alga for having a campaign like this don 't leave local communities behind we hear such shenanigans of campaigning that is done when federal and state elections are done and on this occasion i feel that it 's a very um clear campaign on page 70 of the report it says clearly what the five pillars are and what alga is wanting first federal government to provide funding in and they 're hitting you know very core um essential pillars that are at the heart of our community whether it 's tackling our housing crisis our disasters that are being felt or also what we are needing to do as far as circular economies go and the environment so i 've i throw my full support behind this report and thank you for bringing it to our attention thank you comment i don 't need a right reply um but i will pick up on council smith 's comment i think to add an invitation to candidates in this country but if you want to do a supplementary to suggest it or you 've got what i 'm hearing is perhaps we just on our own volition we actually write to the candidates and say we 're happy to hear from you please come and make a presentation at some point that 's what i 'm hearing so thank you so with that on we would please put the resolution both in fact against declarative carry can we write to the president of the augusta regionals item number one from the general manager here 's the government 's in the general managers report to the march committee meeting so i 'm happy to have that with that specific addition to the go back and read it should someone want to read yes and i was a little confused as well so i think it 's very important we often make our recommendations very brief and i think this just adds to the fact that we have adopted a policy for our section 355 committees already and this is just a follow-up okay next item is the the recommendation coming out of the 355 committee of the regional art gallery advisory group council i 'm sure happy to hear that thank you absolutely any comments or questions on this questions i 've got the resolution all those in favor guess the interview carried on and 4.3 is the donation for the twilight tens that what we would normally do counselors here as some would know is that we would note the report with that thank you council federal thank you uh explanation on that is being dealt with later in the meeting so we should know the report collected so we know the report from the committee using speed council smith will potentially write you 're happy no further clients i 'll 4.4 is investments the recommendation there about naming the investment just that our investments were in some financial way when we looked at them however after a going forward but it won 't_''_1232.799 which i know that he will do the right thing in discussion with the director excellent well i 'm very very comfortable moving the recommendation you 've already moved it and we 're happy to go so i 've put the resolution on your table briefly i commended this report to council it 's a very exciting piece of work that carrier council has taken on to investigate us as council and the community can make a real impact to protect the environment that we 're living for the future and sets a really good ground for us making this a priority in the future i look forward to seeing what how we 're going to pop this path because it 's a really important goal um but more importantly are the staging ways along the that road to net zero so i 'm looking forward to discussing it when we discuss the delivery plan for example reason i 'm speaking is that we 're setting certain goals on certain dates and i find um things to do with especially the 2050 one where it 's going to be met zero emissions and um i 'd like to remind people this is only to do with council 's operations we 're not going to we cannot um why i read it we cannot impose regulations on the rest of our community we can deal with guidance and having suffered to do something different if they want to and even to get our emissions to the 2030 level it could be um it could be difficult under the current circumstances machines and so forth and operation standards to [Music] the council 's operations to to meet these and that 's and that raises my concern that we can put undue pressure on our operations to spend more money on providing a service than what the benefit will be to get into this um mission level in the last seven days there 's been a lot of discussion in the media about these carbon credits and reports don 't of the carbon that was in the original um um the regional concept of the plan and so therefore i support our staff and our council looking to reduce our admissions emissions but i don 't want to put a figure on them because i think we could spend more money or or not if we don 't and then we need to and if we don 't get to the level the proposed cost of um of offsets it could bankrupt us too for no further good so that 's my uh my opinion uh actually i was my support counselor right uh based on the fact that there is so much we don 't know to commit to these figures i 'd like to see us reduce our commissions as much as we possibly can but to commit to certain figures at certain dates we don 't know what the consequences of those decisions might be for the future and for this council to impose their ideology on future councils i just don 't think is right in a perfect world yes this would be wonderful but this the consequences of these decisions are if it 's only a plan and we 're not locked into it i 've got no problems because we should strive to achieve all the emission controls we can but to lock ourselves in and as i 've said before other councilmen to lock ourselves in for figures and dates i just don 't think is the right thing to do i 'm happy to support the recommendation this is something council has been working on for quite some time i think that 's acknowledged and it also shows how councils do work because some of these plans do take a while for gestation to come into some form of some form of structure i i know the comments are being made about uncertainty the the plan really the project really is about adopting and following the guidelines that are laid down by the state and federal governments it 's as simple as that i think this council is very mature very responsible and we can do a lot of work on the way through about emissions control and about about our environment jump into anything that 's going to cause us to have significant financial impacts or significant difficulties if that does doesn 't turn out to be the case which i doubt but i think it 's important that as an organization we do here down the path which is which has been uh i get embossed by state and federal governments and other global communities about heading towards the net zero mission this is a net zero mission pilot project so it doesn 't and the word think is the pilot project so it doesn 't block us into we will have a target of 10 percent or whatever by 2010 or whatever day it just is a pilot program i think it 's important to go down this path and the doctor responsible local government authority but i do put that right around that we will monitor people we watch very carefully and you 've got to use example of electric vehicles we 've got consider the ratepayers with electric vehicles costing you an amount of money in a petrol one or a newsroom one doesn 't then we so it 's this continual conversation we have about the benefit to our community environment and a bit better than people in their ability to play and comply it 's a complex conversation but i think that we need to be dropped from this pilot project in the way it has been set up and has been gestation as i say requires some significant time to get that involved through the comments um i 'd like to support what you just said but it 'll be out of turn but um that 's just uh i think these recommendations the the pilot project is not a lofty argument we 've actually got lots of room to move in it we 've been working on quite a long time it 's not rushed it 's been going on for a few years we 've had consultants to look at us we 've had input into this it 's been a long drawn-out project and i 'm really pleased to see that we 're actually getting to something that we can actually incorporate in our in our project delivery so um i it and move on as part of our planning process thank you for the comment reply thank you while 2015 might seem like a long way away and seems like a time when we don 't know a lot of information i am not particularly young to people who are passionate about climate change i 've been working on this issue for a long time and i want to live in a world where my children and my grandchildren are not suffering as a consequence of actions that we take today as cow council and i believe my role as power counselors and i hope the rest of our counsellors believe the same is our job to ensure that we make decisions to improve the living capacity of our residents today and in the future and if we 're going to take that seriously we need to honestly commit to this work that has started with this recommendation of this project it is in fact irresponsible not to do these things we know that renewable energy is getting cheaper we know that the state and federal government has committed to do not fall in line with that change it will cost us more when there 's carbon pricing to not shift it will cost us more because organizations will prefer to work with people who are taking this responsibly we 've seen this all across the world people are choosing to live in ways that are environmentally friendly they 're choosing to buy products that are environmentally friendly and they 're choosing to work with organisations that are environmentally friendly we are one of our strongest roles is to make sure that the finances of this organisation are sound and by making these investments we know that the things we are investing in will continue to exist for the future a number of mechanical companies have already heralded that they will stop making a number of things that we can 't use cars machinery that will all be transitioned we know that in a lot of places electricity is the biggest expense but if we 're able to produce that on our own that is a cost saving that we can make for council so i would hope that the recommendation thank you six is the car accident committee minutes council kisses not here so i 'm having to move those please thank you council all right elbow thank you any comments to show that the committee 's still operating um for the benefit of to get equal access for the um for residents but to come out of the community was the right to carry star 's wife and family and gave to the for all his expertise um that he passed on to the community and we offer them sympathy on his passing thank you for the comments revolutionising against declaration 4.7 which is the standard lep amendment in regards to agri-tourism just very briefly we did discuss it at the committee meeting first of all my thanks to the director for the work she and her staff have done on this one and also on 4.8 and despite a needling reservation about 4.8 but i 'm not talking about that i think that this is going to be something that will really benefit people involved in agriculture and all the people associated with that and allow for lean times so i think should be supported uh no just it 's happening for the comment write a reply point necessary i 'll put the resolutionizing player shooting with my which is another standard instrument amendment any further comments no comments right below i think would be not required i thought the resolution was in favor signify thank you colleagues 2021 which is the bunnings d8 who do that as a recommendation there for approval council i am very happy to do that i 'll second that councillor council downing second now kinds of questions do you just maybe if smith came in this morning and she just sought some clarification with regard to um the likelihood of when the works would commence and i did explain to her that a principal certified authority hasn 't been appointed for that development the private sector and as soon as we know where that construction certificate is going to advise her as such the only other main concern she had was with regard to the boundary fence in between her property and the buggins car park and again um i 've the developer and that they can land with her as to a satisfactory um height and style of the dividing fence too thank you yes i 'm very pleased to actually um move this recommendation and thank clarissa for being easily accessible to the public and i know mr smith had the neighbouring [Music] people neighbours had some concerns during the da process and we thought we had dealt with them but it 's lovely when they can come and actually speak to somebody and get some clarification around some of their concerns i think it 's very important part about planning and i 'm grateful that we can actually do that there was she did have some concerns they had some concerns about those things that i 'm sure that they will be dealt with this is actually a terrific application and a very well received in this time of our lives uh this time in our community um and it does come with 57 different conditions and they must all be met so i 'm sure that our planning department has actually been able to go through the lot so they would be very well aware of their neighbours they 'd be very well aware of how to do this properly and i 'm very pleased that we can have this some extra inclusion in our street i 'm really pleased too that um redmond street will stop being an actual car park i have a great deal in getting a car park outside bunnies myself so i 'm very pleased that we 're actually going to have a proper car park so that we don 't have any trouble getting um parking there because it 's a very busy place everybody in town enjoys a bunnings visit and i think having a larger warehouse is very beneficial to our community and our business i 'm really happy with all the work that louise has done there 's lots and lots of steps and ways that checks and balances or things to happen that the neighbors are concerned about and the rest of the community i 'm very happy about it thank you just a question i know there 's a considerable value of this development what stage it 's original yeah this we 've done this ourselves through the threshold threshold [Music] together that enables them to redevelop the site they 're on and wish them all well and i hope it provides tippiness to other businesses in town to be able to expand their businesses thank you thank you for the comment reply down here hopefully the resolution was in favor of caring unanimously thank you 4.10 da138 2021 for the council think that this is a great addition to what cara has to offer and i commend the ability network for putting it up to us there were a couple of submissions from people concerned about who might be there and about supervision but all of those have been very satisfactorily answered so i 'm very confident that this traditional transitional not traditional group home will work really well and not be any sort of impulse on the neighbors thank you this is a fantastic um proposal put forward by early network and just as judy smith said councillor said a number of issues that we 're raised have been dealt with is dealt with for our differently abled people in the community i um note that counselor kiss is not here tonight and i 'm sure she would have loved to move this motion um as she has a lot of experience with the lack of these type of facilities in cara and i personally have a my cousin has had very similar experiences of moving repeatedly to try and find access to facilities like this by being able to have something like this in town and hopefully many more to come it will mean families like council kisses will not need to travel every weekend to visit their loved ones and be able to have their loved ones as part of their family while still living in dignity thank you for the comments but the resolution colleagues at the a thank you encourage developing cheers actually has been my privilege to be a counsellor delegate to the tourism corporation for much of gray walters stint representing council there and for a long time when he was the chairperson and i can certainly attest that his work was very time consuming and above and only on this tourism corporation but also with destination country and outback and we can see that they 've also appreciated his representation by the copy of the letter that we 've all got this afternoon so it 's most appropriate that we do write to ray thing pardon me thanking him and i would also like to acknowledge councillor fagan as the new delegate she 's not a novice to the tourism board and she 's already hit the ground running on a saturday workshop so i 'm sure she 's going to also be a great asset to the board for the comments i can change for the recommendation and just follow on what the counsellors think casa gives from destination country outback signed by the chair clark thompson also congratulating mr walter and thanking him in terms of characters liking characteristics in a very very strong position it has been for a number of years a significant role within the region but in terms of the region that 's where i 've got a little bit of knowledge and seeing the work was done by mr walsh of history that the tourism at a regional level was was significantly struggling and there were a number of general managers who got involved through the joint organisation or the rockers it was then as mr walsh did was councillor davidson from cabon and the former mayor of bathurst got involved as well to give the region a bit of a direction and a bit of push because when we became a j.o organisation that we 've continued to to work together in a very very positive very collaborative way and ray waltz was very much part of that group that over probably eight years i think continued help to structure um the strength of tourism not just in calibrating the region on the understanding that as a region with tourism that we need to be focusing and functioning significantly with our friends around orange and bathurst and parks and so forth so he was heavily involved in that and gave a considerable amount of time to to that effort that on the table for the record as well so the comments yeah i 'd like to commend also the councillor walsh mr and i just think that the more we can do for him the better i 'd like it 's a bit more than just a letter if we could manage something else but um yeah i fully commend i think oh whatever he takes on he 's just focused on on delivery there is more being done but modest man that he is there was a dinner of the board planned and he said he really rather often didn 't need that that 's typical of it yes so we various groups are trying i 'll put the resolution in favor against you carry your regular um is council will move this council kiss is not here so i 'm going to jump in the second hour um any comments or and i 'm take questions about any of these um you 'll note that we had 20 applications which is a little bit down but we we believe that code is um and code concerns are still impacting what community groups feel they 're able to do in the near future and in particular our new taken up at all though i do know that there are some groups planning to take it up in the august round and we we think also that is because there hasn 't been time or or the feeling of certainty to plan any big events we agreed to fund 19 of the 20 was deemed ineligible because it wasn 't primarily volunteer run most of this category are from cara although we do have one from woodstock even though it 's builders the power motorcycle racing club and one from marongla and it 's always good to see groups from villages and other areas rather than the town of tower only being supported and so with that the only other thing that i might add in terms of other councillors concerns is that on this committee i often have non-pecuniary interests because i may be a member of the community and councillor kiss was this time a member of a comedian and one other council i had to declare a concern but i 've i 've never left the room because it is a reminder but that said i are for strange amounts of money and for less than it was asked for and that 's only because there is a limit um that we provide of 3 000 in and some people have reached that limit without getting exactly all they asked for the only other thing that i would say is that if this is passed tonight as i very much hope it will be there will be on wednesday morning a community morning tea for representatives of all those organisations to come along and receive i don 't think they get checks anymore i think it goes directly into their bank accounts but they 'll get us certified and they will get a chance to thank council for its generosity and that is inevitably missed um i think morning tea is at 11 o 'clock it 's always interesting to hear what these groups are doing [Music] want to paint the entrance so their money is just for uh and it 's part of a whole series of renovations some of which have been funded by the community grants project and that 's in part because whole variety of of community groups and members of the community i 'm quite supportive of it i just just sometimes some of these things um [Music] each time we give some of these people oh more work eat some money to do these things but we don 't get recognition and so for the drink bottles for the swimmers i see there 's a statewide neutral green bottle here and i 've been going to conferences with councils their own drink bottles that they 've had for conferences but it 'd be a good idea if if we had a big bottle for our own corporate logo type thing and we can buy that they 're going to buy a number of those big models off us and and they 've seen them being supported by council but i know it probably gets into it in the sponsorship or something they 're only able to do it as an advocacy club or something but just so there 's a recognition of council support to various organizations that 's a good signing out thank you thank you i 'd just feel that this this project uh grant funding that we 've been doing the last five years has been the most valuable thing we do so many of our small organisations need 500 a thousand dollars 200 whatever to fix up something or change something or make a difference and i think even though there 's small amounts of money they 're very well received and we generally get exceptional feedback from these community groups saying that they 're very grateful for our support and if you one wednesday at the morning tea if anyone like come generally as councillor smith said we get a terrific breakdown and they give us a great report on what they 're doing and i found it so many times so fascinating what community groups actually do in our community it 's very interesting to be there and hear what they 're doing and they are very grateful for the small small amounts of money although they may be small they end up being very well received and they actually grow a lot because the community groups put things to money towards those things uh everybody does well with them thank you conveyor west through the chair um i wanted to raise that the cara committee grants round one and two have now been fulfilled and with that we have 15 just over 58 000 unallocated at this stage i have been approached by groups that have missed the deadlines for round two and as a result i wanted to let other councillors know that i asked questions today in regards to if there is a way forward for those groups to be considered for a donation of sorts i have encouraged those groups to contact council staff to get that answer thank you thank you yes please in response to councillor dilbo 's comments about fifteen thousand dollars left over um i endorse what the mayor said um they 're always welcome to write to council and in fact um a requested donation that we 're going to be looking at shortly comes from the men 's shed because they were just outside the funding round so all those sorts of things are possible in terms of what councilor wright said about publicity publicity as council megan said we uh we certainly get the grateful thanks of all the members of those organisations and their many and varied the mayor i 'm sure will put out some publicity following your morning tea and a photo that sort of thing but really more than us trying to and i agree that we don 't always publicize the things we do very well in this instance i think it 's more about us saying thank you to all those volunteer groups without whom we couldn 't really do our job as we do it and try to give them some some small meter of assistance and uh and help them rather than help ourselves with the resolution against the cleric and with that reminding you colleagues that there 's a morning 11 o 'clock on wednesday to which you are all welcome to attend um i think councillor smith made the comments that a lot of the council of faith these organizations are entitled or encouraged to just give a brief overview of what they do and i can assure you you will be quite do do so again i 'm encouraging all to be here and thanks for i 'll move it [Music] i was a little bit surprised that we 're actually not um we are noting the report from the director of corporate services and i just asked why are we not going i know we 're going to get further information have we not got enough information to apply for the special rate of variation right now sorry i 'm happy to have the it i i if i expect emotion i think this same thought as you um vote upon reflection and hearing that that explanation and being aware that explanation i have no doubt that counts who doubt i 'd be confident the council will look to to within the guidelines seek that great variation however we need to have the guidelines clearly enunciated to us before we can actually go in their path [Music] would appear that it 's not that difficult but they did say it might be some time for like part of the government of their act together to be able actually um give us a budget and operational same time we can be doing two sets of books almost in terms of which one depending on whether we get we 're successful or not but the fact that we have factored in a 2.4 in our long-term planning um to me would indicate from what we 've earned country bears that would allow us to go down that path but i think it 's responsible to get the documentation understand it i 'm sure we 'd be all in general in the grace and reading the timeline we still have until the end of april 25 which means we have time to wait for the documentation to come to us but i 'm sure the vote tonight would be in comments the director would mean that perhaps some of that documentation will be looked at and start to be filled in and reported back to council the first opportunity before that formal favoriting that we could probably uh not only note the report but actually um endorse out or i 'm not sure whether it 's appropriate whether we should just uh say that not sure [Music] i was wondering whether that was appropriate and for us whether it 's appropriate for us to it 's not you don 't think to actually say that we would be applying for this 2.4 when the documentation becomes available is that not something we should do i would have recommendations for ideas and you 've got to change the world but you 're safe when council rights are partly correct but i think this still gives us that opportunity this is the direction the council is going to adopt in the past we 're going to travel down so i 'm not sure that we actually need to to formalize something in the context of we will go down this path and it 's pretty clear from the directing report that 's the path we 're going to be going down that 's the rich when you 're traveling and i would think that i 've made my point pretty clear and you 've made your point very clear i don 't think the other council was one of the night on this other day to 'll have more details i 'm sure the director will keep his informed documentation yeah i want to thank the director of corporate services for tabling this report uh at the new south wales local government association conference recently held in sydney this issue was by far the most critical in the room and there was much disdain noted this new formula is just rubbish new south wales government has enforced are the process of integrated planning and reporting on all councils across new south wales and as a as a result of that all councils responded to that and have in place long-term documents and in particular financial plans um our financial plan as mayor wester said uh documented for a 2.4 bit rate variation and as a result of this new formula they 're now telling us it 's going to be 0.7 this is quite reckless as far as fiscal management goes and i 'm not sure how councils not only carer council are meant to respond to this and could and to continue to deliver the services that we have said that we 're going to plan i look forward to getting the report back and it has my full endorsement as to which way um the council decides to go with this as far as the scenarios on page one three nine thank you thank you thank you would like to note the shopping timeline that has been laid out here that we will not receive the application form and guidelines uh we will receive it less than a month before it is due to be put back to the table and that is another stake in the heart of the work that our team does here in that they have as people have noted prepared a budget for the next 10 years based on the rate and are now being asked to do more work to apply for that rate that they were guaranteed to go forward uh to be broke i would just like to commend the director of the work he 's done to pull this together and to thank your team for what i 'm sure will be a full-on month to prepare in this timeline for the comments yes this us where the government 's up to where ipad 's up to and everything and we 've got a timeline for things there i 'm suspicious of this to bring additional special variation out because they realize 0.7 my have a special variation for an important project at the moment this additional special variation is to maintain our status quo and i just don 't like the words that they 're using the holy mr ransom um i can meet devil 's advocate and say well yes we had a budget with a 2.4 increase for this year and they say well budgets and budgets um figures don 't always come out the way you want them and 0.7 i just like to see what does come out in their application and their guidelines and what we 've got to do plus the implications after this year and i think we need to just uh take caution and um and go with the with the system they 're providing us and not try and rush us so we don 't get into a situation that we 'll regret later on all of those those concerns from all the counsellors and then agree with them because i think this is actually a very sad event for us to be actually we have to apply for a special variation as we 've never had to do this before we haven 't had we so we 've never had to do this before and i think this is really a rare thing for us to actually ask the government for an increase in our rate variation we 've always divided by the rules and done the right thing and we continue to do that and by putting our 0.7 percent increase it 's made us feel like we 've actually done the wrong thing and i think that 's that 's very um it 's not a good look and i 'm very worried about as councillor wright said in the future everybody 's going to look like they 've had to apply for a special variation and we have been living within our needs and we 're very uh very responsible budgets and we 've done a really good job over the real kick in the guts for us because we 've always done the right thing so i 'm very very annoyed with the ipad recommendation and i think we probably should take it up politically in the future as well because it shouldn 't just lie here we shouldn 't have to do this it 's just against everything we 've ever done before and i just get annoyed that we have to go cap in hand for something that we actually really deserve so i 'm just a bit cross but i 'll i 'll pass the recommendation i 'll put the resolution in favor against declare it carried just just i 'm not angry and debate against conference and countrymen has made it very clear that there 's a there is a very strong push to ensure that the ipad methodology is reviewed and becomes transparent as to how they arrive at these decisions 6.2 355 draft committee of the order of risk improvement committee i 'm happy to move those we 'll account for the false goes up in a second i would say in that case there i think there 's nothing significant came out of that meeting um i think the the starting point is that um the 0.3 were will seek advice on these news our government recovering recovering the costs of code and there were some convenient costs over a variety of areas that council had to cover he did some of the public work that was done around higher clinics and those sorts of issues but council did it i think it also acknowledged that council staff had worked very very hard in the community and maintaining i think a presence but working with other emergency services to make sure the community was kept as safe as possible particularly during those early days of cogan and the germany was acknowledged for that rightly is resigned or retiring from the the arab committee very highly regarded and a very valuable member of the committee but as we as some of you would be aware and some of the new councils may not be aware we 're moving into a new risk improvement structure which doesn 't thrill anybody which may cost us significant fourth of july and it was something that mr fletcher with years of experience incredibly invaluable felt that the time was right to move on i think that 's probably as much as i should be saying on that particular issue but the new risk improvement committee structure is going to be interesting as it has done as it unfolds in your future and you 'll hear more about that i would think in a nutshell but outside of that i 'm quite happy to take questions and quickly recommend them to you and the council mentioned after that at all uh now you know and it will be interesting to see what the new structure is they 've hinted that the mayor will be banned what they propose is scary stuff and again it 's big brother coming down on us get used to it and the new structure council will have one non-voting reserve on the community notes that there 's been no formal advice that 's been received in office of local government regarding the guidelines there 's been a lot of press releases and so forth that they 're rolling out and they haven 't got it organized and i could possibly work with the committee that um we might only have one councillor on there with no voting things unless you know what 's what what is going on and you depends how many non delegates are and where they are with those independent people have no responsibility later on i 've heard in a press in a media talk one night on the abc which i don 't know if that 's good or bad but if you don 't accept it and i 've read it elsewhere we can plan not to have a and basically they don 't trust us as council we 've been elected uh under a very expensive system of voting that 's supposed to be uh accurate and no uh corruption involved when we were elected they 're not prepared for us to make um make decisions and live by them and um and cop whatever flat we top if it 's right [Music] as well as many other things the government 's got to lift their game committees i 'm honored if they 're going to be treated like this thank you thank you very much any further comments your question uh could i just make a comment um about the cobra 19 update it 's cost us four hundred and thirty thousand dollars i haven 't seen that figure before that 's we haven 't had any detailed reports about the costs don 't remember them so the direct costs are uh not sorry not the dirt cost um there is a line that has been lined budget for the last couple of years uh covered costs but uh things such as staff time uh generally allocated two years and wages would be allocated too so not every so it 's very significant cost to us just a question on the comment that would be more of the money we 're looking for in our special spray increase oh yeah [Music] direct 6.4 from the director of corporate services we are twilight and this is where we defer this matter earlier in the meeting is it quite 154.356. i 'm going to leave that for something just did this be something that was held over and um obviously they 've um they 're going to have a another event on the president of april and i wish them well thank you for the comments this will be a uh a round of the shoot shield uh eastwood playing northern suburbs so it 'll be good afternoon on the 23rd of april is it that right yeah actually it is a good afternoon would it be fair to say highly recommend it you could have a good time for football uh ambidextrous like yourself counselor right i think you 'd be able to do both first the comments replied i 'll put the resolutions in favor against eclair carrie which is 6.5 is the requested md society recommendation there councillor hands up council of delta councillor smith thank you councillor delaware you should comment i 'd just like to thank the members for coming to speak in the public forum tonight i look forward to welcoming back live performance as mentioned in her speech we haven 't been able to do that and to be able to offset some of the council charges to use our wonderful civic center venue and i look forward to attending this event and congratulations on to care out m d for putting on showcase carer item number six point from the director of corporate services donation council smith thank you councillor thank you council spencer i think we all know that the men 's shed do a great job for for the people in the men 's shed and they also do a great job for a lot of other organizations whom they help out around town so i fully understand their need for the new box and so on and this was the group that discovered the need just a few days after the community grants closed and therefore couldn 't apply so i think it 's appropriate that we help them out thank you further clients i have no comments i 'll put the resolution against you speak council smith answer questions i didn 't_''_4830.719 i didn 't know it existed and i certainly didn 't think it was in the carer show i haven 't driven there my 't in the carissa except for the fact that we 're going to look after it so um she told me that there were beautiful views out there and i 'm told of these people living here have a lovely view and if you 'd like to look at them more often i 'd be happy to drive her over on occasions it 's well on the northern edge of our shire and we 've done a very good job there the road to magnificent so i commend the amount of work that the model have done and the problem is that they 're going too fast on it because the roads do what much dangerous curve ahead it 's not dangerous but if you go too quick it is smith i have a question for you mr mayor if i if i may and probably the other councils will need to take it on advice because it refers to the traffic committee before he was on it there 's a lot of speed zone reviews here that are going to be referred to transport from new south wales earlier the approaches to woodstock and also for the bus zone and enlargement of the bus zone and the last we heard transport from new south wales was still mulling it over but i wonder if councillor smith might be able to take that perhaps to the next meeting i don 't even think that 's what the director probably could take back to the transportation it wasn 't it wasn 't on our workshop a good director can take that back and i get inquiry i think rather than happy to i will note that the traffic for new south wales advised uh i mean around that sort of way that they are reluctant to change speed times unless there was significant development along that area where where you want to change and also with bus zones if it 's at the school and it 's a bus stop that they 're happy to look at that but if it 's not a designated bus stop they don 't want to know about it um and we we were lucky enough to have a full delegation of the traffic new bottle on everything all their decisions why basically why not it wasn 't there wasn 't a lot of wise it was why not um sign it yes change and zone is very relevant but we will chase that up council australian capital thank you i just wanted to speak to two of the recommendations here first number eight the approval to close the main stream for the festival of international understanding on the weekend which is a fantastic part of cara 's culture and encourage everyone to take use of that and it 's fantastic to see the transport committee continue to support that and follow from councillor jay smith 's discussion around bus areas this is a significant issue across our area and i think councillor p smith 's uh suggestions around transport for new south wales 's position on that might raise an issue that we need to continue to lobby them to take it more seriously as it is in my belief one of our largest traffic issues in the community where often kids are walking across somewhere that isn 't very safe or they 're new south wales needs to determine a way that this can happen safely i think i think on that there are designated bus routes and if he does go to stops and i would assume the traditional issue would take you seriously if anybody sees those issues you need to talk to the director so they can be put on the agenda and council especially looking at it as well through the process to go through a lot of responsibility to contact the bus companies and the bus companies do contact councilman all the time there are areas put aside to make areas safe for the children but there 's responsibility for parents as well in some of these matters as well that need to be balanced conversation further comments just a question um the no stopping signs of newfoundland streets what oh that 's pre-school yeah and lake park it is illegal park two places in the corner but everybody does so they 're just going to put signs in to make it formal pick them away it 's a line of sight problem mentioned people walking across a opposite the preschool they park on both sides of the road so the road is narrowed right off and we 've got to do what we can to to help them there and that 'll make it a little bit easier to see around the corner so that 's the korean question sorry appreciate it yeah what was it something done and to comment your question um just this one on bonnie gray 's road yeah the thing there about review the speed limit is there a speed limit on it that 's what i thought [Music] i think the likely outcome would be that they 'll put a sign up concealed driveway ahead do some safety i looked at the report and the photograph was fairly easy to identify which property is about 4.3 pounds on the road for the comments or questions sorry 189 which is the cara material recycling facility glass stand agreement which we discussed the recommendation there sign the agreement council of zelda thank you councillor robot thank you councilwood thank you mayor west through the chair i was glad to see this report come councillors were shown the existing glass stockpile by signing this agreement future recycling and gloves will be managed and will meet clean what clean waste waste management requirements and i believe that by signing this agreement we will be building hopefully a long-term partnership between council and clean way thank you thank you thank you for moving in i would agree that this is a positive step to continue our relationship with cleanaway and thank the department of construction operations for the work they 've done so far on building our facilities as a leader in container deposit management and hopefully going forward in class management as well i note that clearway won 't use material that is dusty for example so i 'm wondering whether this the hard stand area will be covered through excuse me through the chair the dust we 're talking about is trying to pick the material up with the front end loader in the just edge video so with the concrete base you can pick it up without all that contamination [Music] with the recycling system and all [Music] council to with what 's thank you so much for that reply the recommendation is in favor against your fair account um one 8.1 because the director environmental services which is the natural resource committee council right thank you to secondary council thomas so it 's become a quite renowned exhibition of this with people sending their pictures of birds and i think they 're found really confident about the future of it and they 've had a very good judge come this year and cut surprises and he was impressed with the with the photography standards and um i think the group has um would like to uh had an exhibition up there in one of the rooms and the [Music] second the third point the birdlife project uh to carry a common which is between committee received it or someone else received it they 've got a grant to do um habitat rehabilitation up there planting 1500 trees i think it is for some four or five special birds that they feels endangered but there 's some up there to do it and john rankin was one of the ones that put the money but now there 's been a bird life um person allocated in this area employed by bird life australia but he 's a bit green on on how to get it uh how that how he 's going to get his project up and running and i think he 's surprised to learn that he might need to talk to both the environmental operations department and the planning department and what will be required and when we mention recurrent costs so that there 's a bit of an eye opener there 's some staff member to some members on the committee and i said it might have to be in our business management plan to do this and uh i suggested they might need to do some research into a fence to keep the things they 're going to eat these trees out the explosion fence and they might be able to do something under these new fences that are available through things as an exhibition with an exhibition site it was a strange feeling because i was only there [Music] the existing um chairman joe lenahan is retiring 'll be looking for a new chairman of the next meeting it sounds a very good thing for education and everything but we just need to get the dust yes i do i 've actually been watching the arty bird project for quite a number of years and i think that 's actually the photographs in here don 't do it justice i just think all the other photographs that they put in are fantastic if you want to see any they 're on the uh on facebook page they put them up all the time and then amazing photographs and we 're very pleased to be able to support that photography exhibition i think it 's a great resource and i 'm looking forward to the report on the birdlife project thank you for the comments reprimand unnecessary you speak to your twin one reports so now that reports but we have a notice of motion and that is the motion 10.1 which has been signed by councillor fagin paul smith and planner wright because which one you want to formally move false for seconds and formally do you taken as being read and understood read and understood we 've all been there if you do something then your account says hang on uh that 's the wrong way to do something so you 've got to do it at the start you can 't do it later on so totally understandable thank you just a question there come this is because the decision motion or emotion which had been put out happened right that 's always good here 's a good question um i think now further debates required great requirement required for the resolution against declared carried any matters of urgency two people who passed away okay so you 're happy to move the notion that we deal with that matter as a matter of emergency your council is especially our council of what we deal with that as a matter of urgency i 'll put the resolutions um put that as do we deal with that as a matter of urgency all those who get carried as a chair i 'm quite happy to rule out a big amount of urgency also so council right you the family to thank him and his family for the support he shire as a whole and also as a businessman and a volunteer in numerous organizations the second one is a letter of condolences to the family of mr max tomlin he passed away he he was a great supporter of local businesses in town and you could say it was it may have been his own benefit a lot of the buildings over in young road william street an awful road there and but he also was very supportive of the people that went in there in businesses he also run his own businesses in those in that area and i think it should be in both these people have been where initial men on the and out of the tower business chamber as mentors and i think it 's the right thing that we offer their family our balances and um and thanks for the effort they contributed to the i have a slave in my thing without you you have spoken i need to get a second all right any further comments write a reply not i will seek to close the meeting to the public to considering confidential reports firstly 12.1 which is intended for road grading wet plant high 10.1 2022 this matter is considered to be confidential under section 1082 d1 of the local government act and council to satisfy the discussion of this matter in an open meeting would on balance the contrary to public interest as it deals with commercial information of a confidential nature that would if disclosed previous commercial position of the person who supplied it 13.1 the general manager is the side of lot 16 and kara airport change of name lot 16 this matter is considered to be confidential under section 10 a 2d one of the local government act and and the council is satisfied the discussion of this matter in an open meeting would on balance the contrary to public interest as it deals with the commercial information of a confidential nature that will be disclosed previously commercial position of the person who supplied it and finally 1414.1 director of corporate services which is a debt write-off for a water account this matter is considered and the council has satisfied the discussion of this matter in an open meeting would on balance be conscious public interest as it do it deals with discussion relations personal uh _"

    "text": "we are [Music] calling [Music] general committee meeting open and i will convince by acknowledging the traditional custodians which we gather the people paying my respects to their past and presence there are no apologies we 've all been present in the chamber and i would seek for councillors and staff to indicate in relation to any declaration of interest you may need to give and uh indicate what report would be declaring an interest in whether the interest of machinery or non-vicandry and what is the nature of that interest thank you mr mayor i 'd just like to know that that then i am too of the director of corporate services uh report there and i am the chairman of cara tourism and just like that noted i will remain in the meeting any further decorations of interest we will move on i 'll just make a comment for the record in regards to the council of declaration and independence each council and member staff has to determine themselves uh normal procedure is within the council that when you are representing the council open forum with that we of military councillor flag and you have any kinds of questions on that at all happy if i sign as a child accurate record all those in favor against deter carried now go to page 17 age 17 which is item one from the corporate services and it 's in regard to the members of the city centre reference group this recommendation may be noted thank thank you to any comments on this just to say that this reference group meeting is um seems to be going quite well we 've nutted out a few um wrinkles that we felt we had it will be very interesting to see um how i congratulate the uh the manager of the sixth senator mr jonathan lewell and he 's been doing a great job attracting lots of people to the civic center in a variety of ways and there 's always plenty to do and plenty on the weekends if anyone wants to take advantage of that at the moment we have the stanford on for the whole month so i encourage anyone who is interested in seeing some fantastic um children 's well worth the very small fee to attend uh we have our meeting another meeting in june to discuss and it 'll be interesting to see how the assembly goes in this change of management that we 've undertaken but everything seems to be going quite well thank you thank you yes thanks mr mayor um there was some discussion a on the cultural plan and you might note there that i suggested that the committee first looked to the prior cultural plan and worked forward from there there was also discussion on fees and charges and it seemed to be generally accepted that um council was not going to change anything this year but we 've made it clear that community groups particularly our local community groups if they feel that they 're unable to uh afford the charges that are stipulated that they um only have to talk to us have to talk to talk to the director here or [Music] to all the users of local users in particular and in particular the voluntary groups i urge them to do that otherwise i think the activities the manager 's report and it 's so far very very pleasing the way it seems to be operating any further comments mr german just a kind just a question um through you and it 's to do with the general business item where the issue around it i know it seems petty that the the toilet door they 're closing or not closing of it and it says that the due to covered restrictions now being there yesterday we are popular that that now does we came in restrictions still with the doors being closed or the rest of them and i suppose uh the other question is i 'll show you to the director is that is the manager um been able to make a decision like this or should that be so through the chair the the that problem is now rectified with the easing of coping restrictions but it was definitely heard loud and clear from the members of the reference group that it wasn 't acceptable and you know manager 's definitely taken that on board going forward actually i thought we 'd have a is there a way of dealing it 's a feedback around privacy and discretion thanks for the comment yes i appreciate the the detail of the members of particularly the managers report and perhaps the councils on the committee might convey that to him i think we 're getting some really good details there yes or of course the director and things like the uh the graphs make it quite easy to see how the centre is tracking in various ways and i think that 's a good innovation going forward they will be um um just in regards to fees and charges i assume another meeting before the boat rate is actually effective so they 'll actually have a chance to look at the persian charges we did say at the time that we didn 't feel that any of the charges would be changed dramatically so we 've actually um and we looked at those feeding toes so we had those in front of us at the meeting so i think everyone was on so that did have a copy of the graph yes well yeah if they might be a good pr you 'd actually just provide them i 'm sure the director will do that i 'm sure thank you council okay for the [Music] it 's quite obvious that the civic centers have their own emblem there is really not much there 's no reference that the council is involved with that and um i presume that 's just come from the city centers management this new uh emblems in the city [Music] and just follow him that was developed and published with my authority in the same manner that the care original art gallery incenses has its own operating logo but certainly the expectation is that for any events that are held that it 's made clear that it is our council council sponsor or council facility with councilman miller 's question regarding the toilet doors um it seemed to overlap an existing regulation of how our toilets should operate also to have a the reason why the door was left open for cabinet was that people didn 't touch the door so they 're contaminated but you 'll have to come up with door for the toilet to operate properly and keep any bugs in the toilet extern during operation it 's i think that last comment was an operational matter and we 'll leave it to the director and the manager at the civic center to manage it as well as they will i 'm sure thank you i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against you claire and carry on number two from the director of corporate services in regards to a donation carry tourism council second from the tourism corporation of uh to which i am a delegate from council is uh for a donation of 50 percent across the other 50 percent coming from a tourism corporation and i know also that the concern about the need for a defibrillator in that area arose from the collapse of a visitor while watching the um um and of course the defibrillator would be located in the visitors center but would be available for other organisations such as the very closely co-located cafe and other organizations should the need arise and time commit so that i think council in for a wider community not only our visitors but other people in the precinct as well thank you mr chairman i fully support those comments i think it 's the ideal place to house it over there because it 's it 's as we all know it 's it 's open every day of our christmas day and so that will be available in this case if the need arises for a much wider sort of group of people um half of the funds but it doesn 't say where the other half why can 't we do that and yeah and just another quick question uh can we if when if and when it is done can we get down we 're going to get can we get the other four local areas made aware that it is there to be used in case it 's a hockey tournament or a tennis tournament can we have signage at some of them saying that a defibrillator is available at the tourist center um i would think that maybe the chair and the members of the board might take that on and promote it is out there yeah i was thought i 'd read somewhere that they were providing the other half of the money but that 's what they 're asking for so i i 'll be giving put a comment [Music] at least some signage is a good idea and perhaps that 's something that um council meeting other advisors what 's being proposed to that the first aid training for some of our staff in the next week or so we already have services investments recommendation here that we noted um the year has been an interesting one the last 12 months financially it 's you know some people have had a pretty good eight or nine months of this year and others haven 't certainly haven 't particularly those on very much fixed income so i think the rate collection progress is quite pleasing in view of that for the comments for the comments my reply were not required i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against declare carried over number one from the director of infrastructure and operations regardless choosing three five five three happy to move that is she going to get a second day nice catholic right thank you used to speak mr mayor the only thing that i 'll talk about is in the second set of minutes that we have here the discussion regarding the vehicle advertising for the recycling trucks and garbage trucks that council owns council would be aware that for some years the tiny towns committee has raised funds it 's been in such things as raqqa by means of advertising or asking businesses to advertise with signage on those those trucks they most businesses have advertised for a period of three years and that period of three years is now up and a lot of businesses have included that haven 't sorry indicated that they will renew their the money that they they pay and some new businesses have indicated that they 'd like to come on board so what those signs have done in the past is you simply advertise the businesses themselves and that 's fine but the discussion was was centered around a proposal that the committee consider having works of art perhaps by cara primary school students and perhaps some other nice artwork that would be very attractive and that some businesses might choose to sponsor those as a contribution to the community but also of course to be seen to be doing the right thing and promoting the right thing certainly the tidy towns committee is in need of the money that this brings in but um we thought that that perhaps there would be a number of businesses who would see this as an interesting thing to do and we are we are looking into that and i 'll come back to you um when a decision is made and a recommendation you thank you got a comment um um street art genuine business you discuss street art art would be his murals such as the one we had down there on the wall facing uh what what was the uh yeah thank you i noun my proper and hopefully some other street art that may be put up around the place on on various walls suggestions have been you know water tank out at the pow cam and so large of that sort of street that that is correct at the moment um and that is in an endeavor to attract people who haven 't retired many years ago and might still have the energy to propose and carry out all sorts of exciting initiatives thank you for the comments no requirements resolution a question perhaps um how time sensitive is this and the other really the report is not in the sense that there 's no public available at the moment i say i have some problems with the conclusions as far as this is concerned and considering the not too great a margin between a full refurbishment of existing and adding something on which is what has been suggested uh i just would like to perhaps further discuss this before we cover any conclusions i have a as you know i have a fundamental issue with with um doing things that only last for a certain period of time rather than looking for something that 's going to pick up maybe cost just a little more but certainly you get the we should defer to the council information really the best way forward i think in regards being time sensitive i think there is some hope to move forward really quickly with grandfathering is part of that that was the [Music] thank you about the need for something to take place out there yeah and i fully support passions i really do support the fact that we 've got to make some moves there simply because just about every week the caravan park there has been um full perfect capacity the market day there that i attended about three weeks ago was very obvious that we were very short of capacity to oblives and also the existing building is in what i would regard as very ordinary shape so i do well i agree with that this deed occurred until the council meeting i do want to make it clear that we should move forward at the council meeting and try and come up with some solutions or down there i have a question which i made which made the answer that the information meeting is the um the need for a adult changing facility at google about why we need it there when we haven 't got one in town and i 'd imagine this is the adult changing facility which is part of the amenity spot which is a lot of expense i 'm just like i just like the justification why we 're spending the money and doing it there because i think you know if we don 't have one it should be in town somewhere where it 's more used obviously so if i could have some explanation for that that 's my question shower area whoever 's eating shrimp must have changed yes so what 's the difference between agreement that 's the point that you 're not you 're correcting what you 're saying perhaps but the change room that 's been talked about here if you read the report is that it 's got voice and all the rest of it which is much more expensive now whether whether it 's find it or not that 's part of it will be part of the discussion i think that 's what put the counselor are you putting apologies [Music] 're needing that it may need an old change there 's all these regulations yeah well i 'll just just it 's very interesting all these red things come out of the river was in england and i started pulling them on the sirens went everywhere i think if something 's going to show you if you do think sirens will come to it any other further comments the movies right reply um access committee [Music] if there 's any questions i 'm happy that a number of issues that have been dealt with you will know that i didn 't speak to you about the the optimal issue and and i did raise it to the director thank you so so it does work which is really good i 'm not uh no just the advising disabled toilets of rose gold required on the young borough on grapple roads that toilet does comply does it so it doesn 't comply with the local standards and i think i think you know while we 're on that topic i think we do need to have a discussion about the toilet olympic park and also the one behind the road garden are in very very ordinary condition there 's not much it was an issue around access to the tennis club and with our incentive we actually supplied some council supplied some funding for that to actually do some work there but there 's it doesn 't fully comply with the work that has been done there with the director has tried to get some cooperation out of the tennis club to actually get the last little bit of the work done we 've had no positive response at the stage or certainly being great so with president previous committee proven yeah congratulations to the committee on their 20 years of existence mr jim just to pick up what happens this was this was one of the first access committees that was formed in the central certainly our progressive view on trying to provide good access for our community whether they 've been disabled and aging so it 's achieved a whole lot change a lot ideas lot of people 's concept of access because it was acceptable to put disabled as long as there was an avenue to um i 'm going to um say that it 's not only the age and the disabled that are finding it easy to access it 's also young mothers and grandmothers pushing prams and it 's very very um easy to get around town and keep you having access and i think that has made a deep difference and it 's across all ages and all spectrums and i think that 's even though it says it 's that access community people think about you know disabled and aged people it actually makes it a lot easier for people with crams and bush bikes as well so i think it 's a really valuable comedian [Music] the movement may feel constrained that i think it 's probably appropriate to have a second point or a supplementary motion where the council actually acknowledges the 20 years of knowledge of 20 years that the access committee 's been and congratulate them on on their achievements and have your secret the stop sign isn 't just for vehicles it 's for pedestrians so you 've to run over the pedestrians it 's not just for cars just with the optimal pharmacy is that the one on the main street and you 're talking to essential energy about the big thing at the back or something is it what what 's the how 's the central energy tied up with harming wheelchairs [Applause] [Music] across the road um infrastructure from essential energy which is [Music] [Music] actually on the block supersedes what was on the actual four-part area so thanks very much i suggested a supplementary i 'm happy to move someone 's got to move it that we formally count the formally acknowledges the the outstanding contribution to the access committee over 20 years and congratulate them on their the support that they have provided the council and the community i think we 've spoken enough about colleagues i think it is a success story and the need to promote for the community what the work that has been done has been alluded to the change already those that are impacted by access issues are not just the elderly and those who are friables have so it is an excess success story and i we should be acknowledging it and acknowledging the work of the chairman as well because as also because the contribution that not singling one person out but his contribution has i think delegate from time to time but also very much in a caring and compassionate way about the community and people with disabilities any other comments i 'll put the resolution i was invited environmental services care airport master plan council members we 'll go on public expression so the community and council for that matter will have an opportunity to further comment if they need to but thank you mr means um i 'm i 'm delighted to be able to move this motion that we adopt our 24th master plan and as we know it was very comprehensive claim when it was first drawn up that 's been reviewed on the public exhibition and uh we should now fully support it there 's been some content driven contribution for people who understand airport development much better than most of us do i would suggest and that we should and will now put in and there 's lots of activity and i think that this will actually just reinforce that and and allow people with confidence to go ahead with their plans for building and bringing businesses to the town so it looks great this having this airport master plan i 've had some comments from people who know about airports and they are very um oh blown away love that blown away by the fact that this is so important we 've actually we 've actually done this and you know i 've had some interest from outsiders and dave said that this is a very um big thing for a small town to do and very complementary and i congratulate the director for going ahead with this in such a formal manner i know we 've it 's been a bit of a stop start in the beginning but um i think this is we 're we 're actually on the way now and just flying above the clouds blind sorry about mr mayor i 'd also like to add that sometimes we put things out on means that people are very happy with with the report or the plan but this time we had three really quality and important submissions including one from a representative of the indigenous community and that was really good to see and and i note that those submissions or what was put forward in those submissions has by and large been adopted so i think that that adds to this plan and its viability and i 'm sure that from here on with this plan adopted at council business at the airport will continue to take off for the comments left to the minute this evening mr chairman i was about to say that i think i 'll bring him to a landing there i 'll just quote the county council 's local strategic planning statement of 2020 where cara will be a leader in aviation that need to be raised we will now take a motion to close the meeting to the public to consider including the tenant of the following 10 a 2 1 of the act report the general general may have closed committee people say airport plan to join fisher _"

need to declare um environmental services report number 5.6 the development application number 138 2021 466 lyell street as i 'm a member of the i 'm a director of the ability network it 's a non-vacunar interest in the same thank you any other disclosures of interest required reports and also including the confidential as well any comments or questions on those recommendations genetic regulator against page 58 colleagues policy that we have for our committees which are committees of council with people appointed by council on them and they report back to council on a regular basis to um to tell us what they 're doing it 's important i just want to ask a little question if i could number six does say the council should be responsible for the funding and erection of all major improvement works in the facility i 'm just wondering i know this is a bit of a wordy thing but if we could change it to it does it talks about facilities and a lot of these delegations a lot of these committees don 't have facilities that it says that we can change council works in the facilities if appropriate or when required just so we it doesn 't look like every committee has facilities um you know i 've read a bit of it but it doesn 't really goes on about facilities in the next bit as well but it doesn 't actually identify where some communities don 't have facilities i gallery 's probably the only one that has facilities i was trying to think of other things three five five communities that have facilities just looks like every every 355 community has the director just might like to look look look at that and say where appropriate or where they 're applying it through with that as it meetings our responsibility for our infrastructure platform would be required out we would need to be responsible for either the grant fund oh yeah and it is actually safe it says that there is a bit of a there 's not enough delineation during communities of david just a suggestion you don 't have to follow it and there 's a suggestion to make the big era but i 'm happy with that and it 's um just yeah that 's just what it is it 's a policy and review and um just briefly uh page 88 will talk about the responsibilities of the secretary i know it 's just a very very quick thing but it doesn 't mention anything about distributing minutes and being very new to the committee um i was looking through this to see when mid minutes and distributor revive within they 're really just a guide for those itself the policy provisions that there 's a requirement to provide the minister council i don 't think there 's a time frame it can be too much when you are represented by a 355 interest in terms of declaring interest in the council you are there now there are councils in their you 're expected to probably as you will see you 're expecting to probably page 64 of the ipad section 212 committee membership um b says uh and i i take the general manager 's point that these are guidelines they don 't read as guidelines necessarily um committee membership will not number less than 4 and not more than 12. i wonder if we could put in there unless otherwise decided by council because for example the youth council regularly has more than 12 members in my earlier comment now this is prescription the appendices of what i said was just advisory in terms of what what to succeed what does the treasurer do etcetera um you write the youth council housing council as it has previously resolved specifically to vary this policy as it came with any policy on a case-by-case basis so adding it in there it doesn 't mean you can 't argue with the same with any with any policy affair about the council 's discretion a be crossed out and some looks to be underlined is it all supposed to be crossed out on the sub-underline is what 's been replacing the crosstalk that that correct counselor right what 's uh what 's underlined is replacing what 's crossed out and that 's that 's because that 's now reflecting the updated work in the act i don 't remember what section but that 's that 's that 's the wording you know the action terms about eligibility for the office of office of the councillor so we 've transported that into this document and the next point there becomes mentally incapacitated person who determines that [Music] member of a uh of a uh section 355 committee that 's the best way i can answer that i 'm just wondering if remember it 's on the mental um mental health plan and very true we 've gone through it with a fine-tooth comb i 'm very very pleased with everybody 's detail i 've got the recommendation again number 4.1 which is the director of corporate services 35 high draft committee manager regional art gallery uh delaware members yes please second employees through the chair i just wanted to say that um it 's been a very busy end of the year 2021 and a very productive start for the gallery i 'd like to remind all the councillors that the archival prize opening is this friday if you can make it and also to remind the community um i just wanted to do a shout out to retiring committee member jay mallon for finishing up with us and to welcome our new committee member um um chat thank you thank you is this appropriate that we um write to jack mallon and thank him or has the community already done that i i would think that there should be 40 out of a minute but be quite happy to take a supplementary yeah can i suggest that we write to um okay otherwise i 'm fine thank you [Music] lot a long time and i think it deserves a little bit from council to acknowledge yeah it wasn 't held so is there a clarification on whether they actually outlaid this money for this event they may have outlander um meeting [Music] and that we in the process just investigate whether the event took place yes if i could do that i did the director earlier and then i forgot to ask him no no no very [Music] um [Music] but if they hire city council the bins are there but it 's a bigger event than normal they 're going to get extra bids we 'll still provide them free of charge sorry if it 's a bigger event than normal and they need extra bins they 're gonna have to pay for the bins listed two event dates in their report the fifth of march which i assume that 's the one that 's the best moment and the twenty third of april um i think i can clarify the 25th of april i think 23rd of april i think that 's when the shoot shield came in place yeah so that works for there will be some bids and everything so that 's why i think we hold it off oh slow change the table on page 117 the summary loan summary says 31st of the 12th 21 and the director has clarified that it 's actually the 20th of february 22. no no the top the little blue tag at the top says [Music] okay i just wanted to clarify whether that was the right amount of money we might just make sure [Music] on page 115 um graph nine um i previously met with the director to ask um if we could have a three year average on that graph and i was just worried yeah the spending or the payment or rates please that could be considered thank you thought the answer i 'm not sure whether this is the right time to ask this question what is our policy on arrears at what stage do we stop talking to them and do something about it is that for now is it another time so yeah so through the chair when it comes to rakes it 's a five-year period where we can then sell the property and collect on the rates so far as other rates charges is there 's different time frames but people in the council because it doesn 't happen that often we 're currently pulling together a there 's a lot of there 's a lot of debt recovery action going on every day in our revenue team they are involved in payment arrangements for for is we actually have a lot of money in the bank 26 million dollars in the bank and we all know that that actually isn 't our money it 's actually a lot of it 's grant funding and i 've asked this before and i 'm sorry if i continue but it would be helpful to know just around here we don 't need detail but just how much of that because we do have you know [Music] the general fund is so much and the other funds in business whether we miss that funding which we can 't spend on anything that grants and it 's actually just grant funding it would be helpful just to have that amount i 'm not asking for a detail about it i just would like to know if it 's ten million dollars five million dollars um just so million dollars is made of we 've got one in the general account 2.4 million dollars which is you know explains why we have that money in the bank but that 's on the other account but the investment account really would be great to have some indicative idea of how much is grant funding and how much we actually have you know bank account is that we do report on that on a quarterly basis so that 's shown in our qbrs statements not currently in the investments if i could just you know just on that what council is um raised with us back to paul 's question about rate payments we need about 12 weeks money in the bank wages and commitment if something went wrong that 's this intestine the figure and we 're slightly under that but if we got a better collection of rates we would be improved that would improve our cash balance the question is that rate graph only refers to the general rate not more than two trades it 's not all rates is it yeah all right is it all remember the internal order to raise the issue about the unpaid rates in the financial year can come inside of the fact that the water water rate charges go out at the time of the year and it starts that high into a starting target but no one seemed to make opponents at that beginning of the year so that 's why it works down i hope i 've um question two uh the director of corporate services through the chair we 've spoken a lot in our meetings about the issues with great hanging and we know now that there 's an opportunity to make a submission i just want to give us an update on what we might be thinking or how we can progress that through the chair council received a circular from the olg late last week i 'm still going through and digesting it but what i 'm gaining from it is that there is a one-off opportunity for councilman to put in the submission to state their case and what i 'm understanding if council has engaged the public in advertising a a rate plan is stating 2.4 we can say in our case to potentially apply for the difference between 2.4 and 1.7 i 'm currently preparing the paper to come to council at the ordinary council meeting this month i believe the cut off for submissions is not until the end of april 30th of april which case there will be a experi exhibition period by olg and councils will not be made aware of the outcome until the 21st of june [Applause] and we can seek that special rate variation based on the fact that those projected figures have been included in our long-term plan and where they have been identified in long-term planning either through ipnr or operational delivery plans with the long term debate of the community for consultation in some formula and then after dissecting that after public consultation normally under a special rate variation you have to go through a public community consultation process with your community which is quite expensive on each one of acadia and they 're saying if you have identified that and you avoid planning innovation then you can use that figure that that recommendation will be going they did also ask can you guarantee what happened by the end of end of june and notification and that comment was well we 'll try so we could be preparing but at least it 's a much better scenario when we were a week or 10 days ago in terms of income clarification have we 've been often 1.7 but under this and we 've advertised it in our plannings and everything from 2.4 correct well that sounds logical as long as it doesn 't go against us in the future if we do have a it 's really you 're only asking for money to operate the council we 're usually you ask for rate variation to do a pacific job uh to deliver a pacific project and um he 's specifically designed for council and continued operations and the better recognition by our world that councils have come just this budgeting and planning and even they 're saying the 0.7 they 're it as well so it 's a way of it 's a way of legally creating a mechanism where councils for the next year that it won 't happen beyond this news um it 's probably not perfect now that in general business can we bring up our reaction to that um offer of a two-point of a variation um was that we should all be making sure we apply and said innovation yet we needed money because if we don 't advise we 've seen that we genuinely needed and inflation is more than 27 so my question was should we be responding to the minister 's office without uh just as um as a response and then put the application for and that 'll give us a chance whether we write more letters and what i 'm saying is we should be saying it 's wrong although we 're going to apply and that 's a way of getting around the process it 's still wrong and we should never we should never come to this so how do we how do we tell them that i think the ministry of the local government indicated that there 's a concern about the methodology united partners certainly with national the methodology around the ipad determination so we don 't want this happening again next year i think every report comes to us we 've got information in fortnight 's time debating an opportunity to write also further issues or something especially concerned about the the ipad deliberations that was my question whether we should bring it up now bring up the bengal business but we 'll wait until we get a report and then we will address it then okay if reporter will have some information to deal with anymore okay that 's fine thank you is that 's still not good enough that 's the next the council of fame was talking about yeah we didn 't want to be fixed up again all right third comments tell the question should i reply that 's full because it 's me yeah one is the as the background has indicated this is something that the previous council was involved in as a pilot project and it was an excellent pilot project as a result of that we have come up with a whole lot of strategies both for council also consulted in the development of this to uh to hopefully reach net zero by 2050 um i have to hasten to add though that the company that was doing the pilot with us was very clear about that net zero doesn 't mean that any particular council or organisation can reach absolute zero without the last third of emissions being really funded by trade-offs in terms of carbon sequestration and all that sort of thing and i 've had a illustration of that recently because i have a sister who lives in the canberra hill ga and was a senior executive in the environment department canberra is a 100 renewables but that 100 is only achieved by an agreement with south australia in terms of carbon sequestration and that sort of thing so that being said i think that it was a very very productive relationship it 's a strategy that we really need to adopt and then start putting into our delivery plan and our operations plan and all that sort of thing with with all that is detailed here in in very abbreviated form in terms of it was on exhibition for a considerable time there were no submissions and that 's a bit disappointing although perhaps a lot of people in the community would have consulted and had these say during the pilot i do recommend this to council yeah um i just like to say that this was a really interesting process we went through it and it came up with a lot of things that i would not have acknowledged as being major and it gave us lots of detail about major meters and which was really interesting i just asked the question about how we 're going to report back on this is this a major project plan or is this a something we 're going to do in our planning just as is this a major project or is this just going into our delivery plan i would say that we some of our discussion after this video in subsequent weeks will indicate exactly this particular report can be reported on that makes sense yeah because there 's quite a few things in here we 've already started on and we 've just been wondering um how that 's going to you know repel and report back on the actual activities that they 've actually what counseling what once council will pursue over the coming months and years will be determined in your workshop after this and certainly in the operational delivery program that you set yeah over the coming uh yeah obviously this is a fantastic project i 'm really glad that we are taking a position of leaving the community in this end um give a big kudos to those of you who involved before particularly lisa and her team for working to get this together just a few questions um i think as we often raise these plans that have been developed over the last couple of years business as usual case in this is based off the same 2016 census and idea that carrie isn 't growing which we all know is very out of date so there 's a need to review that when we look to implement this plan and it 's quite as counterfeiting as that there 's a lot of work in here and talk about how to make sure we implement this um efficiently and quickly and particularly bringing on the sustainability officer that we 've spoken about previously okay um yeah look i 've read it with interesting amount of work gone into this and just some things that i observe and there was no no no interest from the community as far as we know um that quotes the 30 of the houses in carer have household solar and i would suggest that everybody i 've spoken to that has solar on the roof are not concerned about carbon emissions but reducing their electricity bill rather than and the other while we 're on electricity i just wonder if we buy all renewable energy there 's only one grid whatever they 're fairly thinking cold fired power into the grid we 're going to get a piece of that i don 't see that how are we going to ensure that we only get low emissions electricity some of the practicalities i 've just gone from and also committing to a certain percentage by a certain time worries me simply because could be i just want to support my fellow counselors here tonight in their um their comments i agree with all of them um it 's a very exciting opportunity for our council and our community to be actively involved and i just wanted to do a shout out to the council staff that have pulled this together it 's very exciting um and i 'm very proud to be a councillor to bring this forward to our community in the next two years thank you this is something which is evolving i think councils communication should be done if the government moves the target if we guys are the government targets that 's what we should do so councils in the past have been working on this quite hard in terms of in terms of of the environmental issues that face our communities and beavering away quite successfully um and including a cost away strategy which which we got through last year as well with the sustainability officer coming up coming on board so council has a history and a record of being involved in this space and what suggest that there 's a few councillors heavily involved in this process as well over and over some of them might be the changes that are speaking on on their behalf more than behind the coaster in the champions league there 's been something about the chamber have been quite quite um i know i 'm a very passionate question strong in terms of their they 're trying to help us come to terms with an environment that is changing in some form and how we leave it in a better place for future generations but i agree with you council committee that we need to be very careful about setting targets and saying we will do or must do all or any of those words which should provide us into something areas of here we can 't always control what 's going on yourself my uh i support the concept of reducing the algorithm our reliance on renewable energy but like i 've said before there 's going to be a budget where the transferred and non-renewable energy is not going to put the council 's operation in jeopardy of my my questions um a lot of feel good statements and i believe that the figure that we 're going to reduce from i thought we picked it was our highest emission year and it was 2014. i could be wrong and i 'm pretty sure that the consultant showed us that we 've reduced our emissions by 25 from that figure in 2019 so to get some really much more to go and get to 20 30 and 25 percent under our normal management without getting bogged down with buying electric vehicles and buying um renewable energy we 've got to use the market alternatives that are out there that suits our system counselor paul smith asked about how do we factor in the coal-fired power of gas-fired power that 's in the grinders against renewable energy in the grid and this was highlighted way back in 10 000 i think when i was at the football stadium at canberra and they said we 're using renewable power from south australia tonight i was working out how i spent i missed the first half because i was trying the canberra and was still strong enough to run the lights but looking into it further was they they brought parents out australia but still using hellfire power to run stadium so it 's like i said you 're hanging here you can hang things on whatever it is for your own political gain or um or whatever it is and i say on page 130 or something we uh we endeavor to be at all renewable energy by 2030. it did did have a little thing you know it should have it in front of me but i 'm pretty casual um it did have a little bit out there that if it 's possible or something so really it 's not that easy to um i think they realize it 's not that easy and we don 't as the mayor said we don 't want to walk into figures that aren 't going to be attainable and my biggest concerns if we get to the 2050 or whatever 's here in 2050 um next year i think is how we 're going to fund the the offsets to have a 7 000 carbon emission from the tip with whatever we do and at today 's price is around 95 or something there 's 650 000 off the budget before we even start and we 've got no control where that money goes to don 't invest into their own little foreign the enactment i can 't fully support because i don 't think we can meet it and still operate as a council we could have to reduce our services to the town or whatever to meet this budget and so therefore we 'll be going backwards and we aren 't in a position to be able to buy all sets to make these commitments as a major company thank you thank you um i have to take issue with council of rights comment that um well a number of council rights comments but i 'll speak about one um which was that councillors might be doing this for their own political gain and i i really don 't believe that anyone on this council is is going to sign up to this and i hope everyone think that there is as council rights indicated some demo in the detail but that 's a detail that if we believe this is necessary for the environmental and and other health of our shire and indeed the nation it 's something that we need to work through and we need to work through it sooner rather than later i think that the perhaps some of the flooding and the fires that we 've seen over the last few years would indicate that it 'll be a much more expensive project not to work through it or to lead to a later date so i will leave it at that recommendation [Music] number five um we should probably know that um so you 're happy with that change in 0.123 yes thank you did we get a second left any comments any time um i just note that the community wants to embed a legacy note in the instrument of delegation which is on page 256 special note regarding gary styles contribution my understanding was that the access committee and certainly i know that the tidy towns committee was hoping it to make some more tangible memorial to gary starr 's contribution considerable contribution to this stop try not only through the committees that he 's been on and he was chair of the tidy towns committee for a number of years but he was also a counsellor for a considerable amount of time until he became too ill and i would hope that in the near future we would be able to have a discussion about that and that the access and the tidy towns committee would have a discussion about it too and we might be able to to put up something that would be a fitting tribute 23rd of this month and we already have a suggestion yeah um i presume under in the business uh 3.2 optimum pharmacy that 's the optimal pharmacy and in the main street there 's the box electricity at the edge of the car park i supplementary um former councillor and mayor bruce slimmer have done a lot of work on this community too so i don 't know if he 's this service should be recognized by some time maybe he asked the access community to bring that back um council as well i think he 's been faint enough that i 've just put something on him someone else thinks about it thank you thanks for you bruce [Music] standard instrument and variation in regard to agritourism so you don 't point their counselor thank you councillor council thank you um yes thank you thank you mr mayor and thank you through you to the director for this um comprehensive report of a quite abstruse matter and the reason that i 'm moving it is that i 've had a little bit to do with it through the tourism board as as i was asked to take it up with council and to ask council to make a submission to this local lep amendment which i did and the mayor and former councillor and myself had a very good chat with the director and got perhaps some idea of really what it all means and certainly the central western new south wales joint organisation has put a submission in which is is detailed here as well so thanks thanks read the background or a lot of the background in that we have to make some of the changes we can elect to incorporate some of the amendments that are compulsory and i thank again the director for giving us that nice little table that sets us all out for us so if if you weren 't able to wade through the rest that that table really summed it up so i i think the idea is supported by the tourism board in terms of helping to make it easier for people on the land to supplement income in a number of different ways with appropriate safeguards and regulation so i am happy to take some questions i will probably throw them to the director rather than answer them but i do thank the director and her staff for spending quite a bit of time on this uh just to say that um i 've actually found it quite interesting that things that were not considered um appropriate in agri-tourism and agricultural places is now on the firmly on the agenda in like 10 years 15 years ago they were _''_3309.2 do that now they 're encouraging people to do it um it will be interesting the devil 's in the detail will be interesting to see how much this has taken on and also what backlash there will be to these types of activities on the farm so we always have that right farm lobby who says that you know if they don 't want tents in the backyard at other people places so it will be interesting to see how this develops but i think it 's it 's a really well necessary but it 's also an interesting document that relates to a lot of different things that were thought of as being no-go zones 10 or 15 years ago so i understand that there are some compulsory items at what stage are the optional items are decided upon and does that come back through a council meeting or is that a direct decision that would come back through the council to make a determination on whether or not council does actually adopt any of the optional items thank you thank you and the level of planning assessment indicated on page 330 the existing zones versus the proposed zones going forward and it 's in relation to business and industrial zones in our audiences we haven 't changed the actual areas for employment and town cbd we 're just calling them something different chair that that is correct the actual air lander is staying second so essentially all this is doing is changing their titles and in some areas such as the general and light industrial we are now allowing it to do more thank you i notice that the director who 's obviously been very busy in the last few weeks her concern is the merging of the general and the light industrial areas into into one area and when i first read it it was was immediately my concern too because we 've got a lot of um housing that is scattered through what is now light industrial and i think it would be a very big problem for this council if it were all to be zoned general industrial i presumably there would be still some some planning come back in terms of conditions and has the potential to be a problem in certain areas for this council and i thank the director for already giving that feedback to bpd yeah you know i support it um comments about why you have live industry we 've got a few houses still scattered around those areas but this is always going to be difficult with planting we 've um because some of that site is coming off regular street and where you 've got a mix of housing and businesses and um that there 's been other regulations come into the planning thinking that if we 're getting access to vehicles into these existing businesses and and getting them out is not always easy you can 't_''_3588.48 back out you shouldn 't be able to drive through so therefore we 've moved on to kite street quite strictly made the point that in the planning process if it 's a heavy industry which i would suggest general industry and and it 's good that we do clarify that we can have a bit more mixture in these areas and the cbd and the young road and comes to town and they want to do something they 're not restricted by an old out-of-date um planning instrument as with the collis development over there where they couldn 't have retail development in that area the collis areas of boratar street behind toyota and so forth they couldn 't have a retail outlet it was so forth and when questioning the planning director at the time and the previous one here i said how did all the motors get a retail it sells cars and parks and she said no it 's not it it launched its application under a vehicle repair station which is different to a retail outlet and there are subsidiary is the retail sales so unless the opponent in these areas know the planning laws back to front and how they could do it we often miss businesses super cheap ended up in an area where they don 't really want people to go into them rms wanted to put them up a cement in front of their driveway so you got their right hand turns into the business that they try to develop as a retail development and i said i said to the director well if they put in a fitting bay and a hoist they could have been a vehicle repair shop it was just technicalities and i hope this clears that up and i think the talent the area those controls are still there in terms of losing businesses i 'm not quite sure that 's that 's the case and some of the planning rules have been very clear and being followed and i should be critically criticized for that at all so sometimes a little bit honest and sometimes they appear peculiar attached to the rules no rules you got done reply put the resolutions in favor clear carry i 'm sorry generally suggested um just to say this is great news good news for a town that 's been lacking in retail space uh it 's a really great development it 's been on the cards for quite a number of years it 's terrific that it 's actually come to fruition it looks like it 's been it 's been well assessed thank you larissa for the people who had any concerns have been being addressed it is quite an exciting development and i 'm welcoming the welcoming the money that they 're spending in town exactly the same just great well said companies supported the only comment i 've got is that it was received by council on the 9th of july and i 'm informed that the rta was the holdover of this correct suppose we should have brought that up with them while over here the delays i don 't think i don 't think you know when people no one would know this except for the bunnings people but it 's frustrating if you 've got to deal with the bureaucrats and you know they tell us they want to help us and how long have they held it up for through the chair it wasn 't just transport new south wales i 'm not quite sure is it 30 days through the chair they 've got 21 days in which to provide comments back to council however the government agencies did seek an extension of time within which to get comments have a couple of sort of niggles in the back of my mind as to where the bunnings is going to do the right thing um firstly regards lighting in the in the car park and the bunnings statement that there 's no night use of parking required as the trading hours are predominantly during daylight hours well i think predominantly means they need to provide lighting but the proposed operating hours go to 10 p.m five days a week and i i really hope that they 're not going to be doing that but i 'm a little concerned about that and i can 't find it at the moment but one of the objections is is about um i think noise or something of operations late at night and bunnings has said don 't worry we won 't do that through perhaps through you mr mayor to the director are we able to make them put that in writing um through the check yes we can ask reading writing but council also does have the opportunity to undertake um compliance reviews it 's quite difficult to be doing and we 're not there at the time and we 'll monitor for a while and you know we have had those sorts of issues at in the past i 'm just wondering whether it might be better to get original undertaking or whether whether we think it would make any difference um um um [Music] owner of the science and the business there is planned because he bought the tipler family and brought all these houses around it around their business for futures expansion and when it 's now it 's coming to fruition they might not be all that happy with who 's doing the development but um other than that that 's that was their that was their vision for the for the site when they went there it started with a small shop and supplying builders materials and so forth and so i think this is a good thing for the for the development um for the town to develop along with street mummies seem to have very good customer support in whichever area they go into well they 're already here but they 're going modern a substantial car park which is often always the um the vein of anyone around these sort of buildings is having enough ball street parking and and people using that building aren 't imposing other businesses parking and also they 've got room for their workers to um to park i think council expects some worry about noise just covered by a condition number 11 that the admission of noise from the premises must be in accordance with the noise policy for industry published by the new south wales epa act and then at number two and to condition 12 outdoor loading shall be designed and installed so that no light will cast on the joint properties which can happen if you just tell them to put lights in and so forth and the lighting is to comply with australian standards such and such controllable fishing effects for outdoor lighting so i think they 'll be looking after their the safety of their workers and and customers that would seem to get too dark they wouldn 't be putting so i think that it will be all right and is western australia i 'm sorry i 've got off script a little bit here i haven 't got my notes so i fully welcome this development at a cost of 10 million into our community um i 'm just wanting to know and it 's probably in there i think i may have missed it is the the time frame to complete this and that like they talk about the demolishing the site to build the new existing of the new facility and i suppose i 'm asking that in in the essence that in recent times obviously we 've had some closures of other businesses in town um and although this is not a closure i can probably hear some of the vibes of the community going forward that you know once bunnings is closed to do this development that how how does the developer handle that knowing how many days it 's going to be closed through the chair all the council 's been advised at this point in time is that it 's going to be a fully staged development and the actual closure of bunnings of time like a couple of weeks at the most okay the way that they 're staging it will enable them to do one portion first and then do the fit out and then basically okay so it 's not a complete closure okay thank you very much for the clarification the proposal is as i understand it to build the new one continue trading everyone they 've got and then once they go into the new one they will demolish the other one turn into a car park thank you we 've been looking for this sort of development increase increase capacity and increase industry and business activity and this is what we 've got you know i think i think we should be very appreciative so can i just say that there 's 57 conditions on this on this application which is and they all make sense they 're very good thank you they you know outline times and when things are available and when things can 't_''_4476.88 be used and we do actually there condition 51 actually talks about a car park lighting security camera plan which be a compliance issue with the council so that will cover the car park lighting i think we as the mayor said we have ways of uh reducing the noise and making sure nobody doesn 't become a nuisance and the best part about this is we get a hundred thousand dollars into our section 94 competitions plan and that 's to be spent on the community so i think you know we can only say thank you very much and good luck and let 's can 't_''_4514.48 wait for it to open thank you ladies yes this is a very exciting uh proposition and i 'm pretty glad that we get the chance to have a look at it uh i 'm sure councillor kiss will echo these thoughts but having a group home locally will make a significant change to uh families locally who have family members who need facilities like this um and also homes bring a real sense of dignity to people with different abilities i myself have a family member in western australia who has continually moved their family has continually moved eight years of and the group home is really the only way that she can continue that dignity and i 'm very excited to support this motion here particularly as we 've spoken before about the caring industry in disability and aged care being a really growing industry for us locally it 's very exciting to see this opening and be supported i know there are a number of objections in here particularly around the types of people coming and going into these centres which the ability network have quite clearly responded to but it highlights an issue around the understanding of what a group home is in presumption that it is about drug and rehabilitation whereas it 's really a space to provide that care and to provide that support to people in need so i would recommend this development to the council yes thank you thank you chair i would almost suggest that um counselor what 's taking my notes um look i i 'm fully supportive of this i think it 's a positive way forward for our community i hope that it 's not the last of them it folk with the different abilities within cara um just something i i was wondering i mean i understand that there have been a few people having complaints about it potentially being used for rehabilitation and and i understand the purpose behind ability network and their explanation saying no it 's never to be intended is there any way of including that perhaps for the for the benefit of the nearby residents i can see it in the cara lep 2012 it 's defined transitional groupo mass and a and b but is there any wave that 's on page 526 of the ipad is there any way of removing that in that there is no likelihood of it being used for a drug or rehab purpose to satisfy the residents probably only go on what would advise by the ability network but that 's correct yeah one of the other concerns again from the neighbours was about the increased traffic and from everything that i 've read in here where it 's saying there 's a number of staff one to two staff and four clients and i think even visitors which we 're going to pre-organise i don 't see that as being any different to some families in fact some families would have more of a right act than that i 'm fully welcoming vulnerability network developing this as a group home thank you does this have a boundary to the west parrot channels through the chair yes it does i can 't_''_4793.84 see many of the conditions where someone 's gonna have to put a uh person-proof fence between this development in the channel for safety it hasn 't always got water in it but sometimes there is water in it and i just wonder if we do need to recognize that either as a council or the high security fence around that block that joins the west coast um any lady through the chair the objectives which is a bit complicated it 's generally 50 [Music] also if one side of the fence say or defense they 've got good enough for what they 've got uh and the other side of defense wants something different assuming the person who wants a better fence to pay the road traffic but i think they 've been assessed chester i 'm more concerned about the water something happens because there 's a lot of water at times we don 't want someone falling into it and i don 't really know where the boundary of channel foreign um um i just wanted to just send a letter to the family um um _"

    "text": "at this meeting you are respectful to others and use appropriate language at all time and council obviously accepts no liability for any inflammatory offensive or sorrow or offensive remark for gestures maybe of course this evening i will commence by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land in which we gather we 're active people and and my respect to the religious past and present we don 't have any apologies we 're all present and correct so we will move on to disclosures of interest and i would invite any counsellor or staff to indicate in relation to any improvement need to be cleared in this in this agenda i want reporter writing we declare an interest in whether the interest is the canaanite and the nature of that interest moving the there is no one registered for public forum so we 'll go straight into israeli meeting proper and we are dealing with two matters at this extraordinary council meeting extraordinary council meeting and the first one is item one from the general manager which is the afternoon delivery program 2017 to 2000 2017 18 to 2021 as the draft 10 year financial plan taken into 20 30 31 and also the draft revenue policy for 2021 2022 there 's a recommendation in there in front of us [Music] of draft plans and policies and programs here and they are in draft form and of course it is mandated that they be put on public exhibition for 28 days minimum which this recommendation in effect will do if we pass it and i certainly would recommend anyone who has an interest in the future of the shire as far as council works with it to read at least the introductions the short forms of say the 10-year financial plan and have a look at what are our main revenue users as planned over the next three years and that said we have a number of very big plans in the pipeline and they include things like west caro drainage the aquatic centre redevelopment and a whole lot of other quite large budget items for which there is no funding in the long term financial plan at this stage so a lot of those projects will rely to said council will be putting quite a bit of money into a variety of not only infrastructures but of course all the other things that we do all the time and i do recommend that people have a good look at this and please have their say if they 'd like to see anything change or anything else put in and we will certainly look at that the only other thing that i would say is that while these all of these draft plans and policies have us as fit for the future financially we are treating a fairly fine line in that we have a lot of things that we would like to do and funding is quite tight and we have to be very careful with so i do recommend something that counsellors and senior staff and their staff have been working on for many months now thank you councilman thank you mr mayor um yes i [Music] just thoroughly endorsed the comments made by councillor smith and i also just wish to add that i think it 's very important that we try and encourage input from the community realizes that an enormous amount of work has gone into the preparing this budget and that um the various plans um that are there i think i might just suggest that you know the the last power up on page one of the ipad where the general manager says that the 1920 financial statements indicated a sound financial position with the majority of key indicators exceeding the benchmarks set by for the industry and the revised ltfp long-term financial plan continues in that vein and then over on the conclusion to that the past three months councils of staff have been reviewing refining the priorities for inclusion and we 're drafted integrated delivery program and 1718 to 2122 and the operational plan 21 22 as well as the 10-year financial plan and having developed the documents to this point council now seeks input from the community all members of the community are encouraged to review the documents and provide feedback to counsel all written submissions received by a due date will be presented to council for consideration prior to the final adoption of the document incurred so i have ideas and thoughts which may be put counsel in a better direction um financially certainly we 'd love to hear it thank you for the comment director and the staff who have done an enormous amount of work in putting this together if you did i said a responsible budget it 's always difficult to make things balanced from time to time and to be able to cover all the things that we would like to see done in some cases the community would like to see done as i said is responsible and we are meeting the key indicators for financial stability as we move forward so i would encourage people to have a look have a read and please come back with any comments that you might may see and it is in essence great thinking is with the maximum that over two percent and other other services that are three percent increase which is keeping up with inflation and the cost of delivering services which is perhaps to some members of the community not palatable but at the same time it 's a business decision that community would be widely expecting them to do so with that i would commend it again and support my colleagues but also like my colleagues encourage anybody to come who wishes to come back to any comments for questions about the budget which will be adopted after 28 days of public exhibition for the comments right reply i 'll put the resolution i was in favor i began to declare it carried item number two on the agenda from the director of environmental services of da32 straight 2021 being unlocked bp 107 level 065 oraca street the recommendation there to approve the set of conditions so i 'll remove that or something different please come to a lot technical smith thank you you to speak councillor ross for the stands alone thank you the dea requires council to make a variation to the dcp requires a six metre [Music] gap between building and enabling a neighbouring boundary and a three metre nature strip however in 2008 the da that originally saw that building go there did not require that the bcp at that time did not require that um i i see no reason why the um continuation of that building which is going to go further south rather than expand in any way i see no reason why that should not continue i see no reason why given the various conditions that are implied regarding noise regarding fire access [Music] i see no reason why that um the um that i see i see that that has adequately replied to the uh complaints of a neighbour i think also um this afternoon we sought some assurances regarding stormwater as well which i think should once again be of comfort to the the person who is lodging the objections to it so with that i 'm perfectly confident that this d.a can be can go ahead and be allowed to go ahead with uh with that minimum disruption to the neighbour and minimum maximum benefit to the business that 's going to [Music] be on that side the second of the speech yes mr may um firstly i 'd like to say i 'm really pleased that this va shows that things are going well in in that industry and area of operation undercover i endorse what councillor walsh said in terms of the dcp and i would just add to that that the reason that there is no need i believe for a three metre vegetation buffer is principally because on the almost their time for a majority of beats and certainly on the perimeter as it fronts the two houses that are nearest to the the operation there is a very tall colorward fence which would make any vegetation completely redundant and would also impede operations particularly access in terms of emergencies that said and and i certainly endorse the application i must admit to be somewhat disappointed that some of what was asked for in the submission of the d.a was not forthcoming to two weeks i do apologize for that to wish an audio auditory an assessment of of noise the storm water and a fire report however the conditions of consent are that a construction certificate won 't be issued until council has the uh the ability to have a look at those and ensure that they 're adequate for all concerned both the uh said however i fully support and endorse all the appropriate issues have been not only well assessed for the appropriate condition so i think it 's nice to see a local business seeking to expand and continue to grow as you 've alluded to there 's some things that need to be conditioned within a condition and through the working process to some extent but i think it 's for council to move on and approve it right reply oh mr just before you do i 'd like to support this application i think it 's very important to endorse the comments management council regarding the need for the strong water management plan to be supplied and which is which is spoken about here prior to a construction certificate and also the issue around the field as well need to be supplied neither the construction certificate or the occupation certificate will be forthcoming until such time as they are addressed which is which is foreign these importers they have to be submitted before construction can start you know listen to stormwater very clearly and [Music] [Music] closed appropriately _"

agreed to being recorded please ensure that when you speak at this meeting you are respectful for others to use appropriate language at all times cara council will accept another liability for any defamatory or offensive remarks or gestures during the course of this meeting i would also be happy with all the knowledge of traditional cafe custodial which we gather the rhetoric people that pay my respects to their elders past both times i will take apologies and applications for leave absence by councillors and we have one from council of fagan who is on holidays if someone please move that i believe that will be granted and council of the computers what seconds that do i put the resolution and leave absolutely granted all those in favor against declare it carried item 1.4 disclosures of interest and i would invite any council or staff to indicate in relation to any interests you need to in b whether the interest is for cunery or non-vocabulary see what is the nature of that interest thank you i declare interest in 11.1 and the late notice of 11.2 uh as they 're in regard to the cara airport where we 'll move on we have no presentation and i 'm assuming mr general manager we have no public anybody wishing to address the council in public forum so we 'll then move on to the ipad which is page six of the ipad which is the minutes of the ordinary meeting until 24th of january so i 'll move that minute to be adopted please councilwork elbow thank you councillor kids thank you any comments or questions i can sign these and show an accurate record for the resolution to that extent anybody doing all 19 i think it is and we have our mayoral minute which i 'm happy to move for council smith thank you i will speak briefly to these colleagues i have spoken to it previously this is simply seeking support from the government in particular to ensure that the budgetary allocation to and the request community made for appropriate at an appropriate facility in cara fit for purpose and that the budget will actually match those needs the 70.2 million dollars was announced since then we know there have been substantial increases in the cost of cost of construction we know that there 's a smaller community of tomorrow that has had an allocation of 80 million dollars so all we 're seeking is to ensure that the political services plan and the planning that has been undertaken so far is able to be completed and this community gets the hospital within which is i think essential for our community i could speak at length but i think it 's best to leave it there other than to note that at the time of writing we hadn 't received a clinical services plan western area health have provided a shortened version of the clinical services plan and whilst the clinical services plan is not for conversation tonight but it 's provided to us in confidence i think the clinical services has provided to us probably is lacking some of the information that the draft draft plan and we also work out sorry when we get presented with the draft master plan and also become aware of where the redevelopment will take place that 's what 's been known mr man i think you 've three years since the announcement was made and if they stick to the original budget they 'll be producing the facility that was probably in visits at the time and we need to maintain that there 's a budget attitude of the facility that we needed i 'm just resourcing the man 's word that it 's i just hope they are they have become me in their through the chair i want to thank the mayor for taking this mayoral minute council elections were held in december for local government we had some pretty clear-cut issues that our lga communities wanted to address and the carer hospital redevelopment was certainly one of them we all believe the community 's waited long enough for this development and thanks to councillor wright it 's three years since the announcement man west has raised a very important point about the that the building costs have increased with construction and further and for future builds potentially not to take place until you know 2022 2023 or 2024 that the cost of 70.2 million may not cover the costs needed to build the a future hospital that the cara lga needs um i just wanted to add my full support behind this recommendation and that i believe that karen has waited long enough for this development thank you for the comment thank you man i agree wholeheartedly with this it 's a significant issue for our community and something we need action on as soon as possible and it 's definitely a good idea for the council to make those actions and those representations to the state government since the announcement three years ago there has been a significant change in the cost of building the cost of the shape of the economy and that service provision that is required from our area with the reduction in services available in the young hospital a substantial amount of the hilltops council council members are going to start using our hospital and as the years old there 'll need to be a review of that and we need the state government to act quickly so i recommend this question thank you for the comments just need something the wheel that they presented to us and which obviously was occasionally about how they built a hospital we are now sort of in the second or third stages in the hospital so we 're well on the way so this community will have a redevelopment of a hospital that there 's no question the concern is simply that the clinical services plan which is a community saying what we felt the community should have has been accepted we just want to make sure that the facilities we get in this community is is fit for purpose for this community and also to make sure that it fits in with western area health with the mps district hospitals and the base hospitals all working together and i think has probably indicated there 's a real opportunity to do that to a greater extent the second point i would make is that resolution is designed to be supporting because a local member has worked very very hard on this and has made it her number one electoral priority which all the elements agree with and i know that she 's working very hard so it 's designed to be supported not being critical out of any way size shape or form with that up with the resolution against declarative thinking general committee recommendations item number one which is 1.1 which is the draft coder meeting practice which we place on a public exhibition 28 days someone moved thank you any comments or questions on this i 'll put the resolution all those in favor again something clear carried if i 'm going to quick colleagues please just 1.2 label government you have large special conference voting delegates there 's a recommendation there to endorse myself and council of fabian australian delegates councillor smith thank you any comments or questions on this i 'll put the the resolution i was in favor against declaring karen i know that the other day they 've got an email suggesting we 'll be using our phones to vote on our phones 1.3 significant number of appointments council decisions haven 't_''_649.68 moved that deliver second please council paul smith thank you we need comments or questions on this probably not 1.4 delegations of authority to the mayor general manager in section 355 committees there 's a resolution there council of elbow thank you second council smith basically eyebrows thank you i presume that 's what you meant house is like that any comments or questions any comments or questions bear in mind the section three five five delegations can be added to or amended at the will of the council no for the comments or questions hopefully the resolution was in favor two between the over three item two two which is two point one direction for the services the the council note the investments and financial reports of january 22. so the previous delegation is that what a separate point when we passed it we 're now on to 2.1 which is the committee resolution which is around the native investments and financial report 2022 councillor velvet thank you council smith thank [Music] [Music] [Music] put the resolution in favor of carrying um i 'm happy to move this councillor smith thank you uh this will discuss that at in the committee meeting um we also had a group presentation from the director this evening about development application and how it all works uh so i don 't think i need to be adding too much other news it 's been well well researched well well reviewed and the conditions and the the approval i think are quite appropriate secondly to speak i 'll just say what i said at the committee meeting is the mayor which is that it came to council because uh the front setback even to meet the dcp and uh it 's been well assessed that there are there 's a great variety of setbacks in that area and that this won 't stand out so the comments after the comments and so i 'll wait for i 'd require the resolution we need to signify that college please but don 't think we 'd declare it carried out we think that we didn 't give tolerance after that we needed to give you show of hands came to us is that it is uh on our heritage site which is the woods flat mining site a long time ago and we did discuss it quite exhaustively last meeting and i do note that the conditions of consent i think condition two um have been amended along the lines that we requested in terms of ensuring that there is no contamination by doing some drilling so i certainly recommend approval thank you for the second speech no thank you so much god replied not required i would assume councillors picked up the resolution as your favor against declarative carried item 3.3 councillor what uh apologies for not doing this earlier i 'd like to declare an interest in 3.3 3.4 and 3.5 for 3.3 and 3.4 it 's due to my brother-in-law being a putting forward these two development applications and then the third being a development application in regards to my family and a business that i 'm working so i will leave for the next three thank you okay one two three twenty twenty one d a one two three twenty twenty one yeah that thank you [Music] [Music] this application shows the uh the support and the growing um support industries to the agricultural center in the area and it 's good to see you thank you because there 's a second i wish to speak any further comments i 'll put the resolution i think i 'm sorry council right you didn 't reply to you [Music] and like the other va 's it 's been well assessed and it 's appropriate that we improve it i recommend it to you i think i might be commenting in the community also that there are a number of das going ahead where some of these sorts of facilities and industries are starting to to continue to grow people here the own road in other parts of the show with activity in the airport of course we deal with a bit later on there is activity in the shower and some of these industries and businesses are growing the council of course is acutely aware that retail is struggling some of the cbd issues are struggling and i 've got every confidence that council will industry and for those enterprises to to try to resolve those issues council is very conscious of that but this is about a da which is extremely appropriate to be approved and i recommend it to you secondary to speak i fully support your comments thank you i 'll write a reply but the resolution was in favor against whatever carried and the final one is sorry through the checkpoint here mr mayor this is this has come to us because um the applicant wishes to remove the on-site car parking from his development application and the assessment is that that 's perfectly okay because immediately adjacent there is more than sufficient public car parking so it would be too onerous a condition i recommend acceptance i think i wish to speak for a comment right replied would not be serious like you could have carried thank you item number five five point one which is in regards to an acting general manager general manager 's general management wait a couple of days recommendation deployment mr michael jones just someone we 'll put the resolution as it stands all those brings it back to council for information or application but he also shares the role around the various directors on a kind of a rotational basis not a seniority or a capacity basis i don 't have the authority to delegate an acting general manager the delivery program 2017-18 to 21-22 in the operational plan 20 2021-2022 a six-month preview to december be noted and that 's something we discussed in information meeting so i want to move that recommendation please councillor smith thank you for the second please councillor peter wright thank you speak councillors method i think council right you 're happy uh this this report shows how our operations for the previous six months has been moved throughout the state managing operation plans and there 's a great list of things of what what we 've been involved in to help deliver the different needs of the community and i congratulate the staff thank you any further comment i 'll just make one this year 's public information and i would suggest that any member of the community interested in what council 's doing get a copy page 133 which is the second quarterly budget review and it will be adopted the quarter ending 31st of december 2021 and then the other councillor smith news things are going on things are tracking well in the last quarter if people who are reading this or are listening notice a deterioration particularly in the the water fund that 's as we have discussed previously is due primarily to the season that we 've had meaning that people have had to use less water and therefore council has had less income we end the quarter with a surplus of over 21 million which sounds like a wonderful thing for council to have and to play with but unfortunately almost all of that surplus is earmarked in particular funds as council quite appropriately does planning for the future so the sewer fund for example planning for future expansion of the sewer system maintenance repairs all that sort of thing and while it seems like a wonderful thing to have unfortunately it 's not ours two years as we or the community sees fit but nevertheless i think that we have done wish to speak any further comments or questions [Music] [Music] reply which is the recommendation that we note the release of resolutions council there 's a number of them there thank you thank you for checking the pleasure thank you very much thank you this is housekeeping happy point one two dot point recommendations there from the director of infrastructure operations in the job to be the face of the highest level lift pump of the river in the switchboard so i want to move that or ask questions this question the switchboard is to summarize the switchboard needs upgrading to handle the increased number of pumps at the river and also the requirement that all pumps have a variable speed drive as well so requiring uh air conditioning to keep the switchboard cool et cetera this project was actually a carry forward item in your budget review that has the originally where we 're starting to look at the design of the switchboard we didn 't realize that all the requirements were going to be in place it has had to increase [Music] the system the economy system to providers needs to have a soft start and a soft finish with the pump switching on and off so there 's no big drops of these big increase in lives in the power system um i it 's uh as with most most things it costs a lot of money to make things work and it gives a consumable amount of money but it leads to a better operation of the facility and also we 're able to keep hoping that i i feel one observation is that i have the booster pump at the side yards it sends water out to bending mower and so forth [Music] this is a critical infrastructure for our community for the continuity of water service for cara and its surrounds built in 1984 i 'm sure our needs have somewhat changed since then in regards to the supply water for our lga at a cost of approximately 1.162 million and we have just shy of 200 000 in our bank account which leaves us with quite a big gap it 's an excellent opportunity for myself to again encourage council to look at money out there that we can be accessing and it requires i believe a team approach to not only apply for funds but to also manage what we get and the acquittal process which is very detailed thank you thank you thank you for the comment i just add in terms of dot point two that while we are providing in principle support of going out to tinder that that tender with recommendations and analysis will come back to council again so that we will have another vote thank you for the commentary question is very clear do i reply no put the resolution in favor against declare it carried we 're now going to reports of urgent nature so we will now get a recommendation about my council considers confidential reports listed below in a meeting close to the public in accordance with 1082 of the labour government 1993.

the draft code of media practice so i 'll move that please absolutely thank you councilman bilbo thank you wish your control council down how much counselor i far as sorry sorry very supportive of these changes um with the moving of the times and with the provision of audio link it 's a very detailed document and spells out quite clearly what is to take place and thank you you for the comment i think the key point is it also comes back for adoption after the 28 day period which the major change which as councilman elbow mentioned this is the provision for meeting by audiovisual link if needed and one of the reasons for that is a public health emergency is that defined as a state public health emergency as declared by the health minister because it 's not defined in the draft write a reply i 'll put the resolution on those in favor 3.2 which is page 62 which is receiving councils and dealerships myself and the council of fagging to be voting delegates at the 22 local companies the high special conference any further comments put the resolution i was in favor aye clear of carriage and i 'll be quick colleagues again don 't be able to call me up the general manager 's report 3.3 in regards to delegations to committee to working parties et cetera the recommendation there i 've had a fair involvement i think you 've all already seen this at some point so i 'm happy to move that way employees councillor smith thank you councillor kiss thank you any comments counseling just to say that i think that this is a fair distribution regarding a number of councillors on on a number of committees and that sort of thing and i hope that all councillors enjoy their committees and don 't nearly fall asleep like i did one of my very first communities if you do that 's until after next monday 's council meeting but there are some meetings being planned for this month so based upon tonight you may well if you 're uh dedicated to our committee you 'll be contacted by the staff that are organising those meetings for later this month prior to being formalised thank you or if you see one bring out the general manager and sort of say would i go i know there 's a australia you know i had a meeting small you know the questions on that the point i would make is that every effort was made to be balanced and fair um we 're quite happy to talk to anybody if they 've got concerns or issues and we 're trying to work our way through it um no further comments wrong reply briefly just to add that for any section 355 committee which we get to in a minute or indeed i 'm sure any of these committees any councillor is welcome to attend as an observer at any time you can participate and i think most most counselors on 355 committees enjoy seeing someone come along okay that 's a wrong reply sorry i shouldn 't have spoken i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against declarative carry on 3.4 which is page 78 delegations to the general manager 355 committee and i 'll make the observation that these are by general and before we correct me here but most actually we need to rescind the previous delegations and just completely re-issue the delegations and that 's what the check with that council i thank you councillor bob smith any comments or questions on that and i suggest that you read the delegation carefully to what you 're involved with if there 's issues come back and again talk to us do you suspect you 're happy to try to reply not be quiet i 'll put the resolution on their favor against declare carried page 96. which is the investments council note the investments for january this time every month for us that 's questions i 'll put the resolution in favor against declare carried item 5.1 which is the da122 and i 'm quite happy to move that sector councillor smith thank you councillors i know that you would have read this and some of the gre reports and got the a considerable amount i would just point out to you on this particular matter is the reason he 's come to council is for a specific reason that is it 's a variation to a development control panel the development control plan is something which is a document which is council document the council is within the doctor but where the document is being varied then it has to be the council who makes the decision to vary that particular document for that particular part of the document based appropriately on the circumstances of the case that 's all so and this has been well assessed and i would suggest we should support it there are occasions when councils wish to vote against what 's been provided that in order to do that you need planning planning rules regulations you know to show reasonable causes to why you would vote against what 's being provided to you so you can 't just say you don 't like it you 'll write against people you have to have proper planning rules and laws to to base your decision on so these decisions are not your understand not your understanding at all there 'll be questions come up on these sorts of decisions from time to time and i know the director is quite happy to answer any questions we have just in terms of a broad outline of the framework in which we work the local it 's pretty much the second metaphorical state we need to work within that framework we can 't bear it without proper process the local environment so the development control things we are able to vary based on the circumstances of that particular matter and with that i would suggest one that setbacks do quite often come up this is one i think has been appropriately assessed to look down and fits the environment that it 's in i would suggest we should support it for the comments councilman i 'll just elaborate on that a little bit um so that the the allowed setback is 9.6 meters uh the proposed setback here is six meters which is a variation of more than fifty 50 and it certainly is well to the front in terms of the two the buildings on either side of it but the assessment has looked a little bit wider and there are in that area of the street big variations in terms of the front setback and they go down to five meters and so there 's no justification really for there 's an aerial well i drove past yesterday and on there in the back one is already built now it says existing on the plan that came with it why is there a discrepancy between the um but the photo doesn 't show it yeah i was a bit shocked when i drove past and saw that one was there and then i went back and looked at it and saw that it was on the plan through the chair i would imagine on page 130 that you 're referring to is the aerial photo from google maps and it was probably taken prior to the house that you 're referring to is being built because the house is not on the phone no through the mayor um those photos are used primarily to identify the site um unfortunately it 's not up to council to keep up with that question so we just have to stop we do we do and quite often this level of documentation is also provided in the statement of environmental effects which is submitted by the applicants however these are from our planning system that we have assignments so we 've got a library of photos as has been indicated at the time that we don 't we don 't take the photos we purchase that imagery across the shire it 's allowing our geographic information system the same as water water courses are on roads and engineering et cetera et cetera any further comments uh just one that you might please do though it says durable occupancy so it might be it 's not going to be subject in the future or got the potential to be subdivided in the future and all that upset into setbacks and accesses at this point in time it hasn 't been established what their future intent is it was just purely to have one dwelling at the front of the site and one at the rear thanks very much i probably don 't need a reply further consideration put the recommendation i 'm sorry sorry colleague i think he would vote for this one and do you age we need to signify how we wrote ourselves close in favor against third parent um 5.2 h131 da for woodstock 4 move this cancel the smith we have a second of this castle thank you guys this is pretty straightforward and really it 's come to us because it 's a heritage area having been long ago the the old woods flat gold mining area but there there isn 't anything there unless there 's something below the surface that we don 't know about and there are conditions of consent requiring them to to stop and notify us if that is the case and as the assessment also mentioned there 's a potential for further development around that site so i don 't see this as a problem i do have one question through the chair perhaps to the director the director talks about possible contamination from that mining a long time ago and that it has it has been looked at in terms of um there being no obvious signs of contamination part of that drilling down at all into something that may be below the surface in terms of contamination through the man normally that would be part of the initial site investigations before they commence work that previous uses that we would actually require them to submit a more detailed report to council but normally it does involve drilling and taking steps analyzed and was that conditioned there so i didn 't go through all the conditions i think we can have that qualifying to cover the what 's the word you 're looking for potential indicated that it considered necessary yeah yes check it out d and good conditions council federal thank you for saying that councilman paul smith thank you that 's all right yeah i think there was an existing business owner there and the way i read the map and that is probably called dealer machinery um [Music] office site on the side for a new additional space to do their business but run their office as well i think reasons coming to us to ask for a gradle [Music] [Music] that 's the original condition i support it thank you thank you yes i do have a comment um on page 154 i um 54 think it 's 150 oh sorry uh item four approve the hours of operation are as follows to 12 p.m on saturdays no work on sundays or public holidays is that their request for us um through the math that they are our standard conditions i think people can i think they 're payment for construction was that quick instruction sorry hours of operation i took that as operations of the business operating at the construction department it does i agree with councillor gravel parking space out there is no problem given the location and what 's around it i know also that the disabled parking space is to be concreted and i just wonder that 's obviously for ease of operation for the person driving that car is there a concrete part or will there be a concrete path for someone to to easily get without having to reverse the gravel from that space to the office or to wherever they 're going uh the development will be required to comply with um the requirements of the building code of australia and the disability discrimination act and as such they have to have um clear equitable access to and within the building so that that would thank you for the comments question one reply da125 stroke 2021 in regards to the young road application so when i moved over something different i 'm happy to move it somewhere i 'm quite happy to speak to this only very briefly colleagues and the fact that it 's a appropriate development appropriate area they 're seeking i think really should be a reduction in the the car parking issues i think on the on the reading of the document of the the dtp it does have pictures think that 's been acknowledged by the observatory in what she 's foreshadowing is coming forward and it would appear to me that this is car parks is certainly most appropriate and set forward going forward for this particular this particular that 's the reason it 's here and i 've seen nothing else in the condition consent or composure which would cause many any any heartache so i 'm quite happy to be speaking to you strongly put a comment i 'll through your chair i just want to say that the report is well well written it 's consistent from the adjoining owners thank you yes i support this um this totally solutions as they operate under business um they 're quite a business in canada they 've got plans for care for young and other businesses in the area you know the discussion i had with the salesman i was looking at the unit they 'd give me a serve about council being slow passing this but he wasn 't up to date that we were up to and indicated that he could employ 15 people as time goes by so i think it 's good i just hope council acknowledges this is on the lot that the proposed bypass might go through so we might have if we ever get to that stage there might be some money being paid out to be honest that i supported her at the moment thank you for the comments i support him strongly and and i 've indicated that and if you think there 's quite an account of the right cluster matters it 's an extension of the tremendous activity out on the young road and the next day next ga indicates that the activity at the airport and the previous da indicated the activity owner was on the interesting highway development agriculture area as well so there are things happening around the around the community around town so but in terms of the bypass comments then we 'll deal with that when we come to can 't stop development now because of what might happen that the building the building is going to be on the higher ground they should not impact that that drainage system is very wet and down bottom gets very very wet and i 'm sure that anybody who purchased that would be fully aware of that and council is also mindful and monitors quite regularly those who who i guess what 's the better for one better word to believe materials machinery and rubbish in the drainage system and keep it keep it reasonably clean of any independence order but the development itself is up on the ground which is not impacted by that channel i 'll put the resolution eyes in favor clear and carry the respect da 5.0 5.5 da158 stroke you second place this has come to us uh because of what the parking uh car parking anomalies as well but it 's been very well assessed that there is adjacent a community parking space and that there is no need for the the parking spaces inside the hangar so the only thing that i would say is that it 's wonderful to see a number of uh da 's coming to council this month and wonderful to see business expansion and new business and and the confidence that people are showing and i think application should be supported thank you um you know kinds of questions i 'm quite happy to support it i noticed this is a dea number one five eight to straight 217. he hasn 't been hanging around that moment just simply means this is a modification of the v8 that was put determined was was launched in 2017. it is an amendment to the date it has been assessed that the condition was no longer relevant and appropriate so we 're quite quite comfortable to take that condition and make those memories any questions it and for the da to be completed this is one of the things that need to be sorted out before they can give them completions so they can use the hanger yes write a reply no better questions i 'll retire i 'll put the resolution in favor against you for a catered carried down speaking some of it council i went back might work but i would strongly suggest you if you 've got a question but pick things up in the ways without afraid to give you a direct screen i 'll say hey what 's going on particularly our conditions something should be strengthened a week without afraid to have that conversation but also bringing to the chamber [Music] are there any members of urgent nature being no matters of an urgent nature i will take a recommendation to close the leg to consider the council considers the confidential report listed listed in the meeting close to the public in accordance 1993 the first report is for directly lifting traffic operations it 's 9.1 in our agenda in central as new south wales joint organisation requests is considered to be confidentialized under section 10a 2 d1 of the local government act the council has satisfied the discussion of this matter in an open meeting would on balance be contrary to the public interest as it deals with commercial information of a confidential nation that would have disclosed prejudiced the commercial position of the person who supplied it and secondly from the veterinary environmental service was the late report 9.2 new south wales public spaces legacy program open space legacy public art mural project which matters to be confidential under section two sorry 1082 d1 of the local government acting to satisfy the discussion on this matter in our convenient hood on balance to contrary to public interest as commercial information of a confidential nature that would if disclosed prejudice the commercial position of the person who supplied it motion please and we 're in a second to close the meeting with the public council council of the billboard council downing thank you very much for the resolution with your favor against the declaration _"

address then you i 'll give you the opportunity if you do if you okay thank you um confirmation of the minutes ladies held 32nd march [Music] the second item is a confirmation of the minutes of the extraordinary meeting early 6th of april um i thought you moved your hand i didn 't sorry any comments or questions on this don 't blink tonight any comments or questions i 'll put the resolution that 's been shown as a terminator record also those in favor aye oh and against the legendary around dementia australia and i was happy to um i think this one is quite self-explanatory i 'm quite happy to leave it to the second and then we should say a few words i think it is important that we acknowledge care and that we do raise the issue from a community perspective thank you mr mayor and as you know this was something i raised as matter of fact what i thought was important and i think the background yes i thank you for having us at that time so thank you for that but i think the first sense of the um in the background says it all in many respects where it talks about according to dementia australia um dementia is the second leading cause of death for all australians and no one caused there 's a lot of statistics in the background that that services so i hope that the council will support certainly thank you for for bringing forward the recommendation and thank us as well for asking that it being thought forward i 'd only add that i think it 's very timely to do this now because of the inquiry around aged care and i think we 're speaking [Music] cause of death in people i thought how 's this happen and i went back to the meeting i attended with dr driver and we 've cured a lot of other diseases that used to kill us so therefore our better quality of life has led us into a stage where dementia for some reason does little debilitating um issue and i think it 's just good progression in our health care that we do the best that we can to track it it 's something the weekend news about not getting enough sleep can cause the onset of this could be a red queen community but it certainly causes a lot a lot of stress to the person that 's got it up to a stage where they don 't know they 've got it but they still have the family around them to look after these dementia patients let alone the nursing staff and doctors and so forth i i commend this recommendation thank you thank you uh councillor any other comments council gotta make i don 't think i need to exercise the right route rather than to acknowledge the council military did raise this your colleagues for your support may not be a core core component of council of business mindful of is that is the issues surrounding our the health and well-being of our community at all ages i 'll put the recommended revolutionaries in favor all right against declarative carry item number two the mayoral minute is transporting to sydney on page 43 and i again will move that resolution i 'll get a second council speaking to that um the council has been this council and this regional group of councils have been strongly advocating for a safe swift link to sydney for many many many years i think what 's putting us on on the on the agenda in such a manner now is that there 's the issues that were created around the the rain and the flooding on the door 's liner road which caused it to be closed and then it 's an accident on our great western highway it really is an issue that all communities can reach from new south wales in this side of the mountain need to be putting their shoulder of the wheel on indeed they have been and they are and are many many groups out there even in the blue mountains communities that they don 't come on board because of the restrictions that they 've faced and the road blocks their station and traffic jams that face because of some of the impediments that have been created it 's councilman smiling and other people are responding because we know for 30 years for 30 years we 're trying convince the amount of communities to come on board so i it is something we need to progress and progress very strongly and very vocally there is a meeting in sydney i think it 's the 27th of may from memory where i 'll be attending and we are meeting i 'm not sure that some of the politicians who are coming uh this day top of my head i 'm not going to second guess but we 're also meeting with western sydney councils as well to try and get a relationship between the western sydney councils and central new south wales that 's what i 'm making that is meryl minute and a bit of a chestnut i guess to all of us is the towards canberra and that linkage as well both road and right and so i think it 's a specifically about great western highway or the safest with lint but it also does canvas i have adequately the issues we do face and this council is very aggressively logging across the landscape with that i 'll be quite dramatic councillor smith will just speak i think you 've said most of it mr mayor i 'd just ask that people look at the state priorities in terms of new south wales transport strategy we can 't grow the regions we can 't increase business investment in our region and regions to the west and south of us if we don 't have those same sweeped links and we 're talking multivital for the comments mr chairman i support your recommendation and you and the notes that you put with it i will um i understand your passion for whatever perhaps i wanted to put a bit of bold typing somewhere i did send a quick note around this morning that to get a bit further along the track with this we significance to upgrade this transport corridor and because it appears that when you get a straight state significance declaration for your project things become a little bit more um intense on trying to deliver a program as the mayor said it 's been quite a few years the um former deputy premier uh member for lachlan armstrong he uh he 's glad he laid a committee it couldn 't be for 20 years the uh bells liner thing and i think the closest they 've come to improving is they did get some corridor acknowledgement of some corridor but um there 's a lot of other people talking about tunnels and so forth looking at these things but one thing that state government doesn 't seem to um look at but this is this issue is that is climate change and everyone knows i 'm a climate change skeptic but if i can use it to our benefit i might go there and um and this was quite just a climate change event where a massive east coast low created some uh some heavy water on the bells area and road and we 've been off the road again and undermined some of the area and um and there 's been railroads that have been the consequence over the last few years so be their wisdom if they want to use climate change they should perhaps they should look at what the possible events might come and this very important road link in the transport clinton corridor is um needs to be upgraded to be in front of these events plus also as council smith and others said that um to maintain development out of this area at present there 's this farm uh this farm um inputs being transported from newcastle and they go down an uptime highway they get carer this is not a road across the mountains to take the bigger vehicles that are allowed to be registered on on the state highways but some roads don 't carry them and just uh we 're in an awkward area to get you either going to go halfway to queensland to get to newcastle one way or go halfway south to melbourne to get to the other other for grain and plus imports with that i 'll uh support the recommendation thank you thank you councillor right anybody comment i 'd just like to say could i possibly i 've drove sydney back last week and it took like well over five hours there 's plenty of road works on the road but not not going to make a lot of difference to our travelling time i 've also there 's many times when we all go to sydney and the road is blocked because of accidents or the snow or the bush fires and uh it does actually really limit our ex our access to the city so i think this is a very good move and we should be pushing it as far as we can thank you thank you very much i just exercised to write a reply by just making a comment thank you support colleagues but one of the the terminologies we need to make sure we use is it 's not just about us getting access to sydney from the regions it 's about the regions getting access to through the city to to grow but also for their benefit if that can happen after the resolution failure against the cleric the committee general many recommendations the first one is the mayoral matter which is the right regard [Music] from the joint organisation board meeting i 'm happy to move that in i 'll second it councilman disgusted board at the council meeting i saw the candy meeting i need a question i 'll answer them otherwise i 'll put the resolution in favor all right against the cleric carrie general manager 's report number two which is remote attendance at meetings i 'm happy to move the recommendation but just with clarification of the general manager whereas if we were to support this the second paragraph would drop out is that what the intent is that that 's correct mr chairman the second paragraph in recommendation yes yes be replaced by the third paragraph with that clarification on do you have it speaking of you as you speak to again i i think this makes perfect sense that just is a reflection of times and we should be prepared to acknowledge speaker just to say that i think the the new second paragraph is um pragmatic and a good response to the discussions that we had at the committee meeting thank you for the comment although the declarative carrier number three is the three five five to be draft minutes of the audit risk and improvement committee councillor right i 'm happy to second that again this was discussed at the committee meeting anything else we need to add and you expect your accounts all right at all to my knowledge um there is business to you that will be rising from that meeting but that 's happened at the next meeting in july thank you any further comments that question i 'll put the resolution in favor against declare that one carry item four is the around three five five to many draft minutes and cary youth council and i 'm sure councillors principal would be happy to move that and i 'm sure counseling you 'll be happy to send that where are you thank you age 46 yes yes absolutely being part of my dad i had progressed just figured all council offenders [Music] i just i think um the value of the youth council was seen again today with the presentation we had had from the community university center type thing this was first brought up at youth council and generated interests within the community and um and they 're working for the um for the welfare of the youth and to bring the council on board with these ideas thank you thank you for the comment write a reply put the resolution in favor against declare carried item number five is the three five five committee minutes of the peace appellate committee who 's shown in chapter of the world peace belt council that 's an issue that 's been raised a number of times in the past particularly around the before and what might be able to be achieved at least to at least be assessed because it 's the unevenness of it how we would deal with that chapter had uh stirred a job since we were recognized uh through our contribution to world peace uh world friendship and all the rest of it and power which we need an ongoing uh committee to pass on the client in the history of the past but today in the future so i don 't think you know whether that 's your song that convenes that meeting in consultation with this chapter or whether it 's the deputy mayor or somebody that needs to have a rather regular thing thank you second uh thank you for the comment i 'll require just to say that this is going to be an interesting workshop and we hope that some very creative art students who will continue with their communities thank you the second we should speak for the comments thank you right thank you are you coming to our questions to speak at all that we were all very comfortable with the investments and the financial report they received a lot of our investments are grants and uh i think the world is when you become a responsible personal community um or spent um but there is other necessary money there for staff in uh staff on service lead and so forth and there is some money budget consensus but what it does highlight is this council more does said that the return on our investments is very small but even our recent loans are still higher considerably higher than what our investment money is and um where once we can generate a bit of money with these investments for now we are more or less just breaking even and it has been noted that banks haven 't driven an appetite for um for large amounts of money to to offer an incentive to invest there they just offer the minimum i have to business seems to be washing the wash with money in prison so we are suffering as uh as many of our ratepayers and residents are the money he got invested is worth a lot less than the money you 've got laura thank you for the comments right there the resolution of those in favor against birth carry by the number eight usually plan of management crown reserve 80087 council smith thank you second to please council better thank you council smith mr mayor this is i think the fourth plan of management of the recommendation represent an enormous amount of work on the part of the staff delving back into the original history of this area it 's as the others have been it 's very well researched very well put together and i have every confidence that when it does go to the crown for approval eventually that it will be approved but at the moment what we 're doing is voting too much other things put it out on public exhibition for a month and i hope everyone will have a look at all the work that has been done thank you cattle rock speaking of happy too you know council smith has discovered the reason why we 're doing it a bit often i 'm asked what do council workers do because i don 't i see them out doing what fixing roads or maintenance or so forth but this is highlighting what council and many businesses have to do now they 've they 've been looking after this facility this area of land and kept it in good order and everything for the duration of the life of to a legendary level they want this in-depth um management plan to sit on someone 's desk that might be looked at again but we 'll still be looking after the reserve thank you thank you thank you for your comments rodriguez the resolution i was in favor hi hi again carrie director of rival services care related environmental plan 2012 amendment number seven hello dad and thank you secretary councillor smith here 's your spokesman this was something that we had to do and it 's um on its way yeah we have to assist the paperwork same thing as councillor ryder said we just need to clarify a few things for the comments i 'm happy to make a very quick one that this is just a processing what a real long process it 's just reloading land at this point like some people get diffused from the stretch at that point it 's about resigning land gh can be their lodged inappropriate inappropriate manner and in due course but it just has no impact on that at all for the comments it 's one step and going ahead or if the um if it doesn 't and the park grows it 's got room to move into another area thank you i reply put the resolution i was invaded sorry coverage va thank you final number you decided to carry out a number 10 car access community business formerly in december 2020 and the 1st of march 2021. i 'm going to be happy to move those we 've got a second on this side of the room yeah yes thank you thank you mr chairman just respect briefly to lisa and particularly the minutes but but then also to acknowledge the sterling evidence from tracy paul who is been a very valuable member of that community since its inception and was now retired so it 's a problem that we do shouldn 't receive a little recognition from himself for her efforts she has been replaced but i think it 's it 's it 's sort of it 's unfortunate i think that it 's this takes this long from the end of the year because of so much chances around acknowledging that that service i to talk about these resolutions aren 't other than to report on today 's access committee meeting which there will be units obviously presented to the next committee meeting and then they 'll be adopted i 'm sure or discussed at that committee meeting and approved at the next council meeting but at that today 's meeting there was a couple of issues raised which we 'll talk about i 'll talk to the director about but um but the uh forces in their praise are that learning about the work that has long been carried out down at the neighbourhood center in the disabled parking down then they wanted to pass on their congress access community i think congratulate bruce because i think and and the other people that are on it because i think it 's doing a really really good job i 've just noticed so many things that have happened and changed and become more accessible to everybody including parents and grandparents and all sorts of things i think it 's a really important community and i 'm so pleased that it 's continuing in the the time that it 's doing and i i don 't think anyone realizes that that 's where it comes from so i just think thank you for that contribution i think it 's terrific thank you for the comment should i reply put the resolution on those in favor all right number 11 which is the natural resource management committee advisory committee i 'm sorry minute 17th of march 2021 i 'll get to move those i 'm going to move though i 'll move it take more second further years to kind of requires anybody else want to comment anybody smiling and watching this on the zoom these matters do get discussed and say to in comedian meeting quite quite substantially got to reply council remember i 'll put the resolution i was in favor oh against declared carrot item 12 is da 25 stroke 20 21 log dp 25308 one amy street recommendation for approval with conditions um the reason that this has has come to council is that the the carport is level with the front of the building and our dcp asks for it to certainly satisfied and i think councilors are satisfied that due to the nature of the carport as an open construction and due to the distance between the front of the building and the road there 's no adverse i 'll put the resolution in favor carrick against we 're carried unanimously five and third end of ga1 2021 what cnb of dp three eight six one seven four being ten keswick street smith street the recommendation for approval with conditions councillor fagan al sanchez councilman uh yes sister this was well um documented and showed an interesting anomaly of a small house on a tiny block and in the middle of town and it 's about filling in and making it means for development but also allowing people to change about these switches seems to be something that people want a smaller block with a smaller house and something what a bigger block for the dealer but this is a very uh good way of blocking it i 'll put the resolution i was in favour against carriage universally item number four dragon capital university center project council smith i from the country university centre just prior to this meeting and i thought it was interesting and informative and i was really pleased with the number of people from the general public and a number of people from the committee that 's been formed who came along to hear what was said and i think that they will go away convinced that there is a lot of support throughout the town and um shy for this and that it has a lot of merit so i 'm confident that we will at least be able to keep moving forward and certainly from what they said the the idea of getting another 100 or so people who live in this shire into tertiary study by this method is a really attractive one both for those young village and more elderly people themselves and for the amenity of the entity young people would jump at it and um it was great support from the community as council smith said and i think that is the background of this whole idea is the support from the community to make it work and i presentations coming to to smile about the demographics of the ages there was a couple of slides out there which indicated there were people probably in our age bracket that we 're doing anniversary courses council right yes mr chairman um i can see the need for this going forward even the president but even going forward the our community members can continually definitely go through a restructuring of their other employment quite often or of their life ambitions due to many things and often it means entering the education system again and it is heading towards these online courses or even the full-time course for the university now can only be 80 hours a week sometimes and the other 32 hours is supposed to be done studying and so forth it 's not face to face and people can travel to orange or battista and do that one day then come back here and have a part-time job and just live with their family and with this facility to help them do their study and get their assignments completed and so forth would be very beneficial and i i got the experience of university because their family haven 't_''_2177.599 been to university but things that doesn 't mean the same family haven 't_''_2182.0 been educated because there 's probably one generation back further than what we 're talking about at the moment but nursing is it wasn 't a um a university degree once there 's plenty of nurses out there that went through the old system and a lot of accounting bookkeeping type systems were i 've done with tafe and so forth that they 've become university degrees and there 's been some degrees created with the different forms of tourism and hospitality type businesses now and um and these can be accessed through an online thing that we 're getting back into study file might make this little bit of emphasis and what i also got out of this was today that the center will be made into a local group it 's not going to be managed by a um a larger group that 's trying to control the we 've been led to believe there are two key thanks to being awarded a country i think that that was demonstrated today and i thank councillors for their support the other one is a suitable venue and i think that 's our next challenge to find something that is of a minimum 300 meters square is what they need in town in a suitable place so we 've already done a lot of looking and we 'll do more and the only other thing i 'd say is that i 'm really pleased that councilman miller considers himself to be middle-aged i 'll put the resolution a conversation on what that legal entity might look like people manage your production as well that 's the committee recommendations done item number one from the general manager from page 54 of the ipads update number two the long game election coming out just a report there the recommendation so i hope you know where to rename the report i 'll do that thank you councilman thank you nothing to comment on this just there for information i will not comment that 's okay candidates are able to register now on the new south wales electoral commission website log on and become a you know get some information or straight away which i think is very handy because a lot of things happen and there 's a lot of timelines that everyone has to go to so i 'm encouraging anyone who 's interested to actually log on and register because i think that would be helpful and also the other thing i wanted to ask was uh the election um we haven 't got a venue it 's very difficult to find the media as we 're fighting with the education the country universities with other things i 'm involved in it 's very difficult to find a venue so hopefully we can find something that would be um suitable because i know it 's that 's a difficult job and i hope the general manager i know generator is all over it and he 's looking for a large venue for the um thank you people who are considering australian election please make yourself available these sorts of these sorts of updates as they come out and i know council will make those updates publicized available i know the general manager is also looking at and uh council or seminar potential council or seminars in the future which again will most certainly publicize as much as you possibly possibly can anybody who 's not sure what 's happening their phone numbers are all publicly partnered i think it 's important that you welcome nominations and encourage people i 'll give you a reply any further comments correctly about the um declared institution the postal voting world facing person voting institutions does that mean retirement just highlight also that the electoral commission will be conducting webinars for aspiring councillors and i think the first one is tomorrow night another one on thursday night another one in may about various things in terms of the procedure so i commend those to anyone who is interested for the comments by replying i 'd just like to say actually you have to take quite a lot of notice of these things because they come up on you very fast by the dates and the webinars and all of those things and the amount of paperwork you have to put in actually worth if anyone 's interested and i 'd love them to be we need to actually meet you on top of this because it goes very quickly thank you i 'll put the resolution in favor against you clearly carried over and i number two from the girl manager of the alcohol free zone thank you and it 's really about the second component of the recommendation yeah uh the intent of that is that it would almost support including it as part of the free stuff rather than just having to chat with them no i think that the intent of the second one given the confidential information we 've got today i think the intent my reading i hope that 's the way it will be framed if not is that we will have a conversation with the police and then come back to council about if in any part there is an issue around alcohol consumption and then we will go from there because i 'm also the understanding that there are there may be different rules and regulations that may apply to park lands as the basically existing suggestions and so the recommendation is not to do anything with that one but go and talk to the police about that and any other parks and as i said are there any compelling reasons to impose any regulation restrictions on any of the parks i 'm happy to with that explanation i 'd happy to move directly i understand this good thank you a second capture and i was certainly not supportive of it in that state because i felt that they did just move if there was a problem and moved it just another block or two from the main street into more residential parts of the town having read the report i think the statistics do support it there 's no doubt about that because the incident rewards of the alcohol related have dropped considerably and so i think it 's worth reintroducing it after the current stance would be the added one so i think that that 's fine and we should support it because we should get them dance through ten do all that sort of stuff so second component of the 't want to the general public at the moment is to think that we are going to make like a decision now on all of our parks and all of our stuff because we haven 't got the evidence in order to support them around that one really what you 're saying is exactly correct but i think everybody would be the same page second would you speak yes mrs [Music] often this is not we 're not trying to restrict the people in enjoying their social entertainment it 's just ensuring that if things happen that the police use laws that they 've got something with this alcohol free zone to back up their um the healing of a situation and i think it 's unusual to watch the evening years or something and there 's not something alcoholic related with behaviour or something after a sporting event or party or whatever and i think this is just good management for our residents of care i 'm having trouble to find led rightly drive i know i 'm old enough i should know where it is but i can think that should be the lachlan valley hotel is it since it had a name change another trade under lvh but it [Music] the map the map is not intended to indicate the proposed area that 's the current area yeah it says the entire length of land whiteley drive so that 's the road up to the japanese goat yes mr chancellor it 's the road from um to the lookout yesterday can nakajima place is the one that heads off to the japanese garden so if people are drinking on that road it comes up on that on that road in any car park associated with that right thanks very much thank you thank you red liner as i said i think that the statistics speak for themselves i think that i suppose it beats the question of why we have to re-advertise and reintroduce rather than to speed up one of our renewal is just sitting in the radar or put assured rather have to go back through the process again and have but that is what it is and it 's just as i say the free zone it does limit some of the behaviour that anti-social behaviour but i disagree with our secondary and the fact that i think we are restricting the use we are restricting sort of by imposing this uh this other free zone area that 's what whatever you want to spend without your restrictions yeah i 'll put the resolution i was in favor uh carry on number one of the uh to the regular corporate services and we have the quarterly budget review statement recommendation there that that we adopted the council um [Music] the third quarter variation shows a deterioration overall of something over 4 million that 's normal it 's the third quarter and there will be further revisions before the end of the financial year nonetheless the revised estimate for our budget is that we will end the year with a surplus of over 14 million which sounds great most of that surplus is of course tied to various funds and it 's not money that council is at liberty to splash around unfortunately despite the the deterioration for good and sufficient variation of reasons we this year and into the future next year second speech i don 't think i can add anything more to councillor smith 's very good review of the budget situation i 'm quite happy to support both of you and the comment council of smith is making these sorts of variations are normal it doesn 't mean the council 's putting away 40 million dollars far from it it doesn 't they say council 's had a had a hit in some respects and reformed it and well i 'm sure a lot of the issues in terms of keeping the methodology of accounting council is in a very very strong financial position i acknowledge the work done by senior staff but there are some areas where budget fluctuations are are evident and for example i pick on one which is the million-dollar decrease in water consumption maybe maybe because of the breaking the drought that there 's an impact which can have can happen on boaters from time to time further comments right reply but the resolution was in favor against declarative carry now go to okay which is committee i 've known you from the director of corporate services for the recommendation sorry that we know um any comments or questions just that they 've had some interesting exhibitions and people thank you very much directors happy with this for the comments question is this was this discussion the um [Music] operations traffic committee draft members of the traffic committee some recommendations mr children before i move those that i 'm planning to move those i must say that i it can be recommendations to the council from this community because i don 't think it was represented happening council obviously was his counselor i just wonder how we proceed with this because i think it 's quick without a report at this stage i just wonder whether we should but i won 't be difficult about this because it is representation at the committee was a like withdrawal if you look but he did provide written responses to all of the items so if you 'd like the three of the statutory members have voted on all the items all of the items that were the recommendations or somewhere later organs all of the items were on the agenda which [Music] talk just a little bit of these about how we proceeded there is a a special instrument council meeting in the fortnight attempt to deal with the budget operational plan um there may be a va on that as well so if you 're of a mine too i 'm not sure if the urgency is around this but if you 're of mine your council 's before it will be handled so we scan this matter over to gendered item on the children councilman in the 10th yes you don 't be that specific and maybe just if that 's just no note the recommendations because it may be [Music] and i think we need to have something to say we 're considered in a perfect way i think you 've probably explained your rationale have you gone a bit further i think unless there are other questions i think that 's i hope i 've been very clear or muscled i 'm not trying to be difficult to think there is a procedure i is really fun everybody so [Music] hopefully the 10th of may but if there 's other issues where they have to reconvene for technical reasons and probably reasons then it may be not able to convene that meeting although it can be electronically uh by that time frame so it would be the first of those opportunities interesting questions quite obviously the woodstock um dance that day thing happened yesterday the stanford struck they want their things to be held on the 14th start commencing the 14th a few days after that and again in june for road closures if we defer this and we don 't well the extent would still be able to get their days on it or it 's going to be coming through from this traffic committee to the um approved mr mr chairman my view on that as chair of the committee is that um it 's very clear that the discussions have been happening and it 's it 's something that happens year in year out and it would it 's a procedural issue rather than girls that would be able to proceed ago okay that 's right i 'm saying that same thing respectively i just asked the question the reason we 're deferring or noticing this report is because there was not a call and attending the traffic committee because it 's a statutory communion it 's got specific memberships so what i i 'm suggesting is that we actually say that because um i think you know otherwise it 's rather confusing to just say that we know this report due to the fact that well normally we can 't put recommendations up unless we have a quorum that goes through a community deport so i i suggest we actually explain why we 're noting the report and deferring the recommendations um a recommendation to stances general manager obviously you could add the report and seek clarification on the formality of the meeting no i yeah i 'm happy with that i just think we need to know why we 're doing it because otherwise it looks like we are actually stallings yeah [Music] the capacity is there for traffic committee to meet electronically a lot of phone or bikes happy with the resolution comments in question i 'll reply but the resolution is in favor mr chairman just to apply for the resolution that 's why i just want to apologize i actually didn 't get to read until this afternoon otherwise i 'm smoking to the director um yes mr mayor this comes to council because um it contravenes the dcp which we have in nash it 's proposed to be located six meters from uh i forget which boundary it is rather than the uh the 20 meters that we recommend and of course the reason for the 20 meters is so that in an agricultural area it 's away from any spraying disturbance that sort of thing but also so that we don 't have houses that are too close together and we don 't have privacy issues i think it 's been well justified that to move the dwelling further back from the boundary would put it right in front of a shed so that it would be well located would impact on the views and that i think the nearest house is over 100 use of agricultural equipment and chemicals in that particular area so i think it 's been well researched well well-assessed and that we should pass it uh i agree with all council since uh and this is going well as i said she said well um well assessed and uh we 're in the middle of a large rural block and i feel that um this is not going to be a problem or an issue for anybody and we have it has been publicized and received no no submissions so i will agree that it 's actually in the right space for the comment write reply put the resolution on it in favor all right against your carried there are no date reports any notices of motion matters of urgency we will then move to confidential papers oh the reason is that would have disclosed for a commercial event a person with whom council is conducting or proposing to conduct a business secondly 1082 v of the act from the retroproper services subject is request for water account adjustment assessment number 75260 and the reason personal parts of any same which is 10 a 2 b of the act the director of corporate services the reason the subject sorry is a subject sorry is a request for water account adjustment assessment number one three seven five five and the reason is personal margin let me know of any resident or rate payer and then we have one from the director of infrastructure operations which is 1082 d1 of the act and the subject is the cara water treatment plant extension again the commercial reason is commercial information for confidence that would have disclosed prejudice and commercial position of the person has supplied it and the lucky last one is the requiem structure operation which would also be under 10 to d1 of the act and the reason it 's the um the villa mario bought the brewing development 1001 stroke 2021 and the reason is that commercial information to a confidential nature that would be disclosed recruited as a commercial position of the person who supplied it i remember that proposal thank you councillor smith resolution to go to the closed caption against carried the going to close council _"

questions on those selfish planetary resolutions in favor right against declarative carrying the second office the confirmation of these minutes of the extraordinary meeting held 10th of january 2022 council delta council with this thank you any comments or questions on those assignments from children accurate record i 'll put the resolution on those in favor against i would be clear we will now go to page 22 of the ipads and there 's a recommendation there that 32 28 28. following council dates and i would just suggest that i 've indicated earlier today that we changed the february date and monday the 21st of february did that suggest a change i want to move those days to your doctor thank you council thank you yeah thank you any comments or questions on those colleagues here from what you find if i 'm going too quickly with is the central west draft central western iran regional transport plan i think there 'll be some comments on this i would like to suggest if someone 's having to move this that we might add a dot point which should be six that would include the corridor of the lachlan valley way connecting what thank you councilman to speak yes i do actually that 's um something that was missing out of this report that we we have in front of us this is a very large report and i 'm sure everybody 's ready makes life a lot easier thank you um i think that uh that hume the hume connection is very important to us and it has been neglected and left out of this report i do think this is a large report and most people would have read it but it is quite detailed and then covers a glad area but i don 't think it actually connects us with other regions and i 'd be interested to hear and it will be good if this we have a presentation from transport new south wales fits in new south wales because we haven 't actually there 's no real connections with other regions such as the canberra hume highway and other outside this area and it 'd be really interesting to find out how they feel about us in the centre of things and looking at other opportunities there is i am a bit concerned over the information about the modal transport hub transporting people by bus to larger centres which i think would be a detriment to our local town and i 'd like to keep an eye on that as well as as other things i do think too this transport plan is more about seems to be more about moving people around rather than freight and i think that our freight movements are probably much more important than our people movement and i i tend to think that we 've actually they 've overlooked it they talk about you know walking and cycling and things whereas we know we really need to know i can 't see a site me cycling to orange or bathurst so i 'm not quite sure how that we actually need to look at as a local strategy and we do it already but i think that this is actually a bigger plan this is too you know it does talk about cycling and i think that 's probably a little bit too much focus on that when we 're actually talking about a regional plan and i would like to see more things um uh more ideas about how the freight movements around our town how it break where it comes from and where it goes to and we are a manufacturing centre and a lot of a lot of freight comes in and a lot of frag goes out and we have no idea where that goes and this seems to be there seems to be about passengers rather than the the real crux of the matter which is trucks pulling in freight taking out freight and also where they go and i think it should be more aligned to the port strategy because we need to know where our freight goes to the ports so outside this region i think we need to connect think it has some information that 's quite um quite all right but i do think it 's uh it actually has a lot of things that actually don 't um don 't uh don 't line up with how we feel and it 'd be great to have somebody here we can express those things to them i think there is a lot of detail about the cycles and the pedestrians and things which probably we 've i think two details but that 's my opinion um they also they talk about seasonal weather events disrupting our corridors um and i think we can have a really good case to push for the um the new bridge across the river because it has been very disruptive in the last you know five six years we 've had massive times when long times when the bridge under the bridge has been cut off so we do have a problem there and this does talk about that and i think this gives us a great opportunity to actually highlight that to them that we need desperately need a new bridge crossing getting from people across the river um so i just that 's my take on it um but so i 'll just leave it at that and say um we i 'm really looking forward to bringing these all these matters up with the transport for new south wales person when you 've heard when when they turn up and uh and hopefully everyone else will have a bit of a chance to look at it again and come up with some new ideas as well thanks mr secondly is crucial in us building tower as a town and it builds us as abrasion we have as council faker said have all experienced the pain of having the word level not functional over the summer and it 's really highlighted how much traffic comes through our town and despite the fact that this does focus a lot more on the transport of individuals and how they engage in society that it 's very useful to have that in power we need to have the height the heavy people bypass are we needing to have the second crossing for the locker so they can enjoy our town because it is a barrier um so people getting that when the sale of um and the loud trucks is coming through we can 't actually enjoy our mainstream that drives people away from taking part in those places so uh yeah i 'd like to set the promotion um by council of vegan to get a chance to thanks mr mayor i agree with what both councillors have said i i have firstly a question perhaps through you to the general manager and then a comment about a possible addition to our submission and the question is when this plan and the next plan come into force what are do they become mandatory for councils or are they advisory and guides as to best practice so i think the best response to that is that there 's a state government plan so they 're not a council plan and the overarching objective for counseling is to get any projects that our council wishes to progress into this plan and so it 's not really an issue of what appears in the final plan that 's not in the plan well it 's particularly the ones that we 're talking about that we would hope would be state government owned assets such as bypass or the second bridge crossing it 's it 's imperative that they plan for those finds their way into this plan thank you um and although i don 't agree with council a lot that there 's anything along with the smell of sheep manure in industry i i do think it 's time that we started working on pushing our heavy vehicle bypass again along with the rest of things my suggestion and i guess question if you like is whether it would be appropriate in here to put something regarding electric vehicle charging stations i know that the next regional plan talks a lot about that but this is the transport plan and i think um if i can flip forward to the next plan it does talk about um wanting on major routes um an electric vehicle charging station every 100 kilometers and so on but if we 're going to be looking seriously at net zero of this decade creating council vehicles electric and so on we 're going to need a lot of electric vehicle charging stations and i just wonder whether it would be appropriate to put that in this in our wish list just a comment mr chairman that there 's no requirement to put every every initiative your mind to including the submission this is just the key elements that we 've already got on the account of agenda that has been put forward we have two months to put to the submission and whilst we will ask for representative transport for new south wales county there 's no guarantee that so really what i am after some considered responses from councillors in the coming weeks to help form a submission and and yet clearly that that would form part of the submission in the united states [Music] [Applause] accurate that we the report was presented to the j.o board meeting 25th of november and transport were very amenable they did put an 18th of february data and they were very amenable as a result of something happened earlier in the meeting minimal to move their time frame back to march and so the relationship with transport very good and i think and the general manager said an opportunity to add other things to it as we go forward and the other problem missing here is if we start talking about the bigger picture of planning is around the connectivity between the airsports across the mountains all those other areas but also the connectivity within a region so how people can how kara can be a very vibrant place to live and people still have access to health facilities in orange or wherever they need to be traveling so there 's a real conversation around that um the other one with was presented that day was the iran central restaurant plan a planning to put it bluntly back on an absolute vlogging because they presented the report he came out the database and they said we want feedback by february and everybody 's gone like the elections christmas new councils ridiculous and they just said that 's our timeline so that 's more difficult to deal with which is the next report read both these reports i couldn 't get over that the assumption on both reports is that care is a spoke not a hub which is the rule then they spoke about public transport to orange there is none and i i think they 've just mentioned this as a matter of courtesy that they haven 't thought and that to me is a great concern when you look at the other document when they 're talking about how the regional center is growing and no real consideration to how the region grows around and i know we 're digressing the city 's going to predict the ground by 2.7 million people in that thing that kind of parks projection figures with any time so there 's a real anyway i 've managed to digress and i 'm sorry colleagues councilman thank you i 'm the man i fully support this recommendation um the key elements listed in the recommendation that need to continue to be advocated for and as a counsellor we 're all here to do this we 're all in very important issues and i would like to continue to raise the profile of these issues both the second crossing of the lachlan river in cara and a heavy vehicle bypass at kendall street i feel are the communities top priorities for the lga and they certainly were loud and clear in our current election and both of those seeing those projects move forward would benefit not only the whole carrot lga its residents but also visitors and those that use those areas to go where they need to go covert 19 has certainly changed people 's mindsets and as a result people are looking to relocate from as we 're all aware from our larger cities into our regional areas to go hand in hand with that populations are increasing which is not quite what 's been reported in the reports in front of us but it 's important for our livability of our regional areas and our connection of our regional areas to be as best as they possibly can moving on um recommendation two we mentioned about um having a workshop specifically with councillors i think it 's absolutely vital after the election many many new councillors elected and as a result i think it would be vital for us as councillors to be given the opportunity to attend a workshop whether it is here in cara or on a regional platform i would be most interested to um to attend that and represent our community needs directly to the government organisations thank you for the comments of course um just a bit of clarification [Music] i presume the second crossing for the river is a new low level crossing the heavy vehicle bypass of kendall street will also need a bridge across to lockland so there will be another bridge i just wonder if we need to clarify we might be looking for two bridges not just one i is has been the leading level crossing rather than bridge rather than london which is well through the places just to add to a couple of things and thanks everyone for support um keep this i think it 's really important that we actually follow through and the update statistics it 's from 2016 we 're about to be released in abs so i are actually very old um and the things that transition last four or eight months and that there is and we 'd be very pleased to take on um more information um about this follow-up just hopefully we 'll get somebody to come and talk to us or back in the workshop somewhere thank you i 'll put the emotional favor against from declaring carry line 3.3 sorry [Music] [Music] if you do just whiz back to the table of contents and hit that item on the table of contents and it will hyperlink you through to the report that makes you sure absolutely yeah anyways how did we get there 113 um i i certainly concur with um dot points one and two on the recommendation and with your earlier comments that the the timing of this release is unfortunate to say the least i actually read most of it um and i thought it 's it all sounds very good and very positive it 's very easy to say it 's a lot harder to follow through with the strategies and and the actions that are indicated and and councils will certainly need financial support if they 're trying to implement some of this so i hope that the state government is willing to put their money where their mouth is so to speak i think that there are a lot of opportunities for our council in here um talks about um recycling and low-carbon initiatives and since our council is committed to a pathway to net zero 2050 that 's something that we really need to work on and i 'm wondering reading in the media things like the recycling or upcycling large scale plant that was planned for the southern highlands that is objected to down there by a lot of residents who think that the placement of it is wrong i 'm wondering if if council could put their hands up and say that we 've got an extensive industrial zone here why not look at bringing it here or other such initiatives that would fit with the many concepts here about not only that there 's quite a bit of talk about parks and the inland rail in this and parts of special activation us as well i was very pleased to see that the inland rail is going to be complete by 2026 although somewhat surprised but anyway i think in terms of our connectivity to the world we need to look at ourselves being quite a hub with all the different highways that converge here and being a number of our larger manufacturers in the past have said that this is an ideal place in terms of how well located it is to all the large population centres on the eastern seaboard particularly it 's it 's something that we can perhaps utilize to keep progressing the industries that we have here particularly manufacturing and to look at attracting new ones but also to look at our connection with parks perhaps looking at somewhere like our railway station there 's an intermodal hub that could convey things to that inland railway and so on so in short i like the concept i think there are possibilities for us in it but i think the devil is in the detail in the future if i could it does mention in here a fast i mean it doesn 't put it in it doesn 't only the transport plan so i 'm not i 'm slightly confused about whether they actually think there 's going to be a fast rail um maybe we should clarify that you know does mentions it quite a few times the fast fast rail from sydney but it actually doesn 't mean you 're doing the transport plan so i 'm a bit confused um the other thing is that um there does that talk about um housing affordability and diverse and inclusive housing and abandoned buildings and i 'd like to i know it says larissa 's job but um it does talk about we have a an abandoned building in the main street in cara and there needs to be some sort of relationship with planning about how we deal with disbanded buildings and owners who fail to act on their on their buildings especially in the cbd because it does talk about the use of um abandoned building reusing and repurposing sites and things and i 'm not quite sure how whether they actually do something so it would be something that we could maybe stress that we need some further action or some activity about that um the population numbers again are not um not up to date and i think that 's a really big problem with this when we get to our little bit at the end um what number was it paul you pointed it out where we talk about cara um i think we can probably update that slightly and go back to them with an updated version of again again it was an afterthought i think yeah we look like we 've just come suddenly said oh well we need to actually talk about all these different towns in this and these are what we think they 'd like to see so um i think we could um add to that quite substantially i think it 's it 's very long it 's right at the bottom a bit about every town um location specific and um okay keeps going um yes so i there is a bit about um sorry a little bit further on gosh there is a include it talks about the emerging aviation sector and kara airport i 'd like to include if we could an educational centre because we 're talking about educational centres and this is about planning so i think we need to talk about a new um that we 're talking about the education foundation so we need to probably include that and also um help tourism i mean we have large tourism potential and section and i think we probably need to identify that as something that we 're actually quite good at and also instead of the sustainable growth of cara 's health dicta we could really do with a modern health facility i think more than a sustainable growth of our health center so i think we could reword that and go back with that with more information and more secure just a secure water supply and definite involvement in decision making around that process would be i think we need to get a bit stronger if that 's we can do that if i need to comment on what i 'm hearing and what i 'm seeing around write to the minister especially our concern and to seeking for a workshop i think that everybody is keen to get a workshop and understand injected out his work definitely i think i 'm picking up the vibe that nobody thinks is a great document and we should be just ticking it off and moving forward so i think that they 're the two sailing points that came out of recommendation that we could spend probably a whole session going through immensely i think we tend to forget the big picture here is that a lot of the a lot of the population growth is in metropolitan that 's prediction some will be in rural regional areas but department of planning figures and documentation gets used by developers and government and government bodies in terms of our development dollar gap so it puts us behind the overall that 's the bigger picture in my mind so i think that what i 'm really gonna train you i 'm not telling you to make sure that what i 've seen by the train to do is fully agree with not a out and explain it to you any further comment on that category um i just find it uh a lot of inaccuracies um on a map on page 151 i think it is it 's got a circle around dubbo munchie in that [Music] [Music] a rail floor is a feasibility investigation the railway line 's already there to maintain it so it was feasible and they 're going to go into disrepair and i can 't see why they should be looking at it as something new that i should look after what they have and it 's been said before about the bathurst orange dubbo plans and that 's where they want the growth to happen there was a victorian mayor on the abc the other night talking and said kobe is the best de facto decentralization activity that 's ever happened and i think we need to hit the planning department transport department they need to go back to square one and um and look where it 's going you reported the other night that the houses in cairo increased 38 in the last 12 months so left when they build more and i think it just needs we need to go back to square one and forget about 2016 and work all together and because orange is running out of land and uh mathis received keep expanding on anything and um 4.1 which is on page 235 which is housekeeping release your council decisions so i 'll a direction that we release the institution to search practically after the meeting not the reports it 's the mayor to sign off and release those decisions the general manager co-signs that it comes to council for information and the normal practice also i 'm sure the record taken out of the normal practice also is that when these documents are signed off councillors are informed so if anybody in the community asks you what you do you free them to talk about the council decision as per the recommendation you still have to be careful about the report that 's the process this goes out because it 's going to output it out firmly in the public arena on to page 4. sorry 4.2 page 239 which is report colleges comes to us every month gives us his information on a monthly basis any comments or questions on this we 'll be able to put a column beside the investments and the liabilities um on loans of what they were the previous month so we can see if there 's any change [Music] station but we 're going to stump up that money and we seem to be holding their own pretty well and we 've got money in the bank account and they 're ready in the on-call account so that so so you 're after movement of cash or large cash well if there 's one if one investment comes up for its term then when we don 't invest it we used into general funds we get notified that being effectively cashed out that should be different i 'll check the finance and see what we can do we can come back it would be as per the the due date column there so you know we don 't have a policy of uh paying loans out earlier due to the terms of our loans pay out early so the due date column there would be those loans would would be finalized but if we created homes we can see when they [Music] it 's also budgeted for in our long-term financial plan that you see a report thank you anybody got any questions i 'd suggest because it 's chemically difficult to start with give the regular ring absolutely the other one we look at quite closely regularly here 's page 2. so 245 which is just a rate collection comparison to tell you that the investments are most of those investments are the money that we said grant money that we receive so it 's they 're not money that we can spend it 's already tied up in other funds and grant money and so it 's yeah we have to spend it when we do grant projects but it 's a lot of it is just grant money or investments for and now in our funds our sewerage and water and other funds that we have to keep separate and that so that we don 't have that money to spend also that the rate pegging our rate revenue is important every time to make sure that we actually reach that very special figure of 10 um less than 10 rate of revenue in at the end of the year and it 's always a bit of an interesting line that just bounces around a little bit but generally it 's pretty good so we 're lucky that we have very good great pace all right for the comments right reply you can 't abstain from voting your local government notions are carried on the majority [Music] and we assume that 's the case i post the cable don 't worry um page 248 which is regardless in regards to the anti-doing your review of the local government tribunal will be beginning racial tribunal so i want to move that or something different councillor thank you i 'm checking the please thank you thank i think it 's self-explanatory very interesting for a new counsellor um and i 'll leave the two of the fellow counsellors in the room to provide feedback on the fourth of february by the way council of people living in rural remote areas if you 're a member of the orange city council you 'll get a quite considerable sitting feed and remember the cara council and they seem to want to have meetings in orange and baptist and dubbo where we 're all in one sitting feed and our expenses and it would be variable that um you know ignore your enumeration will be the same as wherever you were elected and you can go back and argue about the number of people that they represent in that world orange has got a few more councils it 's just traveling distance the ability to get hooked up to uh communications and we make the same decisions as all these other councils on water and sewerage and roads and roads and keep people happy and i 've sent this in before and wanted to take them to the anti-discrimination front here or whatever they have and i 've had much success there is um is people charging more for his school holiday rentals as uh in one time that 's discriminating against people who 've got bit far and it 's always in these bigger areas where they have more money they pay them more money and that gives them more money to run their political campaigns and [Music] they get a larger illumination [Music] anyway that 's what i think yeah just be careful yeah given the reason why i 'm important yeah that 's one way of looking at it i guess colleagues we we do regularly like expressing concern about the methodology i 'm not sure that your medical do so again and i would be suggesting that you do do talk to the general manager about it if you 've got any concerns issues primarily we are considered to be part of ideas part of that is fine but the flip side of that is if you are looking to attract people who are earning 50 bucks an hour or something in the commercial world then how much volunteering can they be really should be expected to do given the time that is required to be a good council in the community so there 's a real a real balance act there way um so talk to the gentleman put in your ring we 'll give you sorry the director passes up there and let them know what you 're thinking please write reply i 'll put the resolution in favor against declare carry on 4.4 page 267 which is the ipad rate thing who wants to have the value on this one which one which are that 's fine thank you very much for this um i also like to add another point another recommendation that we actually or increase the number of people we write to and the amount of agitation that we conduct over this it 's just appalling it 's actually disastrous for us and for those councils in new south wales i don 't know where these people get their ideas from but it 's completely so we 're suggesting we 're suggesting we add i 'm suggesting we had definitely the minister of the local government definitely the local government new south wales definitely the shadow minister for local government as well as our local member is that enough i think anyone else is as i mean i i 'm not sure where local governor south wales is on this i haven 't heard anything i haven 't seen anything 's the first i saw of this that we 're actually just being pounded by 0.7 is the most ridiculous when was the last time we got such a small small rate notice i it 's normally at least 2 or 1.9 i think a 1.7 at one stage but this is just dreadful um and this will put us back for years and years and years and i i can 't see anybody any other council taking on as well even the ones who are getting more money they 're all in sydney um you know for regional australia new south wales this is a disaster um it doesn 't take into account they 're going to pay people for population growth um we may get some population growth but they keep telling us we 're not going to get population growth so they 're telling us one thing and then they 're taking away the other like they 're telling us we 're great this but you know but you can 't have any money because you 're not going to have any population growth so it 's ridiculous um i don 't know we 've got a population we need to maintain and improve what we already have so i can 't see how that how that actually sets up um it 's crazy the plans are i they came up with this uh livability factor what 's the lgci it is called the stands for something and they get a basket of things like electricity um like all the costs that we 've had to maintain such as insurance employment and wages and they 're saying that they 're not they haven 't gone up very much and everything else electricity water sewage and fuel has gone down well i don 't know where they live but it 's not in our shire and i don 't think it 's in new south wales and i 'm really really annoyed about that because it just it doesn 't make any sense i just i don 't think this whole report 's rubbish we can and make sure that they understand that we can 't can 't_''_2874.64 cope with this it 's not going to it 's going to leave a huge hole in our budget and it 's really not good enough there you go it 's not as though we 're going to be able to say to employees no you can 't have a 2.5 percent wage increase because we don 't have funds and so on and so on it is as council of davis as a disaster and it 's something that i 'm sure we will take up with the lg nsw conference and and i hope that it 's going to be a really big discussion there it seems to me just another way that the state government thinks that they can claw back some of the money they 've spent during the pandemic perhaps from small regional and rural councils who won 't be able to fight back but i say we fight ladies and gentlemen you further comments thank you i fully support this recommendation too i think i think this report is alarming will have a decrease of over 6 million in revenue that 's an alarming amount of money of loss of income i know paying rates is not the most fun thing to do for people but it is one way that we get all the services that we need for our residents here it 's going to affect all residents of the lga so i suppose i ask you know going forward if we 're going to be losing up to 6 million over the 10 years of the financial long-term financial plan is you know from from a community 's perspective which service or project and infrastructure are our residents willing to forego if this recommendation continues looking at the table seen in the report it looks like all the lgas are going to be in strike across the across new south wales there are only six councils that have a new ratepay over two percent and in the past if we were if we were scheduled for 2.4 there 's only six that 's crazy so where do we go from here um obviously larger councils um have car parking land development um and there 's other ways i suppose our best way forward is grants and um funding so if this is to be um to go forward it 's something that i think the council will need to look at is expanding our grants and funding division immediately um to make up this six million dollars that we potentially may lose and whatever those projects and services might look like going forward thank you um it seems like um the elections you know it will cost us 124 thousand dollars we couldn 't increase the rates as much this year because they let us charge more last year to pay for the election is that right to remove the additional revenue in the 2122 rate paid to meet the costs of the 21 local government elections it seems um we 've got to make that money put away every every this is difficult um to a certain extent because as council delbay said um no one likes paying rates and a lot of our rate payers are on fixed income or a pension and they 're all the time and then expect our residents to pay it because we 're the only business when they send out a rate notice the person getting the notice can 't_''_3157.839 say no i 'm going to pay for info rates is there cheaper and um did i expect cara 's service and i 'm i 'm sort of being on both sides of the fence here but it 's quite obvious that they 're using a different cost standard to work out what things are and i support the recommendation going forward that we must also look at our budget and whether we can make changes in our budget to do things harder and cheaper or whatever not just add the two percent on and keep doing what we get what we always do and [Music] grants might not be the answer because even those bigger cities that did get more money increase they they approximately 14 million and that 's about what our wage [Music] wage bill is so we 're looking for our other rates and charges from silver and water and other activities that we can to help balance the budget so it is a worrying time whatever happens thank you for the comments i think that kind of commented on that very quickly i think the grants commission has gone to town march some time to talk to us look if it was an industry or business and you 're getting restricted by the amount of money you can get as a revenue revenue base and someone are telling you 're going to take a bit less and the real cost of doing business you don 't have to be a rocket scientist to work out that 's not so i think to be opposing this and raising those concerns about the possibility of chemistry appropriate the appropriate way to go we can 't change it to some extent but we need to make sure we heard about and our objections are clearly completely natural issues and just for interest for the perspective of the newer councillors i think the point council would build our neighbors that no one 's like paying rates we don 't like probably setting rates however you want services you got to be a payoff or a balance there somewhere but of the rates taxes and levies raised in the nations and federal government picks over 84 state government it 's about i think about those states the fed 's bid over 80 percent of the state 's around 14 local government get about 3 so we don 't collect anywhere near the revenue that other legal levels of government so when they give us a grant and they want to sign a check and cut a ribbon which actually great part of money they 're giving back to us in some form or not so yeah further comments i 'd reply you know by spending our rate rate money on improvements and parks and gardens and sewerage and water and all the things that we 've been doing and we do well with you know enough money to make it work then we 've increased our value of our town i mean the value in general is all the rates in all of the towns in regional new south wales have gone up quite dramatically in the last two is being reflected in the prices of houses and real estate so we have increased dramatically the valuation and the stamp duty on that goes to the state government it doesn 't come to carer so we really would be should be asking for some of that increased valuation back to us that everybody 's increased their value of their land and the houses so the statute that goes should be you know tied some way to the fact that we 're actually making more money for the government by improving facilities it 's a rather bad way of putting it but it actually i think makes sense thanks i think i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against declared carrying out the 4.5 is the youth council appointments the council smith will move there councillor bilbo thank you councillor smith you need to thanks mr mayor as i said to previous council this was the largest number of new applicants we had had for youth council and my opinion of the ones we interviewed was that they were almost uniformly a really highly credentialed lot it was some of them to try and keep numbers reasonable so i look forward if these nominees are endorsed to a really good year for youth council starting off of course next month with the 10-year anniversary thank you thank you i think this is a great initiative congratulations to all the nominees who have been appointed i look forward to seeing what they achieve in 2022 and their own self-development from these roles and for those who did not make the appointment to keep trying continue to serve your community as best as you can thank you page 285 is the adoption of sport sporting rent plan there 's a recommendation there and adoption with two dollar points to it and so i 'll move that or something different can i ask a question i 'm happy to move it but i would like to ask a question that covers maps for facilities on leased crown lands is that what we we 've talked about that before and it 's like having the tennis club and the jockey club and harness racing because we 're not doing that what does yeah i 'll get a movement a second and answer the question and the question is the math does that recommendation to involve those groups no that 's why it specifically says council managed crown lands okay so to keep with that scope of the whole plan which is about council owned or controlled assets yeah okay this was some questions and just to explain that there 's this is all council run facilities which is fine but i 'm over the mind of there is other sporting facilities and other groups and organizations to maintain sporting facilities on behalf of council and i have a bit of an idea that we probably should have somewhere include them in this strategic plan that was specifically excluded right so that 's fine no it 's always something i thought we would include eventually but anyway that 's fine i 'm happy it doesn 't stop council talking appreciation points to chair that the fundamental reason for this plan is probably the the one missing strategic plan that the council has not had for quite some years so when the grant applications no there 's no adopted priorities for account for council owned or controlled sport and recreation assets so that was the fundamental reason it might be the council there 's a fundamental reason for this plan as the mayor has indicated still regularly assisting organizations such as the golf club tennis club showground trust others in putting in the grant applications but this is very much about providing some direction to council and to council staff in terms of the options for no actually the general manager has given a very good explanation of why we have this thank you thank you for the comments um i will there 's just a couple of areas in some of the pictures so i 'm second with some changes to be made with the west carol oval number 10 one of those is an amenities block not a shed there is 12 at the park which is the canteen and amenities block um for junior league um not a triathlon storage area um and then the eight well that 's the cola i understand the colder to be a covered outdoor learning just with those minor changes with those things that are labeled incorrectly i think the mood was happy to have those in between yeah absolutely and i think cheryl you might give us an email any further comments on the plan thank you i just want to thank people for um participating with their submissions to council i believe the council did an excellent job in placing this out on public exhibition and thank you to all the staff involved in that for those who have provided submissions there are other strategic plans that can be used to capture this information in particular the rail trail um he 's kind of mentioned a couple times and it 's something that i probably would like to see in the destination management plan going forward through the local tourism incorporation thank you uh suggested there was some people that put in submissions which were very gratefully received and we 've adopted a few of those changes in the plan and also there are some other matters that will be brought up in other ways and in other committees so that 's great for the resolution i was in against carry on 4.8 is the donation woodstruck memorial hall recommendation ever have done for donations memorial show we 'll go to 4.7 which is the woodstock show a leisure amount so what a recommendation make a donation to the doctor society thank you councilman i think your counselor any comments or questions on this it says that um basically they 're looking for money to pay the fee what fee license fee who gets the money and for what license so through uh through the chair the fee relates to council 's fee for uh occupying the facility that 's council speaking right here as well crowd land license fee further comments robert necessarily put the recommendation i was in favor against declaring carried um alligator 4.8 in my mind and the donation was down dollars to the woodstock small halls my regulation is that we have done this before um this will be the fourth or fifth small halls music festival um to be held in the woodstock uh soldiers memorial hall and they 're a great i highly recommend coming out international act and straight an act of australian renown and supporting acts as well this year because of code instead of the over 200 seats that would normally be able to be sold in the hall they 're only selling 100 a little over 100 so there 's less revenue coming in they have to guarantee to the small halls organization a revenue of 3 000 and then on top of that anything that 's made is kept and they try to keep the tickets down fairly well so this will really help them with the break-even and hopefully make good money further comments i just want to congratulate the woodstock community on hosting such a fantastic event and applying for funding under this new area for council of festivals and special events i think it 's the community assistance program um that 's exactly what this was designed for so congratulations on being one of the first thank you any further comments i heard the comments replied probably mr sherry reports and we do have an opportunity for nurses sorry about information or motions community and the princess and council of faith will then move to the chamber that we accept that as the council of urgent matter emergency as well i 'm sure council of what nodding ahead so she will second that off with the procedural motion that we accept that as a motion emergency and we deal with the matter but they 're all those in favor against deter carried now council of faith can 't leave that motion in a formal way which is i think we write to the the high commissioner expressing council of conservation support for the community the top very result of the researchers making so much sorry that 's volcano volcanic rupture earthquake and point out that um apparently rotary club are holding a fundraising um bucket uh australia on so if anyone could support that then that would be great but um we have thomas our destination a couple of years ago and the mayor spent a lot of time with princess although it was two steps although he was two steps behind most of the time um and uh so we feel we were very connected to the our possible and i think that it 's important that we reach out to them and offer our support through in their time and there was some really interesting components i 'll probably share with you later on a glass of water for the comments now there 's a lot of reply would think i 'll put the resolution those in favor against declare and and carried unanimously regarding the death of gene wiley on [Music] um if that needs no further issues and you 've got to be advertised and i have to read this and i will be taking the council closes the meeting to consider the following confidential reports when we go to dual each one individually sorry council closes the meeting to consider following and that is one seven point one sale of what 16 carrier port twist queen

    "text": "[Music] by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land which we gather the rugby people 's past and present i would also remind you that in accordance with the practice of council on low government act 1993 we 're live streaming and recording this many meetings by speaking this meeting you agreed to being live streamed and recorded therefore they 're always ensure that when you speak at this meeting you 're respectful to others and use appropriate language at all times and obviously council except for no liability for an inflammatory or offensive remarks or gestures that are made during the course of this meeting call for apologies uh and leave absence and the councillors are all present and we might just note that the infrastructure operations is on is on leave please disclosures of interest i would invite councillors and staff to indicate in relation to any interest that you need to declare either a so what report or item you 're declaring an interest in whether the interest is recently or non-vicanary and what is the nature of that interest now interests being declared there is no the meeting properly yeah one registered who doesn 't wish to speak sorry minutes of the meeting held 8th of march 2021 councilman capitalism thank you any comments or questions on these asylums your record all those in favor against declarative thank you colleagues i 'm quite happy to leave that as a stands it 's a fairly extensive report but quite happy to answer any questions or to respond to any comments that are being made the key messages from the visitor economy strategy which um on behalf of tower we put forward a number of suggestions to that strategy and i must admit i am a little disappointed that the particularly item number eight and number ten with their inverted commas should collaborate it doesn 't reflect the strength with which we feel felt that this should be approached in that we feel that um the destination new south wales is uh i 'll use the word bludging on the central west area in that we 're part of 62 of the state and we we uh knowing our areas the ten councils involved knowing our areas we our own certainly working with destination new south wales and country and outback hopefully but what has transpired is that we get very little very little uh attention from the destination country and outback board most of us don 't even know who 's on it or who uh who has anything to do with it because they are concentrating on the areas of the state which i was told by one person we 're regarded so far ahead they don 't come to see us very often that to me is totally unfair and [Music] we believe that rather than just uh should collaborate with a state and state that certainly states that government and central new south and destination new south new south wales we should be uh getting equivalent grant money to set up our own tourist office for central new south wales and uh be run by the ten councils in central new south wales and we put that very strongly to the people who are drawing up the visitor economy strategy i feel that what we have here is somewhat watered down far more than happy to to respond to that and in in essence it 's probably nothing i can disagree with you or what you 're saying other than to point out that this is a key message it 's a little bit how you actually go about wording some of these things but the points you make are all valid um i 'm not sure it 's been watered down this is just a key message and we need more greater collaboration the points you make about destination country outback being 6161 for canada state is is true i think the general feeling among the regional group of councils the jail is that we are being disadvantaged because of that of our strength and our success that many of us argued from day one that the current structure of tourism new south wales is not going to work and we don 't need to think that it is working either so be assured that behind closed doors council a lot of the comments you make up i have been made well and truly very strongly i think the wii u referred to the tourism operators managers within our guide organizations which you and i are very much very much part of so i 'm aware of the issues and i think it 's appropriate to bring that to our attention the other one is that there is still a very strong push that there will be a meeting being arranged with the chair of destination country outback even within sydney but i will be attending that meeting so i 'm sure that the opportunity for me to quote you if you like council office i 'm sure you won 't mind i i think tourism is a is a very important component of our region not just tourism directly but also from the component did it provide significant development of growth and economic development beyond just the tourism diet any other questions on the report just about the southern lights project um i know we had an explanation about this the other day and i have forgotten it does say that works in bathurst orange wheat and gabon have been completed and we 've got delivery next to ours i 'm not take another advice yes we did talk about this the other day i can 't quite it wasn 't southern lights we talked about it was about the essential energy which has taken place yeah but this was something that i thought i can 't remember what we talked about with this i think the of course has been some um commentary internally about how that 's been been managed council arrival comes with [Music] in light of the closure of the bells line away and i 'm going to reopen it on friday seems pretty serious what was that what 's happened with the with the landslides and um we 've had trouble with the great western highway with handling the traffic plus if something happens on it it 's um comes to a hold to a lesser extent the road to janelle and caves looks like it could be out of action forever but more importantly the bells liner road and the recent events we need to highlight maybe they will know if we need it people trying to get somewhere and more sending more traffic down the lack of transport infrastructure including the model rail line and those other issues yes just on page 19 in that report well matters raised by members when suggesting members work with local government new south wales and agree agreed position on the uh i presume it 's the esl of the levy um can you elaborate a bit more on that or what they 've what the thinking is um with um on the emergency services levy and i think that the emergency don 't go through that last position is the same as our position and this happens everybody else 's position across the landscape which is a great deal of concern and disappointment even the way it 's been unravelled unravel yeah unravel again and that we continue to support the young new south wales probably as opposed to running off and having a scatter gun approach any other question i don 't something could be formulated rather trying for me to perform a resolution on the run about because i think it 's a really important point and perhaps it could come to the council members because i just want you to try it [Music] but it might be the time for jayden to uh i think they 'd like your support yeah like we didn 't support it hit it while it 's you know it 's still of the year just in case the jo has sent out a draft press release to all the mayors in the jo this afternoon with an appropriate wording around that closure of that line and the continued advocacy for the safe swift link across the mountain so that okay that 's what our college team to prepare for at the moment can i just ask that question there 's a meeting in penrith sometimes it 's exactly the same as the fires closing the western line last year and it 's the same as the southern line being cut rather like mk because of the bottom beam specifically for some people again that 's if you get through all right so we 'll everybody 's happy we 'll have a medal now for the council meeting but we 'll also pass around the we 'll also pass around general management report if i 'm down to page 20 general manager 's report about remote meetings there 's four dot points there we 're starting to move the recommendation uh i 'll get a second and second welsh thank you councilman you 've got to congratulate the general manager on this report i think it makes perfect sense to me i do have one question though this really is about if we have to to um get this adopted and we go through the 31st of december obviously that will take in a new council and we 're looking at a new council member for two or three months if they if they choose to do that so i suppose the option will be there anyway i 'm just i 'm just looking at that point i think it 's something that we 'll sort of cross but it makes perfect sense to me i think that this and i think the option needs to be there given the fact that we don 't have a cabin we hope the worst behind us but rather trying to make decisions does look in the [Music] third dot point request for by councillors to attend meetings must be made a writer and general manager at least and has in brackets council to specify a time frame that is consistent with the time frame for logical notices of motion under our carrier beauty practice that is uh five business days i should have had that in there so if you 're adopted hopefully that 's what you 're serving that 's that 's it doesn 't eventually become an option for some people who rather than turn up to the council meeting just want to go on the screen at home certainly if you 've got good reason to be able to do that if you 've got health reasons or work commitments that don 't allow you to get there but you can get on screen okay but i think to get the true essence of council meetings and to have full understanding of what people are talking about and discussing uh we need to always encourage everyone to be president of the council recommend meeting in person if it can this is a great idea too and i do know that if we pass this it will then also apply to sim staff as well which is fine um i 've got a couple of questions if i may all on that page which is for me is 25 of the ipad the general manager talked about requests for remote attendance having been working days before the meeting so therefore if for example you have fall over and break your ankle on the day of the navy but anyway whatever um you 're then unable to attend either remotely or in person there 's no facility for a late engagement if you like that 's correct it 's a chair under the terms of those procedures i 'd say that is correct and a possible alternative there is to is to uh include in that dot point wherever possible requests by councillors to attend it should be made i think that that 's a really good compromise each councillor can request remote access but not all customers at the same time so does that mean if there 's one counsellor that the meeting can go ahead provided that 's agreed upon by by council laws and and if we just lead on from there to the next question who makes the decision as to whether or not remote attendance is permissible is it does it include everybody who 's attending remotely i mean i 'm not anticipating that that 's going to be a lot of people because i i do understand that i think no more than three business difficulties per year can be accepted for meetings if i remember correctly so it isn 't it 's a didn 't it say somewhere in there that there are various acceptable reasons illness disability caring but that if it 's work commitments it 's a maximum of three per year did it not say that somewhere no not in those procedures is that somewhere about only three times a year are you allowed to come in by audio visualization and and not accessing um remotely and and living elsewhere sort of thing or working elsewhere but so is it only those physically present in the chamber who can vote on 's at the meeting well because i was i was thinking if if you cannot be present remotely until the vote is taken um you know that could be difficult in certain situations so is there a way around that i mean i 'm not imagining we would need to use it but sometimes we have people away for example on council business at say lg sw meetings and we we go very close anyway to not getting the quorum so if we don 't say if we have four councillors in the room and one waiting to be present remotely are those four counsellors then do they have that quorum to be able to agree that that person can be present remotely or can that person themselves vote on their presence or you know acceptability or otherwise mr general assume the latter which is not not necessarily the most seamless way to operate that 's certainly one of the few queries i shall be clarifying private councilman and also i guess it 's the responsibility of the mayor in the end to make those calls i think i think the intent of issues around capital 19 on those sorts of issues not conferences or sure but if we accept it it will be able to be used in all the circumstances that are listed yeah i appreciate that um do i have any further comments or questions and thinking around how the implications are because you think something might be able to keep the system up operating in a um in a meaningful way and um i don 't think uh local government act number 367 will uh survive in this interest in this instance is that common sense will provide uh say [Music] the question is we couldn 't like last week 's extraordinary meeting um could come in very late and for us to do a five-day uh we we didn 't know five business days before the meeting and um we would only just be on the three-day noticed that the extra ordinary general meeting was to be held so in a case like that especially with around public holidays we couldn 't use the computer a logging thing to hold that meeting to ensure that forum here to discuss that and immediately discussed quickly so the question is if we couldn 't use the computer system for a meeting like that i think the chairman of the movement the secretary just agreed that those procedures should say wherever possible business days [Music] meetings and it was it was confidential but it 's something then addressed to defeat the council operations i think i think the first one is secondly i think that labour government is the office of local government have been wrestling with this issue about remote meetings for quite some time now i think many years it may have us placed at this point i think both the local government new south wales and the officer local government have been steering away from that kind of legislation and i think this has specifically being used around the coated phenomena i can see that in some areas that may change the landscape particularly for some of the councils who are more remote and have great distances to cover where it lands i 'm not quite sure yet but i think the point you 're of councils that wasn 't made in the submission on the consultation paper because the consultation paper is not related it 's talking about what will be in the potentially developed way to practice foreign [Music] [Music] um [Music] any comments or questions and i 'd also subject you to find something contact the director as well um rod replied not necessarily property council arrives we 'll move on i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against declarative carry go to page 49 which is the youth council council of smithville moved there and i 'm sure councillors click on that thank you the general manager i 've done something wrong okay thank you councilman thank you mr mayor um youth council had considerable participation in the festival recently and coming up at the end of this week is the beginning of youth week so it 's going to be a big week for news week and the councillors would have noted on the last page of the meeting minutes a draft program which is pretty comprehensive a couple of those are no longer going to occur um this coming saturday down at river park if anyone 's passing by there 's an obstacle activity that 's been run by sync and supported by the youth council with a number of other activities such as a barbecue around that for example and the following tuesday i think that although it says tuesday i think it should be wednesday i think that tuesday is incorrect there 's a leadership day um i think the mayor 's coming along and any councilor who would like to come up and have a look i 'm sure would be able to at the high school it 's it 's we 've done it before and it 's a really really good really well run and really engaging day so a whole whole range of activities and if anyone 's wondering about the first activity which is the young faces of power nanowire 's been changed it was initially called young and young at heart and there 's there 's going to be four or five young people are going to be interviewed and profiled and four or five of our senior citizens sin this week as well so there 's a good mix of activities and we 'll all be exhausted by the time it 's finished i 'm sure thank you for the comments i 'm glad you put the question in about seniors workers my diary shane seniors work this week in youth week next week or a youth week event next week and i 'm sort of quite quite working out which category i 'm in cwc [Music] come across the facebook media that the youth council has been nominated for a community group award with the upcoming business town rewards and they will be held on the 1st of may so which goes to show that well then they really had a very good social media presence the youth council and getting things out we seem to have a good grasp of the system and to keep things relevant in contact with people also on the um amplified leadership day and i think i 'm pretty sure this is right uh one michael um local less girl young lady is joanna treasurer will be a speaker on the and what she 's been doing today in entry into that industry and other things and she 's got a quite a bit long resume at the moment all already and me and just participation and representation so that 's good to see a local person being involved thank you for the comment right reply please resolution favor again you declare a carry on um that 's a suggestion that you might convert a cheerleading meeting to try and regenerate that community and i think that 's probably a good idea and i guess if you 're happy for those point i 'll do it with the second block point we change the review the count of three spell for the australian preschool yeah that 's right i hope you did that as well um so if you 're happy that that includes yeah leaning well mr chairman can i suggest that the council commit a meeting and then it 's up to you whether you 're available or whether you 're getting a deputy mayor which is certainly suggest one of one of the two of you might chair for the membership of the world peace development the australian chapter of the world peace building and you want to meet with the peace the third got point is and the group yeah good thank you speaking of that well mr chairman when i 've read about the the order i think that makes perfect sense and then i started reading with talk about what can maintain the rocks the compositions before but look at just a maybe a non-slip surface yeah that 's going to be cheap but anyway i 'll be interested to see what comes up so sort of saying i do a deal but but i am a little bit concerned sometimes that the there is a rate repeal spell in canberra and i think we need to continue to make sure that the australian chapter of world peace building the australian law peace belt is in the civic square at cara and we need to continue to promote that and continue to have ownership of it i think otherwise over a period of time it 'll adjust to these things do it will drift and it will become seen in canberra as being the australian world peaceful because canberra 's national capital and that might be for anybody 's intent other than just the way these things give us but for us to have ownership yeah yeah and that could be just the person who took the minutes in a quite um unintended yep unintended my question is so the movement second has agreed to change the wording in that resolution and i think it reflects the the current retiring chairman mr d brown 's view on it too i 'm sure it did stay at the australian peaceful and he did mention tell me about the flooring and that and as it 's been reviewed before just finding a see-through feeling or something you may have learned mr mayor i think it should also be noted that in terms of maintaining kara as the australian world peace council in the person of the mayor and delegation that that has been to japan most recently is has worked by meeting the head of the organisation in japan and i 'm sure we 'll continue to ensure that this is seen as the australian chapter of the world peace bill a cup of coffee before that with the uh facilitator in canberra of the canberra of the rugby prison in cambridge and had a very amicable uh conversation and understanding that they understand exactly where we sit as well so there 's no dramas there just i think you can move forward that 's all i just also suggest that the i don 't think there 's a sign there that indicates that it is the australian world i think it 's something we could consider in the future for the comments i reply mr mayor if i can throw a bit of light on that on the local on the local committee that the world peace spell association has been inactive um ian brown has had contact with a person who has indicated to him that it is firing up again and they do now have a uh a person who is prepared to be the president or chairman or whatever they need and that karen will be the the peace bill representing the world yeah yeah i think we all had an issue with that one thank you councillor first comments right reply put the resolution eyes in favor hello again married no i think it 's a great idea and i think we should support it okay yeah look i think this is a great idea and and i think when we talk as as we have in the past again about public art murals around the town which i think are a fantastic idea because i have done some rural chasing in various towns and it 's quite a big tourist floor i think to get some of these students trained up if you like and enroll and indeed get some public art open to students of the high schools as as with the original indigenous murals under the bridge i think could be a great way of engaging the whole community i 'm happy to support it but i just sometimes wonder where the responsibility of council fits with public education and there 's a real thin line somewhere so i think this is important but i just it 's just with people to me to meditate over at some stage further comments i 'd require can i just have my writer require things is going to support these young people who are actually going to involve themselves in a creative art project and they are already contributing more three and a half thousand dollars or three thousand dollars and i think it 's a very uh worthwhile project for us to be involved put the resolution all right um investments in um financial reporters director i want to make a comment before i put this through the chairs i 've just noticed that some of the tables in the report aren 't too readable and i apologize to council for those slipping through if council wishes for the report to be uh removed held over and i can rectify that and present it back to the council someone happy to move the report we noted i and have you ever directly to council for consideration council hogan council and then secondly could i just add that the total for the investment is it seems like there 's just fuzziness around it yes around some of the better well it must be something the system just required in the previous gurus have been in the room watching us so well i 'm happy the recommendation as we 're talking about it doesn 't need to write reply to the resolution i was in favor against the declaration number one from the dr dyer from the director of infrastructure operations there 's a four point got recommendation around the native title and the crown land reserve eight down below eight seven yeah council of the world moveset chancellor smith second any comments or questions yes it 's uh replaced this application i suppose you 'd call it out on public exhibition it 's um obviously from uh reading most of it there 's a tremendous amount of work that 's gone into it and uh once again i congratulate our staff on that and it 'll be interesting just now to see what uh what comes back from the public thank you secondary to speak not only said succeed any further comments or questions i 'll put the resolution in favor against is in regards to the members of the lap i 'm 17 the lep 2012. dot two dot point recommendation so i want to move the recommendation on the left side thank you second councilman knows mr speak councillor once again a lot of work has gone into this and um while i don 't agree with some of the mapping uh particularly relating to the position of the possible draft the draft mapping it is actually regarding the position of some of the facilities out there i think this is a very necessary um document to be to go through and now to send to the department and it 's also interesting noting a few of the responses from the public exhibition um but most of those will come up again when when and if the um d.a or the actual movement of the village comes into council secondly you further comment capitalism yes i i do have some concerns about this as i have had all along um and the concern i guess relates to the parcels of the subject land that are home to threatened species i details about the proposed holiday park the new holiday park that we may be able to lessen the footprint of what he 's proposed but that means is is that not the case is it not dude not saying that somewhere if if that 's not the case then the entire parcel of land will be asked if we pass this to the rear zone so i have a little bit of concern about that and i know that it can be addressed in the d.a proposal the other concern i have i guess being entirely honest here is should by any strange quirk of fate the wall raising not go ahead and we have and therefore the holiday park doesn 't need relocation and we [Music] is it then possible for another organisation to put in a ga or something that that is permissible on with this new zoning that we would find very difficult to knock back because it 's permissible no yes that is possible um but the planning legislation still um will still pertain to that land and the um environmental concerns will have to be caravan park as well as everything else so if another use comes along um by board in new south wales that is different then those that legislation still applies so the threatened species issue will still have to be addressed irrespective of whatever the development application gets lodged i think we just need to be careful that we don 't start going down um pathways which don 't exist at the moment because it 's very clear that there is still a lot of a lot of processes checks and balances in place to go through before any development takes place on this land at all i think that 's the key and i think part of the conversation about the raising of the rainbow itself has been that there are too many individuals or groups who are going down what-if pathways and looking at the future when there 's nothing really positive in front of them to to be to be assessing things against i think it 's it 's too easy this day and age to find reason not to do something without any actually ground truthing or capitalism is a valid but the report clearly says that this will have to be part of the process so just re-zoning the land doesn 't give anybody the right to start building per se and it also identifies a number of areas where there are uh issues in terms of significant impacts within that footprint which would have to be negated and not even be able to be negated within that footprint so i think it 's a it 's a process we need to just let it unfold and make sure that the due process is followed all the way through [Music] what we 're doing here is um we 're helping the new south island if they do go ahead with their greatest ended we have got zoned in in place for um to relocate the um the holiday park at noon and um even if it doesn 't go ahead there could be some time in the future where the park needs to be extended because of extra use and um as you said i think that the threatened species especially in today 's environment of if it 's not re-zoned the threatened species still has to be looked after you might have any control of looking after it if it 's outside another zone and people don 't worry about it so i think what we 're doing here we 're not putting up any roadblocks to stop new south wales water or anyone to make a decision on a future project of raising the wayne dam wall if they think it 's necessary and we are making [Music] thank you yes i would like to comment um councillor smith raised the biodiversity and the threatened species and i know that uh that 's also a concern of somebody with a hunter 's hill address who wanted to have a bit to say about it and i just you know hope that in the future some of the concerns that are displayed about the uh threatened species and the biodiversity there uh come to bear when the next crop of saint john 's wart and all the weeds that we know are growing there come again so it 'd be lovely if they would pressure you councilwoman unanimous thank you uh item number two from the director of environmental services is the emergence of the access committee i 'm sure council members of uh tracy ford i think she 's she 's made an extremely valuable contribution to this committee over a long period of time that we do acknowledge that that 's fine and from you that also publicly as well thank you thanks mr mayor i have a few questions actually through you and the first one is regarding iron drive and it says it 's an ongoing issue rages patrolling the area i have had a couple of people speak to me about the road service up there and it appears as though some work is going to be done could we just get an expansion on what that means doctors are committed as an exception to other vehicles so well it 's about parking and emergency vehicles and doctors are able to parking so it 's not about the airport no at all okay thank you if i may ask two more questions mr mayor one is regarding playgrounds and it parks at woodstock and darby 's falls and river park and i thought i guess i don 't recall hearing about that i may have been relaxing my concentration but that 's that 's definitely the case we 're going to have fencing around those parts that 's fantastic absolutely and and the final one is the letter from steph cook about pedestrian crossings and uh requesting clarity well it was it was it came out of the blue it was just a letter i think it was probably the general letter that went to all councils within her electorate and about pedestrian crossings and without being specific and were in the losses to know what that actually didn 't mean and we 're trying to request from her some specifics around that as to whether there was areas that needed attention or what it actually meant and no replies really specific in what it was asking making comment to the effect that pedestrian crossings don 't seem to cater for all needs of the community do you have any other suggestions and the access committee said well we agree specific suggestions available that 's the response that i 'll provide back to the labor level so this question capital node i know tracy ford 's resigned obviously you need to ask what 's going to do yeah [Music] [Music] issue raised by a resident or by a constituent next question is following on from the session with the sport and rec review sort of indicated that some of our playgrounds are not our sporting fields amenities and parking out up to disable access and so forth are they on the list the access committee have their problems talking about this stage because that was a general comment made without any specific reference but i 'm sure that they 'll be in due course certainly our disability inclusion action plan it does make mention of council facilities and and making them as accessible as possible obviously over time and i think this plan will feed into that and certainly as far as access plan is concerned at the moment because when you would have printed those minutes there 's been some work going on around making sure the access is well i wouldn 't try to be negative i guess it crosses over i mean the sport thing is there 's a lot thank you i reply the resolution of those in favor of mr clara carrick i 'm number three environmental services which is the natural resource management advisory committee cleaning tell the council um not unless somebody 's got any questions i think it 's uh fairly clearly laid out there and the um particularly relating to that request for a donation for a a um have a community screen on the um on the clean website uh i think it 's well known there that on page 332 the while cnram committee might be in support of this project the more appropriate funding mechanisms either by a donation request or a community grant that leave it to the proponents then to take that up if they social design they had there had been a meeting with a item number four from the director of environmental services is that is da 25 stroke 2021 one amy street car there 's a recommendation there for approval conditions council smith going to be any visual impairment or stop and i think it should be supported i agree the impacts are minimal and i there 's no reason why council can 't agree to the request thank you any further comments or questions full support right reply probably not required i 'll put the resolution i was in favor college thank you thank you colleagues carried unanimously before we close the council on other parts of the arcade we have two lab reports one is from the director environmental services which is da1 2021 which is the map around the corner of keswick and smith street which is not a separate item when you come here on our ipad second by council smith councillor fagin here to speak well just that this has also been a very involved um d.a it 's very well set out i think it explains what their it 's interesting that we can have a smaller block in the middle of larger blocks that it 's already there so i don 't think that that 's anything different to what the rest of the streetscape has people walking in it 's not going to change anything no relevance to anybody else the people around them and they 've already conferred and they 've been consulted and they haven 't rejected so i think this is actually a well-thought-out application that i have supported secondly in terms of it reducing the size of a lot that is already below the minimum lot size that that we put into place subsequent to it being gazetted i suppose it it is a semi-detached house and it has been assessed that i think that 's agreed yeah it has been public assessed that there is the amount of open space at the back buddies who applied for such a building and i think council has um the the onus is upon us to approve where appropriate a a mix of developments that will suit the changing needs of the cara community and i think this is one such [Music] of corporate services in terms of late item which is a update report on the uh university center um to speak just just to say that we will be having um talk to in a few weeks time and it 's it 's an exciting opportunity it appears that we have um before our ducks are lined up we have a chance of getting and so i hope i hope everyone is able to come to that meeting that will be on as well yes [Music] any further questions second we can speak any further questions we 're not happy with this i 'll put the resolution in favor against the cleric uh no no there 's emotion any late issues mr chairman i just wonder whether this is the right time to raise this there was a an article sentence from um your generation pa tracy thought today regarding uh seeking a little support from dementia australia and i just wonder whether it 's appropriate to raise that all they 're doing is seeking a little support for the right men for quality dementia care and supporting that between a really important issue on patients you 've got to move emotion that way i would like that we say actually the the the request is that you that the council have that happen or we 'd get a report to account today i 'm certainly happy for that to happen i 've actually had to read it this time because we really should be doing something about it i 'll say my speaking to you yeah i think well if that if there 's a general consensus we 'll pull up a merrill merrily [Music] from dementia australia for the um the federal government to implement the right manner it 's been there 's a whole lot of work being done right it 's just been done to gauge whether there 's any support or any feeling we should do something with it or not and i 'm quite happy to support what council miller 's given the fact that there is obviously support to do something so we 'll get a merrill minute up and stick it to you probably the person who 's interested in this to make sure you 're comfortable to your last question about the steering committee for the community yes it 's the last page of this item which is page 47 and there it and stand julia at reminders thank you um um thank you colleagues i 'll take a motion to close the meeting to the public considering according to attendant of the act the following one report which is the general manager and closed committee as the sale of airport planned to fly off the fight unlimited and the reason is that if daddy would it 's under 10 hsu the act the information that would have commercial advantage on a person within the council is conducting four proposals to conduct

mayor there 's a recommendation there is anybody [Music] motion all in favor please say aye aye that 's carrie report 3.2 the process to elect the mayor and deputy mayor there is a like to hold an ordinary ballot for mayor and deputy mayor elections if needed councillor i guess that 's not an amendment just because the recommendation hasn 't been moved that effectively is the original motion that 's on the table thank you is there a second to that notion councillor fagan thank you councillor speak for that motion yes um i was pretty um a bit earlier but i thought um i just think that uh any intimidation that may happen or people looking at each other in different ways you can mature in a way and not not be seen any of that before this happens that if the more senior local governor new south wales elections they are held as a ballot it 's not quite a show of hands and i think it 's just a fairer way to give it everyone the chance to vote for the people they want without knowing who they 're voting for and we have been elected under a secret balance system to get here in the first place i 'd just like to agree with campaign and say that all and but uh he 's quite daunting to vote in the opening ballot um in an open way and i think it 's a more more successful a better way of conducting a vote any other councils wish to speak on that motion i don 't expect you to write a reply to anything councillor right so we 'll put that notion all in favor please so we 'll move straight into the election of mayor and deputy man we 'll start with the election of mayor and at the close of nominations at 5 00 pm this afternoon we had two valid nominations for the office of mayor councillor peter wright and councillor bill west both of whom have who have consented in writing to those nominations you come prepared so what we will now do will need to have a ballot for the election uh what we will do is place each name in in the ballot box so we can determine the order they 'll appear in the on the ballot paper after many of them but that 's the process we need to go through is empty [Music] draw it out first will appear at the top of the ballot paper and that is bill west and just to show you that we still have a magic involved the other one there and of course the ballot box is empty we do have both eventually we do have both eventual ballot papers for both eventualities so we will distribute nine ballot papers and i would ask you to please place an x alongside the candidate that you are voting for [Music] no this is history [Music] yeah um all right anything oh oh [Music] okay so counselors nine formal votes there 's eight votes for councillor bill west one vote for councillor peter wright are therefore the clear council of the west elected as mayor of carroll shire council before bill takes the chair we 'll the office of deputy mayor to close the nominations at 5pm this afternoon there was one valid nomination for the office of deputy mini that from councillor judy smith who has consented in writing to the nomination given there are no other nominations so declare council judy smith election remainder of the meeting thank you to my colleagues for their support and i do appreciate that and i must say i find these moments always quite humbling and quite uh meaningful i acknowledge the council of peter right congratulations and uh councilman smith congratulations and i look forward to welcoming you in the fold and working closely with you again as we have i think in the last three or four or five or six or seven years councillors uh i can say thank you for the privilege i also look forward to working with each and every one the daughter [Music] and i guess to the new councillors congratulations on your your election you use a big step i know some of you are a little bit apprehensive and nervous and that 's as much as it all could be because i think those of us who are in the chamber for more than one term or two also in your shoes and felt exactly the same way under what we let ourselves in for a longer time so i do congratulate you and welcome you as i 's an opportunity just to acknowledge also the the candidates who took their hand forward you know to each one of those thank you and congratulations too many comments made in some areas where people want someone should do something i think we should acknowledge those who like the people that hand up and have a go and so on behalf of all of you if i may on behalf of the community so today congratulations and thank you this is going to be pretty period we have five new councillors and i think that 's going to be exciting again a big challenge i know there are some aspirations in the chamber and that is great i look forward to working with you all and i think i 've made it very clear what i 'm thinking about my own personal position i look forward to working involving anybody if i possibly can be any information such as to ask the questions i would also like to just acknowledge general manager and his managed team and i 've obviously been working with germany for a while now but i manager if you support already but i 'm sure we look forward to having a very close and open working relationship with you and your your senior management team and uh i feel we will have many conversations with myself and our colleagues with that um again i graduate councilman smith on the return of the deputy mayor and uh look forward to moving forward as a council because it is going to be interesting time and i reflect the aspirations in the train right there to be supportive and encouraged thanks mr mayor it 's it 's been 80 years but who 's counting but i will just say that i will work hard to repay the faith of other councillors and i 'll work hard to also model inclusive and open and listening and understanding behavior i think it 's going to be a great council it 's an exciting council it 's great to have so many new ideas on board and i look forward to the next two years and nine months with you all thank you um i must say it 's also nice to come along and some of the performance council array welcome former council kevin wright who will discuss a little bit later on their achievements just nice to have family and friends in the chamber so i thank you on behalf of the councillors for being here and part of this but also acknowledge the admission i could acknowledge our local member of the honourable staff cook m peanuts under minister emergency services and resilience and you stefan being elevated in the ministry as well and i look forward to welcoming you a little bit later on to help your presentation to the service medals back to business our councillors we do have item 3.3 which is decision on using account banks to feel casual latency should they arise um there 's a recommendation there which is i think self-explanatory is something i want to know about council smith thank you thank you for having me thank you council to speak at all very briefly mr mayor um it is self-explanatory but perhaps for for people who are may not be aware should we not vote to do this but to rate payers of the shire something um about fifty thousand dollars perhaps so i think that this is a very very sensible thing for us to be doing that the beauty of this is especially in this short term of the council that it will get us past the halfway mark and within a period if someone has to for some reason leave the council after this 18 months i think uh would be in a period where we don 't have to have the election until the next election and as councillor smith said these elections don 't come cheap we need to use for the clients any questions comments do our requirements i 'll put the resolution in favor again carrie item number four is the presentation at service awards and i would invite i will come forward and i 'd like to a local member to join me and make presentations um before i do that however and it 's appropriate just to acknowledge that it is important and an opportunity to recognize a number of councillors here we are giving considerable considerable service to this community very seriously and should be something that all these councils should be very very proud of the community should be should be very appreciative of so with that i will come around the front line and write uh like commander johnny booth and i think the general manager is going to read out and i 'll actually uh before i do that i 'll invite stephanie to say a few words to come up with so if you want to say to your words sure okay oh well when you put on the spot we 've got to say something thank you mayor bill west for the invitation and opportunity to be here today to mark the service of a number of councillors former councillors or outgoing councillor shall we say and to acknowledge the service of a number of returning and currently serving councillors to take a step back may i uh start by acknowledging that we are here today on the lands of the warajiri people and pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging may i congratulate each and every councillor who has been elected 've had to attend a meeting of this nature um and it 's uh i think it 's a proud moment for you and your families uh and for the community of cairo which is a tremendous community a very strong and proud community and it 's wonderful that you have all put your hand up to represent the wonderful people of this area to those new councillors i know exactly how you feel um having been in a similar position just over four years ago it can be a little bit daunting and there 's a lot to learn along the way but without you know giving bill too much of a big head can i say that being in the hands of mayor bill west is absolutely tremendous and i don 't mind saying although i um i don 't i don 't mind saying that um look right from the get-go bill and i have had a very strong working relationship during the by-election when i came to meet bill for the very first time um i found him a little bit scary to be honest i i was obviously brand new i i was in the middle of a by-election it was a very brutal election campaign as these some things can sometimes go and but i knew that he had the community at heart but i also knew that he was someone that i could learn a hell of a lot from and the reality is that whilst yes just just on three weeks ago um i was very privileged to to enter the ministry of the new south wales government the bottom line is and i 'll always always always believed this i wouldn 't be there i wouldn 't be the member for cuda mundra that i am today and i certainly wouldn 't be in the ministry without um mayor bill west it just simply wouldn 't have happened he has over the last four years mentored me so for those new counselors you are in really really really good hands we 've had to navigate some very difficult decisions together and and we 've had some very robust discussions over that time um but we 've always had the community first think together we 've been on on a journey which will now continue because we have a lot to get done for this community so for those new councillors it 's a very very exciting time and for those councillors who are returning thank you very much for doing so because your experience your knowledge and your willingness to continue fronting up that consistency of effort is what together with the you know the passion and enthusiasm that you all bring to the table is what will make sure that this council area will will continue to grow and develop and be a wonderful community for so many so um what a wonderful time it is bill and i just wanted to yeah just to thank you for the last four years um it 's a good moment with us really so and uh and certainly to now acknowledge the service of those who have given so much to this community thank you just to give the background to the service awards local government new south wales the peak industry body for the local government in the state grants awards into work of those retiring elected members who have completed two terms which is normally eight years or they could be nine with the extension of the elections over the past twelve months and currently serving elected members who have completed three terms twelve years normally they presented these with those members who have shown that they are committed and dedicated to the pursuit of achievement for the community of our local government area we do have uh an apology bruce miller 's an apology for this evening unable to attend now however he 's the recipient of the local government new south wales excellence award received an appreciation of his exceptional service outstanding achievement and significant contribution to advancing the goals of the local government sector bruce also received will receive his emeritus mayor award recognising those who have served as me so i 'll now hand over to bill in conjunction with uh steph to present awards to merit awards to councilman judy smith councillor ruth fade and councillor peter wright former councillors ray walsh and councillor former councillor kevin knight thank you mr our first merit award and dedication to the pursuit of achievement for the community of a local government area

looking forward to hearing you come back and talk about the hospitals issues [Music] wish you all the best in terms of health and well-being as you go forward and i think what came to my mind when i was here was that there 's probably over 100 years of community service involved in those awards particularly bruce miller to it but judy since got 2008 that 's but i think there is a very significant community contribution being made by councillors and patients will be able expertise pa tracy robinson for making it happen and because steph particularly has come all this way just for this particular very special occasion so with that i think i 'm able to declare the meeting close ladies and gentlemen and invite you all please to come in next door _"

respectful to others who 's appropriate at all times the council accepts no liability for any cemetery or offensive remarks or gestures made during the course of this meeting i will also take the opportunity of acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land of which we gather to raise with people and paying my respects to their lives past present and emerging there is looking around me there are no apologies for the full house there are no apologies for applications to leave absence i would invite any council council or staff to indicate in relation to any interest you need to declare firstly what report for item you 're declaring an interest in whether the interest is machinery or non-procuring and finally what is the nature of that presentation from dan smith from intentis who is representing the order reported with general 's office for the order office and reporting on the annual financial in in about five minutes can i push you there and find out can you hear me [Music] i sure can well i will introduce you again as liam speak from enchanters that we 've had to make a presentation of the annual financial statements for the period 20 20 20 2021 uh on behalf of the order office so dan and i passed the meeting over to you and welcome to the carriage high council chambers by zoom great okay you 've got that yes okay well thank you very much um just before we get into cara 's results for the year you just want to touch on um the audit offices and your work program and some of the performance audits that they 're conducting in the next year or two um part of their focus last year and again this year and going forward is um disaster recovery and response so one of the items i 've been looking at is in relation to the bush fires the floods and capitality and um this isn 't just local government this is state agencies as well um then the recovery processes and then also um the impact whether um and and how that that has all worked moving into more local government specific areas um performance orders that are planned for the next couple of years um i just listed some of them listed there um in particular this year and certainly going forward cyber security has been a really big focus of what it offers and that 's been across the state sector not just like government and that 's going to continue going forward as well as some work on precipitating a broadcast amongst others um the report to parliament on the 2021 financial statements is due to be submitted to parliament in december 2021 so this will include the financial results of financial audit results for local government um plus the findings from the management letters um big focus areas this year in particular have been cyber security and also i.t general controls and also um the role of the arrex so the audit risk and improvement committees and internal so just in relation to council council um as always there 's a couple a whole uh this year we had community land land improvements other assets being devalued and also the annual indexation of the water and syrian assets so that saw a re-evaluation of just over 6.5 million dollars added to council 's infrastructure property plant equipment balances um also of significance this year um in particular the wyoming sewage treatment plant which was a non-cash contribution to council of 6.5 million dollars there was also approximately nine hundred thousand dollars worth of bush fire services um non-cash contributions for equipment plus there 's also been some funding inflation to new sheds and the new regional headquarters come through um as you 'd be aware during the lockdowns um across new south wales the year-end order had to be conducted remotely um this uh slowed things down a little bit but overall went really well and um is um one of the reasons it went so well was because council staff do you always do a lot of work in terms of preparing for the audit and um that really made the difference this year where we weren 't able to be i guess some of the key numbers that are reported in the report on the conduct of audit so rates and annual charges uh went up to 14.4 million dollars so that was an overall increase of 3.6 um rate peaking was two point six percent for the year plus there was some increase in um tradable properties during the year due to new development grants and contributions revenue um as you can see there it increased significantly by 11.4 million in total and this includes 6.5 million dollars for the wyangla sewage treatment plant um there was also significant funding that would continue to be received during the year in relation to the main street upgrade works and then again um a flow and again from that increasing grants and contributions revenue operating from continuing operations was up um at 13.5 million dollars for the year compared to 4.4 the previous year um consolidated operating results for the year so before capital it was at uh 1.16 million for the year and after capital 38.5 and again that includes those um significant capital uh significant grants and contributions capital revenue for the year was just under 52 million compared nine last year and as you can see from the grants contributions here um that 's where a lot of that growth has come from and again primarily playing a serious plan um and the recycling income is continuing to provide a source of income for council as well as it has done for the last few years expenditure um total expenditure was 38.4 million dollars this year compared to 34.55 um materials and services and employee costs will move around a little bit depending on the mix of capital and operational works that occur at council connecticut here but the other big change with materials and services um this was previously until this year that was materials contracts and there 's been a reallocation of expenditure line items between what 's now materials and services in this category here and the other so it hasn 't necessarily been just a large increase in materials and services expenditure part of it 's due to that change in the classifications uh cash position at the end of the year so cash to 3.5 last year um there 's been an increase in the external restrictions but a lot of that is off the back of grant funding it 's being received by council external debt there were no borrowings drawn in 2021 um so total borrowings are slightly lower than last year at 16.7 million and the debt service cover ratio which says how much ability council has serviced yeah it 's sitting at 3.6 that 's a little lower than the last couple of years but it 's still all above the benchmark set by the government of two percent the unrestricted current ratio is sitting at a level that 's fairly consistent with where it 's been the last year 64.33 so this is looking at how many unrestricted current assets council has to satisfy its current liabilities and again counts as well above benchmark which is 1.5 um unpaid rates and annual charges um it 's sitting at 14.49 which is a um above the benchmark 10 but it is slightly lower than the prior year indicator um this was impacted a couple of years ago by the now previously they were offset against receivables and from 2020 they need to be reported separately as payable for a liability um however as council would be aware the last waterling run for the year is done in june um so that continues to impact council 's ratio own source operating revenue so benchmark this ratio is 60 council 's been above this every year apart from the current year um however i probably just want to point out that that council 's own source operating revenue was sitting at 29 the reason that indicator has fallen below the benchmark and reduced significantly is because the high level of grants contributions received during the year so that 21.8 million infrareds and contributions what 's uh caused the reduction in that ratio rather than a deterioration of council zones revenue in dollar terms in terms of our infrastructure property equipment this year 8.5 which is consistent with 2020 new asset editions 11.8 compared to 2.7 last year however with a million dollars of the current year editions related to that search treatment um in terms of the finalization of the audit not qualified so they 're at the audit report council was well within the 30th october deadline and our final management letter is with cancel for consideration at the moment and will be issued in due course the matter 's raised that 's that the level of assistance that 's required was a little higher than normal given we couldn 't actually get people on site that council um so without the work that stuff put in to prepare for the audit to start with you wouldn 't would have struggled to make the deadline so that was really um appreciated that was everything i was at the cover off but i 'm happy to take any questions that anybody might have thank you leanne do you have any questions because i admitted we had a much has had a pre brief preview prior to this i think the questions were answered so i have no questions um so unless you have something else to add we 'll say thank you very much leanne and firstly and so secondly thank you to you for those kind comments about council staff shall certainly shall pass that donald john manager sitting beside me i 'm sure that they 've passed on the relevant staff as well thank you for the way that you 've worked with us in this difficult time of doing things remotely and congratulations it 's a good result it 's a good result of difficult circumstances and our staff really do need congratulations i think that we 'll probably add to that later on yeah i think i think i 'm not really sure i 'm sorry i wasn 't here earlier um but uh as far as we uh across the state goes i 'm not sure as you 're representing the audit office how how do we stand up across the state is that okay so uh i can 't tell you just yet because not everybody 's finished yet um [Music] my real question in that way was um because of the um own source revenue the fact that we haven 't reached the benchmark there that would be the same for most councils across the state would it not i i wouldn 't know 6.5 million non-cash contribution for angler is a big thing that not everybody would have got but um what i will say and i 'll forward it through to the director and the general manager when i when it 's up but the audit office does actually have a really good tool where you can compare your council or any council against other councils they 've had it up on their website in previous years the one for this year isn 't available yet but when it comes through i 'd hop that will um it 's actually works really well it 's a really good tool um to have a look at but it will only go up once everybody 's launched and there were a number of councils that sought extensions this year as well so not everybody 's in it yet but i 'll send that link through when it 's available thank you appreciate it very much thank you now for the questions we 'll say thank you very much [Music] registered and speaking open forum public forum so mr thank you good evening may west community residents like myself the opportunity to speak at tonight 's council meeting my name is sharon dobo being the last meeting prior to the upcoming council election the business paper is one of positivity i 'm very pleased and fully support items 4.3 and 4.4 with reference to item 4.3 request for assistance cara business chamber the creation of a campaign to address live work and play will be beneficial to the lga in fact today i learned the reflections holiday park at wyangla are looking for multiple staff members to join in their team over the busy summer period ahead am i experiencing difficulty in filling these positions i also jumped onto the online jobs platform platform jorah and over 50 jobs are currently available across the cara shire like many regional towns the availability of housing may play havoc to secure new relocatees and we will need to be mindful of this but i am confident we can find solutions i want to thank the carer business chamber for their willingness to advance lga in the space of economic development and a shout out to the individual community grants new community events category is a new request in front of council for consideration and i must say i am very excited to see it being considered events are vital to providing communities with the opportunity to celebrate and come together they also attract visitors to our shire depending on the type of event being held tourism research australia 's average spend stat for a visitor is 275 if an event has 200 visitors attending that is 55 000 in economic impact if a thousand visitors attend that grows to 275 000 economic impact for cow therefore i strongly support the adoption of item 4.4 and see the benefits event sponsorship will provide to the carroll local government area finally i would like to draw your attention to item 4.2 end of year enterturn report for the past five years all of you here the elected officials have been representing the karashiya achievements are listed from page 27 in the paper there are so many wins to mention as a resident of cara i personally want to thank

all council staff the top effort in delivering the items listed in the operational plan a never-ending job and two councils executive here in front of me tonight my deepest respect to you for ensuring council is financially sound as presented here tonight it provides a solid foundation for the future of karashia thank you thank you directors my name is ian docker i 'm representing the carer business chamber thank you for allowing me to talk about the new initiative with our business chamber business chamber is undertaking a tv advertising campaign for a minimum of six months we 'll have three teams there will be three separate ads live cara has a wholesome and family friendly environment for people of all tree change or a relaxed country lifestyle work the diversity of industry across the shire is endless from rural industrial tourism and hospitality name a few hi cara is so spoiled for choice whether it be the fabulous japanese gardens skiing fishing or sailing hawaiian blue dam the supporting facilities are fantastic and the shire should be congratulated from the groundskeepers right through the general manager and it is also home of the australian chapter of the world festival production of the aid has started and hopefully will be finished by the early december and on tv screens by late december we have been fortunate to get some extra footage from moxie 's and a couple of other businesses around town that has cut our costs down a little bit targeted areas will be canberra wollongong newcastle as well as dubbo and orange the advertising campaign plus plus production is approximately forty thousand dollars between the chamber and two local businesses we have already come up with twenty thousand dollars and we are seeking help from the council for a further twenty thousand dollars we are also going to go are a lot of jobs that are unfulfilled out there and so we were hoping that premier businesses will be able to extend this campaign the current board is changing the focus of chamber be more proactive with the businesses and the community as a whole and the ap campaign will not only just help tourism but all companies in town on behalf of the business chamber thank you very much thank you mr chairman good job yes just just a question and in the general manager 's report it recommends that the twenty thousand all that i 'm sure you 've read it but um but it also points out the significant contribution that the council has made to the business channel but also the tourism because we 're very looked as showers as well have you liaised with with tourism as far as this initiative is concerned we 've had and we have not had a lot of response back from them unfortunately um but as i came in here i wrote a text message that i had not read saying realism is on something like that the secondly um we have a board meeting tomorrow and i 'll make sure um do the minutes i might take a little bit of literary license sitting in this particular position and to reflect a little bit briefly on the class of 2016 five years supposed before and i would just firstly congratulate each and every one of you through my condition to this chamber this community and the role of the councillor to those of us who are seeking re-election i just genuinely say good luck all the best in the coming couple of weeks there are three that aren 't going to be seeking re-election before i come to them i just acknowledge for their contribution it was alluded to earlier in terms of the difficult circumstances the last couple years particularly keeping things grounded and i think it 's fair to say has been an absolutely outstanding outstanding job and i 'm sure that your your old mentors would be would be quite proud and impressed with the work that has been carried out so i do appreciate hardly and say thank you on behalf of the colleagues not seeking re-election so i can talk openly about them and i 'll start with councillor kevin right and just acknowledge that perhaps health has made a bit more difficult in the last few months but i 'm very confident that history will be very kind to the contribution that council has made to this chamber but also to the community more broadly particularly around the biliary village and the work that 's being done there always someone who has integrity has never been challenged or questioned council writer so thank you and wish you good healthy as you move as you move forward you can throw that walker away at some stage uh and we 'll have a party and imagine where that happens councillor ray walsh um hardworking dedicated tourism a whole range of community aspects that you 've been engaged with and i think it 's fair to say that i just happened to say i have to some be helpful the chamber senior staff and my own perspective thank you and congratulations your effort has been i think immense almost stylish from time to time the test of time and your integrity and genuine nature is something i think is that demand on this this particular building as well for this chamber okay the third third person i guess is is i 'm not quite sure how this could come out but i will be i will be kind um someone who has spent 30 years at labour government who have been to the pinnacle in terms of local government being involved with boards at a state level and sharing those boards a lot a lot of restructuring a lot of hassle a lot of heartache always dealt with very firm very fair but a very open-minded hand and i acknowledge that completely in this chamber for 13 13 years and one that 's for 31 years for 14 years and there 's no question in your record in this particular that particular role and also the contribution you have made over your 31 years has been absolutely outstanding the three you will be missed your wisdom and your experience will probably be missed more than most with no disrespect to to other council of you 're a fond of knowledge around local government what goes on so i would thank you personally for your your support to thank you on behalf of the community your colleagues and the community in general for the contribution unbelievable outstanding contribution you 've made to to the community of care and the council in particular and of course by a higher level as well so i simply say thank you and i give you the council of welsh council council right i say good luck in retirement i 'm sure that you won 't retire i 'm sure you 'll find something else to to go and do even there 's only improving the neighbors roses i 'm sure you 'll do that very very well so again thank you very much [Applause] could i just respond very quickly to say it 's a moment of privilege it 's also been a privilege to work with some wonderful people in our staff and with their fellow councillors so thank you very much for just for a moment i promise too long but mr may you you actually did and wonderful mentors certainly i think that on a personal level i have two pretty hard markers as one of my mentors they 're both now not with us but uh your dad obviously who gave me some fearless advice fearless and frank advice but no no more so than cyril treasurer who was a recipient of his fearless advice at different times which was which was delivered in a let us say less impactful way but i think we did benefit from that so but i 've thoroughly enjoyed most of my time within these walls and it 's changed a fair bit in that time because we we 've actually spent a few bit of our communities funds in a major refurbishment renovation in this building i think it was it was money well spent because it 's a really important council is the most important business of any community particularly rural communities there is no doubt about that people need to understand that we need to tell our communities we need to tell that story much better than what i think we do and that 's that be able to sell that message the only other thing i would like to say is that i would like to acknowledge our professional staff our staff they 're at the forefront of everything that we do particularly our outdoors they say they bear the power of any complaints and irony citizens and all the rest of it quite often they 're criticized for without understanding why they 're even being criticized i think that overall our staff are so professional and i 've mentioned it have an accessibility meeting this morning we are recognized as having good staff we recognize just trying good people because a lot of our people get punched from other overweight bigger councils or from local from other levels of government and government positions i think that that also is a is a sort of a wonderful badge of honor for us to have as far as this council 's concern we 've always had good professional staff we 've always always had sort of the worry of reappointing new stuff finding new stuff and training up new stuff because they have they have moved that the rest of you are blown in from from other places and uh and don 't worry i was called to blow in when i was a point of view it happened to blow in the appointed man of this one little shy but i think it 's really important that we do acknowledge that professionalism and staff is is why we continue to deliver for our community so and finally mr mayor congratulations on your efforts not only for the last five years but for the last 13 years but who 's counting one more year and you 've got me but but i think that and you touched on this this morning i 'll finish with this as most of you would know bill and i go back to school days we 've been we 've been mates for a while for a long time some people around this table at different times would question that because of some of the things that we 've said to each other however we 've spent many times in our younger and our youth solving the world 's problems only nice class of well it used to be in those days beer to start with bill but we did mature a little bit but the last class are red so late has been an absolute privilege to share a lot of this with you thank you thank you thank you councilman i appreciate those those comments and everything could i also add my thanks for what has been said i 'm not standing again but i am 100 sure we 're starting a new council from a great position i 'm very proud of what we 've been able to achieve over the last three four years i look around the district and think look how wonderful it looks and how good our facilities are have roads their parks everything looks good and it 's a wonderful position to start from the new council we 'll go on with it um at this stage mr mayor i 'd like to personally say to you thank you for the leniency you 've shown me with my inability to be able to attend at every meeting i very much appreciate your thoughts and i thank the councillors for their support and friendship thank you mr man thank you council around those comments and also council mother thank you for your comments sir i i and we could go online we 've got a good meeting to run but just something that some of the public galleries that got me thinking about the conversations about hard work about respect and about dignity and about a legacy uh somebody many years ago what they saw being an ideal general manager the job manager was picked up was exactly what that description was and i 'll explain more about that later on i remember that advice very very clearly but it is about the legacy for our community thank you colleagues let 's move on mr kevin i just want you to indulge in one moment because this has been recorded i 've forgotten i really should acknowledge my family the wonderful support i had from my family right through all of this thank you we move on to the we don 't really extend it and often but i will in your case mr the front door a while ago and there was they were going to bruce followed it would remember that we did lock the door prior to a council needed one occasion and cyril arrived and ran into the door and it was locked shortly after the inauguration yeah and he wasn 't happy happy mr mayor it 's 20 years since i 've been in this this room as a as a lady sitting over here so the rearranged leading range that you 've got here tonight but i 'm also very pleased to be here it is 20 years and i thought i should come back and see what the council is doing um i must say that i from the point of view of a tourist as i am now that i 've been here for the last four days i 've been around [Music] believe that the people themselves in this town are contributing to that greatly because the gardens and the lawns and the appearance of the houses around the place even my old home is just 50 years old now are looking effectively well i some involvement in some states along the line i did go to the movies last night and i didn 't have anything that hadn 't been involved i live a long way from here i 've enjoyed retirement but i always have a soft top of the camera and i do echo what you have said about council miller i can that say to you personally or you 've achieved your employment particularly the amalgamation of the two associations i know that you and i and uh harden there was that who was the the mayor of my now shelia jericho um were very keen on that happening many many years ago and i 'm very pleased i 'm sure chris could be regular thank you thank you [Applause] questions on these for assignments to try and actually record comments and questions i will sign them and pass them over confirmation administered extraordinary meeting held first in november [Music] thank you you can 't find 3.1 investments the recommendation there investments in financial report we 're happy no comments or questions i 'll put the recommendation on it in favor draft of the regional art gallery advisory committee council thank you secretary councillor fagin any comments 3.3 is the natural resource management advisory committee members for 20th of october 21 meeting i 'm the council of welsh has moved out council 's theatre right second there thank you thank you now happy to answer any questions or questions you for the recommendation i was in favor i am against you to carry emotions without notice 3.4 which is the way in the damn wall mr chairman i 'm not quite sure whether the secondary days the resolution to actually deal with it but um but certainly because this is the issue that i raised during the raising of the war the reporting in the press about have been deferred or delayed or indefinitely in all the rest of it i do notice whilst i 'm happy to move this i think it 's it 's important that we do get this letter off as quickly as we can because there 's a guidance of uncertain [Music] to complete the business case and the environmental study as quickly as i possibly that whilst as you know i 've been concerned that this was all just we see what can impact on our community and communities lower down the catchment and now that the lockland if we do not take some action as well as this is concerned so i think it is it is well firstly incumbent on us to raise it with the minister so this needs to be sorted out but we need them to commit to it in a meaningful way rather than just playing games with it yes and i absolutely agree that we and it 's become more topical in the last couple of weeks of course because we 've had a huge slide down the river and i 'm sure forbes will be very grateful if we could manage the order that we do have and we do collect better so i 'm very happy to support this recommendation and we 'll do asap i 'm sure you 've been in touch with a local member maybe to discuss this and i think that 's a good move forward and this will just reinforce our the whole river the lockland river remnants should be a little bit concerned about that because the minister has flatly denied any uh anything about the lying indefinitely and uh i did wonder whether uh the wording uncertainty regarding i 'm certainly not opposing the motion but i just thought that there might this was born about basically brought out basically because the premier had come out and made the comment that he had created speculation around exactly where the business case and the environmental impact statement was going to land and they weren 't in a real hurry the premiering reforms last week has come out indicated that the difference will continue when the environmental impact statement will continue and the government 's committed to completing that task the concern i 've said made publicly the comments i 've made has been that i 'd be concerned that it might get off the end of some bureaucratic whirlpool which or my i think was a term i used and therefore it 'll take a long time to to come to the surface and i think that this recommendation really the business case and the environmental impact statement need to be addressed it 's the only way you can have any fair rational conversation about the merits if you actually look at all the issues and have them assessed properly for any development and take away the emotions that individuals or groups may have that have a single perspective of the dam council of australia raise the issue of the flooding and of course that is very expensive and forks are getting wet and if the weather forecast is right the next rest of this weekend that might get wet again but a lot of people are also saying there 's a significant amount of water that is going down the the river and there 's an opportunity to put some of that away for a metaphorical rainy day um intriguingly is on the public record where i 'm intriguingly on reportedly likely that there were people down the bottom end who are not in favor of the damn they 're now going to cook about their roads getting flooded so you 're not going to win mother nature will should be strongly supporting and we should be putting out now in this conversation to the wall as long as we can for the comments yes i support it because and you highlighted the premier spectrum in a matter of ten days of what he said was indefinitely but there was looking forward to business and so forth we need a um a concise report brought back to as to why or not that it can be built because if it just goes on as a it 's been delayed indefinitely and it 's not being not being raised even the no wall campaign hasn 't won because they haven 't their cases haven 't been proved right or wrong and then the people that want them all raised their cases haven 't_''_2913.92 been proven right or wrong and it also goes a bit further along that the government 's got this they 've got a policy of more water security within the basin new south wales so if this isn 't going to go ahead because the cases aren 't and don 't stack up business based environmental study 's just bringing a bit of conclusion to what they 're doing not just making announcements an election thank you mr chairman and really i 'm not confused bureaucracy that 's causing the problem here there is a lot of double speed going on about this particular issue we need to try and get to the bottom of that and therefore we need to impress well i don 't make any apologies for the wording of this i think we should be really strong about it and we should seek some applications because the resolution 4.2 which is the end of term report the council endorsing andrew councillor smith 's going to do that i 've got to write the night council as head counselor council smith he wants to speak thank you smith it 's the state government that we produce an end of term report which looks at how well we have done on our community strategic plan and of course that 's part of our delivery plan and our one year plan and i think it 's actually a really good opportunity for us to look back what we can do better but i i think it 's full of very exciting positive reading and i won 't take the time now to go through even any particular instances of it but i 'll i 'll certainly recommend that anyone in the public would do well to have a look and just see the the breadth and depth of uh what council gets involved in across the australia thoroughly endorsed councillor smith 's comments and also urge our ratepayers our citizens of the town and district to uh please take a look at this and it gives you some idea of the scope of council 's operations and the amount of work that goes into it and there also some indication of where the money goes thank you for the comments mr chairman i could just be really cheeky and say it 's a terrific report there 's no doubt about that but it confirms the comments on that about we are involved in all aspects of our community 's lives but but compared to our levels of government is an excellent report when you when you completion of the promises and all the rest of it it 's an excellent report and confirms the comments on that about our staff thank you council for the comments the head can devise the heart can want it but unless someone actually does it it doesn 't happen so that 's where the start comes you 're going to just start coming to the side it is a good report flexible on everybody every councillors staff but all that but also our community as well so the comments i reply put the resolution over your favor again declare carry um yes that was uh this is actually uh i think this is a really good paper and i 'm really pleased to see the business chamber is actually going down this path to involve some more businesses in encouraging people to come to cara and to actually develop a lifestyle choice and that 's what we offer a very good lifestyle choice and i 'm really encouraged that this is actually going to point that out not only do we have businesses and manufacturing in a great deal of that 's something we can offer to people who may be looking for an out and i think it 's an ideal time to do that and i think i congratulate the chamber and i 'm sure that the business people and the tourism organisation will be supporting this as we go along congratulations and well done council smith council has and for a long time has had a really positive working relationship with the business chamber and with the tourism industry as well and i think that that is one of the reasons for um the success of a lot of projects that have been carried out in the show i certainly endorse the statement earlier that the business chamber does liaise with the tourism staff and board and i noted in the background to this report there was mention of piggybacking on that very successful get chris to carry campaign the business the tourism corporation certainly has a lot of excellent drone footage which i 'm sure could be made available as well so i think that this is an exciting thing i think if we get even live here and so on it 'll be more than worth the money that is spent so i look forward to the showcasing of this fabulous show the comments yes i strongly support that and i uh also very aware of the fact that a lot of our visitors have come by our tourism um uh also interest in what 's this town and uh many there are many people now in residence in their town who actually came here love the look of the town and they 've stayed what we do need though is hopefully to attract some of the uh people who are more in the employment age group we barely need various firms i 've talked to around town badly need uh uh extra start and uh we uh we also um do hope that uh as council smithers says forget christopher campaign uh running off the back of that i think could have uh quite a deal of merit so i think i certainly endorse this and we will also discuss this at our board meeting on wednesday night as i mentioned earlier that 's of the first farmers market meeting i went to uh speaker there and explaining how you run a farmers market and if you 're selling something you need a lot of beers and people see it and it gets people to your table and so forth and they 've seen what you 've got and so forth and this is what we need to do with this advertising program we need to keep power in front of the public in front of the people so it 's not just um rms and so forth where the media live we 've got to get them out um looking at the areas and around those cities and our money converted we 've got plenty of land we 've got plenty of water and we have our we have opportunities we 've got uh one major machinery manufacturer that 's that 's supplying um farm machinery to the world it is italy that is still continuing to manufacture there and there 's plenty of other organized other businesses in town that feed off that and um and like there 's already that being for the we 've had a bit of the uh i think we 've got a rather good residential um response to the to what 's to what 's going on with is the lack of services i read the in a report where they 've sort of where they all work in the same area that we sort of haven 't gone back to the care of terrorism development type thing and it 's a bit of uh you know we have put a lot of money into the tourism but it 's sort of a sub entity of the karashi and we need to keep that up that at the forefront but the business campaign can work with them but the businesses um need their own identity so they 're going to get lost in the tourism and i think it was a good report on the television of the night by the tourism manager when he said with canal selling so well that we 'll be looking for farmers to save plenty of it next year so they 've got plenty of canals for business to come versa at the moment the funding that we 're giving the business compared to tourism looks lopsided but it 's a completely different operation under council banner because the tourism i commend thank you mr chairman i 'll i 'll just pick up on that point because i think it needs to be made business is very important there 's no doubt about it we should support it and all the rest of it but simply because we 've got a report here that that might be a bit lopsided about funding for tourism and not in the business community if you go back through the records here and see how much support there has been for trying to develop and bring business to this town the money that we paid to tourism passed into insignificance to be honest with you and the gentleman over here would would know that better than any office i think the the contribution that was made to when edgel 's closed in particular and that the heartlake that went through this town at that stage to be able to continue to function here was successful because of the efforts made by the councils of the day so it 's an ongoing role and we should not forget him to simply just pick on a particular set of numbers to suddenly so whilst i support this i think we shouldn 't forget the history of this place and why it 's continue to function as successful as it has i 'm happy to support the recommendation but i want to make a couple of comments if i can partly back up on what council has said because one thing that 's troubling sometimes is this urban myth out there the council doesn 't do it for business and there 's everything every time something goes wrong or half a miss and it 's always council 's fault and i think that is grossly unfair and it 's grossly inaccurate there 's still urban myths around big w and over the myths about the area that i have coming to town and a whole range of things been here for many years and knowing people before me the amount of work that 's gone into trying this council by councils is enormous so i 'm happy to support this that 's what we should do but i think we need to get the record out of the record straight i would like to think that as a result of this we will have a report a council without here or not the council will have a report on probably a couple of things to follow up unless the success of the campaign and the relationship between tourism and additional chamber in terms of this campaign being being rolled out this is public money so we need to have some further ongoing assessments but i think in the interest i 'm quite happy to support it i 'll make those observations as we go forward further comments right reply not necessarily i think everyone had a good say and i being one of the members of this panel thank you thank you councillors would recall that for most of the life of the community grants program one of the categories involved was the natural resource management category and up to a thousand dollars was offered for community years that function has really been taken up by the natural resource management committee and their small environmental grants that they have been very successfully dialing up so the committee for the last more than a year really has been workshopping a new category and we thought that with hopefully the opening up the continued opening up of restrictions that a category for new community events would fit the bill and by that we mean events that have never been held before by a particular group in this particular community i think that it will be quite a popular category i already know of three new events in woodstock area that very [Music] 5.1 is releasing those decisions moved the council of mello councillor voted thank you house to keep him with the resolution i was in favor against declaring carrie 5.2 the annual report we adopt the annual report for the year end of 30 june 2021 yeah a little bit better thank you council right i think um it 's been stated already um by the councils that we had a good result for the year we 've normal organisation activities up to date as well as help with the cable and 19 problems that we had to face and comment that i take out of the report by the order was the uh of the work of the staff to uh to help with the order which was held remotely and answers come back very quickly the staff was able to identify the question and supply the answer in the shortest possible time so we can continue on with the audit and the bit i like is that we met all the government regulated timelines for watching the various [Music] to have a look at uh particularly i thought very interesting the performance measures on page 224 and 246 and the report on council infrastructure sorry the report then the annual report okay [Music] once again this gives how um once again this gives an excellent uh rundown on what uh council has been involved in and as i said before i do urge people to take a take a close look at it and particularly particularly those who sort of wish for things that um you it 's um when you take a look at that report you can see the council has been very very active and also once again we thank our staff for the uh the input they 've had in particular have the general manager can bring that back to our council staff we 've already mentioned the parks and gardens for example and the also the the sporting ovals they look absolutely fantastic and also once again um i congratulate them also for the way in which the rose garden and the area around the visit the center is presented so yeah that 'll work for the comments if i would just say this is an excellent report and everyone should look at it i love the way it 's been put together and i congratulate the staff because i think they 've done a terrific job of presenting it in a very professional manner um also i 'd just really like to say thank you very much for putting in the photo of all of us five years ago and i don 't think we 've engaged at all so it it 's a great report and i can get that stuff on the presentation and i 'm sure um anyone who wants to know what we have in the future where we 've been um it will be very helpful for anyone who wants to know what we 're up to so thank you um look i 'm happy to support the recommendation that any comment i 'd make is that it should be should be compulsory reading for the community if you want to know what council has been doing and what we 're up to and what 's been transpiring over a period of five years in terms of a whole lot of issues which some cases miraculously get raised at certain times of the council 's term uh further comments mr chairman i i i can be a little bit political because i 'm not really should be aware of and read that before they 're aware of what has been done what has been achieved and what is included because it is a really good document but it also helps to take away from some the candidates what people sitting in this room accepted but there is some some statements that are being made at times which you think will i don 't know whether they live here or whether they 're aware of what the council has done and what 's been achieved they should make known to themselves before they make comments about aspirations that have already been achieved in any respect and consider the comment did i reply the only thing to try and get me out of the way [Music] foreign which is the earning the completion of the financial statements against the snf council of welsh thank you councils already in this council now but of course uh by the board of her leanne so i 'll be very brief um the order of the thanks the council staff for the manner in which um they have managed the finances and the manner in which they approach the audit given the difficulties with the permanent closure and the need to do that remotely and i would like to add and i 'm sure i add on behalf of all my and the director and all his staff we are a small and not terribly rich rural council we don 't have lots of money from mining or any other particular thing and affects a lot of very prudent management to keep us in the black and that 's something that the staff do and that the councillors do as well i i have to admit that the big whip that the staff bring to us which is basically saying if you want to do something else you need to look at what it is you 're not going to do is is effective and it 's important as well because we don 't have a lot of money to spend so the only other thing that i would mention is one of the categories in which we didn 't meet those local government benchmarks and in all important aspects we far exceeded those and sometimes double those benchmarks but um the percentage of our own source revenue that we were had available this year went down considerably i just want to point out that in fact our own source revenue that we were fortunate fortunate enough and applied appropriately enough to get large increases in grant funding including as we know the weigh-in water treatment plant that made that ratio look not so good but in fact our revenue did increase so with that i will commend and not for the first time during this meeting the financial uh report second richard yes thanks for watching one of the things i do just draw attention to is that we are in one area they 're given a operating result if with range included and uh i just draw people 's attention to the fact that the net result without france 's is one one million 162 000 which makes quite a difference to our bottom line and i think that means bearing in mind when there 's no great certainty about grant funding or the amount of ground funding being available in the future the other thing was that just as i tried to mention earlier it 's very interesting for everyone to take a look at the performance measures and in particular the report on council 's infrastructure and order and otherwise i 'd just like to say that i think there 's an excellent result and that 's a it 's a tribute to the good management of our staff and also supported by the i make councils certainly the comment that is made that is attributed significantly to the management of the staff but i think you counselors are showing yourselves the discipline and the respect that you 've also shown to what we 're doing give yourself some confidence against deterrent 5.4 page 247 which is the order i 'm sorry the draft minutes of the order committee meeting the ordinary meeting of the [Music] coming to the uh direct committee before the council and um certainly not the uh doing the rx committee but uh i said either the timing of when we have meetings since the next meeting something to march or something next year and i think the general manager might have alluded to the way the office of label government wanted to celebrate and we don 't get we weren 't there to make any uh judgments on it before the council and what the excellent explanation was and i said before we 've not even got a downtime and we 're able to see that tightness and other than that and other than that update we 've been able to manage that successfully and work with the community to [Music] to handle the outbreaks plus keep the community as safe as we can and i think it was highlighted at the aquatic center when there was a case reported from there it wasn 't from there but an infected person had been to the pool and they had to close it and do a deep clean but then they realized the staff were in there 's any other questions uh i 'm trying to answer them i 'd love to thank you councillor i just want to draw one thing to your attention colleagues and that 's 9.4.2 page 257 which refers to the voter 's intention to stand down his grand reflection has been a highly regarded and highly respected member of the committee has decided that he will stay until such time as the guidelines are apparent around the to pursue involvement in these sorts of committees as a result of that in an ongoing form and did give a number of reasons most that probably are compatible with the reasons this chamber is put forward on a number of occasions but also as well as his concern about the potential again i think being not being identified about any decisions that the committee may make and without my leaving and insurance issues so i think just note that my colleagues and i 'm sure the general manager and the director we 're raising that again as we move forward in the new council to deal with that matter of comments replied put the resolution i was in favor against declare carried item 5.5 youth council representative recommendation therefore to allow some continuing involvement only for that youth representative councillor for again taking the council michael knows right any comments who 's happy no i 'm fine you declared all right i was just going to say that there will be 16 applications for youth council which is the largest number we 've ever had and very pleasing and a couple of days with that as a youth council end of year presentation counsellor up and i would be involved in and the planning workshops for next year 's 10-year anniversary so there 's a lot that goes on thank you thank you and i think it was a good one can i just say that i 'm sure council the right smith would do a fantastic job on ongoing looking after the youth council and i 'm very pleased that they put their hand up and thank them very much for their ongoing support because otherwise it could not be happening thank you for the comments and thank you colleagues item 6.1 director infrastructure operations cara river will upgrade projects [Music] people know that the river is very low they can see the amount of sand that 's uh around that area there and the sand is continually continually moving whenever there 's a rise in the river it tends to move very quite a bit and uh is everything okay good but it moves quite a bit and that the measures that have been taken by our give ourselves a a a pumping area which does not fill up with sand and also filling up with sand will cause tremendous wear and tear on their pumps so um uh well done that was all i can say and i do hope the the solutions you 've got there i do hope they work thank you because we know that there 's been so much drama on the river in the well and it 's great that dirk 's arrived and he 's taken her on board and come up with a solution this report gives us a brief history of the things that have happened and down in the infiltration and the well and the ability to get good quality water supply to the town um so thank you dirk and i 'm you know when i started reading and i said the other day i was a bit worried that we i was really thinking oh don 't don 't tell me you can 't work maybe and then we got to the end and dirk seems to have solved some of the problems and we they 'll work for us in the in the coming in the future and make it much easier for us to access the river at all times um with and without plugs so um congratulations and thank you for this report for the comments yes this is a very crucial part of the water supply system for town i think all three directors that i 've been involved with in operation and infrastructure in my time with council has always stated that the water we take [Music] [Music] please please right there keep going polluted environmental contamination once again i use the wrong word but well let 's let 's go i mean we have to clean up a type of water that 's not fit for drinking and we do it very good but if we can reduce what comes into it private pumping it also helps and an inland water person on the radio this week indicated the reason why the low level bridge is flooded more times this year than normal is that the riverbed has risen from the extra sand so when you put the same little bridge quicker so therefore we have more sand to operate here with i thought it was of a good design of my statement so i 'm trying to get back but it 's just an ongoing thing we haven 't got a very good we haven 't got the best pump site but we have to find a way of pre-cleaning a little bit of the of the sand and every hour before it goes into our filtration system and i recommend the uh the current directive of the work thank you for the comments do i for the comments in favor right now 6.3 is the 355 committee of the jail yards council right i 'm sure you 're like thank you i 'm happy to second that any comments or questions yes i find um i 'm very pleased that mr armstrong is in the gallery today because as a producer member of the science committee it was my first introduction to mr armstrong as a member of the council and he come over with the financial report we had a printout of all the expenses and and um going on from that he uh i had the pleasure of chairing this meeting so we wouldn 't know what what 's going to come out of it and um we said they 're on track the financial figures are on track that their incomes is down slightly to reduce stock numbers the truck wash continues to generate good income for us and um because of the needs of the trucking industry that have clean trucks to transport and stock um but we also feel confident that leaving the numbers uh behind target a little bit now they will continue to to be a higher average in the weekly sales and we can because we won 't_''_5260.4 we 're going to see the drop off over summer and early orders is in some years that could be wrong we are facing a lot of competition from from the remote auctions and options plus plus direct sales to meat works there was reports that um some 13 000 lambs from this area looked into a process export processor in december january delivery because the price they 're offering they of what the game we in we have maintained a facility over there for any producer that presents stock for sale and we have a good competition in buyers and we 're regarded as a good sale by owl just going on for the truck washing there 's a bit further down there i 'm pretty sure when a little bit of clarification there was talking under the um transport trucks have to collect them in europe from the from their load and it 's become obvious that trucks on long loads have been been pulling into our truck wash and just dumping the incentive system out of there out of their trucks while while the stock is still on so they 're not washing them out and they haven 't washed away the airflow so the next person comes on the washer has to do it and apparently there is a system being installed throughout the state of the trucks to come in and dump them into a facility similar to what caravans do and the management and our staff we 're going to look into that to see if we would need to upgrade our existing infrastructure they 're handling that sort of thing so that 's uh just a bit of background there thank you very much just uh there are a couple of questions and one of the best about that but it wasn 't_''_5403.04 about the actual truck wash washed apartments about the safety issues the trip hazards and i think that this has raised the general business so i guess they need to be addressed is the intention to address those asap not just that the other one is the pedestrian railways at the end of assailant papers levy again it 's a safety issue is something i 've not seen that before being identified so i just wonder what is proposed to be done there as well i think just one question and it 's really about the yard covers um is there is there um grant funding available for those sorts of things took a while to determine exactly what colours they want how they might work designs are now being done so now the process of getting a briefing from the to try and identify grant funding for those particular covers which should be shade over the spectators and the buyers and so forth no i i for i just want the great funding business available we 're not sure we 've made available that the hiccup has been getting a proposal formulated in a way that actually have design and some costumes that enable us to go for grant funding that 's been a little bit slow process and i believe that will then give us a chance to talk to our state and we 're going to be people about and we 'll get other options as well in terms of uh fraternity and australian organisations as to where they 've got to get funding available the question on the trip hazard or the trips um i would think that that would be something regarded with something of inoperational matters [Music] and there 's been some conversations around is there a way of being able to redesign or remodel the yard in such a way that that the sellers the buyers the vendors can actually move through the sale as soon as the camera falls and the lanes cleared then the truck industry start moving stock out of the lane and feel this conflict between stock and people so whether whether that becomes if you 've got not to say that the sales overall the lane speed or something like that i just wondered mr chairman in asking those questions i 'm not saying that on here that 's so whether there 'll be a further report on those because some of them will need expenditure yeah some won 't obviously something will be addressed because they are operational stuff the [Music] operators they want to go a bit quicker and other times and sometimes there is grants available two covers side yards um that 's good uh lost one round in rails they got some money um yes [Music] is the upset gutters in the yards aren 't um there 's something into the yards where we walk around from one lane in the next lane and um the supervisor knocked out over there and suggested that we number the yards opposite what we have now and we of the gutters don 't work because the trees have upset things now and the cement 's cracked up in different areas but we 've been tired uh [Music] favor against declaration six point four is the traffic committee this is the second difference i 'll get a second and then i 'll you know just start questions little estimate whilst the committee did move a couple of times and seeking advice remotely it was the first face to face without for a considerable time because it concluded our deliberations that we need to be our new uh council representative chosen sometime next year early next year but any any questions i don 't have a question i actually would like to change some of the recommendations slightly sorry um just if we could include the the special events name the carrot again called fundraising walk that just doesn 't make any sense well that 's i 'm happy the council approves the clustering special event the current agreement for fundraising walk it with the town mapping and i 'm just wondering if are they going to offer suggestions for will respond to the correspondent not provide the corresponding damn map and to respond to the corresponding town map and um my question is um and suggestions for other suitable locations [Music] mr chairman just a clarification as far as that is concerned that that was dealt with again that came to the access committee this morning as well and i was able to inform the access committee that it was dealt with at the traffic committee that in response to your direct question it 's really this past and the intention of the public committee was that we would write to the letter writer indicating that all of the current disabled spaces in cara and there are significant number 1304 or whatever it is that they all meet the current regulations and therefore we we 're not we don 't think this was the expenditure of changing those to something that would not meet those regulations we 're reluctant indicating to this lady that there are airport alternatives to that as in parallel parking very close to the proximity to the street we would send the suggested areas uh also indicated because as i indicated earlier there 's a police representative on the committee as well their indication is that in some cases if they 're obviously not parking dangerously in 45 degree parking areas as you know disabled if you hold a disabled sticker you 're able to park in a normal parking zone and so overstay the the signage as far as the timing is concerned as long as it 's not apart dangerously in those they may take up two car parks i hear that appreciate what was there the police have understanding of that and certainly won 't be important so we think this is a senseless thank you [Applause] um um what we normally do regarding paying an amount of money that enables them to cover with insurance there will also be some improvements at the pool as listed here whereby delighted to see that they 're able to put in salt filters of filtration plants so that because that will greatly reduce the cost they have for chemicals i 've thoroughly endorsed this and i think it 's a great way of assisting the donation of 8544 dollars is coming out of a a pool that only has about two thousand left here um perhaps the director might explain how that 's going to work [Music] thank you very much um it was the 20th anniversary of the accessibility being created unfortunately initial chair and certainly one of the main drivers is resolutions that will come out of those bidders uh that meeting and to the only reporter to council to probably next thank you mr chairman and uh as someone at this table we know it 's gary start 's contribution to all things as far as access is concerned not just people in wheelchairs but but everybody believe that you all should be treated as one but you 'll all have the same opportunities just accessing all of the facilities of this wonderful town in china and we should make that disease as possible so he was certainly part of the investigations into the access committee when it was first formed as a system and we traveled around all over the place to sort of pinch ideas and and even as plagiarized their uh their initial plan and all the rest of it and built on that and i think we 've received achieved a whole lot of good things over the last 20 years because gary 's contribution we should acknowledge the 20-year anniversary and the smart goals here will come up at the resolution so that the resolution has been moved here acknowledging the wonderful contributions accessibility within this township and there will be an access committee meeting next year where it will probably all come to council in terms of some sort of ongoing recognition so what you 're dealing with the mayor writes on behalf of the council to to get on the symphony back to to acknowledge his wonderful service to the community yes does anybody need further conversation on that urgent matters well i guess that 's the end of the 2016 the class of 2016 in open council so i 'll

Wiggins as mining up tonight that I am reading laterally to support this resolution I think the president should even consider his position and that might be what I was on Robinson as far as this is concerned and resign I know that that might be popular with some and certainly young one posted on can 't have this debate that we guess what would be your first of all that that 's the circumstance to the argument commander or well I do feel strongly about this but if lunches were to hang up for counsel exceptional circumstances absolutely Arizona but boot in there to to have a young to apply for leave think in this case as I say and because of the performance over the last of three years that this doesn 't support further comment yes mr. mayor I also reluctantly find it very difficult to support this recommendation because well I believe that counselor Witte tried very dipping to in the first 12 months I think he found the between the work commitments he may have a cetera he may well have found the last few years that 's very difficult to village council role and I believe that was 15 months still to run on the on the on this council now that actually you should really consider where the resignation I 've kept it away over resolving his problem any further comment I wish to speak yes kept it right there you hand up mr. chairman I find it very difficult for any as a councilman to make it come even on another councillors performance because I 've I 'm often questioned by people on my performance so I don 't think we 're here to make sessions to his performance um I think what a what when he works out of the area previously makes it very difficult to get to meetings and and it 's often said it 's a sort of a semi-retired or someone that 's in a business in town where they can get a bit more flexible they get to get the meetings and I think if this business I presume is in care of if it does get up and going you might be able to you will have some more time to attend meetings and so forth just try to give him the benefit of the doubt at the moment I feel thank you any any further comments Arielle admitted me for the comments I think this is a give you a situation and I do think that this council doesn 't need to consider his position however I think that we have been asked to determine on a I request to leave of absence and council the periodic table Corinthian so much as we don 't understand the full circumstances so I think there needs to be some conversations been taking place in some serious consideration is being to actually it 's the community you actually decide these things and I think that 's something we need to keep in keep in mind that said I think that there needs to be some huge consideration given for the comments write reply yes mr. mayor I I acknowledge all the contributions of all the counselors I acknowledge that counselor Wheaties record of attending council meetings and other meetings is not a great record that being said looking at the reasons that have been given for the request for leave of absence which are a new business which is impacted by the co mid-nineteen situation that is that particular situation is what prompted me to move this resolution I would certainly were there any further requests or any further history post this three month period of non-attendance I would certainly be asking council what the legal grounds are for that councilors removal but in the meantime I think that the counselor himself needs to consider his position and whether he is in a position to make any commitment or any positive positiveness to the business of counsel and the Shire resolution Thank You councillor Smith I will put the resolution I was in favor of lips I believe have something granted for three months I know against I 'll be clear that one carry thank you move on to item number one of the services investments we recommend direction they 're noticing in business financial report basic intuitive director okay so would counsel the pagan use your waving or yep I was thinking that thank you very much counselor Walsh yes mr. mayor and I spoke at State last week to the director actually and that 's my question relates to page 19 the investments portfolio and I my question was that I 'm aware of that a sum of money that was lodged on the fourth of April or the fourth years the fourth of April about the same time as a number of our investments within a week have been also lodged and you know at that stage two percent over eight months was available now I 'm just wondering if the director can suggest to us why counsel with their greater amounts are unable to you know in mind that the 2% was with one of the with st. Georges Bank which is an arm of Westpac so it 's not as though not as a sum of money so any money lenders any money borrowers at least this the director 3mp or manager the director happy to answer that question through the chair yes I am [Music] in these circumstances with our investment portfolio regarded by our investment policy normal size of local government act when a term deposit expires the finance staff reviewing the available institutions rates on that particular day with regards to the some George rate on that particular day I did have a member of the finance team calls and George and asked them about the particular 2% we were informed that by son George that that rate was a special covert 19 rate that was only offered to existing clients for a short period of time as we weren 't a son George client at that time we wouldn 't have been informed or aware of that rate so we basically go for the the best rate available on that day answer your question capital walk thank you and well as Council to consider approval of the of the of the recommendation he 's further comments or questions on on this resolutions ii ii wish to speak at all just about time the rotaries we 're up a little bit on last year I 'm just wondering we 've got five hundred and thirty thousand one hundred ninety seven thousand outstanding and their arrangements have been made and we put all I know we do make arrangements to pay is it we must contact the lots of people to talk about this do we or do they we wait for them to contact us is that how it works I 'm not quite sure how they 're written arrangements to pay the repayment schedule through the chair it 's a combination of both councillor Fagan customers can either reach out to our rates department and speak about their individual circumstances or we do have a initial contact where we in circumstances will call particular pictures like line so we actively manage these rebates they 're written careers throughout an office not other discussion well we do have people that send out their rate notices another organization so we are first through the chair in the first instance our rates team do handle it themselves if we do need to escalate or you know progress the matter we can call on our collection agency thank you any further comments or questions on this matter rod required for necessary resolution all those in favor all right and to be clear carried item number two corporal services the donation request really on Country Club Pedro mr. James Thank You councillor Miller I 'm second to please go to hand-up Thank You Chancellor Milliken speak at all mr. chairman on that big fellow councils again much convincing of this I think we were all aware of the contribution we built on country club that provides to not only build a gun but the surrounding districts as well and extremely important have access for a decent to this bastard so

should have happened a bit earlier but to have has been overlooked and it 's something we 've done every year and I see no reason not to not to do the same thing as we have in previous years thank you also all rod require probably missus Arial put the resolution all those in favor I 'm sorry against claret Karen thank you item number four policy with small changes which are attractive for our information they move counselor Smith Thank You councillor Miller dude I think counsel Walsh got his hand up before Minister me in the middle screen to say thank you thank you pick the end up councillor walls mr. mayor I think it 's it 's fairly self-explanatory and I I do note that from now on we will be updating this policy every four years which i think is very prudent the changes are of a relatively minor nature I believe I just have one question if I may which is regarding page 36 38 of the iPad it 's sick she 's headed approved investments and in the sickness what dot points that point section six and it 's in the second paragraph of section 6 yep all investments a bid must be denominated in Australian dollars here and and there 's a new date there July 2008 has changed to the 12th of January 2011 and I 'm just wondering through you to the director why you live back nine years something some may argue we 're moving forward a belief that was the last ministerial investment order which needed to be referenced okay thank you thank you thank you any further questions or comments councillor Smith you happy second if ii wish to speak no other than just to say that this is something which gives guidelines to both counselors and also our staff and our town councils money should be invested and it 's very prudent follow it any further comments all right the director Bob assume this caters for electronic investments so forth rector through the chair can I can I just clarify what the council is asking is that the electronic transfer of well once once I presume you would have went to the bank and deposit in account but now everything 's done electronically and you would you have two signatures or to authorize the payoff just making sure that this is covered in this policy that electronic deposits in recently returns a layer so through the chair all our funds these days are electronically transferred I 'm not I can 't tell you offhand I have to take that I 'll notice if my last read of it so if we do have a two-tiered security sign-off process where funds are authorized through a level a level the signatory thank you an evil try that you 're in a yellow frame counselor that was all a for the comments that 's just you know I don 't know what the other frame comes up newest and most any any further comments rod replies don 't necessary I 'll put the resolution those in favor hi again Saudi player carried you now go to the item number five is a word wealth and safety policy will move mr. chairman thank you Thank You mr. chairman and whilst there is none this is going through the help that countless Health and Safety Committee and it 's been endorsed by them and recommended approval to council I think for the important there 's only one charge really but it 's quite quite an important one if we look at it which is just doesn 't point out their responsibilities that we as council of the elected representatives of their communities them do hard as far as on on good health practices and good safety practices and something that we 're doing very mindful of for a long time but I think probably in the current situation where we 're going actually spend emic at the man that 's really important Thank You counsel Fagan I know note that the WHS guidelines have been deleted from this policy which I think it 's probably appropriate as it goes into as those we 've got quite a lot of detail and we 're a specific to different members of staff he 's um somebody explain to me or just generally why they were and removed from the policy young man injured you 're the director sorry mr. Jones fix the dinner managers review through the chair and happy for their general manager to chime in then my understanding is it 's a simplification of the policy the policy does refer and is covered does cover those items in the WHS guidelines thank you it 's just to be a clarification comment encounter the Millers writing speaking at best but I didn 't read that those really highlight the counsel better oh just a question just following on from that answer that is this policy on behalf of counsel than this counsel of Miller said it 's counsel responsibility and that 's highlighted in red print there and the ones that have been the WHS guideline that 's been removed sort of putting the responsibility on the staff who asked to implement them it should be under a different policy of as you say what I would that help counsel Fagin oh I got it it 's fine I understood why clarify yeah Thank You counselors so the comments reply I 'll put the resolution all those in favor again study clear carried next item is the water of utilize the allocation update there for receiving and no dings move that particular resolution or something different um it 's got a hand up through some of those have they end up for a second that please whose second counselor Peter right or kapha notes I was Catholic guess what I was thank you Michael it 's been hard on voices sometimes on this without a seeing a body movement on the screen father I can see it and the shoulders and its own moves their hand twists like we normally do in the chair councillor Smith you speak this at all and mr. Mehra it 's it 's great that we get this update regularly once a month of approximately and the key things to to note from a fairly lengthy report that as of current circumstances there are no changes to any allocations from the to is the Lachlan regulated River the source so that means that despite some inflows and the hundred percent allocation for towns and villages the seventy percent allocation where water life by security water licenses and so on will continue I think it 's important to note that the management of this group is still looking at a drought policy looking at what may happen if there are no or very little inflows into the catchment and that in that case then the river would run dry around February of next year and that there are continually plans in Inc in what 's the word there are there are plans for various contingents moment is that there is no change to allocation and that there is no change through levels of power for example and indeed no change for those who are on the leg Rowland 's pipeline so to comment second who should speak at all no any further comment oh yes mr. chairman um it 's a quiet yeah there 's quite a detailed report I 'm interesting to read on the second paragraph of page 56 the nymph lag deficit of 345 gigalitres has occurred apparently nature 's not keeping up with what computer system I 'm generating enough water but I think it is heartening of the increase in water into wine globe and the research part three quarters of it 1925 gigalitres in the last fortnight after in Lake Mills rainfall makes the profile and the cats but could be wet enough that any minor fall they are could generating seems to be coming through on the sound someone someone just make sure I 'm caught on an Israeli Amman please I got a mute that 's got rid of it right yep yep thank you determine which world numbers all thank you I 'm finite with the dam at the mammaries for in percent but I don 't go to change the world music while the outlook on where they 're managing things I am going or threw me into a meeting next week with the very department so there may be some more updates on this to come come the council meeting mister how far out they 're planning to run the river and what under what circumstances I 'll continue to run the river in terms with water so the comment I 'll reply but the resolution always in favor aye against if there carries item number one for indirect immigrant metal services the naming renaming of bridges roads streets and places as a recommendation there I 'll move it mr. Chairman I think counts on the Fagin thank you there 's three council milla firstly the disliked ice threw you to the director just today or make a comment I suppose them get a response to it and it 's in the pricey of this recommendation where it talks about naming a place which the geographical names boards requirements now my understanding is that the geographical name school have guidelines and its guidelines not requirements it 's a it 's a it 's a body 's probably being a bit pedantic here but as you as we would all know we 've had some interesting sort of exchanges with the geographical base board from time to time and I just wondered about that that 's all just a just a gem sorry three chair it 's just a general term to say it to stake that it 's in accordance with all of the requirements as detailed by the geographical names board not all of that is in guidelines but it is but I can show it certainly change that exact I 've just I just pointed that out and thank you I 'm decided right I 'm very happy with the with the policy and I think the policy very clearly shows it 's about you know there are some requirements but also the a lot of it is guidelines and that we need to consult and do all that not very comfortable of Z this of other exchange we 've had in the past I just want to make that point yes here so I don 't_''_2034.83 I think we should it 's just there are a couple other minor changes mr. mayor or not and I think that this is a good good appetite of the policy and we shouldn 't posture yep Thank You Council develop the secondary speak justice begging your fine any other comments oh yeah can I just I do can you pair with Bruce on that even when you 've read through it it does all through it it says that they are only God I know it 's a moot point that it should I think it 's through the chair it 's not it 's a lot of information off the website its daddy 's just I 'm happy to change it but I 'm it 's not I 'm not referring just to the guidelines thank you but a comment murmurs happy with the word how it is the second that 's happy here it is so I guess if someone 's got a further comment glide reply mr. Chapman just very briefly I 'm very careful with the response to me I thought I got the question I ask again study clear carried there are no late reports notices of motion we need to do if I could mr. chairman just following on from that work safety policy and that and said that Council is going to provide adequate materials for a safe workplace net just with this pandemic thing is there any increase in what 's needed a budget allocation for safe workplaces I 'm sure that that 'll be sparse general managers commentary when he comes back to Council of speech question in the evening about what what the impact from the cops have been on Cabot I don 't know mr. Chamberlain yes it would be broken certainly add that in the third quarter budget review Council adopted the council Midland the 27th of April there was a provision for in this financial year for some of that expenditure required to bring us up to speed from the hygiene level for the funding for the staffing of the flu an amount of money in the budget that 's been thank you now notice emotion roads businesses make a motion to close those account closed excuse me mostly closed the meeting to the public in order to consider in accordance with of course they know the access the following is one item with 10 to the 1 of the act from the Directory infrastructure operations enclosed committee something this is Kara Visitors Center license or reserve one _"

    "text": "[Music] [Music] [Music] number 12 prisoner of war and internment group was built at cara in 1941. it was no different from any of the other pow camps scattered around australia [Music] it followed the same dole routine day after day week after week year after year [Music] except one day something happened there which became part of local and national history the war came to cairo [Music] the kara breakout on the 5th of august 1944 ended with the deaths of 234 japanese and 5 australians and the destruction of 21 buildings by fire why did this happen the coward camp at central new south wales was officially known as number 12 prisoner of war and internment group there were four separate compounds a and c were for italians b for japanese and d which was separated into three areas was for japanese officers koreans and chinese who were part of the japanese forces and italian fascists the camp commenced operation in june 1941 firstly with italian civilian internees who were processed and quickly released and then with italian prisoners of war from the north african campaigns [Music] with troops finished their high speed retreat down the gang tank of a troop ship in australia as they head for the commonwealth internment camp each man is issued with an army great coat dyed red and a tin panicking [Applause] none of the prisoners claims to be fascist an italian officer described them as king 's men okay king 's men but you 're just a lot of black shirts to us anyway they 'll have plenty of time behind the barbed wire to think the whole thing over maybe they 'll discover they belong to the aussies for the duration the italians were generally well behaved and were put to work cutting wood for fuel and working on local farms they were well liked around cower and would throw small gifts to the local children as they drove out on work parties inside their compounds they grew vegetables made handcrafts and even taught local carrot builders new skills [Music] there were many talented singers and musicians and they performed plays and italian operettas [Music] [Music] a small but dangerous group of italian black shirt fascists were kept separately under sailors as well as indonesian political prisoners and their families were also interned at kaura they were brought to australia after the japanese invaded dutch indonesia but was soon released when it was realised that they posed no threat [Music] in 1943 the tide was turning against the japanese australian and u.s forces pushed them back along the kokoda trail and many prisoners were taken they were starving and suffering from tropical disease but after capture they were fed and given the same medical treatment as the australian troops jab wounded left to die by their comrades are brought in by australians out on patrol these are sidelights from the owen stanley mountain area by driving the japs out of the gap down to the plains and back to the sea at buna the immediate threat of a battle for australia was averted patrols have to move cautiously because isolated parties of japanese are still resisting and have to be mopped up some of the hardest fighting was experienced here they were sent to brisbane for interrogation and then to kara when they arrived they were sullen and difficult to prisoners of war in fact they were greatly ashamed of being taken captive and were looking for a way to regain their honour this opportunity arose on the 4th of august 1944 too many japanese were now being captured and big compound was dangerously overcrowded militant agitators were stirring up trouble the australians decided to move 700 lower-ranking prisoners to another camp and hay in western new south wales the japanese compound leaders angrily objected and called a meeting with the representatives from each of the 21 accommodation huts in b compound they decided to rise up and riot to attack the perimeter and die in battle private elf rolls was on century duty in the middle of broadway it was 1 45 am an excited japanese prisoner ran up to the fence near his post alf knew something was about to happen he fired the two required warning shots and ran for his life japanese exploded out of their huts with makeshift weapons and headed in three directions two groups attacked the northern and eastern compound fences and another group jumped into broadway to attack the northern and southern in time the security fences were only six feet high and had not been increased after a security scare the previous year privates jones and hardy ran to their machine gun and opened fire but was soon overwhelmed and killed years later they would each be awarded a posthumous george cross [Music] after just 20 minutes over 180 japanese were dead their weapons were removed and the wounded were treated 300 escaped into the kawara countryside it would take nine days to round them up and in the process two more australian soldiers would die some japanese killed themselves alone in the australian bush two were shot by a kara farmer but others were given food by australian families at the end 234 japanese and five australians were dead this was the tragedy of the coward breakout this terrible loss of life came about because of a clash of cultures in wartime with better understanding and discipline it need not have happened since that dark time kaura and japan have worked hard for reconciliation and now have an enduring friendship this came about due to the early efforts of a japanese graves as a result the japanese government created a new cemetery at kaura where the remains of all japanese who died in australia during world war ii are now interred a great deal has taken place in kara since the war years the beautiful japanese gardens and cultural center was planned and developed by a group of dedicated kara citizens and its imagery and design combines traditional japanese components with the broad australian landscape the designer ken nakajima wanted it to be a place where the souls of the japanese could find peace and it has become a physical expression of the bond between kawara and japan [Music] cara recognises the importance of its history and has respectfully commemorated the kara breakout on significant anniversaries with many australian and japanese visitors attending the memorial events [Music] a student exchange with seikei high school in tokyo and kaura high school has been in continuous operation since 1970 together with other high school and cultural exchanges between kaura and japan a festival of international understanding has been held in kara for over 50 years kawara council developed a friendship agreement with war ii in 1992 australia 's world peace bell was awarded to kara for its work in peace and reconciliation this presentation is dedicated to all those who have worked for reconciliation between australia and japan and who have succeeded in producing a lasting friendship in the aftermath of tragedy such is the legacy of the coward breakout and the nodes not divided flows and on the surface float the fallen leaves of autumn they too are swept on annoying you _"

continue to show them that thank you for the comment yes mr chairman uh councillor smith made a few requests at the committee meeting and we had an email exchange last week the two proposed clauses that we 're looking to add prior to this going on public exhibition uh number one the council will only consider parks or memorials that are sympathetic to the proposed site of an appropriate durable material and number two council will only consider applications for plaques and memorials that are deemed by council to be non-offensive so the intention would be they 'd be incorporated into the draft for public exhibition purposes just this mr mayor just before you talk about that there is some echoing going on particularly with paul so i don 't know what 's happening there whether everybody 's pleased to turn their i can hear that mute their mics or whatever yeah i 'm getting getting some vibrations in my my earphones um i can disconnect if you like all and see if that works whilst you speak there 's only well only while paul speaking to it to get a public exhibition of that please councillor fagan you should speak councillor smith mayor just just to say i think that uh this uh draft policy particularly as amended is one that we need fits in well with other policies that we have um regarding art and that sort of thing and um it makes things simpler and clearer i think for those who wish to uh erect some sort of plaque or memorial council would have a chance to look at it again on the way through any further comments write a reply up at the resolution of this in favor against declare carry just briefly missed america and as i said at the committee meeting the other day we 're really endorsing an action that 's already been taken but it 's in accordance with the the agreement that we have with um the central table land so it 's where these restrictions and it was effective the 6th of july as the report says and with a bit of luck with the rain that we 're just all talking about we may be as well which would be terrific for all of those users but um i i 'm sure everybody will endorse this resolution tonight thank you any further comment i replied we 're not

're undertaking uh we 're under in the moment and let 's hope we can have an election next september i 'm pretty positive but um you never know and at this stage we 're putting it off for 12 months so hopefully it 'll be right by then anybody comments councillor smith mr mayor taking a a little bit of a liberty and um riffing off the word elections in the recommendation i 'd just like to remind colleagues that that i had nearly forgotten and just remembered to do it this afternoon i be so cheeky and say that all of us organized people got it there is probably probably an answer to that won 't count and you 've got a good secretary at home looks after you um any further comments i think you just bought on cable 19 i think it 's important yes council is really the landscape is changing on a daily basis it 's important as councillors that we we really stress with our communities that it is important to follow as much as humanly possible the health guidelines that are coming out here on i think we have responsibility to try and make sure people do adhere to those rules and regulations which are designed obviously to protect our community from their families so that 's just a little by line on the way through any for the comments for the comments uh the writer replied not required i 'll put the resolution always in favor against carried either number six uh investments thank you any comments or questions on this one in the committee agendas i 'll put the resolution was in favor hi carried item number seven a donation of watermedera recreation mr chairman i think we had a really good discussion about this the other other night i think this is certainly uh qualifies for some support from our expenses um and as we did note the other night there 's a really hard working committee up there and we 're also dealing with another issue a little later in tonight 's agenda as well thank you i think everyone will support this thank you for the comment councillor wright do you want to now i just um did your support with councillor miller said and then um they 're part of a um of a village there that 's um has been growing and there 's a few there 's some more younger families there and that and uh i think this is one way of helping the community out there to get with the support and um for this uh construction of a community facility thank you um any for the comments write a reply probably not the declare carried item number eight uh mayoral mayoral and council of thieves resolution there come to the world the second act council i 'll have a second thank you council just with a question though i shared with moving both of those resolutions um my apologies yes yes if the move is happy yes makes sense is murder happy give me a nod thank you yes okay you 're happy the second account to another try to assume you 're sick yeah just move does it move wish to speak uh i will say what i repeat what i did say at the last meeting of the committee meeting was that um if um well i i note that the um and i agree with the the council right to the premier and the minister expressing dissatisfaction with inconsistency between state and local uh politicians remuneration i believe that if ever there was a time when i would tend to agree with not having a not having a um an increase this might be it because uh once again to show leadership to try and show leadership to the always advocated i 've always advocated that there should be an increase and the increase in our remuneration should always be to try and bring it to a level where people might business people and people in the town rate buyers might want to actually be a councillor and see some sort of remuneration for their time so but at this stage uh the decisions already been made we 're just noting that and also writing a letter about it i i believe though that it gives us the opportunity to just say well this is this is what is what we 're doing this is what 's been forced upon us but um yep probably it 's a in some ways it 's a good lead to the community thank you council member thank you mr mayor and what i support all of the comments made by council while spreading as i raised this the second part of this resolution it just smelled of so much of hypocrisy where they made this that decision you 've also made a decision about a whole lot of the people in the bruising their wages etc and yet they 've not taken the hit themselves so i thought if i was going to show some really good leadership here i agree with councillor now is the time they haven 't done that they 've made a decision on impacting a whole lot of people other than themselves and that 's surprising for the comments yes mr jim yes councillor yeah um well apparently our live streaming does go to the media um i think i was um quoted on abc radio the couple of mornings later that i was giving care um orange council or orange council spray for their increase in their their things and uh they were bleeding like other communities um it sounded better when i said it i thought and um i think that should be noted in the letter that uh the different pay rates for different postcodes throughout the state and um there should be it should be one rate for every councillor because each council has the same responsibility to to deliver services to the ratepayers although some sydney councils wouldn 't have to worry do i just don 't know how all that works um we might need just to check if state politicians have received a pay rise i heard i speak to someone during the week and um they said their determination hasn 't come through so um i could be wrong and they the other person could have been wrong too but we yeah we got to show that there has to be some equality in local government thank you um i 'm not sure let 's take cover on advice on the position to comment as far as see if you 're you 're saying people are picking information up on on this i think one of the starting points that council or federal referring to is that um the pay scale or the remuneration scaf or council of councils and council laws you determine on population not on the volume of work or the commitments that they have and therefore a population of 50 60 000 in the bush with a lot of a lot of extra responsibilities the same pay scale levels or so many generations so many counts a lot better like we 've referred to and if you 're a council that 's a population then the their enumeration is significantly less that 's that 's the starting point of this conversation with people who are interested in this should be having a look at the the renumeration scales and if i pick up the point that that counts for the world from council or miller and they can use it i don 't think any of us in this this room virtual room uh considering what 's the impact on ourselves so much is that we see this is something that needs to resolve as we move forward into keeping a strong and vibrant local government and attracting the people who who probably would add value to the community actually trying to get into the council champion to look after communities further comments rather reply mr mayor i 'm just very pleased the council rights be making friends over in orange i 'll take i won 't comment i 'll take that as a writer reply i 'll put the resolution on those in favor is item number nine which is a three five five committee minutes at the youth council councillor smith i 'm sure will be happy to move those the second to please i put the hand up council of peter wright normally thank you any comments or questions on this there 's only a report being noted um mr mayor i 'll i 'll just uh brief update youth council had a their first physical meeting back a couple of weeks ago and that was lovely and as the man knows because he tried to uh scab some of the food that we were about to enjoy and also to say that the um team building bonfire that was going to be held last saturday evening at the home of one of the youth councillors along with a sleepover unfortunately had to be cancelled because of the rain but otherwise uh youth council is going uh full steam and looking for there okay any further comments or questions on this one council fagin can i ask you a question to make a note to just check whether the hospital health council they 're quite keen to have further discussions around the clinical services plan and what the youth campaign might see as being beneficial if i may last thursday um youth council members and young people in the community were invited to uh to have a a little forum regarding that and they did so and i believe it was very successful good thank you thank you for the comments or questions on this predictive resolution item number sorry item number 11 is the regional art galleries policy no i think you need item number 10 please sorry colleagues i was transfixed in reading the wording on 11. item number 10 there 's a resolution

some of their clients yep for the comments will you endorse those comments mr moon thank you write reply not necessary no further comments i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against the cleric carried item number 11. council adopts the draft for public exhibition um that 's we don 't adopt the draft we dropped off the draft for the purposes of the exhibition where the general manager needs to be slight wording there to tidy that up um so can you help someone get me the wording council um on public exhibition just council council uh agrees to replace the draft cara regional article republican policy exhibition i 'm happy to be happy if you want to move that council officer i am i will remove that thank you very much council of folk block on that one sorry have a second to please councilman judy smith thank you sorry all right can i just check that in counselor pagans wording the intention was for uh to end the sentence with for at least 28 days definitely yeah i just think it was changing the word adopted to to agrees that 's yeah anything oh we would say note the report note the draft policy and put it on the exhibition but whatever is the best for you guys we 're moving it that 's fine and play and agree and put it on exhibition for 28 days if i could yes thank you you 've got that minute in a minute gurus good night thank you everybody everybody understand what we 're talking about do you need to comment any more council of fagan uh just this was quite um we went over this with a fine tooth comb and i think everyone was quite happy with it at the end as it 's going on public exhibition i encourage anybody who has any interest in the gallery and i 'm just note that the gallery has actually have actually noted it so um that should be able to go on exhibition and people should comment if they 're interested second we should speak at all no comments any further comments well mr chairman i don 't know the comment i 'll make and whilst cancer thinking is correct we 've gone through this quite extensively there may well be a need for change that 's the purpose of putting on public exhibition but also it does give the council another 28 days to have the comment one reply rod reply put the resolution on all those in favor against against the cleric carried thank you colleagues item number 12 355 committee minister tara nature based adventure playground recommendation now the council of fagin the second to please counselor council of five at which point um just to note that they 're doing a great job and they 're really looking forward to finishing this project and they 're going to wind up before the end of the year which i think the committee has been going for five years it 's been very constructive and it 's done a very really great job so we 're looking forward to the end of this adventure and uh it 'll be a great uh a great asset to the community and it 's already proving that so i 'm just interested to see how the rain and the gullies and all the other things up at the playground site um how the rain affects them in the next week or so so it 'll be interesting to see how we haven 't had a rain event of those dry gulleys that we 've got up there may be very wet for a while oh yeah i would have thought it was a responsible council representative check them i will for the comments further comments don 't know for the comments you want to reply not needed i wouldn 't think uh put the resolution i was in favor all right against the cleric um number 13 thank you mr chairman this is something that council has a responsibility of doing on a 12-monthly basis and i think that the the two nominees that we 've selected here will be worthy filling those positions for the comment for the comments i 've replied i don 't think necessary i could resolution play over all right again should i declare it carry item number 14 cabana management crown reserve 199856 news solution there councillor smith thank you of the second council of ray walsh here council mr mayor just to uh to say that this crown reserve is the land on which the visitors information center sits that it has is a very very detailed and indeed very that parcel of land going back many many years and it we are endorsing it to be placed on public exhibition so it 's something that has still a little way to go it needs approval of the minister and needs to be on public exhibition for 28 days but it is a model plan i believe thank you this is ready for the comment mr chairman i just think that we really need to acknowledge our staff as far as this plan is concerned and the workload that this has imposed on them and what 's going to happen in the next few months and perhaps so few years in that all of the the different parts of the crowd that we do manage on behalf of the the state are going to need a plan of probably similar detail etc and whilst it 's a it has got a lot of information in it and it goes back to the earliest early settlement really yeah i think we found it very interesting but i think our staff it does take time it does take money it does take as that is concerned thank you for the comment write reply put the resolution always in favor hi again carried item 15 is the a41 stroke 2020. um thank you mr mayor it 's been well researched by our council staff and it 's a minor variation really to our development control plan so uh um and there wasn 't any um neighborhood uh opposition to it so i see no reason for council not 2020 lot 22 dp 862.74 which of course is the peace precinct in the italian stoneheart in particular um thank you mr mayor it 's um i 'm very pleased to see this d.a come to council it 's something that many people have been hoping that would happen for a long time that we 're now looking at restoring uh the stone hut and the history that 's associated to that i think is just so important for karishia and we need at all times to be aware of our history and try and where possible retain it so uh i have great uh pleasure in now in uh moving that uh council will speak yes um i think this is a really exciting project then i 'd like to congratulate the staff kate and her team who 've gone through an awful lot of jumped a lot of ropes and high high uh walls to get this to where it is and it has been a difficult process and i think it 's been it 's really going to be worthwhile and this is only the start of the project but uh having the da approved will be um a very good basis for an ongoing project that we hopefully won 't take too long to complete thanks you 've got the comments thanks mr mayor um i think it is a very complex process even from here on because it is a heritage item um and um council needs to prepare a heritage interpretation plan needs to have a series of photographs in place needs to have suitably qualified personnel who are qualified to deal with heritage buildings and so on um and the only other thing that i will say is to reiterate what i said at the committee meeting which building and land managed by council council outsourced consideration of this d.a to affirming in orange so that there can be no possibility of christ and they recommended the conditions uh a number of very detailed conditions which we have before us thank you for the after the i think i agree what 's being said and i think it 's a very important but a very special project and certainly has attracted a lot of attention his encounters in this community 's desire to make sure we record history and observe history of something which we 're very proud of you for the comments look at the resolution college degree declare thank you item number 17 which is the a 47 straight 20 20. carport in lee street sorry thank you mr chairman i 'm very pleased to move this i think it does as the report clearly says very comprehensive report has been properly assessed but it basically complies with the the section 415 of the of the environmental planning and assess for that development control plan um there were no negative submissions received as far as the quite a lot of the other developments within that precinct and and it just made provision as i 've mentioned at the meeting there for a few further development at the front of this block as well so all of that i think is makes it worth your support channel 18 let 's see the amendment to the lep gateway amendment so i 'm going to move that i 'll move it uh yeah this was just this is just a uh a tidy up that became obvious quite a while ago now but um eventually it 's come back from the department and um we have to exhibit it so it 'll be still ongoing it 's always something with the planning department there 's lots of lots of different things to happen after it comes to us so um it 'll continue until it finishes of course thank you for the comment i think you 're looking at anomalies and give them due and reasonable consideration of this i think there 's one through the comments that 's where you 're going i 'll put the resolution was in a carport uh which is 39 stroke 2020 which is what i 'm a dairy how could i dare forget what i 'm a dairy i 'm sorry 18 or 19 so you know i think it 's the reigns got me um what am i 39 20 20 council or peter wright said his hand thank you um councillor peter wright used to comment it all yes mr chairman um this has come to council uh largely our specific reason is um council uh if we have if we uh if we pass this da council will uh not be um levying section 94a contributions on the development [Music] i 'm normally a fairly fairly strong that we get what section 94 a contributions we need from developers but in this case um it is a community group develop developing a community facility on community land and we would set it we would be taking money from peter to pay paul and um i think if we don 't levy these they they 'll have more money to finish the project and um and i think that would easier for them and um ensuring that a community building is um is built in the bottom of their locality and they probably need to uh be aware that this is a um a decision made by council in their in their interests and um it 's not something we take lightly or um or we just do because we 've been asked to do it thank you there 's a second wish to speak thank you mr chairman i can clear with those comments but i i think it 's really important that we do that but our community does know that we actually support a whole lot of our different community groups particularly our villages from time to time generally small groups of people that are hard work maybe deserve some support i concur with the comments made by cancer peter writing that the council has been very strong for a long time on levying quite appropriately section 94 contributions to continue to develop community facilities etc so all of that is good but i think in this particular instance because of the extent of the work that we have no problem in supporting an application of this time any further comments no further comments reply probably not necessary therefore i put the resolution um i think that everybody 's voted for that so if you try to declare that also carried unanimously now i can go to item number 20. 848 2020 which is two yell street that 's where we 're building in the carport somewhere to move that for something different counselor got his hand up and down for the thank you mr mayor uh once again this is brought to council because there 's a variation in our dcp in that there 's a variation to the distance the building will be from the rear the rear boundary and also the fact that the a carport will be constructed will be forward of the building it 's um it 's been uh suggested by our staff that that uh is something which complies in that area out there in that that area has other pla other buildings it 's the same where a carport is actually in front of the building or forward of researched and uh by our staff and i can 't see any reason for council not to approve this any further comments the second wish to speak i 'll just add mr mayor that it was advertised to neighbours and uh that no submissions uh against it were received thank you any further comments do you want to reply probably not necessary unanimously item number 21 is the load of the plan amendment number seven which regards the returning as part of the damn defection holiday area or that land around it move councillor yes mr mayor this is uh merely an amendment to the planning uh to the zoning out there uh it will take it from being an environment conservation zone sp3 to s to sp3 tourist and this is merely just the start of a lot of work which has got to go on to enable the um the planning for the relocation of some of the camping area uh out there to take place which will have to happen if the dam wall or when the dam wall is is raised it 's got to obviously this is a very exciting start of a very exciting project and there 'll be lots more of these i 'd imagine or these types of small alterations and planning proposals that we will have to deal with with the work that 's going on at waiangla and uh this is very exciting because we get a new tourist particle we will be getting a new tourist park after a lot more um discussion and uh and i 'm sure lots more comments from the community so it 's going on exhibition but it is only a planning um a change in zoning nothing to do with the da which will come in the later part of the year i 'd imagine you for the comment um i i sort of follow up the comments to council of agents maybe i think an exciting opportunity there is issues as you 've been pointed out by by my colleagues a bad rock re-zoning band there 's nothing to do with our application or redevelopment reflections area at all this stage is by the draft conversational conversation draft matters being moved around of the land but that said i think that we their sites inundated potentially and the sooner that can be resolved and they can give some certainty so i think quite an important issue but that said this is part of the step a restarting of land any further comments write a reply i 'll put the resolution in favor all right everybody voted for that i 'll be clear it 's carried with our move to the reports that this meeting with the first one is general manager in regards to community grants and there 's a two dot points there which you 've got a surprise to come may the general manager has given um a full and and uh detailed and accurate account of the deliberations and reasonings of the committee and i 'm sure everyone has read it so i won 't enlarge on those the only thing that i will add is that we are fairly confident that even without the nrm group we will have as we have had over the past four or five applications we will have applications asking for the amount excess of that amount of money so we 're not worried that we we won 't be receiving enough nominations without an extra category at the moment and of course we 'll revisit it the moment that it looks as though it 's feasible to do so so the only other thing that i would add is um just to emphasize something the general manager has uh has asked for at the end of his report which is that if there is anyone who has any other ideas as to something that might be needed to assist the community at a different category rather than a new events category and the committee would be very happy to hear your ideas thank you and i think we should all take note of that that last comment from councilman councillor smith any for the comments to speak yes mr mayor um i am the council representative on the natural resource management group and i think this is the right way to go the natural resource management group has been running small environmental grants for some years now and it looks as if across purposes with each other so i think uh if the any funding for resort natural resource management may well be in the rightful place just by being with the that committee itself thank you any further comments or questions nothing else to add right reply counselor i 'll put the resolution i wasn 't behaving all right this is housekeeping thank you mister mr mayor you 're right it is housekeeping but i think it 's really important that if we have anybody uh listing in on this that 's why this meeting is being streamed is that there are times when the council does need to to go into close committee to deal with some issues uh which commercial incompetence or whatever those decisions when taken are released to the public as soon as possible after those decisions have been taken and that 's the purpose of this this resolution to them thank you council member any further comments and of course you 'd also highlight through some of these resolutions that they 've been held either for us for a little little period of time that will doing behind the scenes any further comments after the commercial reply resolution i was in favor carry writer number two is a donation from the randy all black premier league recommendation here for three thousand dollar donation this fits well with maybe maybe like someone someone one of your colleagues might unkindly say you made more sense that and they would probably be right mr mayor but i will push on nonetheless as i do with my husband but unlike my husband probably some of you are listening who knows and yes this this uh fits with our nation 's equality it 's a very good cause and um it 's something that the cara community um is rightly very proud of i believe in that this is the longest established um corey rugby league team in australia and it 's not long before it will be celebrating its 100th anniversary so it 's great to see that they are planning to play down in bombardier and i 'm sure we all wish them the best of luck course and project manager council of fagan 's got a hand up somehow disappear i 'm leaving the meeting thank you okay just disappear the light council as a councillor thank you um there 's a recommendation there to someone the recommendation council of buddha oh sorry councillor ray walsh um 10 second accounts of the miller so it 's just that when councillor fagan left the screen the whole dynamics of work looking changed do you speak councillor walsh thanks mr mayor um yes it 's um obvious that um um the kara show ground racecourse and paceway um committee have been billed considerable sound amount of uh fees over the years but i noticed that it 's very more than well balanced by what uh council has a source their way or or given in uh direct grants to them so i would suggest that the six thousand dollars suggested is appropriate some for council to uh provide in this case thank you secondly we should speak only that i endorse those comments mr mate thank you for the comments for questions on that uh can i ask a question please yes um yeah i uh clean forgot about the on the third of july or something with the councillors that went there um is this a new um way of submissions for donations like do the do the users of the um of the show ground trust land they make applications through the land manager now do they or they don 't do it directly um to [Music] [Music] disabled do they or just it 's their land the dishonor or that 's the question i 'm asking that 's so yeah i think they as the land land manager they would be the ones that account yeah i support the um the grant and the money 's going to those organizations which is who 's spent the money it 's um it 'll be good and um i um it has been only for the last 12 months that they 've they 've put it in so i just if they made their application a bit closer to when after they got the da approved or something it might be um a little bit clearer but anyway no it 's all good thank you for the comment replied you pointed out um the the trust is the manager of the land over there and any groups that use the land would obviously be answerable to the trust and pay a rent or or have some sort of a an agreement with them or a contract so naturally any any uh construction or any changes that happen over there would have to be approved by the trust i 'll put the resolution in favor hi again carried we can 't try and cancel the failure zero couple minutes to come back that texture [Music] [Music] back on back on okay she 's coming back on would you give her a meet up colleagues this could be a better way of being able to manage this one she might have to sell another house maybe the it guys who had locked out coming back now yeah patient colleagues is technology i 'm here welcome back yeah thanks um video 's not on getting close with my colleagues we 're still alive welcome back welcome back number four three five five community minutes together advisory committee i do have a comment to the director in that um note that the in the minutes the sculpture park policy is uh indicates that the gallery advisory committee will be in the role of a sculpture park reference committee i just wanted to know how that will fit with the um or present public public art committee which um councillor miller is obviously a member i 'm not sure who sure the other members are but i just like to know how how that is all going to work um the gallery director has been speaking with his uh committee uh with the view to uh formulate some options uh which he will be bringing to the public art advisory committee so what you see in the minutes as as i understand it is he working with his advisory committee to then formulate some preferred option eventually to bring to the public art advisory committee thank you thank you might get some sort of input my way through formation thank you thank you is any further comments on this channel is i 'll just note that the director and the committee have been very they were sitting on their hands doing nothing they were training and and cleaning and all sorts of things but it 's great to see that the gallery is open again um long may be able to remain so and there are certainly some really exciting exhibitions coming up including of course the colleen and upstart and one in which our local artist greg daley is featuring so i certainly encourage people to uh to go and have a look at those exhibitions i know that the gallery will be very well managed in terms of coded safety social distancing cleaning and all that sort of thing so i hope that people will take the opportunity to get out and see the great exhibitions that we 've got coming up thank you for the comments mr chairman can i just go back to the comments made by councillor walsh and i fully concur with that i think that certainly we 've all got an interest in this what we don 't want is uh for different committees to be across purposes with with each other so i think it 's clear understanding of what our roles and responsibilities will be with the different groups so that we can hopefully take all of the different aspects of our art and culture and that forward over the next couple of years because i think it 's it 's potentially a really exciting time for all of us i think [Music] youtube the next item we 're dealing with is the 355 committee draft minutes of the order of risk improvement the general manager wants to make a comment see if that resolves the issue of the echoes that you 're getting before mr chairman i could i just suggest that the recommendation remove the word draft before annual report my understanding is that 's the final annual report and whilst it was a draft at the committee the one that 's included in the agenda the intent is that that is the annual report from the committee to the council unless the director corrects me otherwise that 's what i 'd suggest it should say thank you mr manager i think that is technically correct to councillor wright feel quite happy with the change is that the in the last section of that report and the draft in your report is not a draft annual report from the chairman it was the annual report from the chairman which the committee adopted thank you speak counselor right right just briefly it was a i think it was a fairly fruitful meeting um we seem to have the risk management schedule a little bit more under control or um relates to um how the risks we have are handled and what the outcome is uh we did have a follow-up discussion from the last meeting on um ensuring that eft payments are made to the people that we 're making them to there 's been um there 's been some events in in our industry and other industries where suppliers have been hacked and people have set up identical name accounts in the same bank as the original supplier and then send in the uh invoices that would have been sent by the um person they 've hacked and there 's been considerable money uh hived off at times and it 's overseas pretty had it happen here to to our knowledge that we are we have made arrangements to ensure that doesn 't happen uh other than that i think um the media uh the report from the um from our chair ron gillard was um it covered our activities for the 12 months and um the chairman 's report is quite of this council officers wanting to get involved in local government administration this committee certainly is fully aware that and leaves the council alone [Music] can i just suggest that you turn your microphone up mr me or not muscle sorry about that it 's a bit muffly that 's all maybe i was talking quietly i 'm getting used to is that any better which report from the chair mr ron gillard and uh i would be wonderful if we could encourage media to um at least take some or if not all of that report and put it in front of our ratepayers because i think it might answer a few of the questions and a few of the dubious comments one here 's the times about uh what great if that was out in the public public arena um i 'm not sure what the media would pick it up and find it exciting but i think if something council could make sure that and i agree it 's something you should probably have a public arena but maybe something that general manager and director can take on board in terms of council 's web page and so forth social media pages any sort of comments required reply item number six is the procurement policy there 's a recommendation there to adopt the procurement policy which is well researched i know there are a suggestion there are two changes but as long as you move that policy council the middle of thank you the second to please counselor smith who wish to speak at all thank you mr chairman and as a report quite widely says there is a necessity for most of our policies to be updated on a regular basis this one is reviewed four yearly basis there is two significant changes recommended here which we should adopt and the player one is regarding the inclusion legal opinion as well which is appropriate and then also the other one is is really something that 's um just getting up to date with the the current uh tender value thresholds allowed by that are called upon by the the state government as far as anything over a quarter of a million dollars now has got to be advertised whereas before that threshold was at 150 000 it just reflects the changing values of course some and so i thank them the director for uh the update and i think we should support it thank you for the comment just referring to the uh the local procurement preference policy which i think is is a great idea and uh formalizes something that council does in a number of um ways um i just note that um there is um while there are two main changes to the procurement policy there 's quite a bit of detail in those changes and i 'd just like to note two things one being that there is a sliding scale of a percentage preferential amount that council is able to give to of five thousand dollars and under is from ten percent uh down to i think over a hundred and fifty thousand it 's zero percent so that local uh businesses have to compete on an absolutely equal footing there but the other thing to note i think is that if council determines that the application of this local preferential policy uh would have the effect of substantially lessening competition the policy won 't apply so i think it 's it 's terrific that we try to encourage our local businesses and providers to apply for tenders but i think it 's also important that we note that it won 't be disadvantaging our ratepayers in terms of using excessive amounts of the funds which they pay into council inappropriately thank you for the comment just a question as i may please yes certainly when we shift the um 150 000 to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the uh for the need for a uh open tender that would be the so that would be the only time that things had come to council if we 're purchasing for and fifty thousand dollars not 150 000 is that right that 's my understanding a general manager that 's correct mr chairman thank you i also note uh in the in 2.7 of the tender process at this 250 000 can relate to purchases over a period of two years from the one supplier so um i don 't know how that goes we can buy a lot of concrete uh road culvert works and um and then the not thinking you 're gonna need a lot for the next year and the next year you 've we might have had a heavy rain event that we might be having now and we got washed out and we need more road stuff so um i 'm just wondering how the staff handle that i can take it on advice so i 'm not going to block the adoption of the policy but i 've been to conferences where this that uh seems a very hard thing to follow where you 're purchasing stuff over two years and you 've got to go to tinder but you might be only buying there 's the legitimate occasions that you referred to is things like whether there 's a national disaster or something you 're going to purchase purchasing vehicles over two years about that i think unless um one of the directors want to comment on us to comment i think we 'll take that on advice just general management yes mr chairman a counselor right he 's correct the tendering guidelines do talk about 250 000 above in over two years uh and the general way that 's implemented is that when you sit down and you decide okay and you know at that point in time we are going to purchase in excess of 250 000 what 's likely from a particular supplier well then you would call tenders for that uh for that supply if you have no idea how much you 're going to uh procure or it could be a hundred thousand dollars and then twelve months later or six months later there 's another hundred and fifty thousand dollars you don 't know that at the time you 're making the original determination as i say procurement is likely to be in excess of 250 000 from a supplier over two years then you would normally call tenders in that instance thank you thank you thank you general manager and answer the question here for the comment yes oh yeah it does thank you um the only comment i think i 'd make is that the two points one 's to change from 150 to because the houston has already been noted but we quite often get get comments about having some form of local government procurement sorry local procurement basically preferential treatment for locals and i think this policy gives you that flexibility that i think you also need to know that if that is predicated and written in regards to or the second point that you just made i think was very very clearly explained by councillor smith and i think that was that was that was good i think as far as the the local option of sort of applying a a preference for local tenders as long as they sort of step up to the plate i think that 's that 's threshold from 150 to 250 nothing 's changed other than the thresher i mean it 's this has been employed in in force for a long time and there are many organizations not just councils that have this this type of policy that quite often do plan ahead you need to go through tender for a couple of years at a time and all the rest it 's quite appropriate but this clearly shows that it 's something that 's worked very well it 's really about the threshold of writing individuals thank you i 'll put the resolution was in favor all right again i declare carried over number seven the director of corporate services as a change to the we know reporting the change to the opening hours of the cara lobby account for the world staff moving that second to please suddenly council of fagan councillor walsh used to speak i support this mr mayor because i think it 's a very sensible option i 'm aware from uh the experience of previous librarians that the thursday night in particular late close particularly during the winter months who comes in to use the computers uh in particular agrees to be closed down at that time not everyone who comes in as necessarily doing the right thing on the computers as well and uh while there has been an alarm button placed in there uh the alarm button probably is only of abuse while there 's still people over here in this building to be able to actually take a call so i think i think this is a sensible thing the the library will open an hour earlier at 9 00 a.m and i would suggest that that probably also suits a large proportion of the clientele of the library thank you any for the comments second is happy i need to write reply i think under those circumstances i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against i declare it carried now come down to mate and i want to suggest we move something different to what 's on the i would if i may happy to move this that we firstly note the director 's report which is the first point the second got 355 civic center community reference group and the third point is that i would move that the appoint two nominated councillors the council of bruce miller as chairman and councillor ruth fade so the second ever that please councillor thank you i 'm happy to speak to that and i think that the report is fine we 've discussed this before but we need opening to formalize that we are going to have a 355 committee which is the second dot point the third dot point is that i 'm aware that every every councillor would probably be pleased to be on the this committee this reference group this 355 committee because it has been an interesting journey on this and i know that there is a lot to be offered by all the councillors the abilities or the capacities of any of my colleagues to be on this committee i don 't intend to go down policy for starters that that group and also the dr councillor has been for a number of years representative on the cultural council so i 'm happy to move that and councillor roshi very important [Music] move on behalf of council i think the new direction of the of the civic center and also the uh new manager should get every support that we can give them and i think that this committee is going to cover a wide range of people of various ages disabilities etc etc so i can only see good coming out of it any for the comment for the comments mr chairman just if you indulge me for a moment and thank you firstly for the coffins i 'm sure there 's going to be significant challenges going forward we need to properly engage with all of the different user groups potentially and that 's why the report is so forthright in saying about the representation i think that 's really important uh council has taken this uh sort of different direction as far as specific sound was concerned in many respects in that we 've we 've agreed to expend significant amounts of money by the recurrent expenditure industry in one-off capital items as well in the next couple of years and it 's really important that do get together to meet um this uh the inaugural little group that 's uh firstly named within this report to identify the appropriate people that counsel hopefully to endorse them in the near future to to make significant recommendations to council to get the best out of the civic center going forward any further comment i 'm quite happy to very briefly make some summing up comments this is an exciting way forward and council has invested a lot of time in energy in this and i 'm sure that the committee and people account for the council of who will be part of it will keep their colleagues fully informed and engaged on the way through this process i think an exciting time as we really embed down i put the resolution i was in favor an inched declare it carried item number one from the director 's infrastructure and operation we 'll build a house and visit a center proposed building renewal works with a recommendation every people got points on it i have a question i have a question yes yep yes council fagin you muted muting and unmuting um the just the the um grant that uh is mentioned here the carry forward um no the local roads and community infrastructure program grant funding that 's the recent federal government of money is it yes okay i just it 's just a bit confusing where the money is all coming from so um and the unexpected vap funds are the funds that we didn 't spend last year on our building asset renewal program now that those questions have been answered mr chairman i 'm happy to move the recommendation thank you council member of the second place councillor smith councilman miller used to speak at all thank you mr chairman and and really this is uh the subject of extensive discussion at our uh committee meeting and i think with the question that was really the one that was posed there was some clarification around how it would be funded and whether it was appropriate to be funding some of this through loan funding i think it was potentially agreed at that meeting that for bid capital works that it 's appropriate that um funded we 're taking advantage of some of the 950 15 000 within that grant funding that was announced by the prime minister and i think that it 's appropriate that we also do loan funds some of these these works um so that we get the best bang for our butt bearing in mind that money has never been cheaper than what it is at the moment thank you any further comment yes mr chairman yeah i support it it 's um it 's really repairs and maintenance to two major buildings that that we operate community services out of and um and it needs to be done i just as we sort of got an open ended on the budget after tendering no we shouldn 't um we shouldn 't divulge uh too much but would you expect that the figures that you 've showed there would be in the ballpark for this job or um not yeah throw the chair off that 's uh expectation is that those figures will be the ballpark yep thank you yeah i think they 're ballparks he further comments our infrastructure have such importance as these are then going back i 'm happy to support that so the comments i 'll give you the right reply council matter of fact it 's so very generous have you missed me uh well i was going to say you 've got to have it now we 're going to ask you a question like everybody everybody gets a chance to write a reply you know that but if i fail to give it to you someone 's going to build me so thank you mr chairman and i think that the other point that needs to be made here and it was in response to uh council further right 's question and the director 's response to that it 's really important that the general the community is aware that these particular works have been uh independently assessed as well as and so that would just haven 't done sort of made a guesstimate of how much they 're likely to cost i think it 's been based on on at least some external advice as well so um we won 't really the industry over a significant part of my working life is that we won 't really know until such time as the attended documents are prepared they do go on out to tender i think the other important point that needs to be made here is that what we are trying to do is encourage our local uh traders to actually tender for these these particular projects and we think that they are certainly within the capabilities of what we would encourage them with the tender documents to come out that they put their best foot forward in tendering for them and hopefully aren 't successful in their temples thank you councilman i 'll put the resolution of those in favor no against i declare it carried um i 'm not suggesting removing a supplementary resolution but um maybe there 's an opportunity and council member picked up the the issue of getting local businesses to tender wonderful we shouldn 't somehow make this information available in due course to the business chamber and let them circulate to through their membership to these particular tender opportunities being being available for process no one 's suggesting that the process should be but fully appropriate and transparent but maybe there 's an opportunity trying to catch throw the net a bit wider so the level of local local trades people who sometimes [Music] i 'm happy to have a very quick discussion here with saline council smith yes if i may just add to that there is a uh a construction group as well and uh be good to make sure that they 're informed as well yeah thank you thank you uh we 'll move on colleagues i just um if i may mr mr mayor to just add on to your comments there um i think it 'd be it 'd be right for us to publicly advertise what we 're going to do with part of this um federal federal funding which is supposed to be to develop business for the local businesses and and that as a way of um putting it out there in the community that these two projects will be available for for local people as well as to talk to the business chamber and enthusiasm for local business we just need to make sure the clear definition the community understands what 's local item number two roast recovery program recommendation there that we note the report on how the grant money is to be spent in the race recovery program for 2021 with councillor smith of the second to please councillor walt we should speak council smith yes mr mayor we 're we 're in the uh fortunate position that we have um bit under one and a half million dollars worth of register recovery funding from the federal government and we recently received 1.75 million um dollars for fixing local roads from the state government so we have approximately three million dollars that we plan to spend this year and particularly that we 're going to spend it on fixing gravel roads which are traveled over by school buses and sealing some sections of some currently unsealed roads uh which are also frequented by school buses so there are quite a lot of roads involved and quite a lot of work being done so that 's that 's great thank you all right to have this uh these sums of money available for the roads and uh i um concur with things that with what councilor smithers had to say and also would just like to know how important it is that the some of the uh edges of the marignori and glenn logan road so not duckling uh yep big glenn logan roads are going to be uh repaired because uh there 's a lot of traffic uh particularly from around the north logan area a lot of heavy traffic now going down those roads to to gulagang so i know some of the locals have been particularly concerned about the the movement of some of those trucks mr chairman and just to note that this is the minutes and this recommendation is sort of gets getting some age on it now and it 's a reflection i think of where we 've been up to as far as the committees are concerned with the uh david nardin disruptions but um i would recommend to the council if they actually do support and adopt the minutes as the recommendation says but then our community strategic plan we provide some money for assistance to data voice communications from from the incentive fund to thank you any further comment i 'm quite happy with that report and the recommendations for the comment right replied we 're not necessary counselor miller after the resolution was in favor um item number two the director of raw metal services is da4 stroke 2020 84 darling street foundation here for approvals and conditions so i wish to move that or something different come to the wall thank you thank you please counselor miller please respect councillor walsh yes i 'm pleased to be able to move this because there 's only a um it 's come to council because it 's a there 's a change to the dcp um and it 's to do with the height of a shed and they certainly have some justification for needing that height in the shed and i there was not any um neighborhood problem with it and also access has been obviously been worked out with the bowling club as well so uh i don 't think council has forget the comments should i reply probably not necessary or put the recommendation as a favor thank you colleagues to clear that character that 's it as well yep and any there 's no notices of motion that needs to be raised following that i will take a motion to close the meeting with the public considering the act of following 10a 221 the report from general community recommendations the subject is rft for 2020 caravan park management services and the reason commercial information of the population nature that would be disclosed program is the commercial position of the person who supplied it and the second is the general committee recommendation again enclosed council which is subject to use the wine village sewage screen acquisition and land easements and information that would have disclosed commercial advantage of the person who could account for israel conducting proposed businesses and that is under 10 hsc declare it carried and we 'll just wait a second _"

all those in favor against disclosures of interest i would just invite councillors or staff to please indicate in relation to any interest you need to declare firstly what i 've got report for item unitarian interest in whether the interest is for canary or non-vocunery and thirdly what is the nature of the interest held [Music] hanging having from the director of corporate services recommendation at the report everything looks pretty reasonable there considering and the the changes that we 've made budget wise some money that we found for the lick pump station the christmas festival et cetera we 've all noted these and the comments [Music] services again in regards to the 355 committee minutes of the regional art gallery advisory group council knows thank you secretary campbell thank you your comments your question council notes oh just a couple of the councils should have got their catalogue in their in their drawers um awards i thought the displays on until the fifth of december and um and the guarantee [Music] i have a question on page 37 um in multiple breeds the other advisory committee rights council cetera et cetera and it 's got carry but no one 's listed as having moved to this that 's something that we 're i guess the other question is i presume that later they 're going right to council then that letter is still coming yes i spoke to brian um [Music] we probably that 's why be part of the submission that public submissions that we 're hoping to get from the draft of the civic center plan um can i just say that i think all of these minutes from the gallery are terrific and it 's great to see that they 've gone on continually even though they 've been closed down and opened up and closed down and stopped and started for the last two years it 's amazing how well they 've continued to operate and i congratulate them because it looks like it 's been a very difficult time for them and um and it is hard planning anything but these pots actually is even harder when you have things organized and then you have to close down one day and open up three days later so i congratulate them and think that it 's it 's very good that they continue to have the enthusiasm for running the gallery just doing what the whole of australia 's doing yep oh is it western australia of the gallery you know he accepted um they 've gone into recess and they 're council council moved to resolution some time ago to effectively disband that so how does how do they access money out of the account uh account of the gallery itself still calling themselves the friends of the gallery and they still come in at times and he 'll run with and and fundraise which goes to their own account and that money is still used as to what it was previously used for okay you know just the process i never thought for the comments a question mr mayor did i miss it or were normally we get an invitation things like the colleen [Music] the because of the election period the mayor couldn 't do the opening which normally would do that i was able to attend but they also didn 't provide counsellors they had a smaller group of people for that particularly as well they actually had 200 people online watching them so they had more people turn up online than what they normally um there is a new initiative developed called um that they have as a new tab on their website and it 's a um i highly recommend visiting it 's just like walking into the gallery and you get a whole picture of yourself from from the comfort of your living room thanks very much thank you i 'll take it as the wrong involvement with my nose i was involved against declaring characters i 've been picking my check 6.3 in this building as you would see from the report the uh several activities have been curtailed down competition is tremendously popular and it 's going really well and [Music] that 's the prediction [Music] just general discussion with people having a yak and that was put down in the middle it appears that clean is still moving on i wonder if anyone has any update on clean and if not i would suggest that perhaps the general manager asked clean if if there is anything going on to talk to the new council next year get them up to speed so i don 't know whether there 's there 's anything happening that they can 't oh sorry tell us about it i think there is nothing that needs to be presentation certainly will be brought that you 're wrong and i think the general manager would also be putting every wish to not just with clean in our energy position but a whole lot of other other aspects of the ongoing program that we 're dealing with for the new council that we agreed on and first of all which happened on a new course could i just quickly understand that i understand there 's a fleet-making advertisement at the business hub sometime in the next week or two just to get the date now they 're having a meeting uh just an information evening after the comments don 't reply no for the progress and all the freshmen as well as the uh the teams are concerned that they indicated that they weren 't going they weren 't going to look at funding and such as the one they 're raising that ball and i are two or three others so there 's re-evaluating i think warren canberra as well i just wonder whether we should be right into them to get try and get a handle on that haven 't ducked it they 've just pushed it out to [Music] um appropriate what i know is in the australia last thursday which is loosely trying to quote the premium the liberal party the national party knew nothing about it the minister knew nothing about it the minister 's been i think being a little bit ambushed on it my understanding is that the water infrastructure people are still working on the business case and the and the environmental tax payers that 's this sort of speculation is totally unwarranted irrespective of whether the whether the dam stacks up or not there needs to be that thorough process to be followed to take an answer which is based on fact not on innuendo or gossip or speculation or someone else 's feeling or lobbying so i think that the council will be writing to the minister under the premises even clarification i 'll certainly have removed that and support for the project or support for the project to at least be completed to the extent of the business case and the environmental impacts they 've been completed mr chairman go through that we shouldn 't do that to joshua that 's urgent but i 'm happy to move something along those lines but i think that uh certainly my rooting of it wasn 't really unless but it was the reading of in the two national haters that i read was much clearer than that i thought whether they had any information whether they were just joining some dots or what they don 't you know and i think it was quite concerning because they weren 't going to proceed to any business case or anything else i 'm blaming some claims about a huge increase in the potential cost of the thing and also the cost of biodiversity that it 's not the rest of it so we need to get a handful is uh um let 's have a conversation about it and get emotion in the books you 're happy to move back right to the to the premiere [Music] clarification on seeing all the stuff we 're just talking about and urging them to complete the different education yes to provide provide clarity clarity and 's a lot of people around a little respite as you know something wrote i was always a bit sort of the view that this was it was flying kites anyway with this thing right through it 's disappointing that there 's a whole lot of people invested a lot of time and effort into it and for if it 's if the reports are correct that they 're now going to a stage where they 're just basically adapted without any consultation any any warning at all that 's a concern um there hasn 't been any actual explanation about that it came out of nowhere it had not been clarified by anyone and hasn 't actually gone gone anywhere other than michael corner replying to it the other day but there was no sort of clarification so i think we need to you know really find out where it 's up to you and if we can help um make it happen if it 's not that we can do a lot but we can help okay absolutely and we really do yes did the national party have is incredibly disappointing that infrastructure is as important as this is being dismissed in such an offhanded manner without any thorough investigation or business case being put together the speculation around the cost the speculation about speculation around environmental impacts the speculation of without impact on land is all just full just speculation until you have some thorough investigation into all those competing interests and you 're able to ascertain what those what the complexity around this interest is when you 're not able to make a comment but it shouldn 't be true making comment i think my personal opinion um to be pulling looking to be endeavoring or to be seen to be dismantling the project at this point he 's writing particularly disappointing as communities move forward to invest into gravity he 's really respecting the face i think for the community of the northern valley where it becomes even more important is the the new south wales and the valley water strategies have been controlled so what the water strategy would look like without landlord in terms of water efficiency water saving or water security for right [Music] at this stage otherwise we will be having the same conversation now if we want someone else in the same conversation if i keep this time takes place and they 're out of wood again and that 's what will happen that 's just bigly disappointing that people pay politics for these sorts of important infrastructure projects and i also think that 2.4 billion it won 't be cheaper i think also i don 't think i don 't think i 'd actually any reason why rural regional communities such as can 't have that sort of expenditure at all it shouldn 't just be restricted to metropolitan areas that sort of expenditures i think we could probably all talk about for four hours so if we leave it leave it at that just a comment when i i think people forget very readily that three times in the last 40 years without the damn 8 or less at one stage was about 3 and a half and the towns towns and [Music] if the dry spell that they were experiencing went on any longer and i think here where some irrigators were present one of the very very big irrigators said minister we don 't want more water we just want security for what we already have and i think it 's those points are probably you know very very worth trying to rewind the dollar i don 't know whether the dollar case takes into account what happens if we do run out more i don 't have a calculation by the community to 50 reduction in allocation is basically the same same comparable equipment with the loss of english conditions for the comments yes mr chairman um what frustrates me like um there 's already a screen item that you showed me is it sounded like the premier was making us a decision to find some money to balance his budget and there 's nothing to do with what what the outcome of this trade of this project was going to be just trying to reign in the budget that um they 'd be very loose with over a period of time and has already been said that the community 's been told what was to see this business case study which needs to be done so it can show if it 's going to be good or bad it might be bad it might go ahead but we need the facts of what this business like business case study will bring up and that therefore is putting the bureaucrats and the minister um under pressure that they 've done this work and it 's not ever going to be looked at and it also stated that entire anniversary the biodiversity offsets we 've created a problem and has been some talk thank you 1.2 billion i think we need more clarification on everything that we need clarification on what we 're going to do next because as the deputy premier uh he 's not the deputy premier now but john baragano said infrastructure they can put a railway or a highway or whatever through sydney and it just blows out and they keep on going without the business case and so forth and he highlighted that this is a very necessary infrastructure to be looked at if it 's not going to be here bit more definition than just that they 're going to park it and for no specific reason rather than what it looks like is they 're just trying to save money the biodiversity as well so there 's some real concerns for rural and regional new south wales at the moment whether it 's to try and build this books or whatever but frankly if you want to talk about that you want me to get on the hobby horse we 've now got 12 light rail all those brand new trains that are off the track for at least 18 months even because they 've brought the band things over in spain they 've had problems all over the world with them i think this is really important i think as far as we started this discussion about why i think it 's it 's it 's about the rules of new south wales but it 's certainly about dumping something and the same applies to uh danielle david because the business case hasn 't been done there right but just arbitrary decided to top it and that 's getting this place _"

    "text": "disclosures of interest and i would invite councillors and staff to indicate in relation to any interest you need to declare what you call straight item you 're declaring an interest in whether the interest report from the general manager regarding cara community grants in that i am a member of two groups which are recommended for funding those being the woodstock progress association and the stock show society [Music] and just remind you in accordance with 1993 council is live streaming and reporting this meeting by speaking at this meeting you agreed to being live streamed and recorded please ensure that when you speak at this meeting you 're respectful to others and use appropriate language at all times and council accepts no liability for any defamatory or offensive remarks or gestures made during the course of this meeting public forum would be we have nobody and we have two sets of minutes to deal with the first one is ordinary council meeting 22nd of february on patreon council of middle eastern councillor walsh wants to second it but do you want to know yourself of interest it suggests civic center performance update it was not the kara civic center it was the visitor center to do with the uh uh crown land management yeah i 'm happy that absolutely cool thank you any other comments on the minutes thank you councillor walsh with the match did your accurate record all over the favor right against declare carry this second time on page page twenty thank you any comments which is the committee recommendations i 'll just okay patient so the first one is the section 355 community minutes of the civic center reference group as i explained that is [Music] perhaps through you to the general manager none of these recommendations from the general committee have a mover and a seconder which they normally do just wondering why this is [Music] back to the subsequent committee meeting for confirmation but the new program that 's been implemented it doesn 't provide for movement all right councilman you 've spoken um i 'm waiting are you um as i referred to at the committee meeting this is uh we had a good meeting of the reference group and we of the things that came out of the meeting was that we asked council to consider in the next long-term financial plan uh funding or finding or uh injury um updating our cara council cultural plan which is about five years out of date and uh needs some attention so we asked the council to do that in the long term financial plan and we will be discussing um i 'm going to be discussing that with the director and how we go about that later today uh the other things are fairly self-explanatory and there 's no notes is think that 's that 's a really good need because at the time we went through a very long extensive consultation process to develop the current plan and it 's pleasing to note that just about everything that we identified on that that needed to be done has been done and i think that 's a credit to everybody involved obviously the people that got involved in the consultation process the plan itself um council adopting that plan and then start being able to go away and work through that get to in the next one something that is reflects the the needs of our community and it can be affordable and that we can work through that success we 've done the virgo and the next meeting of the reference committee i think is wednesday next week and um so if he could be advised if council approves this tonight if he would be advised further comments or questions right reply point up required i 've got the resolution i was in favor of carried over number two is investments and the recommendation there we we know the investments financial report thank you councillor walsh thank you any comments or questions on this no comments no questions i 'll put the resolution in favor against declare carried over 3.3 which is the donations cnn way central west group recommendation there by 300. council council smith comments your questions to young people competing in a public speaking competition i think is very very worthwhile thank you i think it should be noted that while this is a competition that ranges more widely than just parish shire we do have a other lgas which are helping to fund this important event as we i hope will do thank you for thank you once again this is a very good cause and uh it 's something we 've done in the past and it 's a good thing to actually have in our in our in our town enjoy the comments i 'll put the resolution

division committee minutes recommendation here we note them the council of wall secondary council smith thank you mr councillor nothing nothing great is um [Music] thank you mr speaker yes it did mr chairman and firstly these are really important documents exhibitions they 've been reviewed obviously by the council but after extensive review by the director richard i pretty good work there 's been a lot of works going on with this congratulations but i do work on engagement from the people who have been visited and we need to promote this and publicize because it is very very important to our community we go down this beach path and get this right so we need to engage both the aboriginal and non-average community [Music] decisions director of corporate services number one and there 's a housekeeping matter that we note the release of these resolutions so a number of them with the council of wales corporate services in regards the regional art gallery advisory committee is [Music] [Music] three five five committee minutes of reasonably [Music] [Music] coming up so um yeah the councilman if you wish to speak online you were present with that one no all is good thank you very much [Music] met upcoming openings well you said this might have been coming up so it 's upcoming yeah i 'd take that on advice you were talking about councillors being divided and there would be a like equivalence but this chamber 's got restriction of some sort but now for the comments on that i 'll put the resolution on the debate against i 'll declare it um we now have the minutes of the carer sorry of the depot working party and then it 's there and a recommendation i 'm sorry a report for the recommended recommendation working from the working party council thank you i have a question i just wondered in the um the second the recommendation actually doesn 't really tie in with the recommend i 'm not sure um i don 't think it 's clear about the long-term financial clear plan and the amount of money required i think are you trying to recommend that we increase the amount of money in the long term financial plan to 850 156 dollars yep just part of that box below can i um can i suggest a change in the recommendation that council adopt the deco reader on the plateau works program and include the increased amount in the long-term next month i would like to change the recommendation number two that council adopt the depot redevelopment stage in the amount allocated for the redeveloped effort depot development redevelopment stage three includes in increases up to 850 thousand dollars i 'm not going to play the job in your long-term financial plan now the resolution effectively adopts the program and the report talks it indicates that the draft plan that staffer will present to you next week does include that funding so okay can i just have something interesting which means we can then that that budgetary process we 've still got the discretion too yeah i actually understand that but i just feel like it doesn 't actually in the recommendation it doesn 't actually talk about the long-term financial plan increasing the long-term financial plan amount or at the bottom of it and in that in that detailed columns it talks about 850 000 but it doesn 't actually say where we 're going to get the money from that the recommendation is to increase um our amount being spent in the long-term financial [Music] [Music] yes so really that part should be very clear that we 're adopting that and it 's only the funding so the wording for clarity say move through around that part just sorry it 's going to be a nuisance but it should just be the pumping should be considered as part of the yeah the report already says i know that that 's in the draft plan that you 're getting next our recommendations as we are getting them with no detail attached it does look it is quite um it doesn 't actually say anything and all i want is the council dr david the state [Music] [Music] council adopted the redevelopment stage three works program as follows and considers funding and the review of the long-term financial plan beautiful happy good second happy we agreed to do it in stages one two and three stages one and two have been completed and it 's a very pleasing result of the fuel security officers amenities etc all upgraded or renewed we now wish to move on to stage three and this is really important because occupational health and safety and the fact that it enables our staff over there to carry on the registration necessities for heavy peoples workshop stage stage 3 incorporates the storage shed renewing that water watershed pellets so the pellets can actually fit with heavy islands into the water the workshop and spit out as i 've already mentioned the wash bay but we need to as i as was already been mentioned and i mentioned it here too please note but we can must consider the budget the implications listed on page 37 which shows the estimate of 850 556 and include but it does include a 19 contingency allowance recently the development working party inspected the demo site and i took it from the comments by other members of our working party that everyone was very satisfied with the answers we got to our questions the leading members of the staff over there actually took us around and gave us a very thorough overhaul or over overview of what what is requested and what is now being listed here as part of the works so with that i just uh hope that the council will support the regiment with two recommendations secondly we should speak this point further council right now um it difficult like i support council 's lost comments about not to put that 850 000 into the long-term budget at the moment because these are all estimates and i know budget is an estimate but this could be refined down later on and it could go over two or three dog budgets to before it 's completed the story said in the water store shed that should uh greatly improve our um their reporting and then the financial year on us on stock on hand in more formalized weight and possibly even stand bar scan on it barcode and you 'll be able to stand in and scan out provide more um security to where the to the access to these stores [Music] and what others but the staff themselves they have a good understanding of it and understand what they 're doing and what they 're trying to achieve and i think this will increase the workplace safety and the environment that they 're working in and provide a very good place for them to work and we are and we will be able to maintain our highly in the repair shops and so forth there are uh and i think this could even be 10 years since we started this we had 28 pages of reasons why we needed a new depo [Music] directed three years ago and one of the and these things would be the final end to that to meet [Music] attention to page five of this report which i think is page 38 of the ipad which talks about the budgetary implications i agree with councillor wright that it is very likely that the stage 3 will go over several years and just to note that we have already adopted in the long-term financial plan an amount of nearly 330 000 for next year and a similar amount for the following year so there will obviously be further consideration in the upcoming budgetary deliberations thank you thank you for the minutes don 't necessarily reflect that but we did spend an hour or so over there had a good walk around the site and i think gleaned a very good understanding of what to transpire but as i said it 's been a there 's been a significant involvement with the staff who are over in the senior senior staff at the depot i think in fact ownership and they 've provided a regular comment into the design and he should give council a great deal of confidence that we 've got to we actually have a right that 's a credit to our staff over there but also the directors who are engaged in that uh further comments run reply put the resolution all those in favor against carried on number two from the director of detractor operations uh that 's the plan of management crown reserve 70763 which is the another [Music] exhibition gather or submissions and we have been through this before with the uh before it went out on public exhibition and i think frankly most people were written in agreement of it a very interesting history lesson though it 's uh also a dickens of the amount of work our staff have to do to prepare these crowd management land plans and i thank them for the work they 're doing on those and i suppose there 's to go uh but uh yes uh i just uh i think that uh that 's now up to the stage where the general manager can be authorised to sign that and the necessary documentation for it to go to the minister for water property and housing thank you for the comments secretary speaking out the comments question do i reply for not necessarily i 'll put the resolution all those in favor aye against declared carry over against the two other items we have in order they came in and the first one is a proposed motion to the elder conference smith telecommunications i 'm sure councillors will [Music] you should speak that counsel with me um yes i think it 's fairly self-explanatory and i did indicate that i would be removing this motion some months ago now just a little bit of background um it comes from a lot of angst amongst the communities that i deal with in in and around woodstock and darby 's falls and in particular the progress association which has really been inundated with complaints and instances of potential danger where there and haven 't_''_1997.12 been able to call in for the accident in and so on it 's also come about because the show society has been told that they can have i think 4 000 people at their show this year currently but that they need to sign in with qr codes and unfortunately there 's no telstra coverage in the in the village and so for most people signing with a qr code is is difficult although there have been some intense negotiations with telstra that will hopefully provide something for the day but it is i submit a problem that occurs throughout australia in regional and and rural and remote areas and it 's it 's one that as the background into this says is becoming more and more of a concern as more and more goes online particularly since they 're pandemic and i think it 's it 's about time that the federal government was uh strongly requested to do something about it so i commend that promotion to you is concerned it 's this is not the first time it 's been raised and this and it moves its sales style space as far as improving the system is concerned and that 's the test george houston smith has just talked about some of our villages and the surroundings and the farming areas all the rest of it in fact the carriages within care itself and rural and regional towns is still diabolical in many senses it drops out it 's stylists it 's inconsistent all of the money that 's been spent over quite a significant amount of time still has not improved the system to where it should be for a first world country for all the residents not just the ones that are in the inner city for all of us and they need to recognise that and fund it i try to make a couple of comments if i may i agree with council are never suggesting i command the council smith for putting this on the agenda and i 'm going to look forward to actually seeing it rage at the outlook out of the conference and i think it will get substantial support even from the city council because 's a call from the mayor book strip for telstra to come to the party and i 'd imagine that the issues they 're facing at the moment with the floods at the moment will certainly focus people to sharpen people 's attention but hawkesbury also covered places like biltman which was subjected to fires last year so i think there 's going to be considerable conversation around telecommunications and in some cases the lack of assistance as well as the lack of coverage i do know that that it was discussed at the joint organisation in the rda central west meeting in brainey last week and i know woodstock had a very eloquent and passionate representative at that meeting who spoke to optus about the shortcomings in that particular region but also the one that the business chamber had uh and council of peter wright was was there was a conversation about the possibilities you rate that pop up some sort of pop-up system for the for the show i think you need to get on that one fairly quickly because that could attract some funding requirements i don i did raise at that meeting because you know i think it it concerns council right right now and if something has concerned me for quite some time because we get letters suggesting that councils can help financially support the erection of towers black spot towers and it was raised by the telstra that he seemed to tell us to wrap at that meeting that they were quite interested in co-funding and i think that that i think i was able to put to put the journey back in the bottle and suggest that the amount of funding the council has had we 're not in a financial mission to actually be able to fund these sorts of facilities and services for corporate entities in particular however we can advocate for lobby for our communities which we will do but that 's another concern as the federal government is hiding behind this thing that local government could also help you know establish these black spot problems um which means they write that letter to our community and a community have an expectation of council to be providing something and difficult position to to to offer assistance and the second part of that of course is that even if we do there 's no guarantee until guys are going to come anywhere because there 's an insufficient number of people under the under the tower so it 's a lose-lose [Music] hopefully i know some of the metropolitan councils with all the fairground money they 're able to get and the lack of services that provide that we have provided they may be able to provide that sort of services but local government shouldn 't be asked to provide that sort of funding for the comments i 'd just like to comment that um sorry i 've got to congratulate audio central which did a very good job last thursday in lane yeah thank you i 'd like to also just congratulate the mayor did put it very eloquently at the meeting to the telstra and other representatives there very well to explain that we didn 't have any money and we couldn 't afford to co-fund and that uh this was a problem and we needed it addressed so um work with jos to come up with some suggestions and some alternatives but it really is fairly and swearly in the federal government so leave it and we need to continue to push them to do more thank you for the comments mr chairman you touched on one thing there but when we go to conference there 's quite a few city delegates there and um they didn 't want their 5g towers because it was going to upset their health i suggested they maybe they 'd send it out to us or they didn 't want them anywhere in new south wales or something so i said if you don 't want your communications upgraded you can send it out to us i didn 't get much hearing as the mayor said the um this recent event the custom fire event last year has shown very big shortfalls in the network system on the emergency side of things it wasn 't just the hawks brilliant but the miracle um but the thing that floored me that maybe was that the telstra family got up and said your services is 've got enough money in it that 's what 's that 's what 's holding the battery records like i said well we used to have a good telephone when it was able to tell it was in the cockpit with all that communications but now we 're told to do everything online and um mobile and then all this and their internet [Music] fundraising if we punch the service for you we can get a dividend we should be no giving it why would we complain i exhibited into the shareholders i said um well funding is that you apply for grants i said that we can 't live on grants for the rest of our life right and as councils said in the town in regional towns as problems as they told to put the nbn on their computers for the phones so when the nbn goes out their phones go out normally left is a mobile phone to do their work if that 's possible uh beaches wool over in the young area he 's in trouble took three years ago to put the nba on his run the law options and so forth to detriment that it 's important for his business the machining companies over there three through three o 'clock and after them they get a very substandard even more substandard service because everyone goes home and turns their kids computers on and the hose is not big enough and the telstra fellow said oh this one in grand chamber he was the lawyer and he said even he connected the nbn and it 's so much good and the fellow said yeah don 't do it but we 're really suffering and talking about black spots you 've got highways from uh milling from westfield down to linders on the on the backus road spot you 've got thousands of cars traveling those roads every day and i think we can make that we will make an argument whoever goes to the conference team to get support for this and perhaps with a bit of support from the eastern suburbs of the sydney that we could get through a medium about several months ago uh minister little brown made the comment that he enough people and in his his electorate i think it 's marine island i think uh the uh they all got stuck in and they had to make their own arrangements that 's next that 's what basically what the people they were trying to tell you their accounts and put some money in i think that 's probably what they 're trying to tell me but anyway wish you luck with that and i hope something of time things will i think the councillors have taken all this in consideration i know that we must make sure we don 't get hung up on just nbn or telstra that is a broader issue around telecommunications even where some of the old landlines are not being repaired properly and where people can 't get direct access to service to actually get a new phone connected where there 's a software in the wall so there 's a whole range of communications issues that need to be addressed so the comments don 't require council of smith i 'll just thank you mr mayor for your support thank rda and the spoken here today i really believe that in terms of access to emergency services and information in terms of business development education and social connectivity this is one within the system like the rest of my family are my father and my brother they are trapped they don 't get to leave prince william second second item is the community grants round two there 's a recommendation there with a whole lot of wonderful community organisations to benefit if we summon moves and sections and we agree councillor kevin is happy to move that being one of the judges and i 'll get someone to counsel walt did anybody want to comment at all councillor kevin do you want to comment very worthy projects small projects mostly rural also with town there 's a lot of hardworking organisations out there that now with the grand scheme are able to go ahead with their projects

for prisoner Cara Bishop chamber is going to talk to us so Jordan come in please here there Jordan okay hey Jordan how are you hey I 'm well how are you good thank you good thank you the floor is this is also going out live on the bright brave world of the Weber whatever you call that say you are in public forum excellent things I said I would invite you to address it kami on the matter to which you are choosing which opportunity and the gift code yeah excellent so as everyone knows that gift cards mean something they 've been running for quite a while now we 're up to our six year in the program we serve ourselves a few targets in order to people to use the music actively over the last two years we 've seen some some great use particularly in using it for gifts around on actual year and as well as Christmas and New Year I won 't bore you too much it 's just a few really good ones but I 've got the stats from July 2018 to to 2019 622 cards were loaded and from july 2019 to June 2020 833 cards were loaded the load values were substantial as well so 2018 219 there 's thirty three thousand five hundred and seventy dollars loaded onto the cart and in july 2019 to June 2020 there was 58 thousand one hundred and seventy five thousand dollars so lots of money we set a target last year of a hundred and fifty thousand and we can crack that means just this month we 've cracked two hundred thousand dollars rather than in card so it 's been it 's been a journey and a lot of a lot of money spent and locally which is fantastic which is the yes but we 've also spent a lot of time and a lot of money in Avatar odd through waves of print media through the through the Guardian swallows on the radio and through TV and through the Christmas street festival as well so you cat but due to that success there has been an increase to the price of the cards as capitalism would have it so we found that the cards have just gotten the remaining steady on the price are a little bit more expensive but the amount of cards that we need to order and I have increased so the minimum order it 's gone up a little bit in order for us to have enough cards by Christmas I 'm hoping that clover doesn 't restrict the carry personal strength muscle which I 'm holding my fingers crossed there but if if not we still need to prepare these cards of those businesses that suspend them on their employees through the Christmas period and also to keep money flowing throughout the town in that time so we have requested that council provide on a 50% contribution to the next order of cards and yeah that order will be processed very shortly by the chamber in order to have them during time but we greatly appreciate the council 's assistance in dari colleagues and Thank You Jordan there 's anybody move on Thank You Jordan appreciate that and obviously there 'll be some commentary out of the committee meeting tonight but you 'll have an indication of what council thinking thanks for much and thanks to your support so far the chamber thank you very much thank you good thank you we will move on colleagues and will now deal with the minutes compilation of notes they 're meeting on 9th of June 2020 yes counselor well thank you can go to your hand somewhere councillor Fagin did you move your hand oh thank you second counsel the Fagin there 's any issues there that I we need to raise now issues and I 'll put the minutes besides if you 're an accurate record all those in favor all right anybody against your colleagues very handy if you do give some sort of signal colleagues thank you for that quickly for the public for any the public who are watching with the communication of a result not just Amir making it up as he goes item number one the general manager he is in regard for the festival my I formal request has been sent to New Zealand to continue with continued to the right word to become the festival nation again next year I guess this means you 're moving that yes Thank You counsel bagging or thickening that you just just to say that this is appropriate in a number of ways they weren 't able to come this year obviously but also they 're probably the most lighting capsular Fagin is rip on the vegetable committee you want to add to that at all yeah no it 's good we really want to celebrate their front across deep it 'll be glades to be able to include the next year and look forward to something very bright and cheerful and a bit festival activities I think you 're quite right and just to add there I did as as the German report was indicated I did ring Damon at King that the High Commissioner and she was warm is an understatement she was delighted that we were going to invite invite the back and she became very keen to be involved I think she 's still the bowling meanwhile bowling and ran amok which also for the comments the rod reply I 'll put the resolution all those in favor thank you I remember to one year two injuries the can to the world fuel microphone still on item number to do is the Business Chamber which we 've had a presentation from mr. Jordan on in regards to Kemp you 're supporting with recommendation something differently counselor well thank you know the second employees to counsel the Miller thank you you should speak counselor world yes mr. mayor are happy to support this in that I think it 's been a great success and any small incentives that counsel connect we used to encourage money to be spent locally I think was an excellent thing particularly in view of the tones that we 're in Thank You counsel Miller so happy you muted you muted brutal sorry mr. mayor it 's it 's certainly happy to second admits it 's an easy decision to thank I think we yeah the because of we 're just ready up by Jordan our most impressive and then it you for the comments Robert was not necessary but the resolution all those in favor against I declare declare carry thank you item number three from the general manager is the draft draft the parks and memorials policy for council open spaces some other move that drought council Miller you 're happy to move that our second employees council the Smith council nobody was to speak just briefly mr. chairman obviously now if we pass it in a couple of weeks time but the council loading yeah it 's a result of high school today 's positive response to this is that it will will go on public asset exhibition that prepared at least 28 days to seek feedback from our community in all the different user groups etc but I I do want to acknowledge the work that has gone into this by mr. Jones as we know we 've had some discussion area and these policies over the last at a while and there was some concerns raised about some of the wording and and it 's now much clearer and I think that 's appropriate it really place too as far as said the not only the council knows what the future holds as far as the plaques are concerned and memorials but also what the public can expect as well and what but if I need something that they want to get involved in they need to know what the process is so it 's all ago I think it 's a good class they should be approved they can catch them and they 're taking tuitions because I 'll come back and clarify something I think if the second it isn 't yes yes mr. Muir I would like to speak briefly I endorse what councilor Miller has said and I think this is particularly timely because there is a social tendency I think to for people to be wanting to put up tangible memorials more even than they used to I do have one suggestion for an addition to this and that is and correct me if I 've missed it anywhere that there 's nothing in here that talks about the memorial being in a form that is appropriate to the space in not dangerous for example to children that sort of thing and also that it 's not offensive to any section of the community in in its formal or the content of the plaque or whatever so with those suggestions for addition I certainly endorse this draft recommendation thank you thank you I think the points you 've raged I 've been I 've been noted what do you like to comment it to point out the draft these around the parks and memorials in open spaces it 's slightly different to the art gallery policy in the public that policy design for open spaces on council land so easy draft and it began to keep shifting you 'll go to council as a resolution recommendation that the draft goes in probably exhibition it each month that the galleries policy which we do a little bit later on you further comment or question anybody replied council miller leave a gap thank you I 'll put the resolution I was in favor all right against the declare declare carried item number 4 we 're going on managers in regards to simper men it mister chairman Thank You council of all chickens that Boutrous p.m. tomorrow barley briefly mr. chairman this is this is good news in looking that that it means that the more restrictions I think it 's about this habitat were concurring the recommendations arrange for food central table ends it is that perspective the 6th of July but is it going from level 5 to level 4 which is I suppose an indication about what has happened as far as the decision is concerned as well so it 's such a good news story okay thank you for the comment the second we should speak I 'm gonna do that and I think you think falling cancer bloody quite right it 's hitting the right direction and technically councilor work and whichever way whatever we have a good relationship with so they come into our reply what they do and off with resolution all those in favor again against you Claire carried item number five from the general manager local government elections just confirming that local elections confirmed fourth of September twenty twenty one we 're noting the report be second was that used to speak counselor bagging just to say that this is I 've been on the cards for a while we thank heavens because it would have been very difficult to this day to have an election in September and it 's a good move and this is just you know the paperwork that followed the decision thank you thank you for the comment mr. Muir I just have a question through you to the general manager we set aside an amount of money each year to pay for the election because of the postponement for a year we 'll be setting aside an extra amount of money in the next this this financial year that normally would go towards the election in four years time I 'm just wondering whether we need where the council needs to do anything in order to make that amount of money that we make criticizing this financial year available for the election after next if you see what I mean general manager our three is to mr. chairman the ten-year financial plan that council adopted in June does provide in that timetable it 's the question so Smith I guess that thank you yep any for the comment for the comment right replied probably unnecessary council of alien yep I 'll put the resolution all those in favor all right against that Eclair carried the general manager sorry the Director of Corporate Services report is next senator regards investments that we note the investment financial report for June remover please Will Smith and councillor Fagan thank you you speak counselor no mr. mee I did have a question and it was about sorry I 'm just looking it up um does anybody else want to comment while Council is Vegas looking at that question it 's all yours counselor Hagan thank you um sorry I 'm just there was something right at the end that I couldn 't understand and it 's very difficult um to make it worse we should never get a 700-page agenda in front of us so sometimes you lose if we lose a page occasion you saw I 'll require your patience the other night said I 'm four colleagues sorry I was right happy to give you this relation to ask a question later on if you okay I just oh we did actually I did want to mention we did talk about talking about you know running some sort of incentive or encouraging people to pay their rates early on time because we are behind this year I was wondering if anything came out of it um whether we actually did come up with a plan to get people to pay their rates on time and the answer that is no should we should we go back and reconsider it or the conversation we need to have it the emotion mean well it is slightly rising you know every year we seem to get a little bit more behind and 400,000 is quite substantial amount of money but I guess we are getting interest on that or we aren 't at the moment already so mostly three months now I think remember there were a number of issues that were almost impossible to advocate to much for playing early but it 's something I think people reconsider as you know many you I 'm not just not sure whether there are some other places doing things that might be we might find interesting more you know starting give us a bit of a lift yep oh I probably the only comment I 'd make mr. chairman is it is a little bit of odds with the direction from the state government and certainly the changes to the act that has given every right way the opportunity to extend the first payment at least by a month and in the as amazing Decatur the waving of interest rates the council is aware of so he 's a little bit at odds with that that framework that belong our onion at the moment maybe a bit of incentive might make it easier we can I think I think was a conversation if emotional eating if you 're quite happy to raise that they account for the token I think it 's appropriately councillor Smith had a hand up first Thank You mr. Muir and I had a phone call recently from a rep pair who lives in Gurgaon it was very concerned that his early July but he had only just got this is a couple of days ago he had only just got the letter informing him and because he 's an elderly gentleman and because he lives out of town he comes in well very very seldom so he was worried that he was going to be fined and all that sort of thing and I explained that he wouldn 't be fined but it is it is a bit soon when we know that mail is taking a fair amount of time these days but if the letters are getting out after the rekts are due that is a bit of a concern I stick in in that you 're quite right informatics thing anything comes out to us past of you date then it gets a little bit concern but in that particular case you might pass that information on to the to the Bricklin particular so that he can make a no that make a note of that in that case it 's important to perhaps comment there mr. chairman that must be a peculiarly situation for that rate 30th of September that was a question I was here okay okay he said beginning of July figured out counselor or could you have you end up just I was going to mention once again that some of the monies has been made available by the federal government was an actual thanks specifically mentioned to enable people to pay their utilities for Rachel water that was Business Assistance yes certainly was on and I think begin will be a right time I 'm a for the comments reply put the resolution was in favor all right against corporate services recommendation there that we request from Romano Madeira recreation ground and DA three to seven hundred dollars in the recommendation I just recommend something slightly different please mister me and could I could we just change it to add an extra two to paint a whole lot of the application for these the 1724 dollar 30 instead of just thousand dollars you know check it out hey Saul shaking it get to the pay to ride you just we counsel knobs look I just think that it 's a great development he and helping one on the darer and let 's continue that even though that we 've got a lot of funds let 's do in the in the bucket so yes thanks mr. mayor yeah I support this recommendation they did note that the in the report that I have that we 'd already provided some money for for the surface up update and half the water part of the water refund but the committee 's work very hard to get this project up and going they 're a small committee and and with the development of this hall will strengthen the community out there and the community has grown significantly in the last period we would have received far more and 1,700 in days and so forth from the new residents that have moved out there and developed and built and I think this is a good community project and and for us to donate this amount back for them to help cover the DA 's fees is reasonable if any further comment councillor Miller Thank You mr. chairman I probably don 't going to be a party-pooper but beyond this and I agree that it 's been a really hard work in committee but as council rod has just indicated we 've we 've actually assisted up to date in a number of different areas as far as this development is concerned and certainly there 's a recommendation will be dealing with a little later on where we 're going to recommendation is if we do not charge section 94 contributions as well which is something in the aura for 9,000 so I think this is a reasonable to the original resolution in my view is reasonable and it 's something that we should support rather than think together the whole hog I think the comment around oh yes there is a significant amount still in that budget post or remind everybody that 's the first month of the new financial year and that 's why it 's looking rather help with the mammoth there will be seen it calls on those funds over the next step 12 months I am sure so we 'll probably have to supplement those as well and so so my view original recommendation which was a donation of 1,000 and then I 'll test the mood again and move it I mean that 's what we do they might get a second counselor Walt rehabbing a second that okay thank you sorry shape counselor Walsh we you know I would just wanted to speak I 'm not shaking it all right I 've got an amendment on the books councillor Smith you happy to second the amendment yes thank you all right now we deal with amendment before we do other they go way to go he any bit I 'm happy to have any other other colleagues from counselors Council of I was reluctantly I 'll speak against it because it was made very clear following a earlier problem we had with money being overspent of the of a grant that was given to a organization it was made very clear that the grant money am I using it they need to be aware of the fact that should cover all eventualities it should cover counsel fees etc and we are making as councillor Miller said lately now you know amount of assistance I do note also to though that the the the actual cost of the enterprise and I hope they they 're bearing in mind what we 've said before the cost of the enterprise has listed at being ninety five thousand dollars more than the grant money I presume that 's allowing them to cut back but on the original proposal but we do need to always consider that there 'll be others who will be wanting to do the same thing and we have as I said said that the grant money that they have applied for and through council were able to get should be covering all their expenses can I have a clarification please hmm it was counselor while speaking against the the whole concept of a donation or just the the amendment or the the original one he was speaking of the general comments I think counsel but right I have not seen anybody speak for or against the with you know he was speaking you did something but I didn 't know if it was the it if it was the new have that clarified please I 'm happy to be when I was counsel was to clarify that and I 'm happy that counsel was making against the amendment against the amendment I counsel of Washington speaking I watched asleep rush to John idly interpret their point of order though mr. mayor I think I think that you might have you submit the amendment was what Bruce I canceled the Miller board to the time that 's right there 's no point of order so counselor most can 't_''_1778.65 be speaking against that amendment not assume I 'm asking for comments on the amendment haven 't done our formal formal a formal run of debate and before the amendment has put there 's a move of the motion the original motion you get a reply so I 'm happy to continue just a lesson discussion I clarify what there 's in the report it talks about the budget impact and it talks about a budget for 2020 and then at a budget for 2021 can i clarify what that means I doesn 't make any sense it 's on page 55 follow me sir you can literally pick that up please I 'll come back you come to the world it 's under the table that we provided support for its 2017 I 'm working at the highest copy that 's also Paige I 'm one of you I had coffee is my hard copy doesn 't give me patience I 'm sorry but I 'm sure with general manager to get out will pick it up and I 'm working on a hard copy colleagues because I can 't I can 't run my iPad as cheering the meeting and get back to the copy all the time shall government so the copy on your iPad so I 'm having either adoption through the chair on belief in sin error it should really be referring to the current financial year which is 2021 in which we have a current budget suicide with twenty eight thousand two hundred and eighty six dollars which is very clear on the proper yep thank you any further comments councillor Walsh we 're going to just singing clarification because I get Oh forgive me if of arrived removed an amendment to the original recommendation they just knew they 'd they moved they moved emotion which was still counselor can move any motion upfront irrespective of what what the report to Council is and they just cancel those very quickly jumped in and said that he wants to move the amend emotion with uh slight change in the figure which like which again which is in order councillor Miller 's move the amendment which is which is that we don 't and that was seconded so the comments yes with this mr. Muir reluctantly I am in favor of the amendment obviously because I seconded it that 's not to say that I don 't agree with what counselor nerves and counselor right set in terms of the one and are a community and how well they 're working in that sort of thing but I do think it 's it 's important that we are fairly consistent in what we do and it was approximately a year ago that we were asked to provide a donation of around five thousand dollars to a community group application and at that time we decided to only give them a thousand dollars of that five thousand they requested so I think it it is pretty unfair if we then move to another quite a similar sort of group and say we 'll we 'll give them the whole thing and that 's that 's reluctantly the comment whether comment okay I 'll reply cancel note there 's a new the original motion so I can 't enlarge I thought we were talking about the amendment the Bruce would not that 's where we were up to we are we are I 'm quite happy to put the amendment and will then debate the amendment which it becomes emotion and you 'll get a reply there so I 'm quite happy to put the amendment as it stands so which means I put the amendment all those in favor the amendment please signify we 've got one two three four five six I declare the amendment I exceed amendment carried I think that becomes the motion but I think it 's a little bit loosely worded so councillor Miller mr. chairman it 's the recommendation is created in the report the amendment further to the motion now is that we are dealing with the moved by Councillor Miller talking about countable means which we 're dealing with the amendment which is the reflector odds the motion which is in the agenda and mr. chairman just to clarify that that is now the motion is the motion yes or yes thank you you 're right sorry yes and as anybody wish to speak on the motion bearing in mind counsel a noted right reply at the end of this debate before the motion is put as it moves the original motion not to move the amendment any further comments you cancel all right thank you mr. Muir um I I don 't want them to go in without anything but I think we 're getting a bit this bringing up what money we 've provided historically it 's the first time I 've seen it and I would like to see other people every every other organization was the same the same thing and I don 't think the the _''_2166.589 the dwell on applications they just make an application to us to see if they can get some relief from them and and and that happens every day and various organizations are even from from various private days so I would preferred the rest but I 'll support what 's there thank you Thank You counselor any further comment or I just need counsel an observer I reply as you move it original motion well mr. chairman just before you do just a clarification it 's not the first time that we 've seen a report that actually does note the support that the council has given I have an over time for different community groups it 's a regular to exclusive course of study so that just just to square it that rhythm that 's thank you that would be a good thing to give them but actually after reflection I think thousand dollars is isn 't quite adequate and it covers it and I think other people will be asking for similar money in the future I just think these people also this organization hard-working as it is as well for other things so I think we 're they will have to be I 'll have another around a community groups donations that they probably want apply for funding later on when they know what they want more in the feed out of the recreation room so of the new buildings so I think there 's quite a few opportunities coming up for a quick comment before I ask council an aged 2 to 3 driver reply I just want to make sure that we realize but anybody in what which makes like very clearly understood the council has done a lot to support the one in Madeira group to get to where they 've got to has been no stone unturned in our support and that support will continue I 'm sure this was simply a conversation about the amount of support on financial support on this particular occasion on this particular matter councillor Dutch I thinks mr. mayor look the original note that might change to the original motion was simply to try and help out a smaller community in times of covert and times and I 'm quite prepared to go back to that thousand dollars as long as I get something I just thought that we could in this time help them out that little bit extra that 's all Thank You counsel no tropical resolution was in favor against it carried and now move to item members free agree sorry mirror item of three which is the mayoral and councillor face and his recommendation there to know the report and come to the Welsh though second employees on that be to second it can solve a sorry it hands up your second well I met with the Signet thank you getting over come to wealth used upon thank you most most times when these fees come up we talked about the fact that there is really not adequate remuneration for local government service as I might call it but in particularly bearing in mind the the times we 're going through at the moment the times of many other people you know in our community are going through I think this is appropriate but a comment mr. chairman oh yeah as the second it 's a lot it 's a done deal anyway but I think it 's a disgraceful ruling by the department you 've got to wonder whether run the Minister for local Gabbard has had her remuneration Pollard as far as this is concerned that they be now increase Yeats of that quite finally is no that 's not the case I think this is a cynical move and as far as we all agree we all acknowledge that there is in it inadequate narration for the elected bodies of councils and their responsibilities they do that hasn 't changed in many respects that sir it 's probably increased and that we recognize that where they 're stopped and with the the resolution we took as far as our staff are concerned right across the board with an increase see it and that 's right across the sector the only people owed are and not having an increase at all because of this cynical mood bothered the minister is is the elected body full stop and I think that 's again emphasizes how they think of us for mating of I did the same to their own remuneration I 'd be very happy to to support this recommendation is to noted because as I say it 's already a done deal but I think we should by cowardice pleasure now to administer and to the Premier 's wellness this is concerned it 's a very cynical move for the comment Thank You mr. mayor I support what councillor Miller just said and what counsel Walsh who said I 'm not looking for I 'm not I wasn 't looking for a pay increase or whatever but I was interested when on the local news think it was on three or four nights in a row here orange councils are getting more money and the mayor 's getting more money and there are well it must be something wrong but for some reason they 're able to get you go up to a next level or they 've created another thing that 's become a Regional Council and that 's probably on turnover or something but they 've been able to access the existing amount of money for them and so very unfair I thought if it if if the majority are getting an increase no one should should get an increase I still I 've been banging on for ten years that this is a this real human nation thing is an anti discrimination against small communities and the people that work for small communities I thought less of by the ID a bio part the state government in what we rumination they get it 's interesting that orange goes into a into a higher thing but they 're looking for for councils around them to supply water to their town they 're struggling to have enough land and everything for hope for their future expansions and they need to bleed the councils around them did were to maintain that their local business infrastructure so we 're sort of losing out everywhere here and as council member said it 's a done deal it 's loaded and we just move on but I I would if we are going to write a letter I suggested that any council that 's been moved to a different group grouping because of a shouldn 't be given an increase from what they were before because they would have been voted on before that I 'm just it 's just thank you for your understanding for the comment for the comment I think we would all would agree and some wants to move the supplementary up this is quite possible camps in whether we write to the ministry but dealing with this one on this particular carry noting a report and I think the one point I would make publicly is I think both both of you two picked up that both of you have picked up that there 's been a fair bit of media around about Bathurst and orange councils they have got as councillor up said a new category that 's where their increases which are they much publicized that have come from rightly Iran there 's a further comment as a move we should speak reply hurry up at the resolution towards in favor those those against it carried I 've seen some movement in the station thanks mr. chairman and just as up and say I met arising on premier end of Minister for local government and objecting to this arbitrary decision them indicating very clearly that we do understand typically that a whole communities right across the state endorse Australia arena from government however if it was consistent with all elected members of parliament as well as elected councillors we would have no trouble at all with the decision but to single local government here is just not good enough resolution we like to those two people there 's checking that Council a federal rock you are the second that thank you thank you rights do we need further discussion on that I think it 's self-explanatory I didn 't even mention a company CEO I did there 45 25 hours for council so I think we all work very very hard and we don 't do for money that 's that 's the issue here it 's a moral issue as much as it 's a possible mr. chairman it 's an equity issue in the principle yep so the comments drive requirement necessary up with the resolution I was in favor again before Karen let 's for drift of corporate services which is three five five minutes we 'll be happy to know thank you briefly mr. me firstly I just like to think counselor knows who 's come along through the last couple of meetings out of interest and has given some valuable input to these meetings we had our first face-to-face meeting since February this afternoon in the chamber and that was really good the only other thing I 'll just mention to you is that on Thursday we are having a zoom meeting with a newly formed Youth Council in Kuta Mandurah where we 're hoping that we will be able to they 've got lots of questions for us and we 're hoping to be able to give them a bit of a helping hand and perhaps some mentoring sounds like the local members been extoling your worship your virtues across a liquid occidental know if you were sick speak that at all or no noticed Thank You mr. chairman I do and I thought I 'd be good make counsel spit but young her commentary obviously I think it should be work of this this group do this nude counts maintains more sober but they resolved to do here as far as the donation second so that should be the subject at the appropriate time I am I 've knowed he can do and perhaps through a column mister Jim thank you yep I think that 's a valid point counselor Miller and maybe there 's something we can check on to the wouldn 't know then we take on to the meeting if the councilman to formally put it is working particularly well and are particularly good group of young people and I think every generation says the next generation is going to ruin the world but I think in the world is in good hands for the comments question do councillor Smith point them to the minutes there it 's a teen chick Eid and so they sort of a bit of a a bit of an update with each other just to make sure that they 're in a good zone and so forth do they add seem so is that what they mean there they could say you mr. Muir yes that 's right one of the youth councils focuses this year is mental health and because a lot of these kids have been in in lockdown and some of them are doing HSC and and some of them are struggling with it a little bit we do a team checking that begin every meeting just to see how everyone 's going just following on from it I think it 's a very good idea and I commend them and and perhaps it might be something to look at in the future you know in other groups that we have meeting they do council local you raise your hand do with you I just wanted to add that in their in their wisdom they also they don 't move out the old geyser they check it on the walls thank you any further any further comments on this I 'll take a right of reply counselor Smith and no comment so with

system where we committee all but part a part of the policy and the regional art gallery so I think it 's good thank you Thank You council affair you know now it 's just dishes to adopt the new board

minutes of the nature beta venture favoring counselor faggins denominator moves that you have a second to please counsel Smith I 'll take that the new counselor Fagin used to comment I do actually um I attended the last meeting which was last week and I 've been a playground anyone who 's been in playground we 've done notice an amazing amount of activity up there there 's lots and lots of families lots of children and really lots of dads with the young families and I 'm very impressed that the adventure playground brings out the met with the dads in all of us so it was great and I think there 's been so much the playground in this town and this hard-working committee has been responsible for nearly all of it with the help of counsel I must admit great deal of input from rod Henderson and Duke and all the board early and work staff so I think it 's it 's terrific so if anyone hasn 't been it is actually a really great place to take your children take your family and have a picnic and if you can get a table you 're very lucky but it is it 's great and it 's working out very well you know if you it 's amazing it 's just really terrific the photos on Facebook if anyone wants to take a look and it 's become a very popular spot fishing in the holiday thank you I think you 're quite correctly councillor Fagin thank you so now your involvement of course I thank you for the comment secondary to speak no mister me any further comments councillor waltz yes I just like to add to what for careful Fagin says I 'd like to congratulate all involved with it I week supervising some grandchildren and it was extraordinary the number of other children that were there and also the number of families who have travelled not just locals but people have traveled for distances so obviously they have heard about it there and I think I think it 's a great attraction that also one of the things that we do know you don 't know there 's a few more rubbish bins up the one place well I 'm sure the director picked that one up further further comments rather reply put the resolution all those in favor against they be clear carry these counselors other than number two from the drift of infrastructure operations native title notification for ministers with the recommendation to dot points there about nominating council offices as it moves our native element if you can 't deliver sound like your voice take account for Fagin thank you you can be our mr. chairman only to say that this really is a house whose men or something has to be done on an annual basis to comply and it 's what two names that I responsible position thank you William you happy any further comments on this a question all good reply not necessary on that occasion I would suggest that the resolution all those in favor again there is carried item number three from the director of internal operations use the plan and management for the crown reserve Niveen below five six which is actually the visitor center of the Smith thank you ii are I don 't think a little well thank you when you come into a questions on this mr. mayor I 'll I 'll start by congratulating director and his staff on this plan if there 's an enormous amount of information here going back a very very long way and I 'm absolutely in awe of the amount of work that has been taken to get us to this point there 's still a long way to go it 's got to go to the minister it 's then if it 's passed what would be put on public exhibition for 28 days so it 's a very very cumbersome process and it 's I feel quite sorry the number of the other crown reserves that we manage I support that the second division speak at all at this point I 'm just going to make a comment I think the council has basic examination on point deals with issues for a crown reserved and written or specifically a building which between there 's a quite fun number of years to go this amount of documentation isn 't that a red tape to get to this we still work to go I think is really just putting a lot of pressure back on local government lot of cost shifting and a lot of necessary with unnecessary red tape not contradicting with my processes to follow and issues to be kicked off but a building like this in a situation like that sure we 've got to be an easier way of being able to pull this sort of financing to into community with some of these sort of the community I just like to comment that obviously in the 1890s they also had a lot of red tape because there 's a lot of Gazette tools and lots of that 's all I can say always being the same things haven 't_''_3590.42 got a easier and certainly with the amount of documentation from historical documentation there 's probably what 's making it a little bit easier now to do with this I guess you 're quite right thankful for that part though the comments mr. chairman just briefly and it 's just picking up on Bruce point there I think that it was made interesting greedy and did give a lot of history but block of the producers uses over a long period of time and so whilst it is own risks and and certainly will be addressed for this type of detail to have to guess from all of the others planned that is that is listed the Korean leader the reserves and all the rest of it I think it so it does make for some interesting wordy and if anybody that 's listening out there has some time I suggest they I take the time to perusal thank you good points make your colleagues any for the comments rod reply I mean I 'll put the infrastructure and operations still with the Environmental Services sorry Environmental Services and we 're talking bad da40 once back 2020 my straight Abi 's falls so do the I would have moved their accounts for the wall cities and up to us a second council Smith thank you mister question mr. chairman is the director is still available or as he had to go home I don 't know she still assembler thank you I didn 't know it she 's not gonna be usual let us know thank you may wish to speak thanks mr. mayor this is brought to us simply because the there 's going to be a change in the set back of the front fence which is not out of place with surrounding neighbors and there has not been an objection to it and also it complies with our LEP and it fits the local land use so I I have no hesitation in supporting the recommendations thank you I 'll just add that whilst the carport is forward of the buildings the house and that 's something that our DCP says is a no-no road so it 's a long way back and it 's not going to be an eyesore further comments why the reply should be da colleagues I think you devote before all right we got unanimous thank you 32 carried item number two from the director of Environmental Services d810 straight 2020 which is the old stone tier W Hut the recommendation ever adoption and a very extensive an exhaustive report so I want to move that or something differently Council moving councillor Walsh council Fagan thank you you speak Council of bolts thanks mr. mayor I think this is a wonderful step forward and now observing our history and we readily recognize the tremendous effectively Italian Pierre W has had on our community here in camera that 's all very well documented to in the assessment there and this this building if it 's restored will be one that has very few other likes in the in the in Australia and but but this has also got the history of the Italian BRW 's attached to it for that reason the fact that I think it will eventually become support us thank you ii wish to speak yeah this is a great project and i 'm very pleased to see it come to fruition after a long long period of time and congratulate cake and the other environmental planning people to bring it to us and so the heritage I think it 's a it 's a great time with another another great piece if you listen what 's happened in our town and I think that 's a really important and I think it 'll be great to have this available at the moment it 's you know you know look at it and it 's falling down so I think having more history and making it look really beautiful will be an ongoing project but a really good one thank you if I can Captain Smith I 'll come to you audition there 's something we 've been talking about for quite some time such the account connection is important that I would comment on two things firstly that child support must mean trade this is a very expensive report so I 'll acknowledge the hard work only thing that should be noted publicly is that issues that matter that 's been that involves land or an asset that council has control over each being externally reviewed by Anthony Davis condition two contender typically coming out of that recommendation sorry any further comments I think council Smith I said yes yes I was going to mention that myself mr. Muir but I do have a question no no no no I do have a question is this da only for the western wall because that 's not what it says in the recommendation but that 's that 's all it talks about in the background I think the director might be prepared to comment on it yes three who used to chair know the report starts off by talking about the western wall because we 've had a quote about the western wall but the DA is for the restoration of the whole building thank you thank you any further comments or questions other comments or questions rod replied for me not necessary I 'll put the resolution all those in favor is another da manha to signified to yet be with me thank you you 're right corrected I consider that to be carried unanimously thank you Thank You colleagues thanks for the build around the ears for any wrong Xterra carried unanimously item number three from the director environmental services da 47 straight 2020 at least three it 's a recommendation therefore proves with conditions that he can done must take care to memorize a council the pagans the same thinking you turn you you microphone turned up like a CV animated because you 're moving for that makes it easy Thank You Camilla Thank You mr. chairman are they 've come this has been obviously has everything that comes to Cass has been really well assessed and the reason it has come to counselors because of the the alteration that they set back the back setback in this particular case I think it 's when when you first read the on the application you think more why is that and then it since it 's very clear it is really about them whilst still appeal their way I played background be it does allow sense to me so I think we should be supporting thank you the second it was displayed counselor well much the same as what I said for the previous day I that we mentioned the setback is the only reason why has come to Council and I think it 's been well assessed and once again there hasn 't been any objections from neighbors which is always against a prime consideration when assessing and now I am very happy to support them thank you for the kind I reply probably not necessary I 'll put the resolution eyes entire colleagues all right thank you carried unanimously thank you item number four is the the amendment Karen LEP regards the Gateway determination for Yarrawonga present which we 've dealt with in our part of the process moving forward remove employees second move that council thank you taking account or Smith thank you you speak counsel Miller mr. chairman as you said this is this was a subject of significant amount of discussion and debate that was dealt with by counsel and police seems like a very positive outcome here which makes public consultation going to public consultation in in some there are some conditions attached to it which we need to counsel moods to a god by prior to it being formally adopted but I think that this is a good step in the right direction the second of which to speak thanks to me thank you any further comments on this for the comments recommendation all those in favor signify please follow getting carried unanimously thank you so all good thank you so councillors I missed you you were right with that council not don 't you yeah my video is mucking outside all right yet not yet thank you number five which is one of my dearest 1938-39 for a 2000 da 2020 sorry the all water Madeira whose recommendation there for approval with conditions thank you don 't secondly blues councillor Kevin Wright will cancel my collab Dido Kevin 's good Kevin Kevin thank you thank you Michael councillor Kevin Wright second of that that 's a bed right here to speak yes it 's chairman Nam I support this the the committee has have been stated earlier come forward with this with this da and it will be a great benefit to the community there and it 'll be a good reward to the committee 's energy energy expended out there too to get a very useful facility at this facility that at this grounds that some already been used in speaking the number two there could be some that could be in some people 's eyes the very generous some contribution however the committee stated and I also support that it is a community hall that is being built so therefore I suppose using back paddock logic by a farmer that they couldn 't pay the the money necessary some four and a half thousand dollars I think it was I said I seen there the 1% of the figure but then in counsels wisdom and if they take money out of one area they should put it back into that area so we could then be asked to put that four and a half thousand back into the into this area for the for the benefit of the residents of what a Mandara so who not charge them because it is a once again I say it 's a community a community thing and any money that that they raised by running things there will only be used in the in the running of the whole enterprise and and the welfare of the of the village and the residents around and it will also draw people from outside the Shire to events to the hill down so I just ask council to support the three recommendations there please councillor Kevin Wright you should speak at all there are lost it 's all so easy yeah [Music] Thank You counsel Kevin right many for the comments on this now for the comments I 'll reply quite necessary Council of veterans I haven 't heard anything to reply to you I thought you might have had snow up your sleeves you wanted to get up your chest but quite correct in yet your analogy with the recommendation I was in five things to get off my chest but it 's not relevant to this agenda item well we both know that you care caring in an imperfect which is the da 48 straight 2024 approval for a development in cool street happy to move mr. chairman Gasper model thank you councils me a second of that thank you any further computer speak counselor Miller mr. chairman is just a replica of what I said on tonight about Tim to ago it 's really a similar issue here and that 's really it makes sense that we approve it but it does allow for future development of a large block thank you we should support as well yep gladly agree Kelly Smith comments any further comment on it declared I 'm rod replied unnecessary order to a lot of you put the mic up with the resolution was in favor it 's a BA colleagues again declared carried unanimously we 'll move on to item number seven the director environmental services in regards to amendment the le le P and this is about wine red wine the dam again there 's always to move the segment I 'm gonna do quite happy to movie about moving counsel the Lord shaken second counsel if I go thank you you thinking I changed to the the resigning and why angular and simply put in a simple simple fashion this meal eaten able progress to be made on a wonderful amount of work that 's going to happen out there in the foreseeable future and I would understand that this now goes out on public exhibition and I would hope that any people who have any problems with it I 'd come back to us but I think most of the concerns will probably relate to the VA when that eventually happens capsular failure yes this is a rezoning and it 's appropriate that we endorse it and it 's going to be very exciting me when and if when it when it happens not if when it happens it 'll be very exciting for the residents Wangler and also the campus campus that visit regularly thank you and if I comments I 'd usually be for the comment so I 'm just going to make a couple of quick ones and when Daddy used to dish in some form built with probationary as a matter of request from from New couple of things in that the resolution really hasn 't changed any council 's support of the increasing of the hideaway and so forth you should feel very much very much there and present as I think it should be they just want to make it publicly weekly the report and that 's being picked up by both by both moving a second day we can 't emphasize it enough this report is simply about rezoning the land the public conversations and consultations in two forms but P clear in the DA will come back through the North process and people will have the opportunity to comment there in terms of the existing Holiday Park out there that 's a medical reflections to be work them through with their their tendency to market people who have Venza so forth on the chart on the current site there are some issues that I know that would initiate whales and infections I worked very very hard on and I 'm sure a lot of information the next few weeks that will come out to them to hopefully terrifying many issues that some and the ability to provide some certainty I think you hopefully sooner rather than later but it still hasn 't quite got to that that stage yet but I can assure people I know from meeting with these parties that they 're working very very hard to come to that but I think it 's important that we can we emphasize the point this is simply about the land rezoning so whatever do you put in give you on land which it appropriately so permissible for the comment run reply reply periodically r55 please councillors I do favor I carried gentle as I look at the hand it 's be on that front that black thing you don 't care you never said you could learn how you wanted you to Michael I just didn 't see your aim be clear carried any members of a the nature that need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency nothing coming forward by Wilson for a motion to close cedar in

and one from council of bruce miller also medical reasons he 's stuck in orange at the moment you can 't get home so it 's something like the move that will lead absence to be granted please apology separate council respect the council thank that you need to declare him firstly what report of the item non-beginner and see what is the nature of that interest something forthcoming we have no registration for public forum we have a personal public gallery with my registration public forum so we will move on to the confirmation of the minutes of meeting hill 27th of september before i remember a second was the director through the chair it brought to my attention that one of the supplementary emotions was missed out if i draw your attention to page 31 of the ipad under 5.5 straight a counsellor rep there was subsequent discussion of that motion where a supplementary motion work was raised and that motion is that council right to the local member and the minister for the local government raising concerns of the changes to the legislation that will result in a elected by the councillors seeking ceasing to hold office from the day of the election until the first council meeting of the newly elected council that was originally moved by councillor smith and councilman that was missed off in the uh representation so someone with that amendment is that someone 's counseling [Music] carry and the 2021 as well i 've october my apologies mr welch thank you council smith thank you your comments or questions on these i can try to try an accurate record all those in favor aye against because carried them 55. number one is the investments service report you know the investments council right thank you so much for questions on that one discuss this committee [Music] they [Music] request from the cara breakout association there 's a recommendation there thank you council smith thank you thomas question just like to say that this is actually um we have done this previously and it is to hold the very valuable collection of well very historically valuable collection of breakout association memorabilia and it 's um something we 've done in the past and it 's important that we do that until i find a permanent home for this collection for the comments i 'll put the recommendation on your favor against declarative character 3.3 and i would suggest that with this one that we know the recommendation because we 've dealt with this later in the agenda thank you that 's deal with it later in the meeting and for the recommendation of the favor against declaration number 3.4 is the 355 committee draft members of youth council council of smith i 'm sure council veteran i 'm sure thank you any comment council continues to operate on several levels they 're still operating online team bonding evenings and games evenings for the youth of cara which they 've been doing while we were in lockdown but there is another one next month and the only other thing that i would say or two things perhaps is that applications are now open for next year 's youth councillors we have a number of people leading having finished the hsc etc and heading off to other things and on the 2nd of december and i think it will have the honor of being the last event that this council is invited to before the elections is the youth council end-of-year presentation evening and i hope all councillors will be able to join us for that that 's the second do you say that you said that yeah councillor you want to stand well thank you for the comments a question right not necessary [Music] management manager notification to the minister the recommendation here that we provide two names these two of jane golem these people are very qualified to be the nominated native title managers [Music] fixing local roads round three grant funding council central bank thank you coming to your question as for in the um what they came up in the committee meeting we didn 't get the funding we wish for that what we 're getting uh is going to be very well used from what the description of what house could be done in the came up activities i 'm very happy to never thank you for the comments maybe with these recommendations like that in the future we might if we have space just add to me that this i know this is very brief these recommendations don 't have who second third moved and seconded motion between normally you 've had in the past though that 's normally the report actually talking about because it 's they 're so brilliant but you know sometimes i think the recommendation needs to be a little bit understandable or standalone yes i think so because unless you look back at whatever we were talking about in the committee meeting some of these things we have they have no context so we and we need to take over the board of communities and make sure what we frame the committee means we 'll fit into something in the stand alone responsibility they seem and recommend all right moving on to the gentleman which is page 57 which is reported on the 50th on the [Music] thank you this is a great initiative um thank you general manager for being the author of this very succinct and uh worthwhile note about the festival and the celebration that we 're going to have in march in april next year to um this is our 57th year of festival and it seemed a pity to not have a festival where we can when we 've had so many successful ones in the past unfortunately we haven 't been able to attract a destination because of the covert requirements and the lacking you know do a local festival and to celebrate all our different nationalities and encourage the young people to have a party i think we need a party and this is the after covert party which is going to be a lot of fun so we 've had these success the format of our festival in the past has been very successful so we 're going to maintain that format and include all the best parts of the festival but we won 't have the well we may have some formal people but at this stage we haven 't decided who they may be but we 're also going to have hopefully have a big party and enjoy ourselves and celebrate being coward because we have a very very um very historic festival and i think it 's important that we continue to make a fuss and continue the great leadership and youth ambassador programs and the involvement in other festivals and other nations so very happy to move this yeah i think it 's a great initiative and great workaround thank you i 'm just quite happy to comment i think difficulties around guest nations issues that have been felt across the globe in some respects particularly around high commissions and embassies i think it 's important we continue to have this sort of a festival in some form we will be looking to talk to the previous destinations as well should they be able to come but it 's a matter of working with our community and understanding what we have in our community and there 's a great program that earth council will play and that will be already outlined outlined so put the dates in your diary folks i think it 's important to also add that as part of the celebration of our rich cultural history um we 're going to celebrate the first nations people our our indigenous people and i think that 'd be really exciting and contributing to that rich tapestry maybe we can talk to tourism and they 'll get crystal carry that weekend for the comments not a reply not needed i 'll put the recommendations declare carried item number five 5.1 director of corporate services being the first quarterly budget review you want to remove that please councillor walsh thank you councillor smith thank you councilwolf as you 've said already said mr mayor it 's the it is the first quarter of the financial year that we 're looking at the surplus that 's shown there could be a bit misleading unless you delve in and i suggest anybody who wishes to inquire about it takes note of phase 69 where with the notes that are there regarding grants and contributions received but not spent under the headings of capital expenditure and capital funding i think that puts things a little bit more in perspective and i always have a bit concerned when there 's quite a carryover of already committed funding that you can give the wrong impression about the council 's charges i think it 's important to bring that out i would just thank you i took the norm um i i would just add that um as always i believe our virginity is very responsibly managed by uh the director and his staff and indeed all the directors and the general manager and uh responsibly overseen to we don 't have a lot of fat in our budget so that this surplus is by and large already allocated we are able i think to do a good job for the community [Music] 5.2 is the recommendation regarding the draft guidelines of the risk management income order can i suggest if someone 's prepared to move this you might consider adding to the adding to the second dot point and we request the proposal and current timetable be withdrawn that sounds like a good idea right you said i think that 's an important addition to dot point two because um council has discussed the [Music] proposed new arab audit and risk management framework and we 've discussed it at some length and while i think it 's important to say that this council believes that having an independent audit function is important um to ensure uh probability and fair play this council already has an arak has had for a couple of years it will need to be changed if these new proposals go through but we believe that there are so many things in the in terms of the extra time that it will take for staff especially the general manager it 's quite offensive in that the mayor is banned from being a part of this committee and indeed so our council is banned from uh voting on the committee they may be there in a a nominal capacity if they have financial literacy but i i think the proposal is uh really a knee-jerk reaction to what has been happening in a couple of councils and it i 'm really quite sick of being pulled down by the lowest common denominator i think this council works well um members have integrity including staff and councillors and probity and while some of the new proposals i believe are good there are a number that i think are just unworkable without a lot of extra time money and management and i think that we definitely need to provide that detailed feedback that we have discussed and ask that it be withdrawn council officials i think councillor smith put that very well and i agree with everything she said it 's um amazing how the government and we 've objected to it in 2019 um we as council smith said we already have an eric which works very well and i think we are very responsible as a council to our ward and risk committee and committed to an audit and risk committee we are committed to that and we understand where this comes from but it is far too much taking over the management and the finances and the organisation above and beyond the council 's councillor 's role and the mayor 's role and i think that that is very could be a backwards step for everybody so thank you for the comments yes i find the document quite attentive really and the fact that a repeated line through it is that it will enable councils to adopt in an er commerce a more principles-based approach and the fact that it gives non-elected group of people a role that counsellors and the mayor should be fulfilling and you know don 't get me wrong i 'm very much afraid of the internal order that we have at the moment but this just goes far 's putting a um the people who are elected by the but the the the delegates who were elected by the people as of the council that 's putting them in a extremely difficult position hamstringing them in their decision-making and also with our senior staff particularly general manager and directors i think it 's um they have someone leaning over their shoulder the whole time and also usurping quite a bit of the the present role of the general manager is i think republicans interesting that uh in 2019 we sent in [Music] some comments on the proposal that they don 't appear to have been listen to or discussed by the people involved or told us why our points weren 't right or wrong and i think it 's going to make it very difficult if if people that want to be they probably involved because they 're not going to be acknowledged to having their common sense to oversee what is what is happening unless you 've got some special degree and um and that doesn 't always lead good to uh good governance to have a they often get left left behind because they don 't know what 's happening on the ground i think it 's very offensive for the office of local government to pursue this um i uh they don 't seem to want to look after us in a lot of other ways but they 're going to tell us how how we 're going to manage the uh the oversight of council operations and i don 't think they realise how difficult it 's going to be to fulfill these external positions on different areas especially when you go out past the mural highway um isolated councils small big areas with after small budgets and everything are now have a very overarching extensive and they uh their price to be on these committees will be governed by another government body that uh probably also already oversight the able to raise our uh to cover these expenses i just like very many like we have an external order if that can 't_''_1493.2 be trusted it 's run under the order the auditor 's office and if that process can 't_''_1499.36 be custom sit and work and we identify a section of council each year that they 'll return in to see how we 're operating on and benchmarks against others they 've just gone too far and it 's a pity they haven 't got an office of state government to oversee the operations there it seems like they 're they can do what they like where the schools people and they pick us up one by one so i fully support what 's been said here today and pass for for the comments i 'm just going to go a little bit and support what my colleague said i think we 're all very much on the same page on this particular matter i even go as far as to suggest that we all agree that the area because it works is has relevance and it 's important but the broadening of this or creating greater extension of the the roles i think actually not only is significantly significant cost for this council and other councils in some ways providing the basic democratic principle that you have a group of unelected in and make comments about an oversight what would be the role of the councilor and it brings to in question some of the independence of their councillors may have in their role in terms of what they should be doing and how they should be doing it i look at something i picked up in page 16 of the report it 's a little bit scary because it 's just unquote should the governing body require additional information government bodybuilding council a request for the information may be made to the chair by resolution the chair may only provide the information requested by the governing body where the chair is satisfied that is reasonably necessary for the governing body to receive the information for the purposes of performance function of the label government act so independent chair can actually say no the council wants more information that 's just does my head just have an extent i 've never seen written anywhere yet where they talk about what this is designed to achieve flowery words about great accountability transparency et cetera no one really defines what that is and of the councils and some of the issues that have been receiving global government over period climate the report does not really actually heard about in 2010. you question olg 's capacity if something has been unfixed since 2010 or 2015 indeed what have they been doing this is the same mob that brought us the fit for the future same mob that brought us the amalgamation for local government becoming bringing two broke councils into one big broke council same one that brought in the joint organisations and the joint organisations i think everybody goes on in support of jo 's i think they snatched big snap sorry snatched your feet from the jaws of victory jars and now they 're now traveling the stand we accept before the standard walk past the standard we accept so i 'll support you my colleagues think we should not be walking past this but fighting it finally i think there are two of the greatest risks that local government has you 'd want the red tape do we have to deal with the cost shifting and the second one and i rate pays more that 's right then because we are so restricted by income and we look at what this council needs and has identified is improved technology and computers and that sort of technology the cost of that is something that we can 't afford to do in one year or two years but is the one thing that holds that back so on one hand we 've got to do better but we 're going to do better with less than that i think is totally unreasonable unfair to be judged on both circumstances i have no rent but i do feel very strongly about this and i thank you colleagues for what you 're saying for an achievement council thank you so much listening i look the right way daddy 's trying to work we 're so alive i don 't know i i would just add that the arab that we have is shared by an independent chairperson and i think that 's right and proper counselor wright alluded to the independent corded function that we have some of the proposals for the internal audit overlap just wasted money thank you i 'll put the resolution against decision the council plan i 'm actually needed logan thank you councillor wolf thank you interested yes i am it 's this is a really good plan and we 've been working on it for quite a while it 's been done in-house by as well as some consulting with the community and it is really a great plan to be able to put it on exhibition it 's it covers all of the sporting for all those building organizations in town although most of the content is about the council assets and the council recreation areas but it does actually include other organizations that provide sporting facilities in the town it was well worth any organisation any sporting organization having a look and see what we are proposing to provide in the next in the future and i think it 's congratulations to the local um to the staff who 've put it together but i 'd also like to say that um this is actually a plan which will be good for us to apply for funding these plans to be able to apply for funding for all of these facilities in the future so i 'm recommended for people to actually have a look and maybe comment if they need to thank you fashion familiar it 's the whole community and particularly those involved in the sporting organizations in the town to read this discuss it among themselves and if they see anything that they might be able to add that that to that to the document that might improve it to please do so please make it known to council and yes i think that it 's also quite exciting to see the proposed improvements that can be made through sporting facilities subject by haitian to add subject to funding being available so i think that needs to be made very clear always to people who might be reading a document like this that yes those those improvements are subject to funding being available thank you for the comments yes this makes up one of the many players that the council has to enable them to [Music] enact their operational plan or overall operational plan well-being for our community and residents and this plan identifies the areas we have with respond and recreation can be carried out on and how we 're going to maintain them into the future and um it 's so it 's very necessary that we get good feedback if people aren 't happy with it or if we miss something [Music] um around the nation and we 're making revision for that and this also ties in with offering tourism and physical and visitors to town to undertake different uh sport and recreational activities so i commended to the public to to read it and have and give us feedback [Music] um but now 's the time for the public to really get on board with them and read this plan and see where we where we do want to hear where they 've come up with and um yes there has been good public consultation and some of the proposed actions that councillor walsh was referencing have actually come from various sporting bodies things such as catering better for female sporting participants catering better for those who need special recreation and those are really important and they have been acknowledged in this document i think another really good thing about it is that the proposal hopes to and i hope it will revitalize the sport and rep committee that has um is a section 355 community council but has sort of fallen by the wayside a little bit in recent years so i certainly do also hope that all the sporting bodies and all those who are involved in recreation and so on and including people like the mountain bikers and the bushwalkers a growing group will read at least relevant sections of this very carefully and as other councillors have said let us know what they think about it thank you has beautiful sporting facilities and they 're very well maintained this will actually add to that and plan for the future but we do need feedback from the community to make it um make it worthwhile thank you i 'll put the resolutional lesson over all right again i 've declared it carried me out with respect to it item six six point one director of infrastructure strategy 2041. um uh thanks man that you 're hairstyle you 're safe um yeah i know pretty rough um yes the waste waste and sustainable materials strategy is something which has been coming for some time and it 's going to be [Music] eventually enforced by state government and i say quite rightly so i think there 's about so much more that can be done particularly regarding limiting the amount of organic waste that goes to landfill on the page 235 on the ipad with the start but there the introduction lists seven targets in strategy and i am very pleased to see that listing and i also urge everyone to support that i mean it 's easy to find something that might be too hard in the longer term but certainly particularly with organic waste that 's sent to landfill i mean you 've only got to be under the merc and see what goes past there or see what goes into the trucks and it 's something that we all need to work towards i 'm also very pleased to see that the recommendation recommends a various other uh what you might call [Music] side issues particularly regarding to providing information for councils on council staff and councillors on eb various eb programs also rather than have and i i 'm pleased to see that because rather than have a consultant come in and do a consultants report we 're going to have something that 's ongoing by having a sustainability officer so i welcome this um very much and uh i do wish my fellow counselors to support him secondary yes whoever she may be i am also of the belief that this is an exciting and important strategy if if not a little scary because 2025 comes in less than three years from now and there are some important things that council will need to do before then so i 'm too i 'm really pleased that we 're going to appoint a waste and energy sustainability officer i hope we 'll be able to appoint a suitable person at the earliest possible date i know that that 's going to be not immediately because i do understand that there is some funding behind hundred billion dollars for various elements of it and and i presume that part of the sustainability officer 's duties will be to chase some of that funding i hate to say i told you so folks but you counsellors and staff who will remember that the title science committee has been banging on about organic waste recycling for some years now and it 's it 's good to see that that 's that 's going to happen um even though i know that that is a very expensive process for this council but there are probably some left of field things that we can can do for that but i think it 's it 's really important that we work well towards meeting these targets from now thank you for the coming question is the uh waste and energy sustainability officer is it a completely new employee position or can you fill it out of it 's not possible to fill it out with existing employees in that area they 're all feeling committed to doing the operational work rather than developing the new strategy thank you those seven we just send out other information [Music] epa to us or how are we going to meet those obligations can we do it ourselves or it 's just a statewide the targets in the dot points are the new south wales targets so you 're 100 right council won 't have a lot of pull in some of those uh as you quite rightly say phase out problematical and unnecessary plastics not much council can do but they 're things like reducing total waste generated by from people increasing your recovery rate and harming organic waste set to landfill etc we will have a direct impact on them just regarding the organic waste we have to issue a new container for that to be put in and pick it up separately i 've seen some parts of australia where they collect it once a week and then the general waste or recycling is cleaned here before it dies would it be the only way so um typically councils might introduce introduce that in a stage matter with the green lidded bin and when they say we 'll pick up your and fogo the photo sorry the faux part of the garden fogo is food organic so you 're to have to have a little they usually have like a little green littered caddy inside your house which you 'll put your food scraps in and that 'll go into the bigger green bin and council will have to process way they 're printed is a pretty big ask of residents in new south wales to be educated into the plastics and so forth and also when we do um collect and keep the plastic separate and so forth and other materials like that is is to find someone that can um recycle or handle them after us if we don 't end up with a an empty landfill but a fully covered area of uh plastic and safety as um council smith said it 's um [Music] [Music] 2015 net neutral or whatever it is it 's been identified the hardest thing for council to do to reduce its carbon footprint is in the landfill rubbish collection and apparently that 's about seven thousand tons a year and it doesn the next five to ten years thank you i think this is a really great initiative and i think it 's probably um we do need a specialised person to do this because i believe that we have people who are on the ground working in this industry but we do need somebody with bigger vision and somebody with the attitude to be able to search for different ways of doing things and i don 't think i think dirk 's doing a great job but i think it would be onerous on him and the rest of his staff to take this on as well and i think having a person outside another person is really going to benefit us greatly and come up with some new innovative ideas to deal with their waste there is a lot of good ideas around the waste management but it 's all you know obviously we don 't a lot of people don 't have the time to look for those and i think this person will be able to look for those ideas and those innovations and hopefully um by implementing there 'll be new ideas and there 'll be different things coming up to the fore so we i think we 're right on the money i think it 's a great initiative just do it right now and to start looking for these people because they 'll be very few on the ground these specialised people and i think it 's great to get in early and try and um actually get somebody that that will do this job for us because i 'm sure there 'll be lots of other people looking for them as well so and well done and i really support it just very quickly the recommendation is fine the report is good it 's a journey i think we need to be involved with i would be concerned that we are in quite uncertain in certain times in some of the carbon neutrality and where we 're traveling with those issues around the environment that do need to be but it 's going to be challenging i think we need to be flexible to move forward i guess an appropriate way we 're doing i think that if we go to a circular economy and become carbon neutral i think we also need to just keep our eyes on the fact that we want to avoid shifting in the daycare difficult possibly because that 's where we 're very easy to finish up we will be picking up the tab for some of these things that great ideas about the environment that is going to come back to that right part the dollars to the right past pockets i 'm sorry so we need to be careful with that one all beyond that and make it more difficult for councils but that 's the last half empty and i 'm not that sort of person but it 's once yes as i said earlier in my early remarks it 's a very easy reason why we shouldn 't be doing uh this sort of thing but um i think the the greater good is what we 've always had to look at and um yes the eventual cost has been unknown but various states are starting to move this way in particular south australia the people that i spoke to didn 't indicate that they felt any great pain about making the changes over plastics so um i just welcome this very much and that 's the way it 's what we 've got to do in the future if we want to try and leave a better country for our generations to come thank you proper revolutionising favor against declaration reports no matter

indicate in relation to any interest you need to declare in tonight 's meeting and what reporter writing you 're declaring an interest in whether the nature of the interest council so the director of

has an awning okay thank you thank you could i just mention that i 'm chairman of the tourism which has the lease of the character of the civic center area over there which there is a report in here tonight on that but i do not see that i have any conflict of interest if i may add obviously we know conflict of interest is for the individual to determine by the chair with the general manager however i think when it 's accepted that when somebody as a counsellor is representing the council on a body they 're at navigator interest in that directive um court i 'm a volunteer member of the roman era bushfire brigade also the council of rfs delegates [Music] i have no input into head office 's discretion of budgetary concerns so i don 't think i have any influence the council appoints a delegate verifier service there is no conflict or perceived in that area at all further conflicts of interest we will move on to the confirmation sorry we have no registered speakers for public forum forum so we will move on to the confirmation of the minutes of the ordering meeting held 27th of january 2021 thank you michael thank you any comments or questions on these issues the committee meeting just come up to mantra of the investments councilman investments with councillor walsh seconded council smith thank you any comments or questions on this yes the committee meeting i did raise the issue whether or not there were other means of investment for council funds we did discuss this at the information meeting and i 'm perfectly happy that i 'm not not happy but i 'm perfectly aware that there are no other avenues of investment for the monies that council has on that interest you see a minute from the civic center reference group is not here council removed that second council right thank you any comments or questions around you know this my resolution of those in favor against you to carry an item three is the three five five committee minister nature based adventure playground committee and again council of hope is not here i 'm sure the capital smith council announced thank you any comments or questions on this no comments or questions uh well one comment this wasn 't uh well they 've completed their project it was this this meeting that they uh um organisation on the national i would hope take care and i agree take care of what you 're getting here the point of lately is that the project has been completed that they started out to get to try and i think the minutes will appropriately and julie wreck recognize that and i 'm sure in this chamber we will recognize that you 're quite like what you 're saying um for the comments robbery terry i 'll put the resolution all those in favor all right against declaration number four is da132 2020 lot 11 dp 36351 in shannon street carry a recommendation for approval and condition the council of the world second council reported to council for as it does not comply with the dcp but uh the reasons given sufficiently justify that uh us passing that and it 's also on inspection too it 's in an area where that is not going to alter anything there 's also no no complaint from neighbours about it so i think i urge council to pass it further comment now for the comment therefore it 's resolutionising favors the da colleague please thank you for carrying me homelessly we 'll move on to the thank you thank you natural resource management advisory minutes that 's advisory committee i 'll put the resolution all those in favor against declarative carried i 've got another six street awnings in balcony safety policy problems recommendations to make sure you 've named it with due respect this was delve better and that 's a problem i think what happens to chairman is they both they it 's been repeated in the uh council agenda as well okay um there was a couple of questions through the chair there was a couple of questions asked at the last um of the report in the next two item agenda items so it 's just an extra bit of clarity so with the policies and the documents attached to not changing just the explanation and that 's what i understood but what i did what i don 't know what we 're doing right now with this one the motion is to adopt the motion is very clear to adopt which means when we come to the next one it 's going to be for information yesterday that 's right thank you and thanks for picking up yeah that 's good and we 'll keep that in mind with you on the next one as well goodbye in some of the villages are they covered by this as well because further comment i think the point that the council is going to make she 's a valid one to be made publicly is that there is a responsibility on owners and premises to make sure they comply it 's revising our existing policy to make sure it meets everything that 's um [Music] [Music] right reply put the resolution in favor go back to where i was deal with report later on which we will just know as we go through yes yes this is has been devised because of changes in legislation and also because we need to advise our policies at state intervals and we did discuss at the committee meeting that there would be we assume some difficulties in compliance with this plan particularly in terms of the cat section but i 'm sure that council staff will do their very best thank you for the comment yes entire looking for re-home kittens and that and they 've all been desexed before they go to these people and also reading newspapers and lands and facebook people advertising animals for sale company animals for sale showing their registration details and so forth so i think the community is adopting a lot of these things that they want to go to and but there 's one section i didn 't see there 's nothing in there about how spouses should get into the other recliner chairs and companion animals near can cause a lot of family hardship when they 're useless spouse gets out of the chair there 's no question there are no questions and especially working with americans i think an animal actually is under the act including working cheaper sorry the general manager report on the acting general major one there to be noted the german is only few days off in march and he 's derek weimer as the general manager for that period 10th of march moving out to our secretary of the council thank you we don 't probably need to have it well there 's lots i can say mr chairman okay i will take that as well as a procedure a procedural motion and we will put the resolution well in favor against declarative carry the enthusiastic point they agree with that item number two is from the general manager 's rfs contributions which is a bit of a shell shock but i 'm sure there 's a recommendation there i 'm sure there 'll be someone happy to move seconded um and um hard to believe it was only three years ago we signed an agreement with the rfs head office cbi each year and everyone knew where they 'd only be in budgeting concerns we did accept at the time that um not all the money that we paid would be used in the zone but it can spread across the state to ensure that all zones had equal firefighting capabilities when needed and now they 've come back using an increase in workers compensation although it 's not clearly identified in the in the report of what that extra is and also found out that when they have a very major bushfire event things get used a lot more than the budget says and tying the route money back in my opinion to cover some of those expenses also they 're looking for a uh roles or a service but not in the position to offer that um the way it is if it 's gonna be like that it 's gonna come out of state revenue full stock because whatever increase we pay here it says like the county the karashi council is going to be up for a very large increase but the stock council 's money our rate pending criteria which i have a lot of respect for all the increases we will get over the current rate increase will be used on paying the increase in this rfs contribution and i think they 've got to come back to the two councils and and discuss where they 're going with this because once again they 've thrown in the 680 000 rebate or 622 571 rebate from somewhere just to make everything a little bit more paddled to try and get the extra money out of us and the ratepayers pay out pay the money does pay rfs the great players pay the fire insurance levy to pay the major part of that of the upper component to this bushfiring the rate players pay tax in various forms and levies to the state government to help pay that so it 's the people of the shire are going to be hit hard and um 780 people employed and they said there 's one more employee in the field who is in the office and i think they 've got to do a bit more budget a half years ago that they told us that they didn 't have a 10 year budget they were getting all this information from their local local zones that they 've been getting for 10 years that i 'd be involved with them but it wasn 't being put into their head office budget they were just head office budget they just come up with a figure at the end of the year how much money they spent how much money they want and unfortunately if we take on the rfs we get accused of um putting firefighters lives at risk and i 've been told by head office when they 're wanting to get money out of us before uh he said we need to go and speak to the family of someone that dies i think you can throw as much money you like you 're putting out the fire but it doesn 't necessarily mean you 've got a save life things go wrong in fires and i appreciate anyone 's life to the utmost we all do a risk assessment when we go into a situation but i sincerely hope that we can write a letter of influence to the state member and the local government new south wales expressing our concern and the increases because budgeted [Music] unfortunately this has become a just too commonplace looking for you know 10 11 12 up to 78 increase sometimes over the years that i 've been on council it 's uh just happening far too often all sorts of excuses offered for it [Music] manager that a two point a two percent rate peg in 2021 21 22 and the 2122 forecast contribution increases 54.3 percent now you know i thought for a while they might have got us mixed up with sydney housing prices but anyway that is just simply ridiculous and it 's they 're using all sorts of excuses maybe it 's workers comp maybe it 's to do with the report that 's been brought down about all the training extra training that 's been to be done etc once again there was 40 million in a fund some time back that they were handed and i haven 't really taken much notice that some of that money has been distributed to the various fire brigades but i i just don 't think the new south wales fire brigade anywhere near clear in their presentation of where the money goes and what it 's used for and i strongly believe that the we should not only support the uh recommendation that 's put in front of us here about writing to various people but we should also add to that ask the the new software 's local government association to also go to work on it i don 't think they 're included in that level the suggestion of writing is drain on our money and uh it 's shy money it 's rapid money and council writer said and uh i just can 't understand how this sort of bureaucracy to just keep on building and building a building and taking whatever they want to do whatever they want further questions thomas council smith first thing i 'd like to say is that i agree with the two previous speakers that this is the last in in a long line of appalling that was an unconscionable and disproportionate burden on the ratepayers of rural and regional councils the second thing i 'd like to have on record is that this council i am absolutely positive consisting as it does of a number of volunteer fire fighters is fully supportive of adequate and sustainable funding for everything that these firefighters need to do a very difficult job at times including a comprehensive insurance that will support them and their families should things go wrong so speaking for this motion is by no means speaking against any of those people who do such a terrific job and i would i 'd just like to put castle 's attention to the third last paragraph which talks about until a longer-term funding model is introduced their funding will always be at the discretion of government of the day and that 's absolutely what 's needed a sustainable funding model that is transparent and that is as far as possible up front before councils do their budgets and that takes into account what repeating is letters from the ses and new south wales fire and rescue about comes from the office of state revenue during city council that 's that 's it thank you and i 'm mr chairman this is going to cost me a five dollar objective however i think it really should be said i agree with them year in and year out nothing has changed here it 's time that they weren 't held to account it 's time that they learned to operate within their problem budgeting marines this time they budgeted correctly and were held accountable for that you 've got to wonder what the the auditor general 's office is doing and all the rest of it as far as this is so whether they ever see a budget the real fire service would be addressing one to ask and to see whether they are held to account for that however i think the the general managers recalling this clearly shows how what the impact is year on year as far as the rate pays that this community is concerned and that is reflected right across the state so which means that we are entrusted by our our community to that we supply to our community as far as the functions of council what this does is have a huge impact on what what do we leave off what don 't_''_1825.52 we maintain what what 's safety issues are going to be sort of compromised along the way in other parts of the organisation simply because we 've got to meet a grab from money which is not there for making a body that we all support as council of smithers c that is not held to account until such time as the government of the day who remember has got reduction to introduce a proper funding model as the general manager has said which has clearly meant all the work has been done on this a property-based tax to to properly fund this organisation and then the government to hold to account to make sure that they operate within the means we 're going to have this debate year on year on year on year on year and because no one is ever held accountable for it because as i said it says it 's about emotional blackmail they they may have lost their life or so i mean i i don 't know what else we can do except kick up the stink but i think we should condemn a government that is very very sort of i suppose chiefly in some ways holds an independent review comes up with that review comes up with 78 recommendations the government adopts all of those recommendations did they consult with us about what the impact of those might be they consult with us about what the impact of of the the um our budgeting might be i would say no this extra increase again is it is are they going to find out the general revenue of the government some partial funding to these increases again i would say no so it 's pretty easy to make these decisions make these announcements to say we are making making donations to all of these different organizations to for extra uh buildings or or extra trucks or whatever it might be extra equipment when they when they don 't have to find the money themselves to pay it 's an absolute disgrace hold our government to account as far as this is concerned whatever the call that government is at the back not today at the moment it is it is a coalition government but this is not new it was it was certainly around when the labor government was in power as well so we need that change we need the governments to recognize that there 's got to be a better funding volume and then including myself i know but then they need to be properly budgeted for to operate these emergency services i 'm quite i think much left to be said to be quite frank obviously i 'll support what being said i think for me the charlie point was coming out of the conversation at the moment is if the funding model just doesn 't work this has become an annual occurrence it comes halfway through a budgetary process or curricular way to a financial year at the end of the day these sort of increases are going to mean that there 'll be services or jobs or something that we provide as a council that can _''_2028.64 something the community unneeds to understand the other point that i would make is that it has been made on rio firma the council is very supportive of the volunteers and the rural fire service out in our regional areas these decisions are being made the other side of the sanctuary that it really again it exemplifies the fact that this conversation being over quite some time the funding model just isn 't working and there needs to be an overhaul in that broadband copy tax is a logical thing to be doing people to run away from it should be revisited there should be certainty both from the volunteers perspective and from the state government perspective there needs to be certainty out of budget and long-term budget planning and new council right when you 're talking about the long-term budget there needs to be some long-term budgeting but again i repeat council is very much supporting the volunteers and the people in our region that 's what i think is something that we need to make sure we differentiate this conversation because it 's about the budget process it if you like being able to put the hand in global government pocket without any consultation and consideration of the impacts on local government and the communities we represent for the comments mr chairman i wonder if you 'll endorse me there 's two things i 'm doing to make a council of one touchdown you 've got the broader approach one of those is the workers comp to use the workers comp increase and to try and justify these huge increases to use that that cover is an absolute disgrace i mean that that 's underwritten and all the rest of it so i mean that that in and of itself is an absolute disgrace and the comment you just made about the broad race probably takes there 's been a lot of work done on in the past what 's happen what 's wrong with the current model is it is it and council right touched on this as well is that some parts of the community do pay that and they do pay it two or three times but there is a lot in the community that pay anything and that 's that 's what a broad-based property tax does it it makes that equitable across there as well so there 's this there is a much better system that could be introduced here if they were prepared to fight the bullet do it it takes a little bit of political leadership but it is a much better system and then as i say on top of that then proper budgeting proper management and all the rest of it these are going in and here but it can be working this can be done if there 's political work leadership to do i think that i read a payment of the alternate funding method for the rural fire service something like 20 years ago and the broad-based property taxes so what councilman was saying just to clarify that the broad range popping tax they 're putting work in his mouth he 's a far more extra way of catching everybody rather than the current model that 's why i use the term language if not more he 's not part of his own budget it 's just only part of this money will be public will be used in the in the local um brigade at the airport 's new shed but the major part of it is a head office bike so it doesn 't this this increase has nothing to do with what the head office spends money on this is just in the the canonical side the two dollars are gonna be reminded that in mobile fires and that 's when they spend a lot of money they 're all under a section 44 document where the state government picks up the bill so the accomplishment and other zones they 're quite they 're ready to uh commit to the section 44 if the fire is excellates because they know that they haven 't got money in their own budget to fight it and i know this because i was a chairman i the last part of this is from that get a cancer there 's 11 cancers you can get from the bushfires i wonder if the government 's done a budget thing for the people that might get it when they have six or seven days people are on the fire group it 's what i 've been told and if a volunteer is cancer and need to be looked after but they might only have to be in one fire they 've got that tower for life so it 's good and bad that it 's too hard to control and to pass those costs back on the on his own brigades it should be a separate thing through workers compensation pay the basic work of compensation for normal wear and tear on employees and so forth part of this i thought you got away from the old style budgeting where it was above the line below the line but this seems to be going back to that principle and the principle is going this this property taxes at the moment because there 's never been an audit on the insurance association and how much money they collect for the uh from the fire levy it goes into a central pot no one knows how much doesn 't order that annually because i pay as much fire levy as i did there could even be more because um unless council buildings are going to be rated everything that you put in your which they aren 't paying rates at the moment state government bodies don 't pay rates they 're not going that they know spent here locally and taking out the big expenses of 44 it 's uh section 44 since people say in the tv and we might have a bit better yeah sorry it 's um thank thank you mayor it 's um very hard to draw any conclusions of the stage just how things are going financially but i know in the report that the mix and type of number of events um you know we 're still testing the water to just see what people will support and i think it 's important to do that i also noticed um speaking to the various people who are advanced groups etc they um they uh are very pleased with the support that they 've had while they were putting on the various dance concerts and so far too the comments regarding um from preparation for the ested been well supported with the uh with the ideas that they 've put up regarding what they might need etc but i think the best way of looking at this is at the conclusion of in on page 58 on the ipads which just talks about how what 's going to happen over the next six months and also the fact that once hopefully we move away from the cover restrictions we 'll have a much better idea of how the financial model is going to work and i think we once again we we need to show some patients with it to see how that that comes up secondly we should speak i would just that i have been to a number of different events held at the civic centre and the civic centre manager and his staff i believe are working very hard to provide patrons with a good and varied experience and they should be commended for that and encouraged to keep going i agree with councillor walsh that the proof of the pudding will be further down the track but i i think that we we think it 's it 's giving a lot of different people some access to events that they didn 't have in the past um right out left field decision by council to make this change but i must say that the manager is putting 110 he 's thinking outside the square he 's trying to generate interesting things he 's very very very very program of things and i think he might learn a lot of yourself um a lot of people are asking what about the pictures on facebook some of those people don 't see it and there 's a few advertising but the feed well he had to put an extra session on last weekend for one of the pictures and i think we 've got an embryo there that might grow and i wish them all the best feedback on the on the journey um night from both the performer and the people that were there was exceptional so we can do it good luck and i think we 've got a bit of competition in town now from other events other venues who lifted their that all the competition 's good um is trying to do something on their i 'm quite happy to support the report and acknowledge the director thank you for the report the council of the right did you say we took a leap of faith we 've got some criticism from some of the traditional user groups i think that has now been by large and i know that we have a 355 committee that is actually working with the the staff in this area and i think that whilst they haven 't_''_2922.88 met as much as they should that will probably change as we as we move forward given christmas and those sorts of issues which made it bit more difficult but to me the pleasing thing is that we have a report that we 're going to read and understand where some of the financial dissections have changed as a far more significant indication of the different dissections and people who are using the civic centre but it 's reporting back to council i think i 'm pleased with and it gives us a far greater understanding of eye ie knowledge the director and the staff and i think there 's something that gives us a really good picture and makes us makes it much easier to understand where it 's at where it 's up to where it 's going and what we expect in the future and how we will not support it as we move forward third comments i 've replied i should put the resolution in favor again declaring three five five committee attendance to the youth council councilman we had our first meeting of the year with our new youth councillors and it was a really exciting and interesting meeting with lots of enthusiasm and lots of fun the enthusiasm continues for the festival youth ambassador program we have three entrants this year which is terrific and we 'll be working to support all of them and the only other thing that i would say is that next monday we have a a workshop where we will do a lot of our planning for the year that that workshop goes for whether youth council bingo was a getting to know you icebreaker activity other another youth counsellor who had three dogs or whatever it happened to them it was it was a lot of fun and that i think councils would really enjoy it before each council meeting that includes that includes the directors of course naturally so the comments yes could i just hand may [Music] she was asking about you know what we 're doing with our young people and i mentioned this and suggested to her that if condolent wants to pursue something like this she gets her mayor to talk to you about it for me as know each other [Music] to talk to shut up um certainly there 's a state organization and under normal circumstances there will be a biennial youth conference in sydney um as well as a number of other events last year of course director of infrastructure and operations 355 committee meeting being the entire towns and the landcare council as well i 'm sure council emerges except happy to second that and you can go to these councils smith you 're going to bring great attention to speak to no as ramirez as for our first meeting back for the year so we have another meeting on wednesday and hopefully there will be a quorum and we will be able to ratify these notes on the meeting but as you might also have seen because there was no forum we were unable to make a decision about whether to run an awards competition before australia today unfortunately thank you [Music] seems to like getting into things um they might be able to provide a bit of input interest in the care of entirety towns and urban landcares let 's talk about nrm you might talk to that option and what it might look like to go from there are two different organizations is not in geographical all right in fact previously there was an attempt to diaz with the nlm committee [Music] and there was also an attempt to get a move from the carrot art group and neither of those were successful long term but it 's certainly something really good resolution [Music] infrastructure operations of the saudi arab committee meeting held fourth of february 2021 to be noted i guess mr the cheap selling day the general consensus is that 's working it 's an appropriate move and the the other one was around the figures the numbers of the treatment lambs that are coming in there is still obviously a drought influence if the stock numbers are down but there is a general consensus to be anticipated that lamb and sheep numbers will continue to grow across the shire therefore the possibility of increasing numbers in years to come is considered very high more than likely that that will occur and anecdotally as you drive around there are a lot more treatment land sort of sticking your head up in various paddocks i would think that it could be two or three years but transit in the right direction and i think there should be confidence that it will return to two good numbers that will maintain the facility to the very high standard that it is and there 's still a confidence that the numbers will go closer to meeting this year 's expectation anyway council right you 're returning the comments okay um um another four or five result is we 've attracted an agent to rentful who was selling his lambs in forms under another agent and he 's taken opportunity [Music] he 's very there 's a lot of competition out there with other not just a lot of others other marketing forms options plus is incredible that we have stops going through there and and where it 's coming from there 's like certain stock coming in off that market from western australia in this area and it 's it 's incredible what team 's about and i think we do very well to hold their own and um questions happy to answer any questions a way to write a reply resolution against declared carrier number three from the director of infrastructure operations to the traffic committee thank you thank you mr chairman district lowery so could i suggest that um a couple of the items in here particularly numbers two and four what we talked about just noting the report whilst the uh the report clearly shows that there 's no further the recommendation is that no further actually full stop yes no further anybody understand what 's being suggested just clarifies it it puts it in if you feel like it puts a completion to the circle mr chairman just speaking to that thank you thank you as well it 's it 's not to make light of these that they were discussed they were probably discussed and considered at the committee are investigated obviously before we discuss them and it 's appropriate now as you quite rightly say it does put a a dot at the end of the sentences now that they 're now going to properly consider their recommendation to is that the proper process has been carried out and the quite appropriate thing with these two further actions should be taken others are pretty self-explanatory i think and i 'm happy to answer any questions of the report just before we go to that anybody that 's driven down the interfere choice street will notice that we 've relocated or in the process we 're locating the was put on hold until such time but through the christmas spirit and all the rest of the produce so that will real problem there during school times pick up and drop off particularly pick up an it 's a very dangerous intersection very busy station and a lot of people are breaking that law and it 's felt that it was considered it should be properly signed posted it was raised by um police representative on our committee but we 're is apparently what was happening was reported is that regular users of that road were being raised concerns about the queuing of traffic waiting to access the the merv prior to an opening getting there early with us and so queuing down the to cover their trucks within the premises of the murph a lot of the the trucks were actually pulling out onto the road and then putting people covering their trucks and doing all that stuff it 's about traffic movements and making it safe there so it was considered as far as the tracks were concerned that the operators of the birth would be asked to instruct me and remind the trump crimes for their responsibilities of operating within the same limits and doing all of that that would eliminate the need to call it and hopefully that will eliminate any inconvenience that 's been caused [Music] it was already done it was just the timing of the of the committees but it was probably investigated it was probably reviewed as far as the activity was concerned the activity my understanding is that the traffic committee can made when they 're required may be probably following that minor thought on that if something does come through that is contentious does require to be dealt with is out of the site the cycle of the traffic committee meetings they can come together for a special meeting to deal with that issue electronically yeah at the moment we 're actually proving something here we 're not going to do anything so it 's just it 'll work just a few little minor changes of recovery trucks on premises and better communication which is that 's what we 're talking about that 's in hand with the director and that 's that 's what will take place and it 'll be monitored and we 'll see whether this because i time this is the first time that my knowledge has been right further coming yeah just um it 's not a different time it 's terrible i would presume if we 're going to put a day ahead for material recycling simply only been like right now would probably be some talk of a um or something part of the assessment and we can 't go back and fix that but perhaps it 's going down the track without budgeting because um trucks come down and um the kenny 's lane you go to the um to the quarry and that 's coming past there too so it can be a bit of traffic and then interesting that the locals have been under the original contract council was going to keep the road tight here he didn 't think it was tidy this is outside traffic oh no it sounds good it 's good that people are taking stuff to the murder to get rid of them instead of dumping it on their own somewhere else further comments i 'll give council member right reply thank you mr chairman just think that 's one that will need to be monitored um certainly uh as far as the comment you just made about other tracks besides what is using the merv that 's that 's the understanding of the complaint was about trucks pulling out of the pulling up and covering their trucks on the road it 's causing uh some potential hazard so that there should be if that is the real reason that should be in hand as far as some communication is concerned if there is continued increasing traffic players there from other activities well that will be monitored in june so that 's true and if we need to to do something there that 'll be the subject of a further investigation and a recommendation in favor of carrying number four from the director of attracting operations the council of knives thank you speak councillors with that all mr may this this is another very comprehensive and very detailed and very well researched and reported recommendation and i think as as had been the others that we have received i think that that 's that 's all that are made in here have been already agreed to by the state government so to the director on page 90 is a map legend i don 't see a map of the waters just just wondering whether something missing there this one and there 's another possible one on page one three one uh on a map that it seems to look like there 's a box there and there 's nothing in it there should be something in there thank you for the comments of questions right reply [Music] the thank you comment [Music] very well put together and also now now enables us to go to the variable speed drive up there too which help us later in our in our what we 're trying to do regarding reducing the use of electricity for the comments after the comments roderick white point got required i 'll put resolution in favor for the director of infrastructure and operations is the carer sewer network storm stormwater infiltration there 's a recommendation there to allocate some money to put some sewer flow gauges in the recommendation to council smith thank speak um no again it seems very sensible very very well explained and i do appreciate that we are as part of the recommendation um given information about where the required funding will come from i just had one small question about the information in paragraph four of the background where it talks about these gauges can and will be removed and and taken to another part of the system which is terrific i 'm just wondering whether that is included in i presume it 's not included in the installation costs of 90 000 or whether there will be further costs or whether that was a reunion house through the chair that 's your assumption was correct it 's not only moving them down the track is not a problem included in the original allocation of the capital cost um and any maintenance of the gauges is going to be met by operational thinking that stormwater is not supposed to go into the services yes absolutely yeah so the comments required we 've done smoke testing in the past i think the report mentions a program of putting covers through there we need to have a whole infiltration strategy which includes the gauges the smoke testing information education to the public so they don 't have their stormwater connected to it really really strengthen the point this is not about trying to catch people out this is about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the capacity to put water back into the river under the epa licence that we have the managing facility required put the resolution in favor all right against deter carrier number seven directly infrastructure operations carrier street lightning strategic plan we 're upgrading to the streetlights there 's a condition there for the respective budget i 'm urban council of washington see ya thank you councilman comments or questions last night for me wish to speak at all such a question um to the director the recommendation does not mention the actual additional capital expenditure should it is that necessary or not additional capital expenses of 25 000 random for 10 years uh through the through the chair the intention of the report was to put it before the council 's option for otherwise i some of the streets where lightning might not be uh considered uh as to be as good as it should be yet i 'm very aware that parts of those streets but also down in leed street there 's a lack of writing down there and i will see why to bring this up to a standard standard we um malfunction through the chair um they 're being looked at i haven 't got a result from that yet that investigation that they 're the companies come back to have a look at those i 've seen does the recommendation clearly financial plan over the next few months right so it 's so really just is well are not valid during the second have done don 't sue the need to go that fast amendment or you vote against it or do you know according to the meeting process what everybody 's saying is that a recommendation they could perhaps say that counselors consider as a part of the review of the long-term financial plan the carers streetlighting upgrade that 's that 's that bathroom so it 's clear let [Music] do we need any further consideration is the mover happy if i put the motion okay the street warnings and development balconies policy which we 've dealt with so i think we need to note this report and i suggest we put no this report full stop dealt with previously in a meeting refers back to them any further comments i 'll put the resolution i was in favor oh yes to be clear carry item number two is much the same well actually should we be looking at we 're looking at noting the previous report and point two being picked up all you need to do is note the report but here taking on taking on board the comments council marriage made earlier you could [Music] well actually i just had a question about doctor who is there which quite rightly talks about as councilman talked about earlier speak to it promoting the new animal management plan but it talks about doing it via social media and i 'm just wondering whether that in the new world of facebook whether that is that 's true there is on that and um whether it take over the guardian or whatever if we had other print medias or something i 'm sure everyone knows about it you know it 's good get the message out there and if you have dangerous cats like if you don 't look after a cat he goes out and kills 10 birds this is not the one you walk in the clock um what i would be suggesting to you is that you talk to the mover and suggest that you just add the words and other print media yes thank you you for the comments you should speak to that you 've been around and community renewable energy and all the rest of it i 'm interested to know that there 's no video invention in this report directly about how much this extra fund is through the chair it 's um it was indicated to me that it was to the value of twenty thousand dollars thank you so i think if you read the report it 's going to uh be well and truly utilised it could be spent in wide group in our community and that 's the intent of this is to try and get a handle on the usage of all of these different areas of our community and also look at what the future they hold is trying to encourage more and more use of renewables you for the comment yes i think it 's uh very pleasing to see the progress being made here we divided fully and the i think we discussed at the information meeting to the original plan which adopted back in august of last year was the draft efficiency and renewable energy planned at that stage and uh yes it 's um very pleasing to see this happening and um um and also the community discussion that 's going to take place as well thank you for the comments that 's respectful [Applause] which is no mean commitment and this will provide some funding to go towards meeting that very limited thank you for the comments first question right to you and justin smith is that funding of renewable needed renewable energy adoption there 's an action plan at the back includes solar panels on top of infrastructure buildings which the director and 100 renewable are working through specifications of that now [Music] just it scares me when we say net zero because net zero doesn 't mean that we are at zero as it must have been the august meeting we had someone talking to us about it and um we 're told that there was a council in sydney that was already at this next zero and i said what have they done and they said i purchased a lot of shares in the forest to contain um carb which is where 's the forest see or in china it was that 's good china spending our money they could keep on emitting carbon but see they 've got the offset sometimes it 's making them zero they 're not really not zero they 're all second and i said oh well we might plant a forest out here so [Music] this is why so there 'd be too much regulation i says well how does china regulate something when they 're in an unregulated world really over there reduce our carbon footprint but net zero doesn 't mean that we 're going to reduce it 100 and we could be doing other offset type things which is a little bit of um hiding the actual truth and taking the pressure office if needed i find it difficult to be careful about hiding the truth and suggesting council will go to that path um reduce our carbon emissions by 100 percent and it worries me when we talk about nuclear renewal for full renewable energy by 2030 because i don 't think the industry is there they might not be able to do it and is that going to mean that that our invention that comes into our this is going to use any cold drive power or something to keep it liquid or something it 's just i 'm on the on the devil 's average to this but it also at that same meeting we were told we 'd already reduced our emissions by 40 from a figure in 2004 or something which and we didn 't have to do a lot to complete that to do with my biggest um concern if we do want to go to this next zero thing you don 't do anything so you don 't do anything you don 't emit carbon you don 't well i 'll be against because if you 've got a major infrastructure program comes up that demands a lot of carbon materials you 're going to blow your system out for that year so can you point the board as a chairman we we really are this is this is not relevant to the subject and the discussion we 're having here about utilizing an extra brand that was um saw and our director to further a plan that was adopted last year thank you i think that 's a valid point of order finish what you 're going to do that also indicates that unless we get grants we can 't do a lot of this work and that 's this should we should be able to do it on our own i have completed thank you thank you given the fact you 're against the nation do someone speak for the motion 'll give caption under the right request i chose not to speak against what was what was reportedly a speaker against the nation there simply because it was was nonsense or ramble about something that i think any sensible person understands we need to continue to try and limit our increases in in our carbon footprint we need to try and move towards renewables i think that that 's accepted by everybody except a few bloodlights to use another term in another area who don 't understand that to protect our planet going forward we need to do everything we possibly can within our budget constraints of course to educate look at all of the options and that 's what our plan did and that 's what this this extra twenty thousand dollars will do is trying to identify areas right across the shire with different components as the plan as as the director has just indicated there is a escape works in there about how we will try and consult with all of the different components in our community to look at other options and that 's what we they be local government or young that 's what we should do i 'll put the resolution take a motion to close the meeting with the public to consider in accordance with course report for general committee recommendations in closed council subject military water security project tenders production and

about to say is pretty well in that uh documentation but for those of you who don 't know me um i 'm judy goodman from a member of the career branch cwa and representing central western group each year our group conducts public speaking competition for children now in its 29th year for those who were absent last year is a little history last year because of kobe the competition didn 't proceed however in 2019 74 schools 270 students from years three to twelve participated in james sheen high school this year because of coded restrictions the competition will be held over four days from the 25th may in the cwa rooms in orange this program gives students the opportunity from small schools to compete against the large schools the competition is a wonderful initiative to encourage students to become proficient in public speaking writing and delivering a time speech on a subject appropriate for the age of the student thus building confidence some schools in cara have participated in this competition over the join other councils in sponsoring 200 towards advertising gifts for the winners in each category and books for their school library please note that last year funds were approved by council however not paid due to the pandemic and last year your passing words were um let 's see if we can get this in cara well straight away we launched an expression of interest to have the intergroup finals here and that is with far western group and oxley group and central western group to have the finals here because to have the central western group to have it here the schools aren 't big enough the room to have a lot of rooms for a whole morning from years three through to twelve and logistically it can 't_''_255.92 be done here so when we get to the finals not as many people but they still come from far and wide we thought well we 'll have a crack at that so we 're feeling optimistic and we take a turnabout so i think it might be central west 's turn next year he 's hoping so anyhow that [Music] slightly new format which took me a little bit of time to work out what i was doing but i 'm all good you have the first item is i pulled off my from the civic center reference group councilman walsh yep it was the meeting we had and uh and i think um thanks michael for working out the words for the cultural council plan because that 's a very important up until now we 've had a cultural plan but it 's been very small and um and it 's been quite um that we 've now got this new um going and there is a lot of detail that we need to put in our cultural would be available in the budget for the long-term financial plan so that was one of the things that was raised is that we need a comprehensive plan to go forward including the city square and the library and everything else so we need a new one as you know funding bodies take a lot of notice of those plans and we 've been lucky in the past with that so we 're hoping that we include budget but um otherwise uh straight forward we had a great book at the city centre it was um everyone was very pleased with the changes that have been made there michael couldn 't come because he was on the uh on a laptop he didn 't take him on tour but everybody else went on the tour and it was um it was really well received everyone was very pleased with the changes i know most of you have been in civic center since the upgrade and seen the terrific um especially the televisions and you know all of the multi-technical facilities that we have um there 's still a lot to be done and that was pointed out quite a few people said you know this is great but we need to do this so there still is quite a lot to do at the civic center that will bring it up to a really terrific standard but jonathan seems to do a good job and everyone was pleased with that we are having money at the end of this month because there was some under you know spend some misunderstanding and uh interpretation of those so we were quite uh that was one of the things that we 're actually going to nail down and you know get into the next meeting just to understand have more understanding and maybe jonathan will have more understanding of the community needs as well so that will be a big discussion at the next meeting but uh otherwise that was really quite good thank you thank you it was a good meeting that was held regarding the request to look at the charges etc um it will be it 's very clear to the former intending that anything that 's any suggestions coming out of that will be only recommendations that um this committee cannot change or do anything with the charges that are already set for the the civic centre center but as as we have tried to do uh over the several months that there have been some negotiations going on with the organization such as the establishment we 've made very clear that council is always approachable uh if they a couple of members of the ascendant who were present that evening that they have found the manager of the civic center very approachable and very easy to work with and the preliminary work that they are doing to get ready for the establishment which of course is now only about six weeks away the i you will note there that uh there was a resignation from belinda virgo and also a suggestion that for a recommendation that we invited tourism to replace the virgo so i said i urge council to consider that i am aware that daily would be happy to accept that position so i 'm a little confused in a week a couple of things one that we we need to develop or upgrade the cultural plan i can fully compare with the review of the country but to sort of there 's almost been for a second we haven 't done anything at all or not a lot we haven 't_''_664.16 achieved too much as far as the cultural activities that the community is concerned with i was just quickly thinking about some of the years such as the rpo such as the redevelopment of the civic center and the library and other things and we 've had presentations around an extension to the art gallery we 're also talking about a number of these conversations and our computer on the civic square itself so what are we talking about as far as um firstly a budget allocation what are we asking for there and what is the next step along this part obviously i agree with planning absolutely totally agree with the plan but i there 's also as i say there 's almost an entrance here that we 've not done too much and frankly i would take exception enough if that 's the case because there 's always there 's always things to do as far as whatever we do but we 've done a lot we should acknowledge that i 'm sure council is together i think you need to yeah i know you should need to be terrified through the chair uh what the the point of this was council has done a lot and hopefully so councilman um what our cultural activities so we do have individual plans for each of the components but we don 't have a holistic when it comes to the current structure and requirements around grant applications it could have been quite specific around what is council 's overall strategic cultural plan and that 's the component that we don 't have an updated money currently so far as the the budget i 'm not recommending an amount or anything like that just that council keeps it from mine when we come have those discussions around the long term financial fund it 's a clarify it clarifies [Music] is that nothing 's enforced by budget yet and i think you 're signed off until the coaching is actually in front of us and the delivery plan and so forth we 're there to look at as well which i think what you 're saying that 's partly outside partly mr chairman because i i think we have done something needs to acknowledge it really does well i mean it 's very easy for us as a counselor because we get immersed in the day-to-day point four in the recommendation does does so not as a part of this motion and i 'm happy to consider that one but before i agree to any funding i think there needs to be a directional strategy with some funding attached to it at least a ballpark figure attached to it so that we know what we need to at a later stage when we are looking at that question yes is it operational i 'd say no [Music] [Music] so if it counts if that cultural committee thinks it needs to be do a more long-term thing it should come from that not from the civic centre committee town and i think we 've got enough people employed and they 're enough if we have the chairman of each of the committees to be on that cultural plan i think they could put together where they want to go in the long term future so um i think this is just a behind-the-scenes way to employ another consultant it 's not going necessarily there is a plan there and you can have as many plans as you 've adopted it 's not much easier to create another one okay so we do have a cultural plan and i 've been on the cultural committee for council committee for the last 12 14 years unfortunately we unfortunately are many of the things in our cultural plan we actually have done so bruce i acknowledge that many of the things in our cultural plan which is about eight years old have been done and now is the time to review it and update it because those things have actually been done and to be honest it was a terrific plan and all of these things are in that plan all of these major things that we 're talking about doing are in that plan but they 're not in detail because we we weren 't going in the detail they were like strategic priorities such as the civic square and the library and the art gallery all of those things are in the plan but we do need the detail to be able to include all of the projects that we 're working on now the sculpture parks in that we 've done and i acknowledge that we 've done all those things but now we need to have a more detailed plan about the bigger things that the priorities that we 're actually we actually have these priorities we need to actually put in underneath the detail and why the benefits of those priorities because we 've had these priorities for 10 years it 's terrific that we 've finally got to the stage where we can actually do something about them so we do need a more comprehensive better detail plan including all of the projects that we are undertaking at the moment because um that 's the way we 're going to get funding it doesn 't happen without that big plan and that big picture we have got a plan we did it [Music] and we 've got all those priorities in the plan all the priorities we 're now doing but we do need the detail and we do need a bigger vision product plan to actually incorporate all the things that we have done and all the things we 're planning on doing 've done but there 's also you know room for expansion and future things in the type of part and we have changed it could have been uh gallery there 's lots of things we 've done and we just need to adjust all of that in the plan as far as the culture council goes it was it was a great organization that still could be part of this but it lost it didn 't have a lot of focus because we had a plan and all of those things were being done so um and they all required money to do them so the cultural council felt that we were we didn 't have a role to play at that stage we may have a role i 'm sure we 'll have a role in the um you know developing a new plan so that 's that 's the story thank you but who would have if this was passed who who has the carriage of this once that response is considered through the the development of the cultural plan is the cultural plan going to be going the the civic centre committee or is it going to be the cultural council section through i like it i would think the director might answer that but i would be suggesting that until we get to the consideration of the long-term planning part of the budget process we haven 't quite got to that point who would have been considering it as part of this right because um and and one of the things that the manager of civic center brought up and i immediately said we can 't do that in this group and this organization it has to go to to be considered by council as a long-term project i i immediately said we cannot do this in this group so that is that 's why it 's come up it has come up because we feel and i believe that you know we could as the council should make that decision and um and that 's why we 're asking you to consider putting it in the long-term financial bank it 's not we don 't i did say we didn 't want to own it so that was one of the things that answers your question i want to take some questions and answer the question okay we 'll look we 've got a lot of reply so yeah i know it 's cancelled can i just ask a very quick question this is a question i 'm sure i 'm sure that that our cultural plan was had finished in 2009 in this it needs reviewing it i think i think the point the point you might just get that clarified but yeah do you have that one yeah i 'll take it as a right reply all right you 're fine yeah i 'm fine [Music] all those in favor [Applause] and make [Music] [Music] the average interest rate for council 's investments is 5.65 i don 't think that 's quite right as a matter of fact that figure actually applies to our uh 0.73 oh [Music] the bond market 's gone into a different way with everything at the moment through the chair if you 're willing to tie your money up for ten years you can get over two percent large sums up for that time frame i 'm not saying do it but apparently it 's just not that it 's what they 're saying but then things change and some yeah it 's deeper in this this meeting here we 're just going to do what we do and hope that 's what the bond market is doing is probably indication there 's an expectation in the medium term at least the interest rates will rise certainly in some people 's thinking and certainly certainly some of the commentators saying that over the next 12 months on the page data it says at the top and i know that we have this objective that our collection debt collection policy has the objective of having a maximum of five percent of the greatest outstanding pin and financially it looks to me as though we are not really on track for that specific details at this point i can take it on notice the i do know that the the rates team haven 't flagged anything out of the ordinary at this point in time some of it 's to but we can see further information for cancer is it how difficult would it be to put on a percentage graph because the other the first one is more about dollars collected um last year but in terms of the percentage comparison how hard that would have led me to add another couple of years to it i can 't give this one historical i can look into that i 'm sure it wouldn 't be an issue because that will give us um of the percentage rates below it if you add all the market dividends we can 't get point seven six point seven three again we 're at it 0.25 [Music] directly public there 's 26.5 million invested in a lot of that 's grant money and it 's tied money but she 's also united as another 3.6 million general account and short term that call um becoming the next um we have a payment student in the foreseeable future so it 's a considerable amount of money but the general fund balance donation central west group cwa presentation and asked her to wonder the suggestion yeah thank you speaking just to say that this is a really big project and i think that we should support it and it 's really terrific that we are able to attract um the group um group finals here and uh congratulations um for young people but i think also you know what we 're doing the presentation i 'm sure the city of our ladies will be making a difference something you care from time to time thank you number four is the cara industry trial horse riders club council of smithsonian recommendation in that while the actual event is being held just outside of karash shire shire it it does involve a lot of people from karoshin and it does have a lot of benefits as as was suggested in the background to counter shine the uh request was from between 500 and a thousand dollars and he speaks exactly halfway between the two um resolution against your carrier number one from the director of infrastructure and operations i 'm sure urban length council council smith was up on that one council yesterday morning earlier received a to know what the council was doing but you know clean up australia and perhaps it 's something that you know between tiny towns and the rest of us we should keep in mind the next year i think i explained that we didn 't have a quorum at the last meeting of the tidy towns group so we weren 't able to authorize the funding of the price that we 've been donating for the last couple of years and we weren 't able to we therefore didn 't have time to do the publicity that we should have done as far as i know there was one group in the shire only that being the darlings falsely progress association that took an official part in the cleanup there may be more that i don 't know about but i do know that the youth council was keen to do it as well but they also ran out of time but certainly the committee will be looking at it at the end of this year with a view to supporting their i think you also mentioned to us sometime um number operations the nation-based national playground committee council of hogan i 'm sure i have that i do got a second somewhere on the wall that 's the last thank you i have a great pleasure these recommendations to council and i 'm very excited about uh we 're pleased with the results of the playground committee 's work over the last five years and congratulate council and the committee [Music] um i guess we 'll talk about as a council as well but opportunity just acknowledged the work of councillor fagan council staff i think council collectively the support we gave this project they 've been wonderful accolade to the committee who actually drove this from day one and worked very hard to to achieve something that we 're able to get some ground funding to support and achieve something which is now very special and very spectacular important part about our community now and part of that billiard hill peace precinct area so it 's a great accusation so we should be acknowledging those people who are part of it further comments i reply put the resolution will walk here there for a second on my left on my right somewhere in france cancel another thank you council thanks mr mayor uh these minutes uh have not been back to another meeting to be adopted yet but um i didn 't know but i 'm pretty sure you sat in on this meeting with your listeners and i think i joined in some states yes yes otherwise um it is what you read there and uh if anyone 's got any questions happy to try and answer mr chairman just a question two points through the focus groups the third one of those talks about the soul of bi project sorry the solver the solar bolt [Music] together i 'm not sure about that southern lights project but basically um the nrm committee would like council to be involved with the bulk solar buyer project which hasn 't is not is not in the operational plan or the delivery program to date council at this point doesn 't want to necessarily get involved well i don 't want to get involved because it 's another project that however there is a number of community groups that are doing the same thing um the sutherland shire there 's a group in southern shire that are doing it all on their own and they 're a community group um i 've suggested that if the owner come up with us with a plan that we can sort of look at it further down the track um i 'm not i have no idea who carol lynch is and i don 't know what her role in this is but she 's not part of the nrm and it 's part of a community organization that are undertaking that off their own back there is a number of organizations that are running community solar bob buy scenarios that have nothing to do with councils so if i think if council got involved we 're just reinventing the wheel all the time when there 's actually groups doing this on their own um and there 's a as i said there 's a sutherland shire not run by a council at all it 's a it 's a community organization that um but again it 's not associated with council i guess mr chairman i 'm just trying to understand what it actually means oh sorry is it is it purchasing the power that 's produced from seoul or is it no it 's producing the solar panels in bulk to offer a cheaper version of a solar installation with building a solar farm and selling power it 's giving people opportunity to buy a solar output generally domestic any better question i just with the water committee of the white nursing committee the stp um sort of mentioned their waste water and wastewater treatment plant for soil health what 's the issues we 've got issues there the water coming out of the stp is not clean enough or not do do you miss the chair in their thought bubbles at this point they 're thought bubbles they 're not there 's no issues they 're just looking at things to talk about in their subgroups [Music] i reply i put that resolution i was in favor against declaration from the directors of rabbi services which is the aboriginal consultation review um there 's three more points that are recognizable yeah so the question first in the discussion below the three dot points the director talks about three new sections that have been that have been put in there and my question is about that third point which says acknowledgement to country is that and and i had a look there was there was that heading in the original aboriginal policy as well but it sounds to me that should be a welcomed country and it 's from from what uh it was saying in the um in the actual policy it says a a local elder of the uh nation will be invited to provide a welcoming yeah sorry through through with your chair sorry that 's a that 's actually looks like a typo it should be welcome to country yeah it should read welcome to country with mother 's day all right that 's that 's fine i was wondering if i was missing out on some particular wording um but yes i think i think it 's great that those sections have been added and that very well so far with some limitations and it 's something that we really i just it i think it 's it 's going to be an interesting process obviously the consultation process as it generally is and we look forward to full cooperation but the with the consultation as wide as it can be of the aboriginal flag should we also recognize that it 's displayed in the capital chamber which it is and the other one was from suggesting we change it just some consideration in some not just the has also torres strait islander we are in an area where the torres strait islanders but in terms of the general general broader population we might just consider that discuss that at the council meeting too we might include that or not i 'm not sure we should or shouldn 't but i put that there for thought from my colleagues but the aboriginal flag has been proudly displayed in a council for the comments i 'll reply put the resolution those in favor aye against declaration something urgent means good _"

it with counsellor welsh second dude second council of knobs yes yeah you disappeared from the screen pink model um any comments or questions on this yes mr mayor i 'd just like to comment on page 33 um there were there were even though it was a reasonably satisfactory collection of rates last year the last financial year at the end of june there was quite a still quite a sum of about around close to two million dollars uh held over and there 's been quite a quite an amount collected and uh also it 's um good to see that that 's steadily uh coming in thank you any further comments council enables you to comment at all no all good thank you any further comments now for the comments do i reply not necessary councillor walsh probably under those circumstances i 'll put the recommendation i was in favor against declare that carried next item is from the director of corporate services again is that item two donation request for cara breakout association page 36 of the ipads the recommendation there councillors fagin you is waving at me second to please councillor smith you 're second to that thank you um councillor fagan uh this is something that we 've done in the last couple of years and i think it 's um well worth the uh the value um 1300 and 20 for the 12 months rent um the breakout association does a great job and it is difficult to maintain the enthusiasm for something such as this which happens only once a year and i think um having these valuable artifacts in you know the right spot looked after and way we can do this so i support this that we pay for their rental any further comments just secondary to speak yeah that 's fine any further comment just a question yes what will we um just um my memory isn 't the best what was going what did we talk about going into the old schedule either up on benny curry that wasn 't that didn 't happen that wasn 't basically not at this point no councillor walsh do you want to comment on that at all but not at this stage i think there 's nothing nothing formalized about that at all at this point i can if you wish but because of the covert any negotiations between scouts and the crown lands has dragged on a fair way and also there is still an incumbent there in the scout hall which the scout movement has to come to some arrangement with thank you that answer the question yeah thank you um just a comment i might make is that i note that the the 356 donation budget is getting rather skinny and we 're not to some sort of um amendment to that i 'm not suggesting council wants to have a a party but we might want to give consideration amendment of that at some stage during a quarter review um just out of thought um any for the comments write reply i don 't need it thank you i 'll put the resolution i was in favor all right against declare it carried um item number three is the draft guidelines risk management in an internal audit committee there 's a recommendation there to remove that or something different councillors councillor smith mr mayor i 'd like to move something different i know the recommendation only suggests we note it but because i have quite a number of questions about it i would like to move that we send this recommendation directly to the council meeting and in the interim um put it up for discussion at next week 's information meeting this is a big departure from previous uh practice and it 's a pretty complex issue and i do have some concerns over it and i do have some questions for to thrash out in this space so i really would like uh you know i 'm sure i 'm not the only person who uh has some some queries or concerns um so uh i think we are better taking our time to make sure that we all understand all the implications and um and uh think about any feedback or comments we 'd like to make thank you councillor smith councillor miller thank you mr mayor and uh councillor smith i congratulate you on reading my mail and i say i i intended to move something very similar to this because uh i was really concerned when i read it perhaps appalled is a better word i think there is some of this is really worrying as far as the impact it would have on staff and and on councillors and uh and the added costs and all the rest of what benefit who knows at this stage so there 's a lot of unanswered questions and i don 't think we should uh in any stage just sort of sit quietly and just note it and just send on us that will be very expensive unworkable um with very little in most cases benefit so i think that it is we don 't want we we could continue to make the the decision within the time frame if we need to but i think we need to have the discussion um about it and i certainly encourage my fellow counselors if you haven 't read this you really do need to read it it 's a real concern for the comments i couldn 't agree more councillor walsh thank you councillor peter wright yes mr chairman um in the summary of the proposed key changes on page 40 the last sentence sort of it said it could be said that these changes overlapped with the role of the external auditor and in the previous part of that thing it said that this ari committee is to oversee the the independence oversight of council governance and financial performance and i would have thought the external audit would be overseeing how our financial performance would only be a doubling up and um a very big job for a uh for nitty-gritty of what the external auditor does and um it 's probably not right to say but i wouldn 't mind seeing the qualifications of the people that 's written this of this report as to what they 've got in life to say this is how things how things should be done because um a lot of these uh eric serious breakdowns in council is um often comes from councils that have seemed to be uh highly organized uh leaders of the pack so forth and all of a sudden the dominoes start to fall and see what does happen um there was a part in it where they said the meg shouldn 't be on the committee as well that 's a little bit contentious but they 're trying to take away the role of of councillors too and um and i think that the elected councillors should be part of this and have input in it so they understand what is happening themselves not the out not the um the external nominees they 're supposed to be independent that are giving all the advice it 's um 's um it 's very dramatic change and um it 's come on as a slow thing where they push to have these re committees and we go through it all and um i think we originally had to have three independent people and currently we have we have we have two and um but i think that 's pretty good the way it is and i 've learned a lot out of it but um it 's not necessary to be at leon end all of what runs the council thank you any further thank you accounts for writing you for the comments well mr chairman can i just have a second go just for a moment and i think it 's a white touched on it and it really was about sort of um sidelining um the mayors and the councillors to some degree and that that 's that 's that 's par for the course because that 's what 's been going on in whole lots of other areas whether it be forced amalgamations and all sorts of things as well but but i think that the be interested in what the general manager might have to say about this it 's almost a side lining the power off the general manager where there 's a requirement to liaise with the chair of this committee and all the rest of it so i mean there 's a there 's a lot of concern with this thing um so but i think peter was right in picking up on the issue around councillors but more worrying for me in some respects and i come from the county the elective side as you know and i 'm passionate about that but i think as far as the professional army is concerned they 're being sidelined as well or certainly having their powers diluted because they have to they have to engage they have to be guided by in some cases and they have to um everything is almost signed off by i think that 's disgusting any any further comments um can i just clarify um so i 'm i agree with everything you said this is like having another finance committee overseeing everything that we 're doing and get any approval for anything so i i 'm you know very concerned about it but i 'm just wondering are we going to talk about it at the information meeting and come up with a um a submission to this is that what we 're going to do yeah um i i think the recommendation is fairly open on that and we 're going to be a question i was going to ask the lincoln information meeting we would need to start to formulate a a approach to a response in some form and what that might look like i 'm not going to sort of predict tonight but we do need to come up with a with a response and i must say what i 'm hearing answer your question counselor it does in some ways but i 'm not sure who 's going to write this submission if we 're going to have some input i 'm just concerned that we 'll have input into it and then um maybe we need a draft of some sort to discuss is what i 'm yeah i think i the way forward is to that we discuss at information leading and then we all get on the same page i think we are anyway um and then work out what sort of submission we 'll put forward and who we will be actually also lobbying to have some well i think everybody would agree with some sanity in into this conversation with with olg yeah that 's okay i 'm just um interested to see what other people think too um other places as well other shire councils other councils anyway we 'll we 'll move on but that 's um we do need to have a some sort of strong submission against this i agree with that yeah any further comments oh just one quick one mr mayor um i don 't think it 's just councillors that are worried about it i think the independent members are worried about it too of the amount of um not pressure but the amount of um of uh what they yeah workload but what could come back on them for decisions that this committee makes um the accountability i think to be members of these committee under these rules um any further comment i 'm just going to chuck a couple in um firstly councillor smith thank you well done and obviously council miller for supporting it and i 'm just delighted to see the response coming to from from everybody and on this particular meeting um when i first read this i think i threw the toys out of the cot i threw the sand out of the sandpit and did all those things that you can imagine because i saw some pretty draconian things in this but see that we 've all picked up on that in some form or other is is something that that our community should be should be appreciative of is the fact that the council is actually looking at this stuff and thinking about it very carefully um because i think we 've probably covered all the issues that jump out at us at it immediately um but i do think we need to have a really good look at this and the points that have been raised overall valid points this of the same mob that brought the jos and then didn 't support them and the same mob that brought fit for the future and then let it down the vine and gave a source to america motions which turned out to be such a wonderful success and i think he went back and read some of the fit for the future stuff we find some of the terminology probably not dissimilar they failed they failed to explain to me in this document at all what they 're trying to improve or improve things but they 're not really telling us what they want to improve and one of the one of the most galling things about some of this and some of the state agencies are brilliant i must say on the public record some of the state agencies are absolutely brilliant and great to deal with this leaves a lot less let us see our taste in the mouth and there 's a lot to be to be desired because i don 't think they 've identified what the issues are what they 're trying to solve and and mayor thinks it 's a bit rough on mares but also understand what 's being said about senior staff and where this might go and the cost of the cost to councils in in the long run one of the greatest risks to councils continuing to run as a good financial operation is limited limited to to gather income income is income is researched because of because the rate taking normal on the public record is advocating get rid of rate begging but it 's one of the greatest risks we have and when we identify our risk registering in council then some of the issues we deal with are based on the fact that we 've got limited finances to deal with them all at one particular point in time um so there 's a it really is a bit of a conundrum if you like in that context um like i speak for hours the other point i want to make out about mares is that i look at we i look at our colleague councilman miller who 's done a company director 's course um and shared of hornsby phillip ruddock he 's a former federal minister you look at the mayor of dubbo city council who 's a barrister by trade if there 's not sufficient knowledge within some of the local government areas i think it also reflects i think that that olg would be well advised to actually start to seriously consider upskilling councillors and mayors if there is a deficiency in some area i think that 's something that that they 've talked about for quite some time but i would advocate stronger i need to be doing um i 've had my rent that 's only a mile that 's only a minor one but um no further comments council smith do you want to write a reply thank you council miller wants to say something this point across it 's really about if we go if if we 're going to deal with this via a submission or at least a a resolution that 's detailed uh perhaps whoever 's going to write that and whether that 's going to be the director of corporate services or whether it 's going i think we perhaps in fairness with time it 's a pretty tight time frame perhaps we need to indicate whether they 've got enough now to sort of have a bit of an understanding of what the concerns are whether they can start on something i don 't know but perhaps um either michael or paul can through you yes they may they they may wish to comment but i think they may wish to comment but i think everything that council of fagan raised was that next come next monday we probably had our a little bit of a rant then probably come next monday we need to be looking at ways forward and solutions to help help those who are putting that together whether the director and the general manager enough information to actually start some brief outline that 's that 's that 's that 's up for them too that 's what 's getting up to determined if they wish to comment they may but um i would just comment and take a line i think through what you said earlier that i i think will information meeting it may well be the council 's view at the information meeting as well we don 't want to make comment on the specifics we want to throw the whole thing out so uh so i 'd rather wait until the information meeting and see if the consensus is there i think that someone someone very wise not far from me actually made a comment that olg has taken a very good negotiating point they come up with something something a little bit little bit contentious we all climb all over to try and fix it up and then we get left with the ruins and we get stuck with it i think the initial comment should have been way back at the beginning just throw it out and say come back when you 've got something sensible to talk to us about smith i 'll give you a reply thank you mr marin and thank you everyone for your thoughtful support and discussion um mr mayor i think it 's it 's perhaps not so much indicative this um the new eric proposal it 's not so and abilities as in the property of councillors and senior staff and that really concerns me as well the only other thing that i will say is to councillor miller i didn 't read your mail you 'd be pleased to know it was just mind i read thank you with that i 'll put the recommendation always in favor hi against the declarative carriage analysis thank you colleagues next item on the agenda is item number four page one six one which is youth council [Music] councilor smith i know you got your hand up but i 'm changing my pages on i 'm a man remember i 'm gonna do one thing at the time council spit you have your hand up and counselor peter wright council thank you yeah could i ask a question first about the about the actual recommendation because um one of the uh lots of minutes that 's recommended there says the ordinary meeting held on the 21st of june well i don 't think that that is not included in it it 's only the 13th of september councillor smith um sorry genes and i i just can 't_''_1366.48 i just can 't_''_1368.48 can 't find um well i guess i guess that 's i guess i would suggest that that 's probably just an oversight in terms of framing the minute so i would just held on the third of september 23rd out are you happy with that amendment council of smith council all right thank you um councillor smith to speak to them um mr mayor we had a meeting this afternoon as as you know um some of the projects that were discussed at the last meeting such as the cultural scavenger hunt were not able to be carried out because cara was in lockdown but we have had some a number of online things we are in line for two awards at the local government week awards um and that 's a ceremony that 's going to be conducted this friday evening conducted virtually but there will be a number of youth councillors in the chamber as part of that and to receive any award if if our nomination is successful the only other thing that i would we 've we 've been shut down for a while and other areas have been shut down for a lot longer we have moved the 10-year anniversary dinner that was going to be on the 4th of december to the 12th of february next year 4th_''_1477.2 of december was a pretty tricky date anyway given the um [Music] the elect council election that was going on thank you thank you councillor wright you speak at all oh just quickly mr chairman um i sat in there today and um [Music] i was just astounded by the the ability how they can work through these team meetings and uh so forth they 've got things i guess um the whole group are working with it they 've create they 've created these night um get-togethers and even linda they had a they had one night recently and linda was the host but her internet collapsed on the farm i think it was and um and stassi and another one just took over and um and run the event and it 's just it 's good to be young and bulletproof i cultural scavenger hunt they 've got organized or had organized but didn 't run they 're looking to run it next year sometime i didn 't say anything at the meeting but um perhaps it might fit into our festival um weekend uh if we 're going to do something on cara because it 's sort of a bit of a be something that a family might do in the area and i i don 't know if they if they want to be part of it or not but it sounds like something it 'd be good to highlight what 's in cara thank you thank you and i 'm sure our two festival delegates were taking that on board yeah good for the comments questions youth council for the comments or questions counselor smith to write a reply if you would like it i 'll put the resolution all those in favor against against thank you declare it carried item number one from the director of uh there 's the infrastructure operations which is in regards to the native title managers notification to the minister page 165 council millions to speak at all uh it 's it 's really a housekeeping matter we do this week annually and um thank you which is fine councillor fagan good yep oh good that 's very worthy people i think they obviously do a good job very confident people yes you 're right um any other comments or questions i reply not required i put the resolution i was in favor against declare carried uh second sorry second um report from the director of infrastructure and operations page 167 which is fixing fixing country road fixing local roads around three grand um councillor miller are you waving your hand or turning your page thank you we 're having a second to please councillor peter right thank you um do you um wish you speak councillor miller all right no mr chairman i think that that 's unfortunate we only allocated some of the some of the money and we can 't do all of the projects but it 's good we 're able to proceed with um with the this project anyway so yep thank you council all right i thought know i support what the what the what the directors put forward um troopers uh troopers road is that where the pipeline be coming up from bill o 'malley is it or no i think troopers i 'll let the director answer that one but her trip was from a dowry road through to rivers road yep that 's not coming up oh through the chair it 's not coming up thanks very much um just a question for the director is it is it possible to put these all our grants and all our roads into some form of template um some of these roads seem to be coming up but i look at teller i 'm not advocating we change this that 's fine but i look at where teleruck was there and i think we did some camp road elsewhere and um maybe different buckets of money maybe different funding rounds and some of the work may have i 'm just seeing these roads appear more than once on occasions that 's all i just wonder if we have some sort of a template so we know rose getting getting work done on if it 's not too difficult that 's not too difficult mr mayor i 'll consolidate that for you thank you thank you any for the comments or questions right reply not necessary i 'd assume put put the resolution was in favor against against declare carried item number one from the acting director of environmental services uh da 100 stroke 2021 which is the council of smith happy to move that we 'll have a second to please councillor walsh thank you councillor smith mr merits it 's great to see that uh this is actually beginning to come to fruition because there is an enormous need for um this space to be operational for the young people of of kara and basically the only reason that it 's coming to us given that it was advertised and there were no submissions to consider is that council is the land manager of uh of the crown land and so that 's just to make sure that all our eyes are dotted and uh where councillors of great probity can decide whether or not to be terrific and i hope everyone will too thank you does the second wish to speak yes look i endorse what council smith had to say and council does own the building as well as manage the land and um i uh only concerns may well have been parking but i can see that that 's well taken into account thank you any further comments just a question of about um as councillor walsh said we own the building but managed for the crowned land um did we have to sign something for this to come in or general manager you never got that one or this hacker general manager if you want to who wants to pick out that well it just looks like the application you know the person that 's going to use it and submitted it but did they need our did they need the council to sign off on it before that there would have been a consent of some sort as the owner of the building and the manager of the land take that on advice if you like happy to take it you haven 't you haven 't taken on a vice council all right that 's that 's why we could get it clarified yep all right any further comments or questions ah okay thank you write a reply [Music] while i think of it i make a comment that um the led light window at the front of that building or front of the library i 'm just wondering how much vibration or anything or any building works going on that that will withstand and just ask directly keep an eye on that please and even when the roof is being done next year that that that be careful be carefully noted too in fact acting director might not be aware of that give you a briefing on the window we 've been referred to next general manager no late reports no motions of urgency um i 'll therefore take a motion to close the meeting to the public to consider in accordance with clint sorry clause 10a of the act the following and it is 1082 d1 of the act from the director of environmental sorry director of infrastructure contract 2 2021 the reason commercial information of a confidential nature that would have disclosed prejudice the commercial position of the person who supplied it the recommendation please go to closed council okay you shaking you scratching your head or your counselor walsh counseling have you scratching it or you 're thinking you 're saying thanks mate he 's like me he 's got nothing to scratch i can do either i 'll put the recommendation i was in favor all right against declare it i 'll just hold a second _"

therefore i will suggest and request that you speak respectfully to others and use appropriate language at all times and as you know except no liability for any defamatory or offensive remarks or gestures made during the course of the meeting i would invite councils you should note the absence of the general manager i mean i 'm not quite sure i do believe that councilman [Music] item next item you see disclosures of interest by any senior member staff or council to indicate what report you declare an interest in whether interesting um i 'd like to declare an interest possibly for cunary um to item number one acting general manager alcohol free zone as i am the owner of the part owner of the any other any other any other bikini interests have been no others who will move we 'll move on to the confirmation of the minute of the meeting hill 10th of may 2021 as a recommendation there for adoption councillor smith councillor walsh thank you any comments or questions on these i 'll sign them as a true and accurate record no comments i 'll put the recommendation all those in favor all right again i 'll be clear of caring first item of business is mentioned again the alcohol freezes left i think it 's pretty straightforward mr chairman consists of what we 've done in the past issue it was just uh referred to around separate approvals from which council is involved in and that makes perfect sense to whether we actually do it that way and i do know in the report again that there is our further report coming to us i would just add regarding 0.2 that the inclusion of 0.2 does not mean that any hotel for example um can assume that they will get a license to trade on that 's a completely push for the uh this to be available to uh patrons and the licensees of various places the only question i had which of course will be answered with an application for extension of license or extending the license happens is that the police local police will be obviously informed of the proposal the other item which is not relevant to that is that uh i 'm not too sure whether the drive was included in our previous um alcohol-free zone if it wasn 't let 's just say i 'm very pleased to see it there now um it would certainly investigate that one um but i know we can discuss it as being appropriate to ensure that this time around so yeah yes um for the comments writer replied councilman oh mr chairman and obviously the issue around dialogue too is will be subject if there is applications the due process will [Music] avoid the consultations everything else would happen as far as that is concerned the other report that i did refer to was also the wondering of the the parks and i noticed there 's a services sorry i 'm still looking around this new format if she can be found what we 're seeing in front of us there is a snapshot of 11 months of the present financial council financial year and i think if you 'd asked most of us back in july of last year we would have probably had a slightly more pessimistic view of things so i i i 'm very pleased with how that looks at the moment yes we love our investments would be earning more money but the interest rates are what they are taking all things into consideration rate payment and also um investments i think um [Music] i think to some extent has been something that has come back you know one area we 've been criticized by various external bodies over a period of time who knows that last year in that may june period was flatlined i think or is that a rate billing a period of rate billing i i wouldn 't uh spread the child wouldn 't want to a particular performance that i do know extremely hard in collecting those last year slightly improved yeah i wasn 't suggesting this team that wouldn 't be very hard on other advertising classes i think sometimes people seem to think that council rates is the last one on the militia to be paid that people don 't pay if they 've got an issue with being able to pay they need to talk to council this council is very very very uh i wouldn 't say easy that council is very compliant to talk to people who have a general issue with non-payment or rates means that the rest the eight thousand paying their money are being subsidising and being penalized for those who have been unnecessarily elected if i 've had a further comment i think the the breaking the drought has substantially improved our collections uh for the year uh particularly in the uh the rural landholders we 've seen a vast improvement across that sector in the clearing of debt so that 's that 's been really good a key factor for us thank you for the comments should i reply put the resolution in favor against declaration number council the minute said i 'm sorry recommendation there that we hope the minutes councilor smith it 's the council right thank you comments yes mr mayor i 'd just like to give an update on two items from the minutes the first one is 4.3 regarding nominations for leadership positions and since the meeting emma clements has been elected chair and the co-defending chairs are ethan austin and alex shaw and they will run their first meeting next week so that 's the first thing the second one is the studyhub project update and post this meeting we have been given approval from the cuc board for our application and they have forwarded it to the state government which has has to give final approval has not in the past overturned the decision at the cdc board so we are very hopeful and that will come hopefully this month and then we will be able to move quickly on to renting premises looking for a manager and starting the fit out ready to to run by the end of this year good time for next calendar yes any other just think that just a comment around the uh the leadership position i think was fantastic that that was actually balancing all those positions it was really really good and good good young people council right second nation do you remember that at all no i couldn 't have more constructive director of corporate services which is the art gallery advisory committee minutes presentation there may be noted as usual which seems to come just mentioned also the sculpture park i think that was not only a tremendous day there it also promises quite a bit more in the future so i think the uh our visitors from the uh macquarie university were very impressed with the way our sculpture park is taking starting to take shape and certainly said so on a number of occasions yes the gallery is now in between a couple of in between exhibitions but the i was very impressed with the recent one there is that it was a local or regional art award which showcased absolutely superb skills and superb paintings from a large variety of people there was a large variety of i think the gallery deserves a uh quite a clip for the uh the way in which things have gone in the last few months so further comments began to be told about the last exhibition was a very successful slightly different because there was a virtual opening of the exhibition that the characteristic group decided to have a small function at the end to announce the people 's choice award and it was a very successful evening so the art group countability have done a really good job as well as further comment right reply put the resolution i was in favor against the cleric carried item number four from the director of corporate services which after that don 't say but the flyer actually talks about the eighth of june through the chair they 've actually moved the date so when we received the original donation request it was talking about the 8th of june they 've subsequently moved that date to the 18th i think it 's great to support mr turner uh director of corporate services which is guilty on log cabin a donation 194 mr instead of providing 50 we are providing 100 and that would be the principles before you before you performed a comment because there 's a little bit of a it was a backstory through through the chair um the it 's been brought to my attention that the interpretation of our revenue policy was interpreted incorrectly so 184 dollars actually represents 100 and the recommendation would be to let the recommendation stand in that case well i guess what what it was said it 's not actually correct saying that it 's going to cost 369.60 that 's actually double what it should cost the the full charge is 184.80 so 50 would actually equate to 92. given the sums involved it 's probably wise to leave the recommendation the way it is for a hundred percent that 's if it 's a hundred percent unless there 's something different that [Music] to remove it is well while uh having some reservations about the state of health of the finance department i think that we should be comfortable picked up in front of the table counselor second that yeah that anything more that needs to be said this is something that we do for other organizations as well yes i support that very much so because the money raised which is considerable from the usd4 is all turned back into maintenance and improvements at the hall and if anyone has the opportunity to have a look at what they 've achieved there over the last couple of years i think uh it 's well worthwhile calling him so i know that an invoice has been raised for 184.80 is a big fundraiser that uh last year didn 't happen due to kobe and so therefore the just thank you for the comment item number one from the director of infrastructure and operations which is regards to the minnesota tidy yes i 'd like to just expand on item 4.5 regarding the garbage trucks and i have talked to council about this before but i did have that i was showing around earlier some sample photographs of children 's artwork and with more professional artwork which mr mary would like to see just as a bit of a a look at go to the primary schools um and that would be all the primary schools in the show and ask them if they would like to enter the competition with some artwork on a recycling theme to and ones that were chosen would be made into advertisements that would take up a whole side of a couple of the galleries and recycling trucks including a new one and the concept is that we would um i 'm sure the director knows all about this because it emanated from his stuff we 've been very proud that i saw today but anyway um the the next step would be to go to the primary schools but also to go to the business chamber and ask for their support so that instead of a business just putting an advertisement on the side of the truck they would be supporting recycling by putting their name and their logo on one of these so really what i wanted was and in principle okay from council to continue on with the next steps there can i can i suggest that we deal with the recommendation as up with a wording for another point which indicates what you you know you know in a resolution what you respond to i think that will give us a form i think in principle looking around the room i think anybody was objecting or disagreeing with something about the public arena and gives you confidence in the wrecking ball for us to deal with it yes mr chairman just before you finalise that part i think there 's another item on the agenda that perhaps needs a little bit more work doing this issue around the national tree day and moving back to the prince precinct i 'd be interested to know where because i would have thought that that has the potential to generate quite a lot of vehicle activity and perhaps that might even need to come into traffic when you 've said it as far as safe traffic nervous and all the rest of it is concerned oh so i support what perhaps in principled that as well but there needs to be some more mr bear this is this is not actually an initiative of tiny speak further about that um simply that tiny towns and other relevant committees have been asked if they would like to be involved the just been taught the schools so are you saying that the win will be announced or a suitable design um the wording of that and and something will be drawn up and if you like i 'll bring that back to councils available [Music] uh item number two from the director of corporate services which in regards to the statute review of cemeteries and crematorium act there 's a recommendation there that we think come out quite strongly um [Music] it 's just one of those nonsensical things that somebody 's have a thought problem down there thinks that they can another huge cost here to be honest with you and it 's disgrace this right we should make we could all support we care from all of the different areas that would have this would have a detrimental effect and set their support to them and raise this [Music] slightly stronger language but um once again it 's this business of our we 've stuffed land uh you know you could have yippee with the results of that and now all of a sudden yes we should have plan to do a bit more planting of people and it 's uh it 's um uh just absolutely beyond the pile for them to be expecting people in rural new south wales to have to flip the bill for [Music] [Music] [Music] was i got in cindy and the minister of the bureaucrats would might be on the back foot because the owners of those salaries seemed not very happy with uh losing control or whatever they were going to do plus they 've taken on the political uh favor of uh certain churches too so i think we need to put our point forward and um we definitely need to make sure our plan for our cemetery up here has got um adequate land in the 10-year plan which we should have which we have i 'm thank you my comment i agree what ability said to me it would appear to be a thought bubble born out of someone in the eastern southerners of the real world with rural new south wales and it 's just mind-boggling in the thought process that goes around one thing this council has done and in fact probably 10 years ago to start to purchase land to expand expand expand our services at the rate fast expense just a question is people having trouble finding land in sydney can we offer they all bury them up here um i prove your prize yeah i 've seen your prices material prices in it 's a business um mr chairman i think that the real relevant point that turned out for that is that this has whilst it may have sort of um the reaction from some of the larger cancers in sydney uh taking some of the video there 's it 's it 's a classic example of what continues to be the case of huge questions responsibility in some of these areas and then we 'll enforce those same credits and those same actions onto all councils of nation but we don 't operate in a much better situation than here where and we do we know that investment as well we probably go back to the first half negotiations as far as extending our cemetery is concerned but certainly well before 10 years it was well before that because we had some very interesting uh i don 't know like my former deputies getting into all sorts of trouble but uh just a very a very light-hearted comment was made pulling things down it 's had some interesting debates over the years so what is a very serious subject but i think that we need to as i say come out about but also make it very clear that we do plan for our future for our communities and we 've done that with whether cemeteries or sewerage or any other factories from the director of environmental services to dea 2021 boundary road recommendations approvals and conditions councilman walsh what 's up thank you thank you mr mayor um lots of our articulated sewer must be two hectares in size so well it 's very obviously put by an excellent report here that this proposal that if this dea if passed by council um can only go and um the actual the proposal the d.a will lapse if that has not happened in five years so in actual fact i suggest it 's speculation on behalf of the behalf of the person proposing it in that maybe maybe council 's recent work on the proposal for facilities over in wisconsin [Music] the fees that are proposed wouldn 't mind asking the director actually just when those fees have to be paid the fees for uh open space recreation sporting facilities etc what when do they have to be paid because the reason i ask that is council will undergo a certain amount of expense of me in assessing this proposal for something that might never happen through mr chair um they 're under the label following conditions of concern shall be complied prior to the issue of subdivision certificate so they 're actually not payable until until the construction certificate is issued and then the subdivision certificate is issued yep okay that 's understood but as i said obviously council will have um you know expense in actually assessing the proposal today so uh not that i in favor of it thank you mr chairman and and i see no reason why we should not support it it 's been very well assessed as all of our dhr by our staff very professional staff so i think it 's very clear and unambiguous condition number 22 talks about the exact issue that councilman walsh was raising which is about the reticulated sewerage of that science and it 's very clearly that that is cannot be argued in any way and it cannot be spelled out any clearer than what it is there so if we remind or prove it under those conditions and it 's accepted by the applicant that 's fine and i 'm certainly having to support long past life mr smith thank you mr mayor i have two questions perhaps through you to the director if that 's okay the first one is regarding one of the objections and and in general i think the objections have been very well dealt with but on page 74 one of the objections is that the proposal isn 't consistent with the existing character of the area presume that 's because of a concern that there are too many houses too close together but that that hasn 't been commented on in the assessment comments so through you mr chair um it 's difficult because if it is well it 's an opinion whether it 's in character with the area there 's there 's a provision in the um lep and dcp to allow smaller lot sizes in that area with the provision of reticulated sewer so that will change the character over the area of the area entirely if everybody decides to subdivide at this point we didn 't think that a landscaping plan would assist in any way the assessment of the da because we 're mostly concerned about the lock configuration and the reticulated the provision of reticulated sewer what that means for the development a landscaping plan at this point um we didn 't think was necessary and the other question if i may and i think i know the answer to just but i thought this was raising as well boundary road is part of the location of the proposed heavy this where you 've got three entrances really close together won 't make any difference to the feasibility of that through mr chair that is not a consideration of this da at all there is a provision in the dcp that says that um i can 't remember the wording exactly but it 's discussed in the report that talks about that it 's not ideal but it 's everything 's assessed on its merits so driveways to each block be part of the block it 's going to or is there a easement over the blocks for the so there 's no easements yeah there is no easements responsible each block 's got their own driveway i don 't know actually where i am sitting on this because um it concerns me when councilman walsh said that it might happen because we haven 't put the sewer on well if we ever put the sewer on we 're going to have trouble at the airport because we 're going to put silver onto the airport for all the subdivision there at present we 've got a situation where it it out and take it to the sewer system as far as i know so uh and we 've spent a lot of money on designing plans and so forth so we 're gonna have to put sewer on over there sometime because that 's what we said we 're going to do we could also get i 'm also worried that the people that in these existing blocks that they 're as they 're setting that one of the opposition is they couldn 't get silver so they had to have septic and they put a 14 900 safety system in which was going to do the thing very good but then it looks like if we put the sewer in everyone might have to hook onto the ceiling so that 's our desktop news well we 're seeing we 're not you know hurry to get the sewer system on and we 're making the development happen and people putting these these goods septic systems in they 're not going to be asked to hook up at eight to nine thousand dollars or something to the sewer system 's actually gone to the proverbial and so i don 't know there 's no way with the if we set a president at the airport where this fella can put a collection base in there and pump it out and take it to the to the sewage system until we put the sewer in i think that there 's a certain relevance of what you 're saying to the door and the day of my life is worthy of support and the da is about a sufficient it 's not about specifically it 's not about access specifically it 's about a va the da for a subdivision has been assessed that 's what we 're dealing with so what may happen with sure down the track and council of the while comment was was an if comment as simple as that we know we 're going to be doing slower on west carol at some point we know we 're working our way through that what impact that may have today tomorrow or next week or next year on this development is a totally different matter to what which has been appropriately appropriately launched and appropriately conditioned so someone can move forward playing their business as they see fit i think that 's that 's the rest to me is a little bit not quite relevant although i understand the points you 're making they 're not i think they 're relevant to this particular ga and this assessment of it i understand that but if we approve this with that condition 22 that has been hooked up to the servo as councilwoman said it might be there within five years and the da 's lapsed have they got any um any uh way of coming back on us that we haven 't provided the sewer there they 've know our plans and forward plans say we 're going to sew it in west coast i think this developer would have no nothing in writing saying council 's committed to anything at this particular point in time like nobody else in which west carolina um you talked about those bad lacks driveways being sealed i thought i 'd read that they didn 't have to seal them that so however they do that it needs to be dust suppressor gravel granite concrete that 's a deformed road um regarding whether or not sugar will be there in five years time is uh you know something for a future council to work on and um we can only assess what 's in front of us and i think that 's that 's happened well and uh also regarding um people who have already put sewer on over there i would suggest that the price of land over there is probably and um but that 's that 's nothing to do with this video of the resolution i think david college that 's in favor okay thank you again carrie no notice there 's a motion to do with nothing of urgency um [Music] a resolution at the council meetings to congratulate those who were so successful and they 've done such a great job in their community thank you maybe the letter 's going to be written in advance and ready to sign overnight the general manager sorry the acting general manager you still know how exciting _"

non-pecuniary interest in that i am a member of the woodstock progress association one of the organizations recommended to receive a grant thank you do i have any other um there 's one stuck in behind my thing and counsellor walsh yes councillor walsh i 'll come get you councillor aubrey in a minute i 've met mrs i 'll be in yes i have two items which i declare an interest in uh non-pecuniary one is uh item two in the general manager 's report regarding the application for funding from for five thousand dollars from the cara tourism for the uh the the um uh dios report in um in closed session regarding lease of the cara visitor center and i make that uh these comments in the fact that i 'm chairman of the carical working corporation thank you uh ms albree um yeah i 'd like to disclose a non-pecuniary interest in item i don 't know the item da number 49 2021 for the lock for the imperial and i would ask the operators of technology to let the guests are in the in the waiting lobby in please and we have one there mr glendale from characterism is there and we 're also expecting sylvia white from vice president division chamber to actually join him as well i can see silvia on screen um and we just had a second silver so we can glad up as well lens in as well bill glenn 's in as well all right well firstly to both of you welcome and you have the full council listening to you or watching you in in divert in the virtual world um thank you for your time and i invite you to will thank you thank you silvia thank you may west and thank you councillors um thank you for for giving me the opportunity to to come into this meeting um and first of all i 'd like to sort of thank the kirishai council for your past support of this program that the business chamber um have run and hoping that we can partner again to offer this amazing opportunity to local people to get us shopping again once we open fully and to get the local businesses a lot of support they 've been going through a very difficult time as we all know basically this competition um is going to be run over three weeks it um there 'll be three draws on friday the 3rd of december the 10th of december and the 17th of december so we 're going to start advertising on the 15th of november and then the competition itself will commence on the 25th of november each week um they will be when people actually go and shop in the participating businesses once they spend 20 or more they 're able to do entry into the draw for each 20 that they spend at each shop um each week on the um they will be prizes drawn so we will have um there 'll be two one thousand dollar prizes eight five hundred dollar prizes and five 250 dollars um each week so that 's seven thousand two hundred and fifty dollars each week over those three weeks um which then can be spent back into the local business community um there will be a limit of five entries per um person so it then sort of gives everyone a bit of a fair chance to to go in for those those prizes the business chamber we will be supplying of course all the banners the qr codes um the cost of all the advertising and during that period we do a lot of advertising and promote the businesses that are involved in the competition so we do that like social um on the media in print so they do get a fair bit of advertising as well for for their little stake in that competition um i 've just got a couple up just to give you an idea that during the 2020 christmas period which was november and december last year the total load up on cara cash cards was 102 000 and so the total number of cards that were loaded up for christmas last year was 922 and spent in local stores during that christmas period was during that christmas giveaway period was 284 thousand dollars so there 's quite a few other regions that run a similar sort of program and last year cara actually topped came number one across those 55 communities we recorded the highest total of cards loaded cards redeemed the dollar figure loaded and redemption of cards so on top of the 284 000 spent locally during the christmas period um a further 38 000 was spent using cara cash cards so this brought the total to 322 000 so it 's um certainly worth a promotion but i think it 's worth doing um and particularly in in these sorts of times to help our our local businesses recover from what we have been going through and since the cash card program actually actually now exceeded 307 000 so i think that 's a pretty amazing amount that we have kept local in our communities so we 're looking for support from the karishi council again this year to put towards us running that promotion again and to encourage spending in carer so we thank you hoping for your support thank you silvia um thank you um you might just wait in that room in case someone wants to ask a question or either you or glenn and if if mr daley is available we might bring him in please thank you good evening thanks mayor west uh councillors um and council executive um we 're seeking a donation of five thousand dollars as prize money for our cara uh christmas lights competition uh as part of the christmas festival um it was born last year during uh cover times when we were looking to engage local community without actually going face to face it was a huge success last year um and we 're seeking to run it again this year basically the prizes will be four prizes two thousand dollars first dollars best village rural property for 1500 and then the people 's choice uh the prizes are given in carrick cash cards so it supports the local businesses as well thank you um thank you both both you glenn and sylvia does anybody have any questions of our guests being no questions forthcoming i just simply say to both you thank you um appreciate your taking the time and um you 're obviously aware we 'll be dealing with this matter shortly in full council and i have no doubt you 'll be able to get an answer out of somebody as to what the outcome is before the night 's over if you so choose um starting out it 'll be public tomorrow thank you thank you very much thank you thank you opportunity thank you pleasure all right go to the confirmation of the minutes of the meeting held 23rd of august 2021 councilman councillor smith the first hands i can see any comments or questions on these be no comments or questions i 'll put the resolution they 'll be accepted and signed as if you 're declare it carried um item number one of the business is to go to page 28 of the ipad which is the committee recommendations um and i get it item number one is the mayoral minute and i would be happy to move items one and two and leave item three for a second consideration but item one and two were part of the merrill minute um i 'm happy to move one and two someone would be happy to have second that councilor walsh thank you councillor miller thank you mr chairman uh council will and you i 'm sure you were recalled i spoke at length about uh some of the commentary in that report and i 'm just i 'd just like to give notice i 'm happy to support your recommendation but give notice that i would be moving in a matter of rising from that after this which is about the expressway route not the route but the expressway rather than duplication or um if you might consider it to be a worthy amendment i 'm happy to move an amendment alongs along those lines 'm intending to move um i 'm probably supporting what you 're going to move but i 'm just going to keep the merrell minute separate and then move this as i and with my apologies i meant to indicate that i consider the option that dot point three would become an emotion in its own right in some form i 'm sorry i should have i should have i should have made that comment yeah um so moving.1 and two if that 's the case um i don 't think i need to speak any further to that it was discussed at the committee meeting um and notwithstanding councillor miller has indicated as he did then that he were moving in an additional one condition it 'll be a stand-alone motion to follow this supplementary so i don 't think i need to speak any further to the to the mayoral minute which regard the j.o board meeting happy to answer any questions should they be there i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against declare it carried council miller go forth on item number three as to it or change back to it thank you thank you mr chairman something slightly different to what is there to clearly clarify i 'd like to move that council inform the minister for regional roads the honourable paul toole and central west new south wales joint organisation the carer council does not support the duplication of the great western highway and remo remain steadfast in our view at an expressway linking sydney to the central west is required and it 's our preferred option i 'm going to have a second because you know what i 'm happy to second that council peter wright you second the original motion in the committee i 'm happy to let you second that if you 'd like um council miller councillor right you were seconding out were you yeah yeah okay thank you councillor miller thank you mr chairman and and as you know the council knows i did speak at length at the committee meeting it really concerned me when i read those minutes of the joint organisation where the um the honourable paul tour was a guest speaker at where that make up uh the central new south wales joint organisation of councils um for a duplication of the great western highway and that that remains abhorrent to me i think i think it 's just a step back in time whilst we all welcome the the money that 's being spent the improvements have been made on the great western highway particularly up through the blue mountains and all the rest of it and we continue to support that and your resolution that we 've just adopted clearly says that what we 're after here is to express route across the mountains that connects sydney and the central west not a not a a glorified access route to the blue mountains and beyond a a proper expressway that which is what our objective has been for the last 30 years or so we shouldn 't give up on that simply because it 's hard we should make it very very clear to all of the people i 've indicated and others that that is still our preferred option that 's the one that we are steadfast in supporting councilor been a lot of work gone into the uh bells liner road and the future upgrades of it and turning into an expressway and i think um to let it go now would it would mean a lot of wasted work and energy and there 's no guarantee that the duplication of the great western highway will be any benefit to us with the high population along nearly all the ropes all that road um and we need to push for this expressway is that there 's trucks bringing stuff from newcastle back to the central west coast and so forth often get they go down through sydney and go up the um highway to get back to cara because the uh the roads across the mountain aren 't um insufficient to allow them a good access for these things for these for these trucks and um i think we just gotta push very hard to get this um bells line away uh bells liner road upgrade thank you councilman do you want to clarify that because i 'm going to speak if you like i can clarify as i the opportunity thank you mr chairman and whilst this is not my right reply i i want to make it very clear and that 's why the wording is exactly like it is about an express route across the mountains to link us it is it is if there is a better route than the current what has been discussed in the bell 's line if there 's a better route than that that can be identified and utilized that 's what we should be doing we shouldn 't be locking ourselves into that it 's really just about making sure that we get an express route across the mountains i 'm going to speak i 'm quite happy to support the recommendation and i acknowledge council miller 's um not remedy but but amending the the original recommendation to to talk about a a expressway and a proper corridor the jl hasn 't walked away from that that need and i think we all understand completely the fact that uh whatever we do on the great western highway will only ever be a glorified suburban road there have been communities east of the sea east of the mountains and on the mountains themselves but we know there is impediments to getting trucks and vehicles and holiday makers and tourists across the mountains so the bells liner road may well be the preferred one but i think to lock us into that being specifically the case that wherever they want to put a a decent corridor that 's just fast and it 's a safe swift link that resolves the issue then we should make that open to them but the bills line of course was one that a lot of work was was done on but that i think the things like tunneling it for example have improved dramatically in the last 20 or 30 years since this was this was first commenced another thing to not lose sight of is that infrastructure australia was saying that central new south wales are going to be the top seven regions in australia for gdp by 2031. that 's only 10 years away and this region will not grow unless we unless and until we have a decent corridor which can or form but a decent corridor in and out of not just into but also out of sydney the metropolitan region and the coast so i think for the this this recommendation is you strongly worded some we should be should be pushing into something that will certainly enable us to go to the joint organisation and others and say hey the need the need for that corridor that expressway that route hasn 't diminished at all and as time goes by it 's going to get greater and greater further comments better question please yep so is is bell is belt line of road it 's taken out of the promotion isn 't it belt the bill 's corridor is not in the motion the motion might get read back but instead of bill 's line of corridor it 's now an expressway or a corridor yeah well that 's i 'm not against what council miller was saying and i wasn 't saying just to duplicate what 's there but i thought that 's what but it 's it 's it 's i presume that is the road 's what i was thinking yeah yeah i think i think that the councilwoman 's recommendation with your second is not necessarily site-specific although we know one has been identified previously for many many years council of councillor walsh you muted councilor walsh sorry got a button can 't_``_1309.039 hear your councilor walsh got it now um yeah i thoroughly agree with your comments and counselor miller 's comments regarding the necessity of having an expressway and i think another point that could easily be raised too is the effect on the traffic coming over the mountains through a bushfires and b uh these slippages on the bell line of road in particular and your your comments uh mayor west about uh tunneling i think leads us to uh probably look at uh or push for uh quite a bit of that crossing becoming a tunnel so that uh it can actually uh avoid some of the shutdowns that would be in the years to come would be absolutely critical the road was closed or a hot any highway across the mountains was closed for a couple of weeks thank mr chairman i 'm pleased we 've had this discussion again today because this as we as you indicated earlier it 's going to be recorded it will be will be public um these comments i think it 's very very important that we continue to push the critical point about this we do need we will what we want now we need now an express route across the mountains to link the eastern seaboard with with central west new south wales to allow us to grow to our true potential it needs to be fast and needs to be safe and therefore that whether what whatever that route may be and whether it 's tunnels or not that 's for us other smarter people and than me to decide but it 's really about the principle of having a decent safe fast route across the mountains i 'll put the resolution all those in favor against declare carried item number two is the local government new south wales board elections and 2021 annual conference there 's a recommendation there so i want to move that please or something different sorry mission council of again council of miller uh there 's no comments on this or is there no no comments i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against declare it carried colleagues we 're we 're virtually a little bit and sometimes there is a a lapse between me talking and you 're getting the message so if it 's going too quickly please just let me know so i can we can slow it down if you wish to um item excuse me item number three director of corporate services investment and financial position the

questions no comments or questions i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against i 'll declare it carried um item number seven comes after six three eight 49 stroke 2021 being the rower the imperial hotel sorry in kendall street um is the recommendation there for approval conditions the council of smith second council of miller um councillor smith mr mayor this um is a uh sensible i think um application and it has been well assessed it 's not to do with the pub per se but uh the to increase the amenity of the living quarters above the pub and really um the major reason it 's come to us is that the pub is heritage uh listed authority um but i think it 's it 's a good application thank you everybody for the comment chairman as the second i agree with those comments i think this it 's been very very well assessed as these days generally are and i think it just as councillor smith has just said it just improves the amenity of the the residents above the apartment and makes makes perfect sense and as i said i suppose a bit jokingly but it would make a very nice place to sit on a nice winter 's afternoon with the sun streaming in probably with a nice glass of red any further comments there 's an opening there colleagues write a reply councillor smith no thank you i 'll put the resolution all those in favor colleagues please declare it carried unanimously next item is item number eight da71 straight 2021 this is the one i 've declared an interest in so i 'll take the hedge fans off and leave the room and councillor smith here might do the up do the honors please okay the mayor has left the room application thank you and seconded councillor walsh councillor miller would you like to speak uh thank you thank you madam chair i okay this has been very well assessed and there were i we did have a speaker in open forum at the committee meeting um who addressed it and in principle certainly didn 't have a problem had a concern about a couple of different items as we discussed at the committee meeting were confident that they as part of the assessment process those issues had been dealt with and that there is no reason at all why we should not approve this da thank you just a second i wish to speak nothing further to add to that further discussion questions there being no further discussion uh right of reply not necessary i would imagine i will put the motion those in favor against i declare it carried and wait for me to return to the room apologies um so we are now at item number and i should have moved forward for i left the chair i 've number nine which is the draft net zero emissions pilot the recommendations to move that please councillor smith councillor peter wright thank you um councilman this week mr mayor we we did have a good discussion about this um at the committee meeting and we have discussed it several times with uh the people whom we employed to do this or or whom we were who did this i think that it 's an excellent roadmap if i can use that hackneyed expression and all that i would like to see is a little more detail which i 'm sure will come out for us in the next little while hopefully about exactly what we 're going to be doing and when we 're going to be doing it thank you second of which to speak um yes yes mr mayor um very topical conversation at the moment across all medias and from both government and business i understand the need for this carbon reduction and everything and how we and how we have to make changes in our business or be able to measure what we 're doing properly with our business as a farmer we 've been trying in our soils from very different ways and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn 't the um and also putting this on the agenda out on the open it gives everyone a chance to have a look at it for council to meet their requirements under the um under the carbon reduction discussion is that our ratepayers will have to do some things too to help us with recycling and so forth and um because that 's going to be our biggest back our biggest bug bear from the people that we 've spoken to is the is what goes into landfill and what emissions come from that um i stated at the general committee meeting that i uh have concerns with the uh with the net zero part of it which if you 're still going to produce carbon you 'll have to buy carbon credits i wasn 't_''_2047.2 against the sequentiation of carbon i am against what what i am against is that we buy these carbon credits but don 't really know what the holder of who issues them what they 're actually doing or are going we 're going to have to uh just look at what we can can do in that if we do have to buy carbon credits thank you any further comments now for the comments write a reply just briefly mr mayor i agree with what um councillor wright said in terms of it it 's a very uh if i can use the word hot topic at the moment and rightly so and council needs to play its part in the entire australian community aiming to reach that net zero by or before 2050 and and council has the mechanism to do that um or or the map of the way to do that with this report and of course it is it behooves us to as leaders in the community to show the way and to assist the community to meet those targets as well and there is certainly a community section that is very important in this as councillor miller uh councillor rightly thank you thank you i 'll put the resolution all those in favor kent against declare carried item number 10 da124 stroke 2020 um being with conditions councillor walsh second to council of miller thank you councillor walsh thank you mr mayor this was reported to council i am honored yep yeah well i was reported to council because um uh are you the front setback but also the um the um the um size of the the two uh two blocks there would be uh less than uh what is uh suggested in our dcp i use the word suggested advisedly because uh the council does have the ability to where a a sound case is put forward for a change any change to the dcp council does have the ability to do that and the this is a very awkward uh block in particular because the building on it at the moment is diagonally across what is a rectangular block and i can well see that the proposed changes to it with the uh demolition of a present car port and the uh actual uh changes uh or or addition of two carports one each side of the of the units is going to certainly make it a much more viable proposition for is a going to cause any problems at all to neighbors and uh the one that weren 't any uh or there weren 't any objections listed to this happening either i thought after all these years councilman miller would have read my lips and read my mind you 're on mewtwo do you think that you 're thinking that or not any further any further comments counselor peter wright thank you mr mayor um i 've always got concerns when we were offered to vary the dcp on lot sizes we have a guide there for for a set reason and i think in this this case with the building being built on an on a um the original building being built on a um angle or a diagonally across the block it makes it very difficult to um the amenity to put this section the second one on and uh looking at the buildings they 're not very big units so any bit of any bit of land outside was probably quite beneficial to the existing to the tenants of the existing buildings so in that case i on youtube thank you council all right um i see that the director has her hand raised do you recognize that comment yes sorry um through the chair um can i just clarify it 's not a variation to lot size it 's a ver which is articulated in the lep it is a it is a very variation to sight area which is only contained in the dcp yep thank you thank you mr chairman any further comment or do you want to go now councilman any further comment yeah you 're fine yeah thank you yours councilman yeah thank you thank you mr jimmy i 'm aware of councillor miller so thank you um just checking i just i just want to make the point that uh council right was correct in that the guidelines only and this is this is a sensible use of this block here and neither he nor i or any of us in this room are experts on amenity it 's it 's it 's beauties in the higher the behalf not um and as designed for houses and all the rest of it does meet the requirements other than these two small changes to the dcp and i see no reason why we should not support it it 's a good good use of the land that 's and it 's complements what is there and um we do need um all sorts of different types of dwellings within the shire and also different sizes i know this is not a change in lot size but it doesn 't change in land use size and therefore we do need that this is is a very good way of showing that we can adjust some of our existing properties to meet the current needs of our community and the future community for the comments i 'm just going to i support this in committee i 'm going to support it very quickly again and notwithstanding the comments made by council right this is something we can vary we we can work this way and to me having looked at this site it makes makes good sense uh i 'm not the expert but it makes good sense visually from what one can see is a fairly significant demand for a variety of lot sizes a different variety of dwellings and more importantly there is a significant housing shortage and residential shortage and commercial shortage as well so i think all those things combined it makes a sensible adjustment further comments wrong reply thank you mr mayor yes i agree with those comments that you 've just made but and also the fact that um this this block is a was or what what we 've been asked to do is is to try and make the best of a situation which already exists and uh i think uh the suggestions that have been put forward regarding it are certainly uh will greatly improve the the uh the standard of for the people who reside there uh there 's a certainly adequate backyard there okay i look around we 'll tell you that that the the the space around the blocks there or the what will be two blocks is uh certainly quite adequate for what what 's required these days from you mr chairman i 'm trying to not be to have the bumps um it doesn 't come through everybody 's ears so i 'll i 'll just leave it on but i guess too noisy let me know i will put the resolution always in favor council of fagin i can 't see your hand drink on my screen can you just call out yeah i 'm sorry i seem to have lost my camera um yes i agree thank you um and those against councillor peter wright thank you we 'll record that um we will move on then to item number 11. um and councillor fagan if i can 't see you and you want to add something just whistle or do something please um item number 11 civic square master plan council miller 's got his hand covering the screen does that mean he wants to move it dude yes councillor smith is seconding that council of miller thank you mr chairman and this i think is an exciting uh plan and it 's really terrific that it will hopefully get the support i think it will tonight to have to go on uh public exhibition and uh sure that the director and starting our staff and the council would welcome a lot of interest to be shown by our community in this draft of the civic center redevelopment and as we know there 's been a lot of discussion about it over the over many years there 's been a number of different iterations of it this i think is is an exciting uh step forward um it clearly shows that the multiple number of uses that the the civic square could be used for and probably utilized for without closing it off to some traffic movements as well and and so as i say i do welcome the community having a a good close look at it and to engage in the process by making submissions etc i think that the point also needs to be made that whilst this is a a draft plan and it shows some really lovely diagrams and some of the uses for the proposed redevelopment it does not um look at some of the major issues that still need to be addressed it clearly says that they do need to major problem to that part of the particularly the art gallery and the library etc that is needs to be sorted out that 's mentioned in it but all of those engineering details and that would need to be properly developed going forward but we do need um support of our of our community and we do need to know what their views are as far as this development is concerned my personal view is as you know that this is underutilized this is an underutilized part of our civic activities and can be so better much better utilized for many many different activities going forward if we 've if we adopt certainly the concept and then we do the work around um all of the different parts of the the planning and also the funding and particularly as i said in part planning is of course the drainage which is a major part of this and of course parking etc there 's just a whole lot of work still needs to be done this is the start but i encourage again all of our community i 'm getting a encourage our community in the first instance to have a good close look at this over the next um 42 days and get back to us to give us an idea what they 're thinking might be this might be a wonderful distraction from what we 're all going through and people may be able to sort of get a copy of these sit down talk it over talk it over with their neighbours talk it up with their friends and say yes i can i can see what 's being the objectives here and we support this for these reasons or we think it can be improved along these lines so please community get involved thank you councillor miller um councillor smith you second of that i know it 's councillor fagan has a hand up but i can 't see her counselor thank you if you 've got can you hear us or not yep like in here okay okay that 's that 's fine i can see your hand i 'll go to councillor smith and i 'll come to you thanks mr mayor um as as to say i might just add two things as i think i did in the committee meeting and the first one is to thank all those members of the community who have already spent quite a bit of time uh working on these plans and giving some really interesting and relevant input and who have informed what we have already and thank you very much to the director and her staff who have put this all together it is an exciting project the only um qualification that i would make is that none of this as council miller said has been nutted out in terms of engineering and so on and therefore we don 't have any costings but we also don 't have the finances at the moment so that we will when we have had all our feedback and incorporated that we will be looking for grant funding after we do our costumes look i 'm sorry i seem to have lost my camera and um after this i will go in again some other way um just to say i really appreciate all the work that 's 't been finalized but it will be something that we can really um look forward to having um and everybody can comment on it it 's great to have such a comprehensive plan to put to um to our community and i 'm really hoping that they 'll be coming back to us with some more suggestions and some ticks of approval because i think it 's a great plan i congratulate staff for doing it and i look forward to putting this to the government and and finding some funding for this great project which we 've been looking forward to for so many years so thank you thank you council of fagini for the comments on this matter councillor walsh just a suggestion the um the groups of people who sat in on the various work party or workshops that we had wondering if they could all be just get a courtesy email to say that the the the plan is now now on public exhibition because we do seem to have lost our ability to connect with our public uh somewhat i 'd hate those people to that it 's ready to go to uh come back to council in uh 40 odd days i think council miller mentioned yeah thank you councillor walsh i 'm sure the general manager will make a note of that the director 's got a hand up um but i 'm not sure that we 've lost our ability ability to communicate as a matter of record i think we 've still got that ability quite firmly in our in our mindset um can 't_''_3037.44 uh say miss i 'm through the chair can i just um just mention that we are actually posting out a copy to all the people that were in the workshops good thank you you 're ahead of it as usual council oh sorry councillor wright thank you mr mayor um a couple of quick comments um this will improve the access to the civic center and that was highlighted once that there 's not enough flat area in front of the front doors and um we 're looking to improve the access to all people to the um to the buildings um as far as media from one of the organizations at the weekend uh discussing the uh proposed um plan that we are discussing now so uh i think uh they must be looking at our agendas or whatever to see what is what is going on but i do support council walsh 's comments there to uh to get them to engage and just a question has anyone been losing uh volume while people are speaking or is it just my computer not being powerful enough i would have to rely on the techno people to comment on that but it may well be that it 's the distance that you are having to travel at the farm sometimes um but it also can be interference and so forth coming and other others who aren 't speaking having their microphones on at the time thanks just me and i did turn the camera off and it did come back on soon [Laughter] we 'll leave that one you 're right don 't don 't don 't don 't anybody think that 's a job as just a counselor right and i did discuss this far from the from the from the council from the town um where did we get to write a reply must be share the comments i 'd reply um mr mr chairman other than to just again reiterate what i said about hopefully the community will really engage as far as this is concerned and and be as excited about it and certainly i am and i know a number of our uh certainly our staff and also other fellow councillors so um get involved and give us some really constructive feedback on it thank you thank you council miller i 'll put the recommendations in favor and i 'd like to think from what 's being said i think we call that unanimous council nope you think you put your hand up in you yes yep thank you we 'll move on to item number one of the general manager 's report to this meeting which is the carry community grants and page whatever it is on your ipad 's colleague 70 44 44 thank you um there 's a recommendation there with a list of organizations that from from council to somewhere to move that or something different please mr chairman i i 'll move it i said there 's there were a few sort of expressions of interest and that i think those numbers are pretty limited us that who might be able to move at the moment so i 'm happy to move it appreciate it council lamellar councillor walsh happy the second thank you um i 've got one question that councilman if i can somewhat answer it before i ask you to speak and that is it might clarify i 'm not going to ask you but the question is an organization here called the nuts and bolts i 'm just wondering if this is one of the if count if the general manager or council or smith can provide a bit of background on on that i 'll defer to councillor smith if she 'd like to speak yes happy to answer that miss mr mayor um and we do forget sometimes uh that you 're not privy to all the discussions that we have had during the assessment process um carry remember as the gulagong mixed nuts the the woman who organized the gulagong mixed nuts has in fact moved to kara and this is the the new iteration of that it 's an organization which aims to help uh women in the community who may be suffering from loneliness isolation mental health issues and so on it worked i understand well in the gulagong community and i think they they have a number even well before the pandemic when things were were not so good they were having a dozen or so women um in there regularly and uh hence the need to purchase some extra furniture thank you and it 's not as specific but thank you that explanation i 'm sure the general manager couldn 't have done any better councillor miller thank you mr chairman and and i not a lot to say i think all of these recommendations and all these groups are all worthy of support as far as this is concerned um can i just add my thanks to the committee for uh their deliberations as far as this is concerned as as usual they have it again as far as their recommendations this time so i 'm happy to recommend to my fellow councils that we adopt the recommendations as put to us thank you and for the comments councilor welcome yes thanks mr mayor yes i i 'm very supportive of the community grants because it makes an enormous difference for a lot of more voluntary groups than our shire but um just one little thing uh perhaps councillor smith might be able to answer is um i know the woodstock progress association are wanting assistance to or use the money to assist with the print of a woodstock tourist brochure um i would be hoping that they if they haven 't already that they might uh discuss this with counter tourisms because counter tourism isn 't just for cowards for the whole shire thank you thank you for the comments councillor smith um mr meer uh just as as a partial answer to um councillor walsh 's comments i believe that this has been discussed with tourism and i have certainly encouraged the progress association to become members of council um move back to the remover for right of reply and it refers to the fact that this year we had 16 applications this half year we had 16 applications for a total funding of um shy of 19 000 which is well short of the 25 000 so that we have available for the six month period i think that the reason for that is is obvious to everyone lots of community groups haven 't been able to get together because of what 's going on um and so we look forward to the the uh future in the future having far more applications i would also like to mention that at its last meeting the committee discuss a replacement for the um environmental section environmental category which really wasn 't being used and which has been taken up by the small environmental grants admin administered by the nrm committee um and we 're looking at um some support for events in the community we are working on how that would look and um what the parameters would be but we are hoping that by next february when the next all the safeguards that we need and we 're hoping that that will really fill a nation and need in the community particularly as cara opens up after christmas and after the pandemic further comments no further comments write a reply uh mr tim and i think all worthy causes as we 've heard and we just should support it every little bit helps these small community groups thank you i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against it carried uh item number two from the general manager um which is in regards to the the support that was being sought from the business chamber and characterism as per the um chat in the open forum um somewhere to move here i 'll turn off and move out of the chair for the while this is discussed if you so wish um somewhere to move the recommendations please councillor smith councillor miller thank you councillor smith mr mayor we we did something very similar last year it was as we have heard from ms white and from mr daley it was very effective and i think it 's that have been doing it tough really over the past couple of years because of covert closures and before that because of the drought that we went through i think it 's uh it 's a lot of fun for the community particularly the christmas lights competition which was really well supported last year and i 'm sure will be even more so this year so i thank um sylvia and glenn coming in and talking to us and that this is a great way to help revitalize our community councilor miller uh mr chairman nothing to add to that i think as we heard with the presentations at open forum was very successful last year i think and i agree with the comments made by councillor smith in that it 's probably more necessary this year than it was and it was necessary last year but i think the certainly the business houses need a new date left but certainly our whole community i think dudes are left in these uncertain times and if we can do that it 's a small price to pay for the comments i the recommendation as well and support the comments that have been made by both councillor smith and councillor miller uh this is an ideal way for karoshi council to be able to supporting our local community and our local business community but our local community in general is it is certainly difficult times and to be able to do this is something that that is i think we ought to be doing and and need to be doing and to be using the business chamber and established organisation with runs on the board is is an appropriate way to be to be handling public monitoring money and supporting them and we 've been very good supporters of the chamber and they 've been very good supporters in terms of the community and i fully applaud what they 've been doing and encourage them to continue to grow and also the likewise of characterism that are a very highly regarded organisation that have tremendous runs on the board and again encourage them to continue to work with them and i 'm sure we will continue to work with tourism as well speaking not not enjoyable times by any stretch of imagination and when we come through this and we will come through it we 're going to need to give as much support to each other as we possibly can to get this community back on track as quickly as we can as much as we possibly can there 's going to be council leading in some areas but council also encouraging the community to lead as well another business chamber in characterism do just that further comments write reply and write a reply i 'll put the resolution all those in favor against the declared carried counselor fagin a year still getting audio or not yep i am okay good thank you i vote for that yep no you 're not i just i think if you if you i can see the screen i know where you 're on my screen if you press the you unmute i can see you go off being muted this might be a signal yep no i 'm just trying to get on yep no you 're right yep um i 'll let item number one page 72 of the director of corporate services which is release of closed decisions at close decisions um tour it 's housekeeping and therefore for um moving and seconding i think in dealing with it i want to move that council of miller age 72 i think yeah yeah thanks mike council neighbors you 're happy to check in that council of nobes yes thank you council members housekeeping you need to um no need to speak mr chairman thank you i 'll put the resolution those in favor all right against declare carried we 'll go to page 74 which is much the same in terms of housekeeping where the noting and the tabling of the interest returns for councils and relevant staff which the director michael jones is holding up for us which has been tabled um councillor walsh has got his hand up i assume to move drive a second to please council lamela thank you housekeeping but if someone 's got any questions we 'll move on no questions i 'll put the resolution on those in favor against declare carrot item number page 75 which is a recommendation for a or recommend yes i recommendation for a donation to support the care and district senior sits um recommendation there councillor smith is moving out mr um sorry don 't we have a recommendation before that the pecuniary interest returns or we do we already sorry sorry i was thinking about what i wanted to say next um i 'm happy to support this uh happy to move this direction i 'll get a second all right okay thank you so second to please i 'm looking at all my screen counselor right thank you thank you um councillor smith here to speak we 're going to save us the next one [Laughter] just briefly mr mayor this is this is something that we have done before and we know that the senior six club doesn 't have a lot of spare money so i think it 's a worthwhile thing to do i just wonder if i could ask um the director through you um to comment on the the letter from the treasurer of the club which uh suggested that these the chair um it 's a requirement of our donations policy that uh each year that uh each of the community groups do submit a request yep yep thank you that 's that 's what i thought and i hope that the um treasurer will be so informed i 'm sure i 'm sure um please counselor we own the building but we must have a peppercorn rent to the senior citizens people to um for them to get these these rate notices that 's i think that 's what the treasurer is asking it 's it 's addressed to the kerashi council but it goes to the senior citizens and probably just want clarification of why that happens because it is our building isn 't it director do you want to try and answer that general manager might help you through through the chair i 'd defer to the general manager i 'm not aware of the ownership of the building well we can take it on advice fellow manager mr chairman council owns the building uh i 'm i can 't recall what the i 'm sure there tenancy of the building we 've been some years since i 've looked at that to be honest yeah oh it 's been taken on advice do you speak for the recommendation council alright yes mr chairman um i 'm sorry to muddy the waters of that question but um just seeking clarification um now this is a very good thing it 's um it 's used regularly and um but they probably don 't use a lot of water in the or the sewer and but it 's a standing charge and so forth and um um it 's a service to the kit to the seniors of the carisha thank you for the comments write a reply put the resolution on those in favor against declare carried item number four from the director who 's a donation request from medical association associates vaccination clinic councilor walsh council of miller council of mello you had your hand up did you yeah yeah i 'm sometimes the hands don 't appear but well they do appear i couldn 't see the council no he moved i couldn 't see if um councillor walsh thank you mr mayor um yes um i noted in the report that the general manager had had discussions with the medical people from the medical center and they were very pleased with the suggestion of the 250 dollars a day charge and uh it also uh gives clear indication to of council support in this um so um i think the um was the recommendation there um but charging a flat fee of 250 dollars a day as i understand from the report i think uh we can accept that thank you the second wish to speak yes mr chairman i just just briefly this is about transparency i think and and being being consistent as well i think that we all acknowledge that the terrific effort that karen medical associates have put into uh trying to get the community as backstab the numbers as highly as they can as far as the vaccination is concerned but we are also aware that there is another clinic in town and also many others as far as now that the pharmacies etc are able to give the vaccines we acknowledge the terrific effort and it really is a very small amount of money that we 're asking for here but it will come some way towards defraying the cost of just those day-to-day running expenses which is appropriate in my view whilst not impinging on the the medical associates and their out-of-pocket expenses as well too much because i think it 's clearly understood that um this has been a sterling effort by them and there 's been a uh they 're not being uh recompensed my understanding any of the people that are spent dispensing these vaccinations to recoup all of the costs associated with it so this is this is just a a transparent way of saying that we appreciate what is going on here but we also understand that there are many other organizations that i 've just mentioned and there 'll be others as well that are doing this but they 're doing it on their own in their own premises this is trying to get the numbers up but utilize a for convenience sake to get get those numbers up as quickly as i urge everybody to support it council smith thank you um i 'd just like to add to what councillor miller said because i did have some some questions about this and what the actual costs were for the medical center and i think the general manager for giving me a reply they do have some out-of-pocket expenses they 're not funded they are funded by the government for giving the vaccinations but they 're not funded for having to rent an extra set of premises they do that because that 's the most covered safe way for them to do it they they want to take as little risk as possible uh given the numbers that have been coming through for vaccinations of um someone with a positive diagnosis coming through and then the whole medical center having to be shut down for example so they 're not paid for uh rent they 're not paid for hiring of extra personnel and and overtime and that sort of thing so i think it 's it 's very appropriate that we express our um our gratitude to them and not of the health services in kara i think we as kara citizens can be rightly proud of what our health service has done having gone over and and above and rightly proud of what our community has done in terms of a level of vaccination which is right up there with the best and exceeding many um so i think it 's a very worthy cause further comments i 'm i 'm obviously going to support this i was part of the conversations initially um i supported it then i still support it i think it 's important that and there is transparency as council miller has indicated and there are others out there in in the in the the the shire that are doing their bit commercially as well and we need also to recognize that the the the health community and the carer hospital the western area health pauline ralston paul cooper and their teams inspector adam beard and the police and all those involved and other community organizations are doing a tremendous tremendous job in trying to work with our community and get vaccinations rates up and the key to this whole situation is get vaccinated please get vaccinated and we 've been saying that from from day one so if a council will be able to take the lead in some form or other and provide support for our community is something that i think we ought ought to be doing and that that applies also to the fact that that this recommendation does indicate that there is a a cover 19 expenditure line the council has played a significant role to date in in some of the issues behind the scenes around covert 19 there have been some real costs council is not complaining one little bit but i think we do need to keep a track of them as we go forward where that may take i don 't know but council 's doing it openly and willingly to support our community which is which is incredibly incredibly important but i go back to the whole whole scenario that there 's a lot of people out there doing a lot of great work we need to support them we need to work with them in isolation specifically there is there is uh the the surveillance testing has proved to be incredibly incredibly um successful and and been popular in our to be congratulated with that and i know if you have a few of my colleagues like myself have actually been there and had our had our tonsils tickled out there i say it not meaning to be flippant and actually as we were speaking i 've had two and as we were speaking i got my my second negative result from last week back tonight so um but i would urge the community around those sorts of things to please a be safe but but be patient because there 's a lot happening and people are working really really hard to protect and support our community so we can all we all have the opportunity i think to work together and by doing things such as again i 'm i 'm repeating it getting vaccinated getting tested staying safe wear a mask do all the things that the public health water is doing support our neighbors our friends our families and i think to time is that and i know i can do this on behalf of of all of us that are in the entire community particularly all of us who are in this this virtual meeting is to those who are unwell uh we wish you a speedy recovery we 're thinking of you during our prayers so we do wish you a speedy and safe recovery um it is difficult and we just simply say good luck and we are really thinking of you at this i think difficult time for all of us but particularly more difficult time for those who who have been unfortunate and unfortunate is the right word to use to to contracted government any further comments write a reply sorry counselor right there i 'll give you again councillor yeah just a quick comment um i think what this highlights is that they 've used our civic center and we 've got a set of charges to operate as a as a as a normal business entity and but we 're here we are agreeing to to only charge a flat rate but and it others but as you said there 's been a lot of council staff you you get used in the other in the i 've seen them over at the testing regime at the at the showground uh we use staff for for the family days uh for the the night markets and so forth and um and that all gets charged out but it 's it doesn 't come back to council or on onto a public thing as a direct uh costed that we 've donated and um i support um everything going forward and everything else has been said here tonight thank you for the comments write a thanks mr mayor yes i think uh a lot of the comments uh are very true particularly regarding uh the amount of work that 's been put in by the um staff the health star particularly you know from the medical center as well and they were set up down there in their own car park and there would have been some days when it wouldn 't have been very pleasant being out there either so i think the fact for them to use is a very very worthwhile thing for us to do as a leader in the community thank you i 'll put the resolution all those in favour hi again study cleric carried and before i move on i remit i was remiss not to acknowledge and i 'm not um i 'm not being political here but i think we should also just publicly recognize the the absolutely tireless efforts of our state member state steph cook who was really doing a sterling job in supporting what 's happening in care and across our electorate but supporting what 's happening in cara unbelievable energy item number five australia day representatives um councillor pedro thank you yeah thank you come to play right there council mike and arbor the second in that thank you gentlemen you should speak council i think yeah if there is common sense in local government this does make common sense that um there 's uh these two delegates are organizing something that will happen after an election which which normally doesn 't happen and um for the day to work we need this meets all the guidelines of local government i support it thank you thank you council emerge yeah concur i just think that it gives us canew uh continuity moving forward into the australia day um festival so uh fully supportive thank you um i 'll write any for the comments councillor smith sorry i have a question mr mayor and it 's about the last sentence in the introduction um either to you or to the general manager it says that the mayoral position will be vacant from the 4th of december until the 10th of january my understanding in the past was that that the mayor remained the titular head after an election and this appears to have changed so i i 'd like firstly confirmation um that it has changed and and if anyone knows the reason i 'd i 'd like to hear that because that 's a very long time for a council to be without someone performing the functions of a mayor and who may be needed for example in an emergency situation or at other times when the uh the general manager can manager you don 't have settled not me you can answer you can ask the tech you can ask the technical part to start with and there 's a political aspect on that which i might take happy to mr chairman i just i reported on this in my uh report to last month 's general committee meeting that this was the case has been a change of the regulation following the 2016 elections it 's of course been exacerbated by now the lengthy the lengthening of the time for the receipt of the postal votes and of course this year exacerbated by the christmas period um the rationale for i understand is that is is that uh some mayors who may not have previously been re-elected at the ordinary election uh then perhaps causing one of a better term mischief uh between the election and the the council the date of the first council meeting where our new mayor is elected uh if we could make a comment it 's probably not disseminated a lot of things that happened we seem to cater for the lowest common denominator in that i 'll step out thank you on that um and just to add to that councillor smith that was a good pick up thank you um i know that there are a number of councils and i know that rerock for example are writing strongly worded letters to the the minister and their state representatives in regard their concerns about that length of time and and what 's the change in the regs and i know that at the meeting virtual meeting with the deputy premier john baralaro with the country mayors and rural regional mayors and general managers a couple weeks ago this matter was raised with him the concern of the councils was expressed and actually the deputy premier seemed somewhat surprised and whether where 's the council want to actually write and at our concerns that 's something for this chamber to actually determine and i 'm happy if someone does a supplementary motion to tonight 's meeting if if if you feel that strongly about it and the essence is that in for those who aren 't fully aware is that in the past the position for those emergency situations until the next mayor is is appointed which which allowed the mayor to allow the the general manager in the council to function in those situations that are required an elected person to comment and there was no delegated authority for i also note that this regulation only applies to mayors that are elected by the council it doesn 't apply to the mayors that are elected by the community at a general election anyway that 's does that answer the question yes mr mayor but i i would be happy to move a supplementary motion to the effect that that you have just uh suggested i think that it uh it could be quite an important issue and i think that 's it 's one we should have our say on do i get a second half of that i 'm happy to second that mr mayor and the re and the recommendation is that we write to our local member and the minister of local government expressing our concern at the regulations mr trump changing regulations so trade general manager mr just say 't been hasn 't been um adopted yet this is a matter of rising from that moved by councillor wright and councillor knobs my apologies my apologies um the original motion which was being moved thank you general manager councillor wright do you wish to add further to the original motion that you moved no just okay thank you yeah you admit write a reply i 'm just i mean what 's been raised about the motion that we 're discussing yep yep it flows out of it but you know all right we 'll put them if you 're you 're happy and the second is happy i don 't know if i could go as far as to say that i 'm that i 'm happy but i 'm trying i 'm trying that 's the important thing that 's the important thing um so i 'll put the motion which is item number five in in the the agenda which is around the continuing involvement of uh councillors wall street and council miller as they currently stand up with revolutionaries in favor all right against and then wrong and if the council smith wants to move that supplementary i 'll take it now yes thank you mr may and welcome to my second thank you um general manager you 've got a recommendation there that mr chairman i 've noted that council right to the local member and the minister for local government raising concerns at the changes to the legislation that results in a mayor elected by councillors ceasing to hold office from the day of the election until the first council meeting of the new newly elected council i think that covers a thank you councillor smith for the move you should speak further or you think you 've covered it sufficiently at this no thank you mr mayor i 've said what i need to say council member as a secondary and mr chairman having been in this position and and knowing what the regulations were before i think that they worked perfectly well whilst it generally was only two or three weeks at that stage this is exceptional circumstances and there should be a sensible response from the minister regarding this issue it council sort of without leadership um only in emergency situations etc um for this length of time thank you councillor walt did you have a hand up uh yeah look i 'd just like to mention i think that one thing two things that need taking into account a this is going to be right in the middle of the fire season and b of course we 're still in the middle of a pandemic and uh certainly uh leadership is still required right through that christmas period so i think it 's important to bring those two factors into the letter thank you any further comments yes council right yes mate um just following up your comment about mayors elected by the community under this extended period that polls aren 't going to be declared to about the 23rd or 4th of december which is there 's nearly three weeks where those councils won 't have a mayor either so that 's a uh i presume that i could be right with that am i uh gentlemen the general manager 's comment my understanding was that those mayors who previous election remained in that position until the new mayor was appointed all right you know i misunderstood the way you interpreted that that was my reading of it now i 'm happy to be corrected uh mr chairman that that 's my recollection admittedly i 've i 've been more focused on what 's relevant to carer council i can certainly clarify that for councillors information thank you thank you further comment well the only comment i make in that case is that the councils that the councils elect the mayor being disadvantaged but if that may if the generally elected mayor is um can carry over in the interim period so you might i don 't know if it 's worthwhile um adding that to the to the letter because the councils that vote for the mayor are elected by the community and represent them so their decisions should be encountered too sorry mr mayor oh you 're fine you 're fine for the comments mr chairman i 've just just jumped in i just checked the report that i put submitted in in august and it certainly the office of local government that popularly elected mayors will continue to hold their civic offices until council elections are held on for december so um my reading of that is that they they would cease to hold office as well okay right yeah thank you i 'll stand corrected thank you thank you um for the comments right reply i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against against and declare it carried um item lost track of time i did australia today we 've just done that so we 're now looking at item six which is donation request for cara statford did i suggest i 'd like to make a change to that recommendation um i 'm in the hands of the of the chamber someone gets in quickly will take something that or something the change would be the council provided a donation to ensure that karer stanford incorporated for its 2022 uh event phase on the 11th pays only nine thousand dollars plus um cpi for the year uh for the higher of the kara civic center and that the final donation amount is the um and uh i 've got to try and work in somewhere there about uh 20 months um uh 20 20 days of actual hall higher i um can i suggest you might just put a second dot point that this a plot this this applies to no more than 20 days higher i think that would be the best way of doing it and i would also suggest that the recommendation would be nine thousand dollars excluding gst as is the yeah okay so everybody understand that do we have a second to please mr chairman all right and adding cpi yeah yes yes yeah nine grand he 's still in gst um plus cpi thank you and the second dot point you got yes yep okay good all right um councillor walsh thank you mr mayor okay i think the uh nine thousand to eleven thousand is uh just a little bit too bigger hike for um in one year it 's um probably around about 18 to 20 percent and uh sounds a bit like the bushfire brigade actually but uh the uh charging us but is a little bit uncertainist about what might happen next year and i think we need to give them as much encouragement as possible to make sure that they continue on with this wonderful event that they hold and i might point out also that this stanford is worth a lot of money to this town in accommodation and food thank you councilman you 're my turn my turn sorry i thought you can read my mind mr chairman i want others to do it too as well to hear your mind thank you mr chairman i think it makes perfect sense at the moment the current climate we do i know what we do we do give generous support to the estate but we do all recognize how important it is as a social activity to our town the town benefits greatly from this wonderful event that 's been going on for 50 odd years now so this is something that we need to encourage obviously if it can go ahead we do not want to price it out of existence so we 've got to be really mindful um significant donation now this obviously will add to that but i think in the current climate it 's it 's makes perfect sense further comments right i knew that because i got your message yet um listen uh just i 'd like to support this uh i think this stedford is a really and it has been shown to be a fantastic asset to the community and the whole of the council um and the residents get involved including the business chambers and i 'm sure in the business chamber and all the businesses and i do know that this actually brings a lot of money to town and my experience has been that it 's a benefit to a great number of people including the the talented people that take part so um i 'd just like to um congratulate them and say this is uh we we need to do this and i think it 's a very good move thank you council reporter yeah thank you mr chairman um i support it is this to be reviewed every year or um yeah or will it remain recommendation is talking for 2022 in it yes yep all right yeah thank you very much um you know i 'm i 'm quite happy to support it as it is and um but i think we need to be mindful that um there 's still a thirty thousand dollar twenty five to thirty thousand dollar donation from the council budget to uh back into the civic center and um [Music] i 'm glad that we can support them and but i think we need to realize uh how the costs are made up and the impact on on on a on a on a function that that works long hours and um so forth but uh no i completely support this thank you thank you for the comment i 'd reply not necessary put the resolution in favor all right against declare it carried item number one director of environmental services his lot is da 96 2021 55 mount mcdonald road darby 's falls a dwelling there 's a da there with a condition a recommendation of approval with condition consent so i want to remove that please or in qatar council of wageningen council smith council of miller council thank you thank you mr mayor um again we are talking about a building envelope that was put on a parcel of land at subdivision um approaching 20 years ago it doesn 't necessarily mean that that 's the best place to cite a development it does mean however that there are certain processes official processes that need to be gone through if we uh pass this recommendation i think the key uh for me is that uh the reasons for the sighting of firstly the dwelling partially outside the building envelope are that it 's a more level uh part of the land and that it is already cleared of vegetation there 's no need to clear any more um it 's only the um the waste that will be cited completely out of the building envelope and i i think it 's been all been well justified and we should support it further comment thank you mr chairman as the second or i totally support all of those comments this this has been really well assessed as sense to me that we should support thank you for the comments or questions no further comments or questions write a reply therefore probably not required i 'll put the motion eyes in favor i need hands colleagues or something thank you i declare it carry anonymously um item number two from the director environmental services is uh da number 95 2021 uh nine tokyo terrace is a recommendation again then for approval with conditions the consent to apply so i want to move that council a mill thank you councilor walsh thank you councillor miller mr chairman uh we must all be getting tired it 's been a big agenda so far uh thank you again i think i 'm as a risk of repeating myself this is really really well assessed uh makes perfect sense to me the reasons for coming to council firstly there are um largely does comply with the dcps etc the variations are minimal they are justified in my view and i think we should support it second yes i agree with that we should support it because the effect of having uh an not going to um concern anyone in my opinion simply because it backs on to the uh um backs onto the peace precinct and it 's also one um you know one of the larger blocks there at the um up for the new uh subdivision so i can 't see that the height or the actual fence front fence being built out of bricks the same bricks as the as i understand that to the same bricks that are being used for the house which is once again i think uh allowing us to go ahead as one of the common sense things that council can do further comments no further comments write a reply not required i would assume mr chairman i need to say that uh again if you look at the costings associated with this here it 's it 's a i i suppose a vote of confidence in the carer community that we 're looking at expenditures of this this magnitude uh in these in developments like this uh up in that part of the town and i think that it august well for our taking place around the shire and that should be acknowledged and we should be very pleased about it i 'll put the recommendation on this in favor signify please carried declared sorry against declare it carried next item is item number page one one one one one five nine sorry which is the dcp extension review recommendation there which is a large document but the recommendation is reasonably long recommendation but it 's endorsing you and supporting what we have done is that councilman are you waving at me no i 'm sorry i 'm trying to look around the screen and and mr chairman if there 's nobody jumping out i 'm happy to move it and speak to him i just thought there 'd be others that might want to do it that 's all um i 'm having to do it i thought that too but i 'll let you move it and count to the welsh a second again so yeah thank you thank you mr chairman um as you just quite rightly said this is quite an extensive number of documents that uh the uh a a little bit of comment as far as that is concerned i think certainly not enough comment to because it warrants a whole lot of comment about the quality of this review into um our development control plan it will take the place of and supersede our 2014 plans i would encourage all the people that have not had a look at it to have a look at it because it is very professionally done very comprehensive and will guide the developments across the shire over the next five or six years uh before we go through the whole process again council right sorry councillor walsh thank you mr mayor yes uh agree with what council miller said and also just add that i think this is a tremendous document it 's uh fascinating too fascinating to read through it even if you thumb through and pick out the parts that interest you it 's really really uh tremendous and after 13 years on council are still learning things from it so it 's tremendous in my book i thoroughly um recommend to particularly developers and particularly to some take a look at uh the various parts of it that might pertain to what they 're developing and what they 're doing thank you for the comments nice councillor fagan thank you just i can 't believe that this has gone so quickly it went out on an um on public uh exhibition and it 's just raced past and um it is a very interesting document as uh council walsh said you can look through it and find parts and bits and pieces that you find really interesting and i think it 's work it 's quite a it 's a something to keep um i 'm glad that some people have commented on it and we have shown that there there is an interest in it but it is also a very important document that 's going to um shape our future and i think it 's a great that we 've got a new one and it 's updated and i congratulate the staff and the planning staff for doing such a great job so the comments i 'm just going to back on part of and that is just to everybody said there 's a document which takes us forward it 's a planning document but i really think it would be remiss not not to piggyback on council of fagan 's comments about the staff and their work and their contribution this is a 600 page document which has had a lot of work going on a lot of thought a lot of consideration and so to them i simply say to the director and her staff and other senior staff and council involved i just want to say thank you very much well done so the comments reply i don 't think it 's needed mr chairman i 'll put the resolution i was in favor all right against i declare it carried we now go to the late merrill minute which is which you should all have and i 'm quite happy to move that as has printed if i get a second or i 'll speak briefly to it councillor smith thank you thank you i will speak briefly while um this is something we have discussed counsellors um it is down this path sometimes you think well why are we doing this because now i can listen it 's just doing the same i 'll say old but i think that the standard you walk past becomes a standard you accept if you don 't raise concerns you don 't raise your the issues then people just tend to march forward and when you look at the importance of these sorts of reports can play in in planning and development going forward within local government when you look at the i think i 've used the figures millions of people being projected moving to sydney and what 's happening in this region is being moved is been counted in tens of thousands it is just i think not on um and it goes back to the conversation we had earlier about the the expressway or a fast route over the mountains and this region is predicted to have to be in the top seven regions i 'm repeating it top seven regions in australia by twenty by twenty twenty three thirty one by by um infrastructure australia so it 's fantastic full about what how good we are we are i think the region a community in a region that should be growing considerably and it is growing considerably and it 's being held back by some of these sorts of reports and i can speak from personal experience with the clinical services plan at care hospital it made it difficult almost impossible to argue for a greater population and greater services because the conversation always went back to we need to work off department of department planning figures population figures and projections so it does have a significant impact so i think just to turn around and say that we don 't agree and we want some explanations i think it 's something that is appropriate and we should be doing i think and councillor smith you second that did you i did uh but i think you 've you 've said it all mr mayor thank you any further comments uh mr chairman i would just like to add to that your comments and as you know when the council knows i actually raised this issue at the out as far as this is concerned i and i 've argued many many times in the past about the the poor use of statistics to to to paid us into a really bad position and irrespective of they might likely say at the start of this this is only one of the documents that are used to decide whether infrastructure spending is in a particular area or not but it also says and then it 's a damning statement in there about this is where they decide on land use and all sorts of things and i think that we should be not just making a note of it and i i do i congratulate you on the on your minute regarding this but i think that we should be making a very very strong statement about this because this will impact on the growth of rural and regional new south wales going forward it 's been it 's been impacted on us greatly in the past and i speak from a personal experience over the last 30 years where these these sorts of numbers are being utilized to communities will look like and how they 'll be populated into the future so we should be shouting this from the rooftops that we actually do not support in any shape or form these proposed documents being utilized at all they should be debunked is what they deserve and we should be making sure that they are but i do agree with your your questions here about the methodology etc and also doing a a full review of the projections going back at least for 30 years that i 'm talking about that i can sort of recollect that there 's some of these figures that they 've utilized in populations going backwards significantly going backwards which we 've not they 've not even come close to being factual and they should be debunked thank you thank you for the comments no further comments council right because i supported um i i think figures like this was also highlighted in the lep in 1990 and i think mary kovac she acknowledged the figures weren 't accurate but but they give a trend and um we 've got a trend where in the next 20 years but only have 150 people more living in your town there 's going to be a few houses empty so it just doesn 't line up i think they 've got to bring into into the discussions the improvement of the hopefully the improvement of infrastructure we discussed earlier with getting people across the mountains quicker and also the take up of uh technology i think they would have found this out in the pandemic where a lot of people can work from home and don 't have to be in the in the city and so forth and um i think with agriculture the way it is at the moment and um i hope we 're not just right writing a question away but the importance of it will be um will become more will be seen to be more tied to future development of areas like ours that um um that growth will include improve and i also uh i know i live in the past but i know in 1970 when they 're building the dam out there we had nearly 1100 come close to that sense but infrastructure things like that can have a big bearing on australia grows thank you any further comments i think i will wave my writer reply i 'll put the recommendation i was in favor against against declare it carried um no late reports um mr mayor yeah if i may uh if you would accept it um and i do uh apologize uh death of one of our former councillors i was wondering if you would be prepared to accept a uh a motion that counsel uh well are you prepared to accept a motion to that respect yeah certainly yeah yeah i 'd just like you on behalf of council to write to mrs kathy starr and her family uh expressing our sympathy the loss of gary a former counselor and also a wonderful wonderful community member i 'm telling you the second to please councilman miller i 'm sure thank you and thank you councillor walsh that was something which is a terrible oversight on my behalf and or our behalf with this meeting and we should have done that to start not i don 't think i need to say any more council miller mr chairman just in terms of process just in terms of processing the motion they need the first motion they need to rule that to be a matter of great urgency just so we 've got that right in terms of the process i i did the council of wall street asked me would i accept it as a matter of urgency and i said yes i 'm sorry yeah it was a bit quick and a bit convoluted but i did and i should have got a motion to deal with as a matter of urgency i know yeah but i did but i did accept it as a matter of urgency yeah well mr chairman probably had a frustration that we missed this to start with councillor miller well just to formulate that mr chairman i 'm happy to move that as this is a matter of urgency um and i 'm sure somebody will second that so that that 's recorded properly councillor faye can second that thank you uh i accept it as be dealt with a matter of urgency all those in favor bye against and declare it carried more now go back to back to the motion moved by council of wall street by council miller any further any further conversations and i do deeply apologize to the chamber and to the family of the late garry star for not missing for missing this and not getting it very startled very short at the meeting uh mr chairman and just supporting councillor walsh 's comments uh obviously i was gary was on council 's uh with me he 'd spent nine years on power council but that was a small part of his contribution to the cara community particularly to the youth of of cara he 's done tremendous work not only sort of through his school his teaching career but also after when he became incapacitated he actually tutored a whole lot of kids he engaged with with a lot of a lot of um slow learners he supported them and they 've gone on to achieve great things so he 's made a wonderful contribution over a long period a really dear friend to many of us any further comments and i should make the chamber aware that that was a very small funeral because the covert council of welsh councilmen and myself were able to attend that funeral and council and duty express council 's sympathies and we did provide some a small flower floral arrangement as well as four baskets to the product to the household um gary 's wife and three kids particularly so that the kids had something to take home from coward from the council very sad time you for the comment write a reply not necessary no i 'll put the resolution all those in favor again so i think i 'll call that carried unanimously um i have one other that i would like to raise as a matter of matter of um urgency if i may and that 's to for council to be noting the um imminent in terms of minutes imminent retirement resignation of uh direct environmental services i 'd like to do that as a matter of urgency so i 'll move that forward to have a second and what i would like to move you know sorry i 'll obviously i 'll accept that as a matter of urgency and put the resolution everybody accepted it um item and i would do this in three parts if i may one is that council note the resignation of the developmental of the direct environmental services miss cate albright uh two to extend our deep appreciation to her contribution uh and commitment to to karashi council and three extend our best wishes um to her in her future endeavors i can have a second do for that please taking the council of fagin i 'll go that way um and just in in moving his colleagues i think that we have been fortunate to have had miss albury working within within our midst for a number of years now and i know that her contribution uh has always been one the position has been well thought out she 's been prepared to to argue her case and has contributed wherever it 's been necessary and some of the we 've just dealt with the the dcp which is some around the aboriginal community and the some of those precincts that we 're looking to develop have been exemplary and they are truly legacy projects and i 'm sure we look back in years to come to acknowledge uh ms albridge contributions so kate i on behalf of the community the council say thank you very much for a tremendous job hard work commitment it 's been fun uh we 've all had our moments but it 's always been in good spirit and and in in in good faith so i i do say thank you very much um councillor fagin you 're second that you 're to speak yes i 'd just like to say um that kate 's been a terrific um role model and an amazing part of our community since she 's arrived and we 've we were glad to get her from the north coast um and i think uh she 's been um she 's uplifted the standards of the player of the planning department dramatically and i 've i 've had quite a bit to do with a whole lot of issues 's um leadership has been outstanding and i 'd congratulate her and and wish her all the best in the future so the comments council look i 'll work around the room council of smithy on top of my top left hand corner thanks mr mayor it 's unfortunate given the covered situation that we 're not actually able to be there in person to feel well kate i 'm sure we will see her around the traps in the not too distant future but i do hope that when uh we come out of knockdown we will be able to get together at some significant stage and and that kate will be with us and we will be able to uh have a toast to her and wish her well in her new endeavors i certainly thank her also for all the work that she has done on our behalf and on the behalf of the community councilor walsh thanks mr mayor yes kate uh just wanted to wish you all the very best in your future uh endeavor and uh thank you very much for the work you been with us um all of a sudden uh da 's and uh have become very easy for us councillors to actually work on somebody who 's giving the leadership there that 's in your department and i can only presume it as you who has brought that out and i also want to just also acknowledge your interest in history of the town and the work that you 've done particularly relating to for example the italian hut the stone hut and also some of the other areas of history for example down the main street where the those prism glasses were were replaced um those that sort of thing is uh something that 's you know very near and dear to me and i 'm delighted to be able to say thank you and uh wish you well council miller thank you mr chairman probably not a lot left to say i think that we 've all admired kate 's uh better the way that she 's going about her job clear concise and professional i think are the words that come to mind as far as i that and again tonight i think that the number of resolutions that i 've spoken to or moved or seconded some of the terminology that i 've used there is it 's been well assessed and there 's no reason why we should not pass this resolution and i think that that is because of the very clear professional way that kate and her staff present it but i think it 's also and councilor wells just did acknowledge some of the work but i think the efforts down the main street that project managing that project was a sterling effort above and beyond kate in my view and you did a tremendous job it could have it could have run off the rails many many times and i 'm sure behind the scenes it did at times but i think that you manage that really really well and we 'll be forever grateful for that um i think there 's two other points i 'd make one is thank goodness we 're not losing you that you are you 've begun this this community does grow on you and here forever so very pleased that you 're staying around we do look forward to catching up with you um going forward and i know that certainly in conversations i 've had with the with the gm as well that um he will utilize time permitting your professionalism in your professional career uh going forward as as in when the need arise as well so i will do look forward to that as well so but good luck good luck and and in all your future endeavors thank you for the comments yeah just quickly um i 'd on a personal note kate i 'd like to say thank you i think five years ago when i first got onto council as a very novice and amateur young counter not yet not so young counsellor um the advice and that i got from you it was was taken on board and i think he helped me through a very uh a transition so thank you from on my behalf by the comments i 'll use my write a reply um kate i think that that gives you indication of the both professionally and personally we say thank you for that again reiterate i wish you well in the future and i guess the final comment is the general manager is going to find some of the managed meetings much more much much more quiet can i uh respond of course you can um thank you for thank you so much for those uh kind words and um yes he 's gonna be he 's gonna be bored really without me i 'm sure um i you know i it 's been a remarkable experience here i 've learned a lot and and i couldn 't do what i 've done or achieved without my staff we we come as a package and they are a remarkable team very very clever with with great skill and they should be um they should i 've told them that today on many occasions so um the ones i can as can speak to directly understand that they are um extraordinarily valued and they are extraordinary people um and i 'd also you know like to thank the council for for their confidence and i could not achieve without council support the general manager 's support and and they have been some great projects my interest in history is is always growing and um and that stone hut i just i love it and i hope that there 's a there 's a da approved for a roof so hopefully we can you can or you can or larissa can get some funding to get that protected in in perpetuity so there 's that stone heart up there forever um it 's been a one b

yes go thank you for allowing us the time to put our point thank you for allowing us this time to put our point forward in regards to the proposed fee structure for the Civic Center we have emailed every counselor with our concerns along with the 2019 fees and the projected to 2021 things we would like to just outline a few of the major points obviously the substantial fee increase we have been told that these fees that these fees have been set viewing from other centers we have been given some advice from our Aegis Tedford ruling their fees for their orange civic theatre rooms and backstage area than our Civic Center the asterid run upstairs canteen and sell their own tickets they pay four hundred and fifty five dollars per day a which includes a technician and there 's no extra charges for target flooring microphones etc with the new proposed fees we have a lack of opportunity to have a canteen to try and offset some of our costs ticketing again will be done by Civic Center staff we usually have volunteers that do these jobs our Stanford family that come back to our stead for each year will now not experience the same feel as they come through the front door because it will not be us or our volunteers greeting them it will be staff of the Civic Center the effect on our business if the estate food could not go ahead accommodation meals and fuels from the out-of-towners as well as the extension ourselves for our accommodation and meals for our adjudicators and accompanists and our trophies and supplies because we try to shop local where we can we are asking for consideration on these points as we cannot fees are adopted we have been assured that not all these fees will apply to the aesthetic rent as it 's more aimed at the one-off events but as you can understand we need to know a budget we know need to know the fees before we can budget and plan for our 2021 at Stanford with this all in mind we would ask the counselors to either not adopt the fee structure at this stage or adopt with consideration special consideration for the three weeks that the estate would cause the Civic Center home again thank you for the time and apologize for all the mess ups I 've done a couple of zoom meetings and I haven 't had this problem so just me I think but yep so thank you very much and if someone could inform us of the outcome as soon as possible we

up thank you alright we will now move on to the officer 's report the first one is the Director of Corporate Services in terms of the shipping center and some of them want to move that thank you our second to please thank you sorry council Fagin do you say getting out or you want a question do you want a question or you with the question I 'm sure they will if you ask for it yeah you asked a question and it doesn 't have an amount of funding in the recommendations I lied on a fundamental manager mr. chairman thank you cancel the Welch was the move that you to speak Thank You mr. mayor and council and had a difficult decision to make sometime back when we had to decide whether we wanted the Civic Center to continue as is in other words very little use and also to some extent it was quite a bit of our ahem required through the building and the in our down of wisdom we backed the director to appoint a manager the manager is a person with great experience in in running this sort of operations and we by looking at a request for further investment which was the general manager says will be dug within the budget confidence to that person to try and bring some quality art and entertainment programs to the service to the Civic Center and also to encourage and promote local programs and by that I mean the estate fir 'd and the MMD society and any other local programs that may wish to try and avail themselves of the facility there and that of course some of that will be dealt with in the when we debate the budget the the money the money that is that we are suggesting be made available and also how that would be used Thank You counsel Fagan dear to speak yes I mean I think piece is a really something that we need to do after giving the money in the beginning to employ in a professional person to run the civic center and ask for a policy and proposal proposal the future of center which has been lacking in funding over the last few years I think this is actually the next step you know refurbishment and our ongoing cultural life and activities in their community I know we play we spend a lot that I think this is just another item for to spend on infrastructure so that we can actually attract better grow more quality productions and other artists to our community and I think as the aging population we have less moveable people around then it would be good to have recreational arts facilities such as this you know and a high quality so I 'm very supportive of the idea for the comment I guess mr. chair I 'm of two minds here I 've read the report and also seen the new charges and on page 3 of the report it has core principles listed there listen senator be freshly run venue yes I understand that 's changing then it says ticket prices must be affordable to the community fees and charges must be realistic and comparable to regional industry standards and fees and charges that must also cover basic costs but you know in doing this I can 't see how they can do that right I 'm telling free under the current fee structure it 's doubled nearly from our existing charges the sted foot was told been charged the the proper charge under existing thing and it would be eighteen thousand dollars not the nine thousand dollars and now they 're looking at some thirty two thousand dollars and I understand that the community what we 're still going to encourage community but it 's going to be by negotiation and that 's not clearly defined in the fees and things it 's going to be up to people [Music] making applications to Council with some consideration and the fees they 're going to be charged we 're I think if that was we if we had a community fee that was applicable and thing that 's going to be a lot less work for the manager and so forth cuz he can 't make decisions on reducing fees and if we 've adopted this fee structure so I want to see the Civic Center change and I think that the the current fellow has but when we put the two together I don 't know if we 're gonna get the outcome we want thank you I 'm going to speak in favor the motion fission charges which obviously we 'll discuss a little bit later on in the evening but I 'll make an observation that past practices is that the some of some of the community organizations have come to council and have been treated very very well by counsel in regards to reduction in fees and charges I think this council made under me to to to those user organisation keeper this dead but that practices continue I see no reason why that won 't continue as in the past where they have applied for a sometimes a special special feature in terms of community organizations again it very much inculcating their thinking in this document but across the conversation with that that the community organization may be looked at but they very report to our community now it may not be written in the way that every organization can understand that in plain English but it 's written in the way we should understand but that opportunity easily and we encourage engagement this report also is an important post establish whether those parodies become those of a city similar center working have and I 'd also comment that there is a in this weather 's an indication the director will report the council on a monthly basis in the early days think better then so I think that the mechanisms are in place there actually ensure the community 's protective support and looked after and we will work with the money fest but no that 's a given and talking to I think all that colleagues we 've all indicated that both publicly and privately we would expect to continue to support its bid for northern our oceans like them I think that the point also needs to make this is a process that council adopted or embarked on some some time ago in terms of a conscious decision as to how we thought the Civic Center could be changed to be changed and that this report just continues along that along that plan in terms of and we 've had these these papers in front of us for quite some time so it 's not a surprise to us and I 'd also just in conversation with the director time I got exhausted off him in his office because mm I they invent new charges and salaries report performing arts and connections in Australia and that was a document which other fees and charges and how they 're assessed so comparing one with another we 're comparing Caroline just community can not be misleading but can be can be difficult a full picture so I think it 's important that we do pursue this recommendation and we do proceed with work on the city set up and we do give that commitment the community we will continue to work with them very very close because the volunteers are important but also so is the improvements in the city centre says something that the community is proud of it up and whether as a sees the council further comments council smoothly you had your hand up thank you mister me and you said much of what I was going to say so I 'll any and council Iraq was concerned that the report from the center manager talked about affordability for the community and that that didn 't appear to fit what you were saying about councils past commitments to community groups and how we supported them by donating back fees and so on rightly is a council matter and so couldn 't appear in a civic centre documents such as this it 's something that council has done always for community groups and I 'm sure will continue to to do but it wouldn 't appear in that Civic Center management document capsule alone could you have your hand up yeah I did just on a point of order I think that counselor right spoke against it and yourself as a chair spoke for it I think it should have been that we should have asked for someone to speak back against it in before the deputy mayor had a sir because I 'd like to split I 'd like to split sort of against it I guess I tend to agree with cancel a rod I think that I think that the fees that were charged it that we are charging in carer for for our community are a little bit high I understand I definitely understand that we the our local our stead fit out in any way that we can and we and that they will get well I hope that they get what they are asking for in regards to paying the same amount each and every year in regards to CPI but I do but I think that for the clientele that where the carer as a community are going to go into to accommodate I don 't think that we I think we 're I think we 're barking up the up the wrong tree with with large large fees that are not going to see that the Civic Center used I 'd like to sit as councillor rot said I 'd like to sit a little bit a little bit more investigation into it I understand what you 're saying mayor and and deputy mayor that 's that 's where I stand at the moment thank you we 've taken your point of order was not not not necessary well it could also pick it up emotion is not feeling a division charges which is commenting on counselor right said any further comments mr. mayor when councillor ride mentioned chord principles he forgot to mention one which says that council continues to have the discretion to provide donations to assist community groups with these and charges as they see fit that 's what we 've been doing for the last 12 years that I 've been involved with Council and not once not once can I remember the Stanford or any other community group not being or being refused either a refund or assistance in some way in the use of the Civic Center and for the functions that they 're holding there and while council acknowledges that right that has that right I can 't see any reason why we cannot look favorably on these charges as the mayor has already mentioned to there will be a working committee set up to assist in the within the actual liaise with the with the direct with the manager of the Civic Center and also the director to to actually manage it and I 'm sure that the monthly reports back to Council will enable us to very quickly see how things are going 'll put the resolution all those in favor hi against all right council if I get you a favor up is in okay yep I 'll be clear carry mr. Mehra 's counseling Miller it 's been carried I move on now to the directive in fact operations george campbell breached george campbell region of Darby 's falls row there 's recommendation there that we we receive and note the report is like the recommendation I think you 've come to a mellow the second place yes so Michael knows thank you you just speak counsel Miller very briefly mr. chairman this is real just tonight what he 's a short report on underwear we 're up to and certainly on I 'm sure I share the same viewers that counsel and would certain the director enough happy behind me is quite available really the grant programs but don 't we have to commit to it and I think that that 's appropriate in that this is a very important access road and we need to make sure that the bridge is kept up to I made Papa stay the poor basil this is really as I said just now to get the phenomena that we 've done who made me the grant applications but everybody needs to understand that we have committed to a 50% contribution if and when we are successful thank you further comments so I fully concur with Council on Miller I think that as the council we 've shown that people that we 're we 're going to give with looking at giving 50% funding as well so and we 're just looking at funding to help us heal I think that 'll work any further comment yes I think it 's so you know we we are able to push the barrow a little bit here because rather obviously it 's going to be one of the main access sites for the work that we know will be eventually starting on my angle wall and the amount of traffic that will be going over there could increase considerably so once I think that is something that could be used as leverage particularly when it comes to once the way to be etc and that Thank You mr. chairman I think that 's a good point that councillor Walsh was just minding that the last time there 's a significant amount of work I mean a lot of work moment that excess ride was some way back when the the dam was brought up though its current state so one so it was a good excuse to do it then and I think that certainly there 's a lot of work that on that road and the bridges and all the rest of it at that stage and and this is it 's appropriate and it forms part of the reasoning or operating the bridge again thank you I 'll put the resolution all those in favor aye again against declare it carry item number two in factory operations which is the sale yard committee minute to be noted I just want to move that chair of the committee I 'm happy to move it the second a perfect temperature of heaven right thank you I think there 's nothing nothing to add to that each that has been magically figures would have been dramatically partly orion and partly the drought seems crazy actually blaming the drought in the rain but we know that we know that the system in which we live and i just note that maybe the financial gurus within counselor might then be too quick to to adjust the third quarter EU and or second floor areas Oakwood review and take the dividend back into the general general bucket which may have to be reviewed but there 's nothing else to add any questions I 'm quite happy to answer Peter right yeah I just added I say apologies mill you know I was absent 110 percent I didn 't even know the meeting was on so you can get an email or anything so I should have looked at must have to look at something else I 'm sorry for not being there I 've let the side down yet again I 'll check that out around the invitations of email all members of the committee were notified disappointed although most have been because other members were there so I 've overlooked it or something take it that 's all e John but if there 's a difference between we overlook that we couldn 't get there whatever somebody didn 't give us those importantly we know that you were mister chair sorry so sorry just just a quick one on this is we 're just a one for the IT department I guess on the on the iPad oh I get item to as a double up from item one and it 's called item but it 's called item two and then I 'll get a second item to I just want to check it next way that 's that 's what I was talking about earlier okay it happens again yeah down the track some way can the IT guys are sitting in their own adult clear that they 're not and I 'm sure the pregnant girl manager taking note that ruled the IT guys will look at it they don 't are going to make an apology to two counselors in the rectum I take this unnoticed I don 't think this meeting was in the rocks on tap file with world which made not went out but it wasn 't_''_2506.93 in the outbox on tap so counselors should also get the priests agendas prior to moving you 've got a comment I 'll put the resolution is over carry committees Thank You mr. chairman I 'm happy to move ball four and take any questions if there is a second counselor well mr. chairman just before just before if there are any questions just to clarify item two we 're talk about recommend to council that we support the recommendation in the transport for New South Wales draft report from the improve of the existing school zone on Redfern street reinstate the fifty K zone there that we 're talking about the high school forty forty K zone this is something that 's plenty in play for the last couple of years has been a difficult one to get through but the council needs to understand that all we or we can recommend it from the traffic committee to the council and also hopefully the Council adopted is that we can support the recommendation but it would need to get back and go through will be supported by Transport for New South Wales so we can for the ones bring this a dip agenda item to a close for all of this time you said used to the last couple of years was that was that cheek well it 's been a while any further comments like seconding and i just like to say I 'm delighted to see that that is happening and that 's much more appropriate of design flashing lights being Dowell Street he further comment a question of right reply but mr. chairman just to make sure that that 's was cancelled pulses seconded and supported it just to to just a risk of repeating myself counsel needs to understand we 're supporting a recommendation but it 's not a decision to take thank you but the resolution was in favor all right against declare carried item number four from the director of infrastructure operations which is laying doing water treatment plan upgrade there 's a recommendation be to no commute even though the information provided so I want to move that thank you I think Thank You counselor better say mr. Muir that that this is has been a problem for a considerable amount of time and even though we 're working hard on it it looks like it 's still a problem with some ifs and buts but given that we are working with water New South Wales on the regular dam wall raising project I would be hopeful that they would come to the party with some new and better water treatment but in the meantime we continue to work on it if I may just before I finish ask a question we 're talking about water quality and I 'm not sure what into you stands for could someone enlighten me please sure until the bread will come quickly online and give us an explanation of that stands for please the director Andy threw the chair that 's quite a complicated rise but basically as a measure of the turbidity of the water so its appearance being cloudy and colored so our objective is to remove some of the particles and the power and the water we 'll be distributed thank you for the comment ii said and I believe there 's a good chance of a discussion with me with water New South Wales and the only thing is which it 's done with any of it suits us we 're not we 're not given the plant that 's gotta cost an arm and a leg to run and have limited income from thank you thank you this one make one comment colleagues the last query out there is the important one to note in conversations around the opportunities can arise with the rising of the war and the redevelop was a reflection of Holiday Park based on the assumption that it appropriately so knows that the holiday park would have a double water so that there 's something that is account so we would probably believe it discussed as we move forward at some particular point in time between we would initialize plans around for the commented yes mr. chairman and and I concur with the comments that have already been made I don 't think this is a terrific opportunity to try and library job be the rising at the dam wall and also for the holiday park but I also won 't know it 's caution and having been around a long time with mr. Hollister councils concerned I have may have bad memories on my say of trying to organize and be involved albeit reluctantly because I was never satisfied that what was being proposed in the annals of time was it was an appropriate outcome for the village and also for the part of that particular time so we need to make sure that what is being proposed here not only delivers or both of these areas can also delivers that Adam portable price that whether if we do take it over and that it is something that we can have confidence in going forward it 's some of the stuff I 'm saying here is your board you all the tears but and they 'll talk about the same sort of stuff where with the sewage plant out there but it 's really about that making sure that in the end we we do not settle for second-best that it is only the best system that can be but also by the wider Cairo community for the comment just a statement mr. mayor if you like it the end to you for the deputy mayor stairs for nephilim metric turbidity unit and yes Google is my friend Thank You Castle who knows that explains everything it was a complicated term yeah that the reply will put the resolution all those in favor aye against declarant Airy we now move to recommend service was 56 which is da 24 straight 2020 in regards to the Woodstock recycled Woodstock landfill in the station out there counselor Smith you 're going to move that low a second to please where 'd it come from sorry thank you Thank You Chancellor Smith thanks mr. mayor this is something that we 've been working on for some time now and I 'm very pleased to see that it is coming to fruition before too long hopefully and what we 're doing for any member of the general public whose listening in is we we are removing the old tip and we 're placing it with a waste transfer station which we 'll have and tidier environment and that will include of course rehabilitation of the tip area which is is detailed in the background to this recommendation in some heads and I won 't to go into it the only other thing or two things that I would note one that there were a couple of letters in response to this one of which appeared to rely on some outdated information and not be aware of what we are actually doing and the other has been answered very satisfactorily the only other thing I 'll mention that because this is a council da it was quite rightly outsourced to a firm in Orange to assess so that council has been at arm 's length from this so I have great confidence in supporting the motion just a second it which to speak on oh I 'll just add that this this will do away with the with the 200-liter bins or whatever they are and you 'll have two big bins there to be able to fill up and and should alleviate overflow and so forth I just want to recognize the directors does the truck come out empty and take it back to town and empty it then bring the bin back and if if they do what 's the likelihood of someone just tipping rubbish where the bins should be and or or can you bring a bin out and offload non load and so forth through a number of bins the practices take the debonair drop it off big the other people so thank you low-risk yeah thank you thank you thank you break down any further comments or questions on this run no further comments or questions rider require I think the point that you made counsel that Smith is worth repeating is your vision first it involves council infrastructure it was independently assessed just all the issues are probity and being at arm 's length accomplish a common practice deuteride require countless mister no mister me I 'll put the resolution all those in favor da Thank You counselor I 'd hate to see hand counsel if they and they can 't think counselor Kevin right yes okay thank you I deeply other motion carried unanimously thank you the CBD footpath reconstruction program there is a up-to-date information report therefore noting you 're selling to move I will second deflator sort of counsel array well should you just wait counselor Miller yes I do mr. chairman and and I think it 's it 's a really up-to-date report as you just said and it unfortunately it does highlight the the impact of the cowbird virus and and the progress certainly slowed the progress down that we 're all very impressed with them and it 's affected the progress in a number of areas but particularly as I was the delivery of lis of the pavers and and unfortunate as I said but I 'll take an overall I continue to be impressed with the quality of work that 's being produced down there I do have separately for the impact that 's made on some businesses and the disruption is certainly young not to be Scott that I think that there is certainly you know it 's a very difficult time even when you was going to be disruptive as far as doing this work was concerned what we would be able to deliver the really product with as little disruption as possible but certainly if I was not being out to play and not not even knowing about a category so I 'm coming in February of this year and the impact that might have on not only progress of the the footpaths but also on businesses in general so do have some separately there but we will know I 'm sure I speak for all of us when we do it acknowledge that but we remain committed to delivering a very very good product and as soon as we possibly can I 've been in the director in the I 've assaulted this really important project Thank You counsel counsel well if your second that you took it all yes mr. mayor thank you once again I 'm very pleased with the look of the work that has been completed I do understand fully regarding the pavers and the fact that that is going to hold us up I 'm also pleased that one section left of the eight left to actually concrete and after that able to leave because basically we 'd be back to installing the the the pavers in the in the street furniture and also the gardens so it is a pity that we 've been held up a bit longer than we would have hoped but we 're always going to be some small holdups we didn 't count on the cabin causing the disruption to the to the pavers production as always going to be some holdups because there were a lot of a lot of pipes and quite a bit of infrastructure underneath some of the footpaths that no one you were there and over the years for various councils over many years in fact for one of those fights I saw some that have been dug up the other day and they they could have been there when our grandfather was about so I I do I share consular Miller 's sympathy with the businesses but I would hope that the attractiveness of the Main Street will start to repay them in some small way in the future once the whole job is completed thank you for the back to your question counselor thank you thanks mr. Muir I have a comment and a question too and the comment is about the new Telstra charge for the rehabilitation of the manholes it 's it 's a bit disappointing I think that council is going to be forced to pay an extra ninety two thousand dollars because Telstra says we did some work 17 years ago but the question through you perhaps to the director is given that 92,000 seems to be a large amount of money I 'm just wondering what to mobilizations means because I 'm presuming that they are going to be very costly through the chair look it it 's I 'm trying to get to the bottom of it I 've sent a million emails and I can 't quite work out what we 're actually being charged for and I 've had an additional charge and it 's now up to ninety nine thousand and I am just trying to get to the bottom of what each of those charges are for and I assume the mobilisation is to bring people to saw at this point Ned Kelly 's alive and well we not the 90th Telstra was keen to give this addition telecommunications service out here as well the comments yes yeah just following on from councillor Smith 's question I believe when it says to adjust 4x2 lids and adjust manholes and they taking the existing manholes out and putting new ones in and therefore I have to take the technical equipment out before they can put them in or something is it what through You mr. chair no that 's not the case it 's actually just adjusting the actual pits not the machinery inside and they 're taking the opportunity to upgrade the lids which were also being charged for by sort of default with my interpretation of that so no well I 'll thank you yeah thank you for that if they 're going to upgrade something that that sort of stopped doing with what we 've done with so I think we should talk to the telecom mob but span and run a few things past him I have noticed on Facebook Telstra 's has got a only thing they don 't provide is to change provider that and we 've all been going through six days of hell with mobile services because they 're fixing something but I don 't really know what they 've got to fix that look at cities are very difficult very bitter pill to swallow there 's three contractors down the line so this is three lot sets of different contractors that outsource this work so everybody puts on their you know amounts so it 's it 's not the true charge it 's just it 's yeah it 's disappointing and I cannot tell you how hard I 've tried to give Telstra back the you know notices speeches in Parliament and delivery of Telstra and npn over the years and I 've given it all back to them and do you know they didn 't like that what they were promised what they promised originally and maybe big epic shots of the theater right stomach that 's an avenue we can look at after but as we as we move forward Adelaide at a later date invest consider market I just think that it 's probably something that the discussion between the soap and the director of it certainly again look for the other avenues I think those would not neither the strength is familiar with advocating on behalf of the community some but not like in this instance and do that very well another reason I think in this one because of young on ports of why that I reacted to this that we should be holding them to account if we possibly can more time the directors about doing that sometimes it basically I just replayed again I think that we will all be really satisfied once we we 're building something here that 's going to last for community for hundreds and hundreds of years of market and so that 's that 's really appropriate and whilst it 's causing disruption at the moment and it 's at significant expense the fire bans I think they 're piled into insignificance in the years of home I put resolution all those in favor aye against carries next item of business to reach me a minute which I century and the Jo meeting because the zoom meeting and also making the minutes of that meeting which are still the draft minutes you know come to the walk thank you rather than speaking to these I 'm happy to answer any questions it was an interesting meeting on the zoom but like as we 've experienced colleagues and Zoo meetings we 'd be amazed debates and conversations so and I think the minutes clearly detect the changes the Jo to the from them from the rock to the Jo is still continuing to pursue having to answer any questions should you have any colleagues capsule a lot just speaking of the second email the motion and I find it 's very pleasing to see the potential relationship that might grow between the eight Western Sydney councils and our Jo that 's particularly pleasing because my involvement on behalf of Council in tourism and also we we know that in a few years time there 'll be a second Sydney Airport and it would be very much to our advantage if we 're able to work with those Sydney councils both for freight and for people who are might be leaving using that to leave overseas or travel is readily available so I think I was very very pleased to see that also you know that in that report there 's a note in that report on the about tourism that the we want you back campaign that 's been running and I urge everyone to check into central New South Wales tourism website and have a look at that see a few local stars in that and I think it 's a very very professional job but all the potentials all made a contribution to that and I 'm we 're hoping that that book gives benefits tourism wise to the whole region thank you any further comments or questions just I 'll if I may a just in something I 'll take a couple minutes to a while to mention a couple of things like I 've been going and looking at that we want your back campaign is a very good campaign terms of local stars will list two of the three were local stars and sky local council and Penrith is certainly one that really really have solid n1 which is going to be kicking dolls if I move forward picking from Auckland it begs the question does Kara want to consider looking together with several city city city can 't_''_3976.17 because in the relationship with Kagura do we want to go they can consider having some relationship with the City Council the other one users that depend on manager I think JC motor centers head out an email which was essentially from Alastair lund is the regional boss of transport you said well the RMS part of it about the corridors in Sydney the corridors around the m79 and the outer Sydney ogle I think in terms of where we sit as a region as ladies which I which is around that into that end of the corridor from reading it alignment looking at occasions the corridors are a long way off playing even preserved which which I think gates alarm bills and food cattle are those people living inside of the great to guide which wouldn 't be over the mountains especially and then as as they should and such as lagging to suggest that we will continue to go there looking do camber and go around but that 's I hope you all got that email and have had a chance of the best commend commended to you together with that up with the resolution I was in favor anybody again carried come to the hill many would like report with fruit we integrated mr. chairman we won before that I think yeah which is a a director environmental services the mural yes it is Lister before we find that very temple one or going on mural yeah mine mines after it on my arm oh so I 'll just follow mine if you like colleague and I 'm not alright I 'll just have to get it up that 's all just replace me yeah now it 's gonna be in the hardcopy they 're both listed after but that 's not so item number one for general manager is in draft integrators delivery program operational delivery program seventeen eighteen to twenty twenty one operational plan Twenty twenty Twenty twenty Twenty twenty nine twenty thirty and the draft over your policy for 2021 there is a report by general managers three points may I just draw your attention if someone 's a mind to move this a ten dot point for was a presentation of the Japanese gardens and there is a missing couple of words in terms of provide up to an amount of there 's no amount there so so much mr. chairman I 'm having to move it I 'd be happy to move it and and dad put 15,000 in the thank you do I have a seconder yes very happy so now you have your second us very happy thank you that 's that 's that 's the whole forward got points yes yeah okay counsel Miller you should speak to it I do mr. chairman and particularly very my conversation was had earlier which was slightly in context that I think it 's firstly I 'd like to bond compliment to stop on the amount of work that have been damaged as far as this whole thing he 's been so busy with the cameras so a lot of work carried out by the council as well as been brigades but the staff and the council as far as developing those plans some and going forward they 've been framed and very difficult circumstances as we we know with what 's been going there for the months and the still uncertain about like what impacts the cabin non-endemic will have on the future as well particularly for the next six months or so and so I think it 's which meant my own career and things were as far as the debate that was and the requests in open forum today as far as that who 's in charge is too concerned as far as the Civic Center I think it 's very clear they had implemented the sleekest which spoke earlier it made it very clear that this is about the future of the Civic Center and hopefully getting it much more professional footing however it is always been the council 's mind there is the opportunity there for the regular users the regular local views is a very significant contribution to the community and those they want to restore would have been down for 50 odd years so very important part of cultural activities but the opportunity is there for them to come to Council for the support that they 've always received and counseling totally in the 30 years that I 've been there we 've never been knocked back as one of the speakers said earlier we 've always been supported as long as the requests are reasonable evicted certainly trial is that the comments that were made around ticketing the use of the canteen being able to fundraise himself and that I 'm sure that they will be able to be accommodating the difficulty either clashes up by going forward we do understand that the community activities that are basically run by volunteers knew just what to sport as I can give and they 've given us much opportunity as I 'm keen to to support themselves so all of that would be taken into account I think that certainly working after thy wisdom is to get me the Civic Center back the Halligan days where it was a hive of stand it like available to fire this hadn 't said it because there was so much activity and it 's really about encouraging as I said the local usage of it but also trying to encourage professional the base and show is accepted to come to their town once some one of the really professional pudding so that we do have the opportunity to have a mixture of community events that 's on activities to entertain the water part of the community as well so I think that that 's as far as the person charged around the Civic Center is concerned the other issue and a solasko more quickly the proposal from the general manager about the chariot the mountains foundation regarding the Japanese gardens I think it 's really important understanding at the end typically that it was done that 's been caused by the endemic as well as the activities of the Japanese gardens it wasn 't my concern and the uncertainty when undergoing forward my view on this one here is yes we should them took them succeed to a request to at least have some place it would be subject to obviously distance this is my recommendation says it would have to down pub we 're going to be public nice and public exhibition to be probably the right you know we think that then it would be a last port of call let 's say I would be looking at this it should be this should be supported it 's a very significant cultural establishment within the care community but it 's a wider significance as far as the care to pain and the Australia to pain relationship is concerned it should be supported on a regular basis by state and federal governments and that 's what birds approach would be this is really about emergency fund it all other as well in this very difficult time so but again I can mend it all of the recommendations of the delivery play in the budget I need to play for the next ten years and for to the council I hope it is supported and the wider community do understand being 10 thank you to just taking the oysters big at all just very love the second it I completely agree with counsel and Miller 's comments and the only thing that I would like to a lot to every iterate is that I 'd like to see that we are that we 're going to be continued to look after our Cara community and our the instead foods and that they and that we get that message across to them that they know that I get I get Mandy shamrocks presentation tonight but part of me said she doesn 't actually understand that we are going to not live we are going to help them out in these forgotten thank you Thank You counsel nerds I think that 's been the constant theme and I think calculability might touch that when he sums up possibly across all of us in terms of council evolved yes mr. mayor and I 'd like to just comment on water and the fact that we did receive one written letter one letter aside just expressing disappointment in their water pricing I 've also had quite a few verbal approaches over recent times to about it I would and 2014 council borrowed eight point six million for essential works such as the rmmm of the water treatment plant mains replacement etc and the water is doesn 't just isn 't just care it 's also some of the villages we have extensive lines running up to areas some even outside our so our which we have under a an arrangement with central favor lands I gather and would also be with the state government we would have to maintain those lines this five million four hundred thirty-seven sales are still owing on those loans the interest and principal have to be paid I 'm also mindful of the fact that the state government requirements I 'm sure counselors are two of the 7525 best practices guidelines that we have to adhere to so I do urge people to consider these things when they do complain about the cost of water in that we have a a we have an obligation as a council to make sure that we have an adequate and safe water supply for our for our residents and I think that some of the comments the fact that everything cut everything costs money to provide Thank You councillor wife any further comments Will Smith Council Spence was first council of bedrock that 'll come to you Thank You mr. mee we 've we 've talked quite a bit about in this debate in an earlier debate about Civic Center fees and charges both councillor miller and councillor Walsh have alluded to the fact that what we are hopefully voting to adopt here is a very wide-ranging one-year operational plan and sorry a very wide-ranging financial plan that goes in fact 10 years into the future it 's it has been always in my term on council a very delicate balancing act that council performs between fiscal responsibility and council 's desire to look after all the ratepayers of the shire all the iconic institutions of the Shire and all the community groups of the shire that contributes so much to our amenity and well-being and I include there the villages so for council this code pandemic has only made that financial balancing act even more difficult and and one that we really had to think when he congratulated the staff we have worked on it I think that everyone who is listening tonight and everyone who has read any part of these documents needs to be aware that council is committed to looking after them as best they can within the limits of the money that we get from our rates and charges and our grants and I certainly commend these documents to everyone as very fiscally responsible but also as the top point for in terms of providing emergency funding on request to the Japanese garden shows the the document of a council that is responsible and these concerned about their records Thank You councillor further college council a better right you were yes mr. chairman I comment on item three and four first I support the the provision of money to the that if needed under emergency funding for the Japanese gardens did you do the co-ed 19 pen endemic they be provided into the budget I note that we 've been directed to not charge interest on overdue rates for the ensuing six months July to December and I also note as ye South Wales to have that decision reversed yes that that 'd be one but on a second on the second point or Plan B may be that the state government pick up the forty thousand dollar bill or whatever that we after that we forego and not charge in interest because they 've been funding a lot of other organizations with different Kobe Kobe things and I think it 's a bit tough on us to be asked to carry this loss of this loss without any without any compensation item to thought long and hard about this and I floated what I do that I wouldn 't that I would move an amendment to not to pass this with the exclusion of the Civic Council the Civic Center fees and budget and I 've received negative comment that the mayor in debt in the indicated he would not edit entertain a deferral councillor Smith said she didn 't think of the deferred we can we can work it out afterwards I had a meeting with the director this morning and to discuss these charges and it was a learned a lot of things and but just the terminology in the fees it says that the Civic Center will will manage the tickets and the canteen but I 've also been told that all all the fees for the Civic Center are up for negotiation now it can 't_''_4974.579 be negotiated but if we 're not going to charge what 's there it 's going to come back to council to be approved so the the many of treatments are going to have any flexibility and he 's charging and he 's gonna have to wait for a once them once a month meeting due at minimal to get approval to charge less so therefore and also yes I 've slipped up and I didn 't follow it early enough and what pricked me is was when the mayor mentioned last week if the information meaning that about the bar and that that where we 're going to run the bar and he said that might upset fundraising by different groups and that 's when I went and had a look at things and seeing that we 've gone page we got eight pages now and if it 's professional to charge a day rate for the hire of the building then charge 30 extra for a for the lectern and 20 for a microphone and so many dollars for each like you switch on in the spotlight situation it 's it becomes complicated and most of the charges I think of if not all the charges in our budget besides the Civic Center as increased by the CPI index that these charges have increases nearly 100% and so it 's a lot more than what we normally increase them so and I know these won 't be put up in seriatim so I 'll have to vote against the whole thing until we work out the Civic Center charges because all we 've heard from the Civic Center proposed Civic Center management is how much money they want to spend to get it going but they haven 't given us any indication on what money they get they can attract through various shows how many seats they need to break even and I would have thought that would not something to hold them to but it gives us an idea if we spend all this money charge these fees how much money will come back in to help with the running of the of the show of the show there 's no income in the budget lines of the Civic Center so thank you any further comments I 'm going to make a couple of comments and I 'll just leave completely out of the conversation that the comments that I may know had with my colleagues directly indirectly I 'll leave that for another day another forum but look there should be cheddar please is one issue we know that I think that 's been made very clear to more council military including welcome to the modern oversee the dishes are multi-million dollar budget each about going forward with councils operation raising revenue doing work for our community on the ground there 's a lot of work being done and we need to make sure we acknowledge that council Millard rightly acknowledging the contribution of staff and a hard work that they put into this budget and operational plan as well counselors have been involved with this for a long time in terms of setting their budget in terms of vision charge it 's across the landscape not just one particular issue so there are a whole lot of areas where that come from there 's been a lot of and councillors senior staff spent a lot of time resolving and working our way through them it 's a responsible budget we know where we are financially I have every confidence to start with deliberate councils will continue the monitor on a very regular basis across the board landscape that the budget as I said it 's a multi-million dollar budgets not just one budget there one issue in regards the Japanese gardens I think the council 's from that sport on Molly should I represent Kara trial counsel on that board which doesn 't give me the pecuniary interest even you probably had a keen interest but I would just acknowledge that that commerce the council mermaid is that we are lobbying hard to get the federal state government work with us and any access to dialect application specifically not just it 's sitting there so we will we will use it a lot of work that has gone into this and a lot of conversations or discussions it is a good budget who does represent a community it does cover a whole range of activities in the country like that one day what they 're giving all that forces are myriad activities Kevin Knight and has made it a little bit more difficulty I would discuss on one thing with water and sewer I know that we are waking on deep I about for the industry industry environment to give us a tick off to actually go ahead with our integrated water cycle management plan now that 's the key component that we have to complete difficulty setting that kicked off to go to a consultant to actually give us a really good deep view of our long-term strategic planning for our water and sewer and that would include being able to go to a community and say this is where the reserves and the funding designed to go and also give us a really they fit with what we need to do to continue to buy the sewer and water services within it within our Shire and this council the Royals play their outside outside as well for water so we 're really really hamstrung to some extent by by not providing that feedback them that that feedback to us but with that I commend this to you colleagues a lot of work on into a lot of work still to go hopefully a short credit on the first of July we can not hand it over but we can pass it on for the next year in terms of of the way forward in terms of an operational playing delivery plan and budget so the comments please I will ask councilman Miller to assure a red light Thank You mr. mayor and thank you for the comments that you have made and clarified in some areas I 'm just going to close by just making one very clear point made it earlier and some of the other speakers have supported it as well including yourself local users of the Civic Center will be possibly can it will be ample opportunity there for them to raise their particular issues 11 sympathetic ear times councils concerned which is in line with what we 've done as I said cert in the last 30 years of lives that won 't change the opportunities one will certainly be there as far as fundraising activities are concerned and board this is about trying to put this a very important facility council facility community facility I 'm a much more commercial putting as far as the users are concerned we try and bring in or a variety of activities that fit well with the with the community activities so I would encourage everybody to hear that message aloud and don 't remember budget the delivery point agreement and everything else is senseless Thank You councillor Miller with that I will put the resolution all those in favor please my student my food colleagues all those in favor against I declare that I get clear carried much much I want to probably I didn 't take the counter would essentially supporting and I mean that that 's not as mayor 't have the right to there if anybody what they should or shouldn 't do and I 'm sure the council didn 't like all my colleagues would tell me very quickly where to go or what to do is influence I can and cannot do in the council chamber outside of throwing the maybe just for reading the your email I 'm not really careful you okay to say what I said council I would not very clear distinction they 're very deliberately stance amendment before it can be asked for second the mayor 's got to accept the amendment before he can ask for a seconder but I didn 't say I wouldn 't accept it at all mr. chair can I suggest that this is this is not a dividing forum as far as thank you for surgery so this is about running a meeting Thank You councillor Miller oh yeah except that we now move to the director Romney will services item number one blame you I 'm happy to move of your team if we cancel the memo checking account for a while I do report as well and I agree with some of off languages through this this is it this is an exciting project well it 's exciting as an addition to what is anticipated as far as so community art works the concern to Miriam you mind what we 're committed to as far as a sculpture open and other activities aren 't concerned so but I think that there is this particular item is concerned it clearly demonstrates where the funding would come from but secondly is also I 'm encouraged to note that some of the damage that was caused with water getting under the plan all the rest of it that has been rectified this Catholic now on top of the brickwork and all the rest of it so when this mural is restored its occupies a pretty prominent place as far as one of the management isn 't super D and secondly it 's quite exciting that the the original artist is that is going to restore his guy come in this case this was just a second was just like yes I 'd like to help pleasing their desire to upgrade our Main Street and to make it an attractive place for not only the people who live here to have some pride in their Main Street but also to to encourage tourists to stop here I note also the the other possibilities that may arise for some public art which would only continue to improve the look of the of the the Main Street I do also want to congratulate mr. Boreas for actually going ahead and painting his building down there he adhered to some Heritage Park colors and which is fitting for that building because its history goes back roundabout to about the 1890s in fact so been a lot of occupancy occupants since then but that that building has a particular place in there our town 's history and I think to see it to see the fact that Glen Morton who did the original mural is also prepared to come back to Cairo to to redo this one I am just very excited about how it 'll look and I think it 'll be a great thing for you know traffic coming hope it doesn 't cause any accidents but and I appreciate the fact and I applaud the the director for also looking at what else may be able to be done in the main street the other thing that I would like to mention too is that I would hope the message gets round to other people who own buildings in our Main Street there are a couple that looking a little bit sad I could say so who if they if there is a a reasonable amount of history attached to the particular building they can access these heritage grants to assist in actually lifting Lee or improving the look of their buildings so I I do I do urge Council they are to accept this recommendation thank you very much counselor you had your hand up but you want to speak to something or a question first the read the resolution regards the Merial at the bottom end at number one Kendall Street you know in the when you when you read it it 's got these other activities that might happen or are going to happen with the Muriel Redevelopment why I really need the report the director might want to speak to the new that might want to might a comment but I think it 's fairly fairly clear to these just for the yes yes mr. made very clear Meerut Muriel had the wedding it 's a very clear and the second question is the center being approached by mr. Boris to my knowledge the when he owned the wall when it 's going on or would that be on those next what 's up what 's the kebab shop near the owner of the command shop or does the wall be shared between those two owners I 'm just making sure we 've asked the right owner of whatever I think it was always on that wall cross for a point of view on that I would have thought it 's on the wall if the wall facing that business through you mr. chair it 's just like a party wall they own that side of it that 's clarified you for the comment I really got ups yes I think that 's a 're going to put 5,000 towards it and the owners of the building that it 's going on decide to paint over it next week shouldn 't we look at which who has goes on that wall we 're putting 5,000 towards it I would I would think that that 's already been assessed but the director might want to comment further but my understanding would be similar to the divided offensive that we left on your side is is your side of the fence that 's my consideration of what 's going on and the property is owned by that person facing that that area does affect a lot of 08 just just on that mr. Mir if we if counsel wanted to put murals in Squire Park on the wall on targets walls do we have to approach from Target or do we just do it I think that vision would come but I 'm not expert in that field calculator I don 't know but I think that we keep that out of courtesy we would we were in that cage talk to our community and also to the owner of the building at the moment I 'm not sure is talking to doing that one I 'm not going to get out there at all I will just keep moving on colleagues unless this is someone wants to further referred the debate I think that points taken and then the director might just make a note of that make a comment or email but I don 't think it changes to debate any further comments nice to meet up now the question of am I in place will this Muriel have any Perry 's order over or something to so it 's protected from future painting or is it a given does it is addictive atacama place do you used to chair um no like the other one didn 't have any heritage value it 's not got a Heritage listing it 's uh it 's it 's just simply replacing what was there thank you for the comment just the lobes yeah something 's not sitting right with me young but I also but I 'd just like to make but I I think that going along with the camp with comments made earlier I think it behooves us as a council to make the community to we have all social media that the terms we 're aware of their comments from the previous topics a lot of comments were made on social media regarding taking down this cut the mural and not not replacing it we should jump on the bandwagon and say yes we are we 're part of it we we are the ones that are putting the five years putting this donation towards it and just nip that in the bud on social media I think I think does it opportunity there 's some sort of personal issue that that it 's easy it 's for the comment Roderick why thank you mr. chairman and I 've listened to thee I suppose that and almost negativity even a couple of areas with disappointment on us a odd this is restoring something that was was damaged and so it 's quite like it does get restored and it 's really exciting that 's going to be restored and what I think it think that the comments made about some of the other public not potentially some data which does potentially impact on other properties walls the conversation wouldn 't put the advert in Markman we mentioned here one of the proposals is on the northern side of the Civic Center which we the community service I 'm doing that manage on behalf of our community and of course as far as the line way I mean we can 't again or think it would just add to the amenity of the town and we should all be in favor of doing have anything that can add to their melody to the joy of actually walking around in town but also as I highlight for visitors to that this world we should be supporting so this is complementary to us as mentioned in this report here as far as the laser as a Cadogan review panels him police say boo day as well it 'll all add to a better amenity for all of our users whether though the pedestrian or whether I mean cars or visiting a little like that so we put the resolution all those in favor again you clear carry any any supplementary plays to that motion that council investigate placing an order on this Muriel for future protection or the second uh yeah I 'll second it okay counselor lives you suspect there cancel and I cancel it right well the reason I asked I asked this at some the regional owner of the building he had to replace it because the the previous one got it got weather than that and and we 're making contribution of five thousand dollars to to replace what was there so we must have thought it had some benefit to the to the community to have a mural lab and council walls said it it 's been painted the build has been painted in heritage things so it 's in and the Heritage Area and I would have thought if we do this it will maintain that area for this mural thank you and actually council and I think the director wants to make a comment drew used to chair that building is not Heritage listed a heritage order lasts for we have the owner 's consent to lease out as a heritage item you can 't do it and that building is not a heritage item right having conservative you can I 've clarification there mister mister mayor of which building the is it the Australia your honor miss mister viruses building other or the building that the that also chairs the wall building is not Heritage listed but the other building is but parentage itself is voluntary so it 's kind of Heritage listed by being on that building but we can 't_''_6311.45 Heritage listed as an individual we don 't own it and mr. Horace owns it so it 's a little tricky I think having heard that counselor right it might be easiest if you are prepared to withdraw withdraw your motion and we can deal with it you know in the information may need to discuss it further to come up with what we can and cannot do legally and what we can cannot enforce if you well I was yeah I did say investigate the type of orders and I did so I suppose if happy or that you 're happy that we your motion now is that we discussed that matter we discussed that matter of Heritage listing at the information meeting well Harrods or other listings possible listings we could have to protect the community painting well that 's that 's a big word put into motion council nope you happy together with taken to other words I 'm gonna rule the whole thing out of order yes I 'm yeah I 'm happy to go happy to go I 'm not sure news anywhere should be against the motion Oh mr. Chairman I was I was certainly able to speak against the motion its original for but I think there is there 's no harm in getting some information and now we 're speaking against it either if we don 't need others but I don 't cancel all right that 's right thank you thank you I 'll put the resolution house in favor all right interests would be clear carry any other matters of notices of motion though conditions if that 's the case I will then take a motion with law it 's in our deck the following I 've got a number to get through college so they wouldn 't lose item number one is from the general committee recommendations in close counsel is 10 to 14 2020 the upgrade of the sports field lighting in West Carrick the ocean ground and the reason is commercial information the confidential nature that would if disclosed prejudice the commercial position of the person who supplied a second item is the general manager in close counsel or subject is very V estate again it 's under 10 a to see the Act be any information that would have disclosed commercially confer confer a commercial advantage on the person who with them counsel is conducting or proposal to conduct business either number three new report from the retrospective operations and that can a to the one of the act the subject is attend a high-level reservoir chlorine dose from ten to eleven twenty twenty and the reason commercial information to the confidential nature that would if disclosed prejudice the commercial musician of the person 's business plighted and the fourth one is act from the director Environmental Services in the separately writes concrete buzzer very limited the recent advice concerning mitigation or advice that would otherwise be released from the production of legal proceedings on the grounds that my mr. tunic councilmember ii employees thank you i put the resolution all those in favor be clear if carried gets a second colleague while we go out of the zoom meeting _"

    "text": "fingers he was he raising his finger to wag your finger at me for what i 've said or is he that no mr chairman i was just trying to attract your attention when you because i suspected you would ask that question um there 's just a couple of questions i would like to make but just a general comment to start with and and i read these this report and there 's it 's quite extensive and it 's very informative but can i say without appearing to be too negative that i think the attention to detail in the report writing itself is pretty ordinary there 's some really sloppy writing in it that sort of does it loses the context in some areas just just by no obviously no one 's been proofreading this stuff or whatever well that 's how it appears so that 's a general comment and perhaps one that you might pass on if you whether you agree with that or not but i think that that 's for what it is that 's that 's that comment i have do two project which is on page 12 and there 's a comment in there about um sort of there 'll be there 'll be a report on in due course or something from the um the general managers advisory commission uh committee on on some of the proposed projects or or whatever or the scopes or whatever and it 's a sort of railway line that it 'll be reported on in due course well i just wonder what that actually means is is there no timelines for that to request that the general manager 's advisory committee actually do report in a in a timely manner and put some timelines on it that 's the first one but i think the second one and it 's in the minutes is quite important one and it 's about the comment that around the um the dual height dual the duplication of the the radar the blue mountains or the access over the mountains and i just wonder if am i am i being sort of a bit um i suppose being used to politicians over the years and all the rest abandoned the expressway over the mountains and is this a way of sort of pushing that to one side or what what does that actually mean because it actually just says that the the minister was seeking the jo 's rep support for a duplication of an access over the mountains that worries me that terminology worries me so they 're the two comments i 'd like to make and perhaps whether you feel able to answer those at this stage or take them on notice over to you can i hear you bill of course you can 't because i 've muted um in in terms of the the just the structure and the the lack of atd if you like that 's something i 'll take on notice and make sure i read them more thoroughly as well um but make sure because there 's a fairly short time frame and trying to get these out to all the councils to get the councils informed as you 'd appreciate so i think that 's a valid point in regards the energy the general manager may wish to try as far as the bells line on the road is concerned or the corridor is concerned um as i think i 've made indications in the chamber over the past couple of years the the government really has gone cold on the bells liner expressway um and they 're pouring all their energy into the great western highway now what the jo has said is that the the the the bells corridor is still very much on our mind but it doesn 't read that way and perhaps if something needs to be picked up um and there are still conversations going with with the councils on the western side of of of of sydney if you like the the eastern side of this government around getting their support it 's been difficult in some reasons to get them to come on board i think the blue blue mountains council themselves which as you know was someone where a group that were a little bit hesitant about having any sort of corridor through their through their pristine area are now changing your mind a bit and probably wishing they had rose group 35 you built i 'm being flippant 35 years ago but it 's 30 years ago so the fact that we 're getting no traction is i can understand understand your frustration but i think that where the jail is going is that the great western highway duplication is on is on the agenda they 're trying to make it happen it doesn 't mean that the just walked away from the bells line lebel 's corridor but the great western highway is on the agenda and they 're doing it so we 're quite happy to say well at least something 's happening but there 's a lot of mysteries there is a lot of a lot of objections still um coming out of the the blue mountains and the government was very much very strongly i think persuaded by um the um the reporter i forget their name now uh as the two retired army personnel who were reporting directly to vladimir checklin and to john baralaro prior to the last election and they were all very adamant that he should be euro western highway so chairman with all due respect though and we 're all on record here as saying that there 's there needs to be huge expenditure on the great western highway and no one 's ever argued that point but to to settle now for a duplication of it is is a terrible terrible um not only a terrible decision but also a a terrible position for us to take as far as the jl is concerned in my view we shouldn 't be we shouldn 't be giving ground at all on that and governments come and go and we should be we should be continuing that fight we should not be settling for what would be a second rate system even though it would cost billions of dollars to to do it we shouldn 't allow that to happen so we should continue to fight it so um that 's my view on it and perhaps it 's i don 't know whether it should be taken back to the jo to to voice those issues i don 't know what the rest of our council think about that but support the duplication we 'll spend billions there it means that the the expressway over the mountains will never happen and because all that money will be spent on a on a what it will be a a just a duplication of it of a and access to the blue mountains and et cetera glorified we 're after a glorified shitty road yep that 's exactly what it 'll be um i 'm happy to open this up to other councils because i don 't particularly disagree with you you know that but yeah yeah council smith get your hand up [Music] thank you with regard to that i think the the bushfire situation and then the um the rainfall situation where um bills was closed for a long time showed that we need two viable roads across the blue mountains in two separate areas so i 'm i 'm certainly in favor of continuing to push for the bills which is i think still an important highway to be upgraded as well council federal yes mr chairman um i support what council smith just said the um we do we need another good road to to keep the system going and in recent time we 've seen what 's happened with the bells liner road that and it needs to be upgraded and with the great western highway it appears they 're only going to try and fix the bottleneck from lithgow to will hart lead up to black heath and there 's still a hell of a lot of trouble from there on and in my limited planning vision the bells line of highway provides more opportunity to to put in a dual line road because there 's less buildings on it there 's probably buildings where they it 's all going to cost a lot of money and we 've got a lot of rocks to shift but um god they built the first road with with minimal um machinery and we don 't seem to be able to to improve on it and um i think yeah we definitely i think the bells line away but the bell 's line what we 've been pushing for that is is definitely um needs to stay at the councillor walsh i neglected to ask you you second to the motion do you want to speak at all um look my understanding and i must admit i i have taken a fair bit of interest over the years in this and um been quite passionate about a far safe crossing of the heart of the blue mountains whether we go under it or over it we need a really good safe fast crossing and it 's always been that it hasn 't i 've you know in the last couple of years we 've been calling it a safe fast crossing i don 't um know when it changed to a duplicate of what we already have so um i 'm a little confused about what they 're actually proposing now because we 've always wanted um a fast expressway across the mountains and i thought we were getting that but obviously there 's been some change in discussion or i 've missed it um but my reading of it was that we were going to get you know tunnels and expressways and all sorts of things but i the communication because i can 't see where that 's why all of a sudden it 's changed i um councillor walsh is coming in i don 't i think that 's why the report 's written i don 't think that the joint organization has walked away from the doors line of road it hasn 't just not the prior priority of the government at the moment but um you 'd reckon after 13 kilos of reports would be some action but maybe um if there is a suggestion that maybe after this resolution is put that we might have a supplementary which indicates this council encourages the joint organisation to continue to pursue the the the um the need for a corridor on the on the bills line away if you want to put the put a speaker correct on but but to pursue strongly the um continued lobbying for the belles line expressway as a supplementary and then right for the jr point of view and that will give us an argument then to go back to the joint organisation and say hey there 's concern that make sure it doesn 't mr chairman i i don 't think that goes far enough to be honest with you i think we should be going back to the jail telling them that we don 't support the duplication of the great western highway at all that our preference has has been as we 've all talked about here again today is the a good site fast crossing of the mountains bell 's line in some form or other we 're not dictating how it 'll be but in some form or other if as i said so if we go back to them and sort of have a bob each way which says yeah we haven 't forgotten about but we 're happy to support this this ludicrous idea that 's now being pushed by the minister from when i don 't know for a duplication of the great western highway as i say the the the best the best route and the and the the safest route for all of us west of the mountains is a a second route as we 've indicated and as you involved in this for 30 years and in all of that time there 's been a bit of sort of back passing and all sorts of reasons for not doing it and all the rest of it and then the focus on the on the great western highway that 's fine and i absolutely support the upgrading of the great western highway it needed it and it needs to be completed but it doesn 't need to be doubled it does need to be duplicated and that 's what that and that 's the very clear message we should be giving to our jo we 're a member of and a clear message to the government we don 't support the duplication of full stop now i might be able to step with with the rest of you i don 't know and if that 's the case um um you know i 'm a big boy and i 'll wear that but i think it 'll be a really bad decision if we if we go to water on not exp not supporting the expressway as our number one now into the future down you for the comments yes councillor walsh yes this is this bit the attorney council of warship nice i support a lot of what councilman miller 's had to say simply because uh as we 've discussed as he 's mentioned uh it 's always been intended from our point of view that the only agreeable route across the mountains to the people on this western side has been a new expressway roughly following the bell 's line of road um there 's no pointless trying to run a road through or trying to go under or over or whatever all the built up areas on those blue mountains and of course once you get to the bottom um you know somewhere along the line there 's going to be a real trap there around penrith and all those other areas now that are building up um the the road will never ever cope with what 's what 's uh happening there the other thing i just wanted to point out is that the energy project on page 12 which council miller originally mentioned to aware of the any funding that might be available for eb uh charging um there are now 12 vehicles 12 brands of vehicles available in australia now that are electric so they cut the customers the the people are now getting a a real choice of electric cars their prices are coming down and uh i think um we 're running the risk of missing out on the traffic that can come this way because of that the uh i know there 's a charge station over in the park the car park just opposite the visitor center but that is only for the um one variety of vehicle that 'll only fit in one variety of vehicles as far as i know the nrma charges as far as i know they will fit with or the nozzle will go into any other variety of vehicle and i 'm also aware that in some of the bigger country towns even some of the motels are talking about putting these in now if they if they have them and we don 't we we could easily miss out on a lot we have a we have a charge of the at the moment that are still in the car park at the at the gallery and uh i don 't know how many people have been in there to charge up i 'd love to know because i don 't think it 'd be very many um and i i i know the general manager has admitted that you know if we can get the um a car park planned for the japanese gardens done that we could look at perhaps moving that up there and i think that would be a uh terrific result if that happened i i i 've been fairly learning at council awash that 's a good a good plate but i think that the the the council staff will be aware of the energy projects and what we might be doing and i think no one disagrees with with the need for for ev stations um any further comments councillor smith put your hand up a couple of questions if i may um on a slightly different topic uh first one can you just remind referred to a few times in the report general manager integrated planning and reporting thank you and then a question about uh actions on page 20 of the ipad to do with [Music] renewable energy and there are two of them firstly kabon to write formally about barriers to development of their vision for solar energy production i 'm just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about that and the second one that jo reps are going to meet with the minister 's representatives regarding procuring electricity and seeking support to enable councils to engage in renewable energy so are you able to explain what those two are referring to not the top of my head i can take it on advice and i said gentleman and you just have to go to it mr chairman my recollection is the the uh of the same issue cabana and i think a couple of other councils in the region certainly combine are looking at establishing and having a joint venture arrangement or some sort of commercial arrangement to establish a solar farm and that was around council being of energy as well thank you so just if i may does that mean that currently councils are not able to do that that 's correct thank you and that 's part of the conversation okay council alright yeah thanks mr um thanks mayor um it 's not in this report i couldn 't see it in this report but on the abc news today i think it was the state government 's picked three sites one at lithgow one at yes i think and one possibly at parks to put in a um sounds like those incinerators they talked about 30 years ago to burn the city rubbish um it seems to have come back out of the blue and um i think well it was a long time ago because um george freudenstein was a member and he told me the meeting one night that we got to go out past west wyalong to put these things because it 's the only place where they can read the air if it 's being polluted because anywhere closer to the city that is more polluted and what the what rude but this is what it 's part of being being tested and it sounded like it was going to be a digester type machine to make power and and so forth it 's just interesting it 's come up so quick and whether the jo can pick up on something on that but in future um but my other question is could you give me a ruling on on whether councillor miller has spoken against the resolution because part two of the resolution says that we write a letter to support the upgrades but i on do we need to um to the highway there so would we need another amendment to that to say council miller hasn 't has the council member just spoken in general he hasn 't moved any anything anything formally or informally and counselor miller is probably as well versed in council procedures as as any of this if not more so in regards in regards to your um in regards to your question about the waste disposal um that was abc news this morning it hasn 't been discussed anywhere else but i a conversation about waste disposal out in the region some 15 years ago and quite right george team i 'll be in part of it 30 years ago so there 's nothing as far as i know of that 's been flagged as part of the joint organization regional or in proximity to us and the same abc news i heard this morning was taking the gold and have been taken off the agenda anyway so um you know i that 's that 's when i can 't really comment on it certainly well and truly outside the outside the scope of this report it isn 't um if i may it isn 't lithgow part of the jail area but they decided not to join way back and want to be part of the blue mountains well if i may mr chairman um and reply to my question about speaking for and against um can i add to uh can i move an amendment to add to number two [Music] and that 's the after katoomba but this is at no expense but this is not in instead of so what you want you want to move an amendment that get added but that gets added to the letter like we can support if that 's being done or i 'm just testing the ground because yeah i know what you 're doing i 'm not you 're doing um and that 's you you 're flagging that as an amendment and not wait for someone if someone wants to check on the amendment mr chairman or suggest something different or suggest something different thank you just a clarification i 'm not speaking against the motion but i read the comments that i made but i 've indicated that i will move a motion after this has passed because i don 't certainly don 't have a problem with supporting the upgrade of the great western highway i said that a number of times again tonight so that 's that 's in keeping with my philosophy but i certainly have a problem with the second the comment that 's in the report about duplication which will which i understand we 'll be able to deal with with a supplementary didn 't hear that bit that you 're going to do something just let it go the offer was the offer was put to him fairly quickly i think so um so you 're going to be draw counsellor yeah i withdraw thank you any other any other commentary around the mayoral minute i 'm not going to worry about my writer reply but happy to talk to my colleagues offline if you have any further questions i 'll put the resolution those in favor against declaration councilmen [Music] and i 'm hoping that the general manager did take some notes here but it 's in essence it is that that we inform the jo that carrot council does not support the duplication of the great western highway that our objective remains the a new route over the mountains and in in vicinity of the earlier identified route of the bell 's line of road or something for those that that effect i mean the general manager will make sense of that i 'm sure but um doesn 't support the duplication and memory and remains steadfast in the belief our number one priority so there absolutely you got that mr general manager or something around those words yes mr chairman so i want to second that yeah councilor wright council military adding order out or you think you 've mr chairman i think everybody 's sick of me now anyway so i think i 've said all i can need to say at the moment so but as you 've all gathered i 've been involved in this for a long time i 'm passionate about it we deserve a decent root over the blue bounds we deserve it we need it and we shouldn 't go away from that point do anybody else which speak oh just a second that um i don 't think we 're sick of hearing bruce 's comments about the highway a few other things we might get carried away with um now this is um like like he 's like it 's been said there 's been a lot of people put a lot of effort into this if a former member uh our former local member in armstrong led the committee 'm looking for a um another memorial for him or anything but it 's the road that has got less build up on it and with new building things we should be able to get a better either dual lane if possible across there for easier um easier um crossing of the mountains and which which we need and um if they took half the signposts away it 'd be easier for a start every time you can get a bit of straight road then they put another sign but it it 's um it 's all been dumbed down and and we need a better road yep for the comments yeah i 'd like to just say i support the promotion and uh because i really do believe that they think a few passing lines attack lanes tacked onto the bell line of road is sufficient and might shut us all up any further comment i 'd just like to comment that they 'll all be coming over our way to across the mountains so they 'll want to look right they 'll all want to road safe road getting out of lockdown any further comments just go for the comments the only i 'm not going to make a comment on just i 'll talk to you probably all um at some stage rather um and get more information for the jo sits on this to clarify any issues i think the one we want to be careful also this council we need to make sure that we continue to pursue the not part of this motion i 'm not going to extend the debate but we need to be strongly pursuing the upgrade of lachlan valley way as well to open that corridor into the southern area of um southern area of sydney and canberra and i think it 's probably from this council perspective i think more chance of getting funds spent on the local valley away perhaps in the short term than on the great on the on the bells corridor not the bells corridor it 's not important i 'm not suggesting that any further comments write a reply the only comment i 'd make mr chairman is you and i can probably have i think that there 's only that sure i 'd reply won 't comment i 'll put the resolution i was in favor all right against against carrick i think councilman there 's only you and i in the room that have been involved this for the last 30 years in some form or other and family members going back to day one within armstrong so yeah it 's it 's just it 's around infrastructure in rural and regional areas so it 's not just it 's a it 's a really a thin edge of a wedge to be quite frank and why in glendale is no different it 's just this the need for decent infrastructure and access uh item number one from the general manager we 've got three first item colleagues we 've done well item number item number one was the general from the general managers which is reporting the local government elections and there 's a recommendation there which is just endorsing the general manager as a mayor and deputy mayor and deputy mayor and deputy mayor to be the um delegates voting thank you any further comments on this i 've already read the report no comments i put the resolution i was in favor again declare it carried we go now to page 37 which is investments from the director of corporate services and there 's a recommendation there to note the financial report for august so i 'm happy to move that councilor smith thank you i heard a yep somewhere is that yeah me ruth thank you councillor fagan second out any comments or questions wish to speak no mr mayor i think it 's all obvious and it looks like we 're doing well with our collection of rates is that a rhetorical question or no question at all it was a comment doing well i thought the director might have used the opportunity to come in and say how well they 're going actually i noticed that that period everything it does there is rates coming at that time every year so whether that 's part of the electoral part of the electoral part of the the rate collection cycle i 'm not sure the general manager any for the comments no further comments i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against declare it carried item number two from the director of corporate services which is in regards to the eric meeting the three dot points of recommendation um i 'm on the committee i 'm happy to move that if i get a second done at least at least a minute i got a second okay second counselor that 's good cancer walsh thank you um three dot points there colleagues i don 't think i need to speak to it because the the um draft minutes are there in their draft um but the two salient points are the point two and dot point three dot point two is the decision to look at the noting the report from the chair which he has to provide every year which is a good concise report i know you would have all read that and the recommendation that the charter the audit risk improvement committee charter which has to be reviewed every certain periods and that the committee recommends to be no charges no changes explanation i 'm quite happy to to answer questions if anybody has questions i have a question yep um page 52 at the top mr jones advised the 20 desktop computers were passed their years by date and urgently need replacing the data computers are hampering software program rollouts um do all the computers have to be linked together so that they 've all got to be bought in the one year and the one time etc or is there a steady roll out over a period of years so that you know you might you might get five one year and another five the next year through the chair i 'm happy to uh take that question um so no the short answer is uh no we have roughly about 160 devices um we 've currently been going through and auditing all those devices and what 's been determined is that there 's roughly 40 devices that urgently need an upgrade we haven 't_''_1987.279 spent any money on upgrading of devices for quite some time now we now have in place a plan where uh laptops and desktop devices refreshing those devices on an annual basis and uh uh to to spread the cost of that uh that investment out over a period of time well thank you for that i think that 's a sensible way of going about it rather than landing a very large sum in just one year etc yep thank you you 're on mute bill any further comments from the eric meeting just one other question uh on somewhere there it mentions the central new south wales joe scoping document was the scoping document i didn 't write the page down it 's on correct do you want to try and answer that one or take it on advice it rings the bell it rings the bell but it can 't be specific counselor walsh the director mike or the general manager through the the chair was it in relation to the uh cyber security audit tesla walsh i can 't tell you stupid enough i didn 't write the page down number down can i just interrupt it 's on page four and it is about the internal order of cyber security in on a uh a jo run program where we went in with other councils and had a an organization come and audit our cyber security uh capabilities um and that 's what that report was referring to thank you thank you any further questions comments uh just yep council are right sorry yeah just um this cyber security and everything and um the it thing is um it 's it 's risen to a level of um with the it needs to be um up-to-date and operating and um and it 's not just buying the hardware we 've got to make sure the software is up to date and um because we 're shifting to a new data recording system i think it 's called and we 've had complications because the old system wasn 't up to the to a level that there 's easy access is onto this this new system and um so it 's just it isn 't just buying the hardware we need to keep the software up and um i think anyone would know today that um for something for a business i.t network as easy as someone ripping up a bitumen road or or um or blowing up a bridge it can be just as um important to maintain the security needed to keep it operating but um so that 's why it 's sort of it 's going to be on the agenda every month but this it 's operating at the we 're operating with what we got at the moment but we 're just trying to um as i perceive as a committee member that we 're just trying to bring everything up to date thank you any further comment no further comment mr chairman the only comment i would make is we 'll never be up to date because it changes all the time we 're always playing catch up we always will be but it 's really important to be on the agenda and we need to continue to stay on top of it or try as best we can yeah thank you for the comment write a reply put the resolution all that 's in favor all right again i 'll declare it carried the 78 there 's a recommendation there in regards to the that item which is a normal housekeeping procedure councillor smith any comments on this is that his housekeeping normal procedure any comments never wish to speak at all no mr mayor i was going to say exactly what you said we 're something that we are required to do and something that we should be required to do by the state government yep okay thank you being there for the comment i 'll take it out to write a reply numbers raise their hands i 'll put the resolution on all those in favor against declare it carried item number one from the director of infrastructure operations which is the tidy towns and urban land care or tidy towns committee councilman smith will move that i 'm sure i 'm sure she 'll get a second to pretty quickly have a look at my screen yep councillor peter wright thank you um councillor smith i the only comment that i would make mr mayor is that counsellors would have noted that in one of the two sets of minutes there do to uh put forward five hundred dollars for the best in show in rafka um and that dot point three notes that that rafa competition has unfortunately had to be cancelled because we just had so many schools and daycare centres and preschools and so on who didn 't have the the kids in classes or with them and weren 't able to complete so we we do plan to have a really big competition on the same theme next year because i do know that a number of individuals and school groups have begun their um their sculptures yep thank you for the comments and i think on that last point i 'm aware that there are school groups who have started their work on sculptures this year i think councillor smith 's done excellent job in time to to find a compromise to make sure that those school students are acknowledged and rewarded and their their efforts don 't go in vain for the comments write a reply put the resolution as in favor against we 'll declare it carried item number one of the direct environmental hotel i made it and the director has muted uh moved by councillor walsh seconded by councillor miller councillor walsh used to speak thanks mr mayor the the da application largely complies there 's been hasn 't been any submissions against it and the couple of suggestions from the heritage advisor of now incorporated in the uh d.a so um i see no reason for council to refuse that any further comments or questions second he wishes to speak i 'll listen to kevin you 're the second chancellor please yeah thank you as always it 's been very well assessed and i and and as the council of walsh said it it basically complies the only comment i would make is it 'll make a very nice okay little sitting room facing north in the winter time particularly terrific to sit out there i would think as far as a residence is concerned yep um councillor walsh yep all fine sorry councillor peter wright i 'm sorry yes mr chairman i 'm looking at councillor right when i said i 'm sorry you know we do look alike but disappointing i 'm glad i 'm glad you said at times thank you keep going council all right um yeah i support the recommendation i 'd i 'm just um i rang the general manager on friday and i just i i don 't know where to really go but um it says the author is kate albright i i i i don 't i don 't that 's i think i 'll rule that out of order councillor wright if you go to concern about that you need to talk to the general manager i have spoken to millionaires yeah i know and the director has declared an interest in the matter not beginner interest in the matter um i don 't see that 's relevant to the report at all right i think i just it 's only just transparency from the rest of the public uh um i think not questioning the professionality or anything but it 's just um i think i think it 's a complicated area i 'm sorry by putting it out in the open forum you probably are doing that that 's there 's a way to to raise the matter with the general manager and if you did that that was the appropriate thing to be doing um i don 't think it 's appropriate raising an open forum because a certain amount of that could be construed as making a comment and as we all know conflict events are something that individuals have to manage not not any other person at all so i think we leave it at that so the comments on the da for the comments i reply not necessary i 'll put the resolution those in favor all right hi an interest thank you um go to da 71 2021 in regard to burke street and i have indicated i 'll declare an interest so i 'll take the microphone off and i 'll ask councillor smith to i won 't participate in the debate and i 'll ask councillor smith to take to chair the meeting please thank you mr mayor so uh da71 of 21 do we have a mover this is the uh side boundary fencing in the carport okay i 'll move do you wish to speak thank you um once again this seemed to be well presented and well um well uh gone through by our staff the carport in front of the existing dwelling i on a drive around there the other day i noted that there are quite a few other carports in similar position and also of various sizes so even though that is would require approval by council because the two does not meet the dcp the other thing which also um was mentioned again tonight was the fence height and um in actual fact i had thought that it was probably just on the look there it looked as if it would you know more likely to prevent an intrusion by neighborhood noise and uh well the the proponent of the d.a suggested uh his lights might shine in there well i agree that probably isn 't a major thing but um the um objections seem to have been taken into account in the summary of the da by our staff and um i just note also that the surveyors report as has been mentioned earlier the side of that carport and the post of it were not actually over the boundary thank you just a second to wish to speak thank you deputy chair um i think again this has been well assessed i agree with the comments made by the mover of this nation council of walsh um i also thank the speaker at open forum for the constructive way and the manner in which he presented his uh his concerns and i think that it was it was well presented and also in his acknowledgement of of the the different issues that a couple of that had been rectified and also was his willingness to to accept the assessment by our staff as far as the 1.2 is concerned so so i think all in all as council of also said i think the objections were taken into consideration by their staff and have been answered and there 's no reason in my view that we should not approve it [Music] further comments or questions there being no further comments uh write a reply not necessarily thank you i 'll put the recommendation it carried and we can invite the mayor back into his room we 're on to the next recommendation mr matt thank you thank you councillor smith that 's so we 're on to the item three which is the net zero draft net zero emissions pilot which is recommended some recommendations with that to go at the public exhibition so i want to move that or i 'll move it thanks councillor smith thank you i 'll second it councillor peter wright thank you you speak councillor smith yes mr mayor um we 've been working with these people for some time and we had a couple of very productive sessions with them and i think that their report and their roadmap and so on are excellent it 's i think a very important thing that we continue to engage in and continue to progress i would like to see us discussing at a later stage a bit more of a detailed and personal roadmap for this council and future councils and how the reporting is going to be done on our progress on costings and all that sort and uh very well reported on secondary speak yes thank you mr chairman um um this uh net zero by 2050 and that is um can 't_''_2948.319 be seen by some as a feel-good thing but um but it 's also necessary to um preserve our existing businesses and um and make and meet community expectations and i 'm good to see that it 's got that inclusion in in business as usual scenario because we 've still got to do what we 've got to do but we 've got to use the technology and and whatever is available to lower our emissions um output not just for the for the good of the climate but but for good of the budget and um because if this is going to happen these these carbon things is and all our carbon generating inputs will theoretically should become more expensive so we gotta look to alternatives or how we use what we do use in a better way and um because as in the uh in the last um session we had with the consultants most of our council operations can that 's it 's going to be difficult to handle is our waste is in our waste facility business so the collection and handling of waste and um and the carbon generated out of the um out of the tip site the um the landfill and um i think that 's where we 've got to get the community on board where this recycling is going to be more necessary but also through through the jo and other organizations the state organizations that suppliers are going to have to look at better packaging and so forth to help us reduce this waste but i think it 's a good thing going forward the net zero worries me a bit because some people if you don 't do it you can just buy carbon credits and that scenario worries me more is that they 're just creating a business for people to sell these carbon credits and they can be all over the world and we 've got no way of tracking them and um i think i 'll leave it at that and i 'll let and i look forward for the comment yes i 'd like to watch i 'd like to comment uh there are five attachments uh there which are easy to read and understand so when this goes on public exhibition i do urge the community to read it and to please provide comment on it i 'd love to know what more of our community feel about something like this because we all know there are those who are very very much in favor of of trying to take measures to reduce the effect of climate change we also know there are those few that are rapidly against it so if we could get some idea from our community just what they think uh i think that would be wonderful to have before it eventually comes back to council to uh for a council approval what we might also do thank you thank you councillor fagin for laughing at me um you almost went a little i want a little bell on those you want to speak councillor fagan are you just reminding me today could i just uh raise um say one thing um 's using it and it 's been around for the last 10 years 15 years and i think this is a terrific um example of what we can do as a community to take some action and do it with some sort of efficiency and also without hurting anybody so i think it 's a really good start and i i i 'd also endorse council walsh 's um suggestion that people getting people actually look at it and see if they can come up with any other ideas that we might like to use but i do think that this is a great start for our active suggestion about changing the climate thank you thank you um i might just ask if the general manager of the director will actually comment on where this fits with the energy energy renewable program we adopted for council not that long ago mr chairman i 'm certainly happy to make a comment that uh yeah this is very much a council and where it sits in the community in a community uh plan i suppose council did adopt councils will recall in energy efficiency and renewable energy plan and that 's certainly the roadmap i 'm using in terms of the operations of council as an organisation and you 'd also be aware council adopted uh the installation of solar panels at our water treatment plant and sewer treatment plant which are the two short term two of the short-term projects out of that renewable energy plan so they 're in this year 's budget so uh they 'll be they 'll be delivered by director of infrastructure operations and his team um so in terms of a road map for what the council is doing in terms of our integrating into our business that 's that 's certainly what we 're doing you 'd also recall council in may of this year uh with the the council 's procurement as part of the joint organization of electricity in in over the next 12 months council 's committed to a minimum of 50 of that load being been sourced from a renewable energy provided the contract prices are on a par with existing power prices so there 's already some significant steps councils in the debate tonight integrate integrate the the real but energy plan and options into into our business as usual approach thank you thank you general manager any further comments on that i think that might be clarified some of the where this sits where their documents both sit now for the comments write reply yes briefly firstly in response to something that councillor wright said about um carbon sequestration if i recall correctly the uh second session that we had with the authors of the report said that nowhere will be able to achieve net zero without carbon sequestration so that 's something that we 'll need to look at down the track and it 's something that we 'll perhaps need to or council will need to ensure that they are able to follow and control but i certainly endorse what other councillors have said about asking the community to have a good look at this and to make comments please they say that it takes a community to raise a child and whilst council can show leadership in this matter it certainly will take a community please ask everyone to consider the report carefully i 'll put the resolution i was in favor all right against against declare carried item item number four from the director of environmental services which is the da one two four one twenty four straight 20 20. um hartley street um give it do excuse me application for approval with conditions of consent if that 's the mind or counsel of the committee yeah councillor walsh thank you i 'll second it councillor walsh thank you mr mayor the um proposal seeks council 's approval to various of the size of the blocks in a subdivision there i note that the existing building is positioned diagonally across a rectangular block which obviously makes it extremely difficult to achieve an optimum use of the of the area for this reason i agree that with the assessment that not averaging the setback and not you know strict uh we should not average the setback and also a strict compliance with the dcp on lot size is unnecessary and unreasonable and does not create any adverse impact and uh also there haven 't been that um council can uh um can confidently uh um approve this um a second i 'm quite happy to support this i did actually go for a drive because i was curious to see where it was what it looked like the site to me lends itself specifically to this sort of a development and um i would acknowledge the work the staff have done in preparing the the the assessment has been well assessed um any variations i think are reasonably appropriate for the comments counsel all right you 're on mute cancel the right cancel right you 're a mute mate councilor wright you 're on mute i am now i 've got i 'm just going through um i 've still got problems with the reduction in the in the lot size if the two existing ones there they 're on about 400 meter squares um and it says oh it 's only a hundred and something square meters it 's but it 's still greater than 10 and um i just don 't um i 'm still coming to terms with this with the um set a president further along down the track that this might become the norm rather than what what we feel is good um so i 'll be speaking against it at the moment thinking well now 's your chance to speak or i assume that we 're speaking against it well that was speaking against it thank you thank you any further comments not muted councillor smith so councilman will go first thank you mr chairman i i disagree with that comment about um basically we 're opening a pandora 's box if we if we we 're talking about a 10 or very close to reduction here in minimum lot size but as um all of you would be aware of i did for many many years that we knew they [Music] of lot sizes there is no doubt about that the lifestyles for many have changed dramatically over the years and the needs have changed dramatically over the years and we should be aware of that and we should make provision for that i think this has been really well assessed and i can 't see any reason i was going to say something similar so that 's fine thank you for the comment i 'll allow the movie to write a reply i was going to make other comments but i 'll let them have a lot of reply thank you um yes um i think it 's been well assessed but also we all need to bear in mind that um we are um living at a time where we need to try and make uh various types of housing available to people and bearing in mind also uh that we um do have um considerable financial pressure on a lot of people so i think uh we 're uh this enables three three flats or three units to be near together there but that uh and uh really it wouldn 't be any different except that if the third third flat was actually tied to the other two everything would be okay so um um it 's uh i i can 't see any problem with it i 'll put the resolution of those in favor all right all right against declare carried and councillor number five from the director of uh environmental services which is the civic squared redevelopment plan um which is a plan to go out of the exhibition sorry i 'll move it please yes you can councillor smith councillor second councilman thank you mr chairman can i firstly acknowledge the wonderful work that has been done by kate and the team as far as this is concerned i think this is an absolutely terrific report it does reflect that a whole lot of work that 's that 's gone on for a long time to this stage by a lot of people so well it 's really important now that we do put it out on public exhibition which is the next first of the next steps of course 42 days so that we again seek the uh the comments and the and hopefully the commitment from our community is to the development of the civic square and uh to make it more user-friendly and and certainly uh enable us to um with that being user-friendly being able to utilize that space much much better than it is at the issues that we do have as far as drainage that is concerned as well so so that 's the first point the second point i think is that is that this is the first step there are a lot of other parts to this afterwards we would welcome the feedback from our community as far as this is concerned but then of course we need to go through as is clearly indicated in the report um the issues around engineering and and traffic and and and all of the rest of it that 's there you know the the drainage issues that i 've talked about except for so i think that there 's a lot of work still to go as far as this is concerned but the very important next stage is is to get our feedback from our community so that we know that they are on side with what councils think i guess at the moment council of strength thank you i 'd also like to commend the many many representatives of all the user bodies the various user bodies who have participated in a number and ideas and feedback already so i think without without then this plan would be lacking a lot of the really good elements that it does have and so the next step now is to put it out to the whole of the community who haven 't had the opportunity to have their say so and i hope we get lots more really interesting ideas and comments further comments council smith councillor peter wright it all looks very good and i i look forward to feedback um and it did say that the next step is to cost it after the feedback and so forth for um how we 're going to finance it but just looking at it with my eyes it 's sort of going to be very level which is very good but has there been any figures done before now what the what the cost of leveling that site is and uh because we did discuss it once before and was sort of knocked on the head um so much with the amount of money it had cost to um level the site i i wasn aside the general manager has gone gone off mute that i would have thought those sort of questions would be answered in the any sort of further engineering if once we get a design sorted in some way or other does that make sense to the senior staff i got that right the director of nodding adrenal manager is nodding that answer your question council all right mr chairman it will still have different levels of it yeah if you look at the plans there is certainly it 's not going to be a level site flat across one side of the road to the other there is various levels incorporated in it if you have a look at the plans it clearly shows that yeah and there is a indicative costing in there as well just for clarification yeah thank you councillor right yeah i 'll i 'll just councillor walsh i can see your hand counselor watch let me get cancelled right finished yeah i 'll take that on board um i just don 't want to put something out there that 's that 's not going to to speak in favor of this i i agree with and some might smile and say that i agree with council miller on on on the the suggestions around uh doing some work here at him out in the civic square but he 's exactly right this is a really good report it gives the community a chance to have a look and see what the council is thinking it is somewhat visionary this council is not one that just sits down and lets things things have an idli but we do plan things and plan them well i repeat it 's a very good report very well thought out very well put together and does cover all the salient points that we need to be considering i think that what we need to make sure the community understands and both council smith and councillor miller have have raised that is not creating expectations that something or other is going to happen or take place this is a long process there is no funding for at this stage not saying there won 't be funding but there 's no funding 's a whole lot of a lot of planning that has to take place so we need to manage expectations and the expectations i think of this council at the moment are quite right that we go to the community with these this sort of uh of draft seek their feedback seek their comments and then come back with further documentation and further uh further evidence and information that needs to be put together for the community and start to look at designs it 's a long way to go but this is a tremendous step and it really reflects well upon i think the caliber and capacity of our staff and i 'd like to think some of the encouragement that the councillors have provided as well councillor walsh thanks mr mayor yes i i thoroughly agree with all the comments on the presentation of the report i think it 's a terrific document if there 's one thing that concerns me and that is the drainage particularly relating to as everyone knows the flooding of the gallery and also the galloway room and i think we need to community are aware that that will uh be taken into account before any work does happen there that at least will be work done to try and alleviate that and try and if possible uh prevent it from happening in the future thank you for the comments councillor council miller or council fagan i 'd just like to say that this has been we 've been talking about this for a very long time and it 's amazing that um and great that it 's actually come to this stage and it 's very well documented as everyone said um i also believe that we 've addressed nearly everything i i couldn 't find anything that we hadn 't talked about in the past and i think it 's a great to have a really good plan because and community consultation because that will give us really good grounding when we do apply for grant funding and i and you know i can 't stress enough how you know if we 're going to be successful in doing this it has to be well planned and i think that 's um you know the engineering and all of the other stages and bits and pieces involved will be really be good for our application for funding and i congratulate the um the yeah the staff because it 's a terrific document for the comments yeah councillor councillor walsh yeah no all right hansel on the council of sorry councillor right i 'm sorry i 'm looking at one and seeing the screens a bit the council are right yeah i think um i know i 've already had one bit of a say but i i 'm quite happy to see things change out there and but i 'm very happy that you 're saying you don 't want to build up the expectations too much and that 's what where i was getting at me before that um what we 're thinking of it will can be achievable in in a relative good time that 's all thank you i 'm not sure whether i said building expectations or managing expectations well managing whatever you said i agree with what you said managing or well if you manage expectations sorry i 'm just trying to actually agree with you yeah no i realize that thank you thank you appreciate that further comments council names you 're quite councillor miller writer reply thank you mr chairman and uh whether we 're building expectations or not i think we should be excited about this plan to be honest with you it is visionary is that term that was used by somebody it 's been really well presented at the moment and we will we welcome i hope a whole lot of input from the wider community now to take back the council then the next steps and the first one is all of you would be aware particularly councillor walsh made the point about the engineering and the drainage we 're all aware of that we know that that 's got to be fixed but it can be incorporated as part of this and that 's why this is exciting it 's i think it 's taken on board a whole lot of the different user groups and has catered really well for them to make this a a a civic stage in the future and that doesn 't mean it 's going to happen next week or next year but to make sure that we go through the proper planning process get it right so it reflects our community 's needs and wishes and then do all of the appropriate planning that does get it ready for funding applications etc sometime in the near future i hope i really do hope the near future but um but that 's for other councils we 'll make that decision down the track i 'll put the resolution all those in favor against declaration and i nearly made a quip about you had the right reply councilman or otherwise i would have said managing your expectations as well sorry um we 've actually moved to billers a little bit there 's a sort of flaggy thing in there that was discussed this afternoon don 't worry um uh yeah no no notice this emotion matters urgent business i will then take a motion to close the meeting to the public to consider in accordance with 10a the act the following um which is committee the reason is a request for what account adjustment assessment assessment number 26 triple zero uh the reason discussion in

their early past and present and apologies uh application for legal abstinence by councillors uh one from councillor kevin wright who is still unwell it 's all missing so does someone want to move out of the council and welcome council of smith i believe absolutely granted all those in favor again should we clear that carrying anonymously um reminded in accordance with the local government act 1993 council is live streaming and recording this committee meeting if i speak at this meeting you agree to be agreed to being live streamed and recorded therefore please ensure that when you speak at council meetings you are respectful to others and use appropriate language at all times and of course the character council should have no liability for any inflammatory or offensive remarks or churches made during the course of this meeting i would invite councils and staff to indicate in relation to any interest that they may need writing you declare an interest in whether the interest is pecuniary or non-pecuniary and what is the nature of that interest there is silence i 'm assuming nobody is declaring interest so we will move on to public forum and we have no one registered for the public forum we will then go to page four of the agenda which is the minutes of the previous meeting held last year on the december december 2020 services in regarding investments yes i think on page 16 on the ipad the investments portfolios and i did an indication of our times at the moment where the more recent placements of money and interest 0.43 0.35 yeah it 's only going to indicate a drop further in that much of what we have there that 's in excess of one point over the centers um coming to you again in the near future yeah that could obviously have an impact on bottom line yep that 's something always will and otherwise um rate collection seems to be um holding up reasonably well so checking well yep in the sense of as we know invest in sort of what the office of local government allow us to invest in in many respects i just wonder whether they don 't be aware of this and that everything we 've heard out of the reserve bank on the restaurant that we 're we 're looking at a long drawn-out process here maybe a number of years whether they are going to review other alternative investments that would allow us to invest in at some stage i just wonder whether that discussion has been had with anybody not to my knowledge i just wonder whether we should be at least well i i could i just add to that in that i had monday with a treasury bond might be available because the state and federal government both have an enormous sum of money borrowed now and it would be beneficial to all perhaps whether or not we could get a short enough term in that i know that we 're going to have a fear of some money and gradually but that may vary in terms anyway but i just want to make my agreement that that we 're right to our government to raise this issue about reconsidering the lending for the investment strategies and the second drop point might be that we also suggest they tell ipads that this is restricting council capacity to to to generate income when they come for the information meeting the the office of local government 's deed or because they didn 't notice on what investments are permissible for councils because certainly some of the things spoken about in here tonight are permissible we 've always taken a very very low key risk-averse approach to it so that might be informative [Music] corporate services item number two is the section 355 committee minutes to the civic centre reference group other than that thank you so much i need to know any comments or questions we are having meeting tomorrow night and um hopefully these third minutes will come to us quickly and be able to report on the activities that are happening at the city centre all the time these days very busy place i just added i i think the tone of the meeting was excellent and that night for the direction of which things were going mr mayor i was just in the foyer of the civic center with councillor wright for the youth council 's first meeting of the year and at that time i asked a question about where the youth council was going to look at continuing to run youth movie events as they have done up until last year and the answer was potentially yes that they would need to be different in some respects and jonathan llewellyn was was there because we were talking about really our biggest fundraiser in doing that is and jonathan said those sorts of things are still being worked through as to what 's permissible so perhaps that 's something that could be discussed at the meeting tomorrow night absolutely um we have had some queries about that and so i know there 's a query so that 's one of the things we haven 't quite i don 't think yeah so still quite a lot of things to discuss but it seems to be going well at this stage and as ray said we meeting and we 'll be looking to help jonathan to get him have more participants at all the activities thank you for the comment resolution i 'm against you to carry out of item number one from the director of infrastructure operations council of clay will move this in regards to the convention nature residential playground community group yes i 'd like to say to congratulate the uh playground committee on winning the committee of the year for an australia day and they 've done a great job as everyone knows we 've um had our meeting to wind it up and you the last minutes of this that meeting will be next council so um they 're very pleased with all the things they 've done and they 've given councillor report a list of things that may be happening with achievements to happen in the future that they would like to see which is a great community consultation for a future plan under the lookout and then phil and the bellevue um so they 've got they 've done very well and i congratulate them on all their an ongoing relationship with a few of these people so that we can continue to maintain and upgrade facility for the comments we 'll also note there was an email came this morning for the director that the toilet facilities up there about to be upgraded and improved as well so third time actually i 'd reply with the resolution i was in favor aye again carried over sorry one from the director of environmental services which is da 123 2020 i 'll move on shane street uh yes um the development application i think as well summed up in the conclusion from the director says that the findings of the inspections and the comments made from consultations assessed the impacts of the proposal the likely environmental interaction between the development and the environment are such the council should not refuse the development application also there has not been any uh or any uh problems voiced by any of the neighbours so i would suggest that the um the the adjustment to the frontage is minimal when you consider the other developments in that straight as well so i use that the parts of the d.a that are at odds with the uh the uh dci ecp whatever are really dictated by the shape of the block and given that it 's a cardboard that will be forwarded to the building line it 's going to have i think minimal visual impact anyway excuse me unanimously page 55. which is the nrm group i 'll get it i think everything 's clearly listed there at the the business of that meeting which i was unfortunately an apology for but um as i said if anyone has any questions i 'll either find out for them or uh or try and answer whichever i think actually i was in that one wasn 't it you were and the director was as well so yeah any comments or questions i 'd just like to say can i say that i 've really enjoyed the facebook posts from the nrm group with all those amazing photographs that they 've put up with all of the birds that was terrific and i think you know it 's been great that it 's been so been terrific so i think um that looks really quite a it 's quite an exciting way of getting people involved in natural resource management so congratulations i 'm sure the director will pass that on to staff as regarding item 2.6 the city 's power partnership what that actually is that is a partnership that council has been looking at entering into and it 's to do with um achieving a cheaper rate of power and i gather that i think bill you were at the meeting you may be able to explain if anyone else gave a better addition of that but it 's uh it 's a number of councils are getting together to get together to try and achieve a cheaper rate of power and also looking at um the solar power and wind power et cetera and what it does is provide councils with a serious a group of a series of um advice and um opportunities and resources that we can tap into if we 're looking at um different types of power or internal strategies for council buildings or for the community there now tap into um i will just note there was a meeting today i just missed it just clash with something but in the future i 'll be able to share those meetings with you and you can join them if you want to so just to learn more about the system and more about the program that they 're offering so there 's more resources it 's a different it 's not that 's not offering bulk uh purchase of power it 's just to offer resources for councils who are looking at doing that and a whole lot of other things separate i guess just for interest because that that was through sand rocket and yeah this is the trailer the other one yes yes i just wonder whether any well has joined this group to get those resources or whether that 's worth sure because this is this is a platform that allows for information to be passed on and perhaps ideas develop you know at least have that discussion with the group it 's my understanding it 's limited to local government really yeah make it who are of the ja who are part of the city city power partnership to actually be making sure we just forward that information onto the suggestion which is where you 're going yes exactly could i just suggest that just press that blue line and go to where it says the partnership actually pleases our power partners are committed to switching to non-polluting energy of reducing commissions in their communities and then there 's five little uh saying what what uh how they plan to go about that i didn 't see her name and the people pressed during the apologies so how is carol lynch what 's her involvement with nrm group my understanding why reading and values that she whoever she is she has met with clean and clean with reporting that she stayed with her she 's no formal part of that formal part of the nra that 's that 's my reading of it she certainly wasn 't there yeah so the next one there i did to talk to the mayor about this the focus groups and the forms through subgroups to look at yeah um they 're not going to increase their membership my members of that group are very aware they 're only an advisory group and our amazonian [Music] 2.7 of energy efficiency and renewable energy this is is this separate to the to the city 's power strategy and the strategy we were trying to this is where we kind of find cheaper power for business the director might want to comment but i understand this is our own energy efficiency plan and some infrastructure that we have we 're looking at we 've got that right yep environmental services street awning and balcony safety policy assuming we 've got it right we 've counted before council members seeking accounts of cancer okay do you have a question any comments or questions who um i know that um it doesn 't you know we 're not changing it but i do want to know is there any i know we inspected them when this was first introduced and then we got people to upgrade them depending on how where their problems were do we inspect them again or is it own facilities it 's up to the owners to maintain their own facilities however council will you know eventually have to reinspect it again and i think it 's between five and ten years okay so that 's that 's not part of his policy no but more directions will come out and there 's more directions coming so it 'll give us a time frame and we always have to once the repairs are done we have to sign those off and have construction certificates etc they have to be compliant but as they age there will be more issues identified at the morning so eventually we will have to start on a program of five to ten years so how many of i mean probably you don 't know this but how many of the 85 were required to be upgraded there wasn 't any there wasn 't and that will be done yet so we feel comfortable against policy and no more activities are required at this point okay thank you yeah further comments right required put the resolution on this in favor of carried out i think it makes sense and it 's but it is a concern that we have to um find all the d6 how do you say that entire females or entire cats which is a very big ask and i 'm just not sure i can understand why they 're doing it but i 'm not sure how that 's going to happen and how we 're going to monitor that it is interesting that they 've actually introduced it at this time because you know it has been on the back burner and nobody 's actually had a major band there with this i haven 't heard anything about this for a long time it was one of the original things that was going to happen legislation it actually didn 't happen so it 's interesting that we left holding the litter and hopefully we won 't have too many of those i do like the photographs in this i think it 's very very attractive and it 's also very readable so i feel that you know we can hand this out to people who have questioned our companion very good plan i just came along i was going to ask i was um [Music] all the non-desects cats and registering they have to be registered now um but if you want to keep them cap entire then you have to there 's a permit system you have to pay an annual permit fee um considering there 's about five cats registered at the moment out of i don 't know how many thousands of cats that are plugging around the shire it 's almost an impossible task it is a question is there a is have we got an artist on the on the vet if a female comes in that 's not registered or not microchipped are they um so [Music] um [Music] uh i was going to actually ask about the marketing of this and how we were going to get it out because aware that cats have to be de-sexed or committed um maybe you know we 're going to take advice anyway but some sort of like some sort of information directly on the council meeting um _"

    "text": "[Music] apologies for an application for lead of absence the councillors i have one from councillor michael knows i think that 's the only personal mission of some of the leadership to be granted please come to obama [Music] i would invite any counsellor or staff to indicate police in terms of disclosure of interest in relation to the interest you need to declare what we call a variety of declaring an interest in whether the interest is machinery or non-binary and thirdly what is the nature of that interest been declared i would also just remind councillors that in accordance with the local government act 1993 council is live streaming and recording this committee meeting if i speak to this meeting you agree to being livestreamed and recorded therefore please ensure that when you speak you are respectful respectful to others and use appropriate language at all times cara council accepts now liability for any defamatory or offensive remarks or gestures made in the course of the week we have opportunities and start with the confirmation of the minutes on page three at the beginning of july 2021 council to the postpone of the labor government elections and the general manager may want to clarify something or yes thanks mr chairman just need to make a correction councillors to the report uh of indicating that at section 290 the act dictates that the election of the deputy mayor must be held within three weeks after the election uh as the subject of some discussion of a webinar arrested with the office of local government and i 've taken the i 've taken the interpretation there that 's three weeks after the date of the election whereas it 's actually three weeks after the declaration of the election so that gives us a bit more window to have a have first council meeting sometime in perhaps the first and second week of of january so just just want to make that comment and correction to the report that 's that 's tabled which doesn 't change the recommendation the recommendation that you don 't wish to come to the wall secondary smith the council walked used to comment thanks mr mayor i think it 's a disappointing date to fix council staff and also councils i think early february would have been a better suggestion but anyway it is what it is and um we 're only noting noting that and it 's certainly still going to be at a a an annoyingly busy time for a lot of people and particularly i always think of harvest et cetera at that time but obviously two was an extended vote and also have some people period now for available two people so i do hope everyone takes the opportunity of registering their vote i i just add that it makes some things awkward for council and i 'm sure all councils i 'm thinking say the staff christmas party that counselors are normally invited to important things like that but as councillor said it is what it is all right just a question um they weren 't quite clear on who was going to happen if we had to spend any money on setting up the returning office wages and so forth and that being transferred to december they didn 't make any uh they do have any idea if one the local government was that has not yet been determined if if there is an additional cost who will put that bill you 're very fine i think well just with that answer i think that the office slave government might assist the shift and now they 've got to get back to government to uh to sign off on it and determine what is going to happen as to the timing i mean it 's really a good time to have any type of election and federal elections on the 6th of december and hot windy and miserable day they still went ahead i think i think vader 's more resilient than they given credit just two quick ones firstly i hope that anybody who is thinking of standing or has already indicated their standing is very much aware of these dates they are tight but i think that we need to also remember that this has been brought about because of counter 19 no other reason at all something is flexible difficult but we need to be able to adapt as much as we possibly can as kennedy some bigger issues and individuals need to be mindful of the reasons this has been changed mr style declarative carries first one director of corporate services which with regards to the investments have a total at the bottom of our investment portfolio but we don 't have one and can we leave that offer is there more investment i 've already made a note that there should be one added so i 'll take that on board i did i sort of thought maybe we had a few more investments that fell off the page um was that heavy it was that big i did actually add it up though just you know to make sure that we still have the money in the bank and as i have before i you know i wouldn 't mind having some sort of uh some sort of breakdown of what we i noticed we had the weighing the sewerage handover money um articulated in this and i think it 'd be best if we had a bit more of an idea of how much investment we are not allowed to spend that be great to have a little bit of a i 'm not sure if everyone agrees with it but i think ukraine had a little bit more of an idea of what 's actually undeserved because i think um you know this gives us a better overview of how much money we actually have to invest and how much money we have to spend if we had to spend um just a bit more of an idea if i could ask that um otherwise we 're looking like we 're doing quite well and it 's nice to see that the rates are coming in as such it 's a rapid rate is that correct um that appears to be the case i believe we are on top of the right election as we speak that given this time of year uh july august there has been a living of the rates of the year so that 's reflected in craft just to your your early point councillor we report on on those details so far as the commitment of those those funds on a quarterly basis in the qers notice of pbr support but it is nice to have it a little bit more i think anyway you know financials it 's better to have that you know exactly what you 've got you 've committed to so i think it 'd be nice to have a bit more um but yeah it looks like we 're okay thank you i was reading that the fourth quarter review will indicate obviously where we 've been subjected rate collection but looking at the percentage by comparison and last year we 're still still above ten percent left through the chair karen taylor spoke about that at the uh the a-rec meeting there 's been a change in the and treatment of the funds so it actually means that we won 't be able to achieve the five percent we will almost have to be larger but i can provide more details around that in the wording i think if that 's if that 's the case i 'm aware of that conversation if that 's the case perhaps we need the the second chance in the top paragraph that would you the number five percent in fact we 're going to be quite easily going to be judged by that and you need to reflect that somehow in that statement [Music] is that 's correct so their funds have set aside for asset uh building replacement thank you and mr chairman you may recall that 's the that was the proceeds from the sale of yarrabili that council resolved at the time to put into that program with the aim of using the interest on it which is minimal at this point in time and maintaining the interest of all the maintenance and replacement buildings [Music] yes i just want to comment on the fact that um you know some time back i did complain that we were not investing for longer terms to uh but i noticed now that um particularly we 're very low interest rates but we 've extended out to long much longer terms for our investments and one can see also though at the time they 're going to call you will still make it reasonably easy i would suggest to maintain our cash balance good to see and but i once again i sort of agree a little bit with the council of fagan too and that we do always need to know what money is actually tied to grants which which which bottom how long that 's before i think that would be also very uh apt to have that available particularly with the new council coming in first will i reply services in regards to the draft minute the regional art gallery 's russia committee already i just like to comment that there 's a wonderful exhibition over there at the mail which had a small opening on sunday yesterday and very well worthwhile seeing and it does tell quite a bit of the story of some of the aboriginal people who were the ones that uh in particular who joined the forces for the first and second world war i think it 's very well versed while showing anyway better comments obviously did the resolution against declared carried out number three [Music] um [Music] both just come from uh today 's news council meeting and uh planning is still going full as as we were meeting the new south wales youth conference which was slated for the 17th of september i think we had six youth is going um they just called in and said it was cancelled in longer so it joins the litany of things that are cancelled in september but we 're working on a novel program for uh world peace day of a peace scavenger hunt in kara and a sort of little piece origami sort of pinwheel thing for people to make at home and then bring on peace day and put around the um the piece fell here so lots of things still going on 10th anniversary of the youth council this year that we 're trying to put a program to uh for an evening event on the 4th of uh december through southwestern all online after the election and they looked to contact the previous members and so forth and hoping to get a bit of a [Music] book together and seem to [Music] in the committee to do something i presume with the re-service and the covered uh basketball courts down in with basketball and um looking at a grant submission for a youth youth type thing there to bring the community into a basketball event on an ongoing basis now they 've got some good you 've got some good things going on was what you can do on chips acknowledge and congratulate them on the presentation i made the council a couple weeks ago youth council has been one of the tremendous successors of council it 's been a great initiative that i think we should in saying that the 10-year celebration is something that we should be observing recognizing we should also just be acknowledging you that have very good youth councils on that they do technologies the chamber i think he 's also been quite suspicious being due to a substantial uh support coming out of the chamber so congratulations cody comments blood reply i 'll put the resolution i was in favor [Music] around the room and i [Music] signs there to just warn people to just be aware when they go in there because it would be a shame as we know when i was first might have and change it to that surface on the integrity of that building so as far as the way it 's been presented so i do have a problem on my basis with the director regarding the last sentence and i think it 's it 's unfortunate that 's in there because that that almost says we 're perhaps prepared to abrogate our responsibilities are passed on to a committee whether it 's being brought to council for a proper assessment and where they should accept the assessment which this recommendation is doing or we we do the research do start doing something else that shines that forward is concerned now i don 't think we need to do that but i think that we should unclear we should not pass that off to a community to now have the responsibility of doing that which is concretely what we 're saying we think we think that the current risk assessment says that it 's fine we should adopt it and be prepared just give the warnings and that 's where it should end we 're the responsible body not i think that that doesn 't um um [Music] in my very moment of saying that we 're basically offering them the opportunity to to further pursue it which is contrary to what we are actually recommending i think what you 're saying then shouldn 't we perhaps stiffen um 0.2 by adding something in uh provide a copy of the bill committee order information that 's fine just to clarify council 's made a decision and then where [Music] indication to the committee that we 've been said it was raised by the community we 've we 've now sort of accepted that because it is our responsibility we 've accepted that we 've had the risk assessment done and the risk assessment says what it says which i think i think is fairly reasonable so it 's really about poor information i agree with that i 'm happy to strengthen that second one just for the information back to the committee yeah this is council well i 'm just trying to reverse it i 'm just trying to work the recommendation in a way that it 's not you 've come out by the three times that 's what i 'm trying to say well mr chairman can i thank you for that out of work that you 're stiffer we 'll probably ask you for the speech seems to be speaking against them and thirdly i 'm trying to clarify encounters in the movie 's mind exactly what the move is thinking what has to do with that then i will ask a second if there 's a change with the secondary agrees that i 'm not the second i say no i 'm not part of that that 's the process where i 'm trying to clarify that council or military concerns are expressing the him i don 't care if that 's the way it is you could add something to that second one that the copy of the report be provided to the committee and the committee we advise that the council supports the recommendations is not considered any further work is warranted to the floor of the visa and that 's exactly what i 'm saying that 's good that was the second think that needs to be part of 0.2 so does that mean that last sentence of the summary shouldn 't be in fairness to council we 're going to be moving and made a different thing on sort of where 's the amount of some extent was early dangerous but the recommendation recommendation standards apart from the report because you can 't change report that 's as it 's written could indicate that they will be given the opportunity to look at other options whereas the resolution is now saying no don 't we are satisfied with the floor in its current current state exactly quite often that 's against what 's going to be in reports anyway um council of attribute was too common [Music] people are complaining about the noise of the bell if you wish had to bring in two or three o 'clock in the morning and i have a good one and i must confess anybody i see their cancer while i say bring it as loud as she can and like yeah sorry counselor that we that would not destroy the actual context of i don 't know how you have an unobtrusive sign there but i welcome the [Music] we 're going to floor as it is right here but then in the executive summary for the report there 's no reason why it has to be uneven it was said that it was a japanese tradition with some conjecture about if that 's what was representing japanese tradition so therefore safely saying put an epoxy level thing over it you make it level but so that 's just as bad as the final sentence in the summary i think it will just set that report to them and put these on intrusive signs [Music] [Music] [Music] at least you know you 're in there you could follow just give the triple o number i just i i support the recommendations or whatever 's there and move on thank you [Music] i don 't know of any such japanese tradition but that 's not to say there isn 't one i accept the report from the risk management officer my concern has always been not so much that someone would treat them for peace bill because of difficulties with wheelchairs crutches prams etc etc so um and i know that it 's something that we 've discussed on numerous occasions and the access committee i think has talked about it some years ago and each time we 've decided to keep it as it is but i 'm i 'm actually surprised that we haven 't had some complaints along the lines of not being as accessible as it should be but it is what it is [Music] environmental services in regards to the reporting we go from the icap investigation into canterbury city council recommendations thank that 's to say that this happened between 2013 and 2016 and i 'm intrigued to well i 'm just asking the director why i know we 're noting this report but she 's i 've discussed it with the numerous people and the idea is that we these are the things that may go wrong if we all venture down the wrong side of the law or the wrong path but um i note that these things are actually recommendations from the um my i that these problems can arise if we don 't um adhere to our code of conducting general good behavior which we 're unsure of pigments in this chamber always have so i 'm confident that this is an old report things have changed quite a lot and that power is a clean living law-abiding council and hopefully these things will never happen here but as you can see that other places have problems and we need to be reminded that these things do happen but hopefully it 's not the report came out in march 2021 although the investigation happened between 20 to 2013 and 2016. it is for information but it 's also a bit of a heads up that things may be changing in terms of the code of conduct or associated documents that it 's just worth getting on the table now so everyone 's aware of those things thank you for speaking mr that 's a good good summation of good clarification i think this is this is not about to be imposed on us we just need to be aware of it but i would it might be imposed on some style at the stage in the future is the first thing we do is insist that the state government clean up their mess as far as this is concerned about by the same rules that they 're trying to at least point out would be your best practice as far as them because i think we all read about some of the stuff that these people don 't look like when we head to china over the next couple of months somebody some of the stuff that 's much much worse than what has been investigated i think that if the rules apply in in a democracy they should apply across the board from the highest levels of the land to the third tier of government which is us and there should be a standard way of doing that i think the other thing that we need to be aware of is that there is potentially a significant cost associated with some of these page offices particularly around the auditing side of this and and keeping that record keeping in mind so we need a move to try and exist in some form as regulation rather than i actually think that some of the recommendations in here are prudent and sensible in terms of potential and possibility and for example um that if a developer wants to expect a council they should come and speak to all councillors and and the uh staffers should be there taking and keeping notes that sort of thing that if if there 's an on-site visit within potential problems that all councillors should be invited which of course we are i think those sorts of things are quite prudent and mostly happen but i i can think of instances where people have tried to get councils to come and see them one-on-one and then talk about things that may not have actually occurred so there are there are potentialities that while i think we don 't fall into the trap now i think it 's it 's proven to legislate about down the track yes i um well i know certainly and agree with much of what council smith has just said i 'm also just concerned about there 's no guarantee that the specialist advice you seek will be uh on the level either so i think uh in councils like ours which is the only one i want to really talk about was the anything that relates to planning matters i think we are already very well covered there and i think councillors are all aware that they should not be discussing uh planning matters on their own with with various people in the community so i think also the the cost as uh council miller has mentioned i think of the cost of bringing people in from outside to audit and also to perhaps sitting in on meetings with developers i think is just a little bit too a little bit over the top of my and i also agree with you know the comments that made about the people in the higher levels of government imposing these rules honest without uh paying much heat to themselves [Music] some from some of these things i thought are already in the meeting code and the way we operate like recommendation eights has got to provide meeting a formal setting of parties of interest in the development matter and then the second point councils make available a member of staff to be present at such a meeting and to prepare an official fire well i didn 't think councillors could meet without the general manager being in the room but that i could be wrong we couldn 't meet with someone to talk about business because the general managers there so it 's covered in other areas i think i thought so i just can 't find it but i thought the present general manager and the mayor often meet with with people regarding development just to give guidance on whatever what council situation is sort of indicated that that should have a file be made of those meetings so something further on goes ahead i it does make a little bit of sense i think it 's all good i think that the regulation 27 or something should be common sense should be used back on where i see we support the comments about knowledge of the director and think of the police on the table can 't use in terms of these icap recommendations that 's something that we should be watching while some of them are things that we think are common sense and we do anyway some maybe a little bit concerning in terms of the cost of the area involvement the external agency it just does show what can go wrong in local government and we need to be mindful that we need to encourage our community to understand how this council works as well i think that 's something we should be quite proud of and should we maintain that kind of behaviour because that does show what can go wrong the time frame between the the the defenses of these defenses and the report coming out it should be timed as a little bit with the large doors being played well like the horse is bothered with something to something to some extent but it doesn 't still mean that we shouldn 't be still not mindful of some of these bigger bigger issues and this could be more of an overview rather than operations which need to be adhered meet with there 's a real difference in terms of how some of this stuff is interpreted it needs to be looked at so i would be really strongly suggesting that there 's no in this country particularly our area where there 's a conversation with developers or directors certain developers beyond the appropriate realms of that behavior i 'll be punished to point that out but in terms of the report on following the report i think we also need to need to be conscious of where some of these changes and legislation may come if they do if they do do come into the force and some someone said you probably do them already and some would be quite concerning if they didn 't come in so it should be mindful and maybe you need to understand from that company you say well i 've got their responses to this as well if they have a response so with that i 'm quite happy to to leave for others you should pick up at the point i would like to think at some point you probably hope there will be consistent rules and regulations across lower government state government federal government around code of conduct and discipline and behaviour it seems that we we 're the ones closer to the community if we 're the ones who spend some time to be treated as the second class citizen or the people who are capable of doing the right thing at some point and greater laws that i do photosynthesis i just think it 's um [Music] um about sort of rating where we wanted the grant funding in which we put rate at number one this council accepted that this was our highest priority and i thank you all for that i think people appreciate it both particularly disabled and i must say that i 've been very pleasantly surprised the number of people have actually implied what was going on and were delighted when i tell the basketball courts are going back up and what was happening but any other issues of urgent business qualified wasn 't urgent a of 10 and it 's under 10 a2d one report for general management committee airport plan for our of the confidential nation that would have disclosed this commercial position position that person displayed they 're right thank you for the resolution again _"

identify what report is very the [Music] 2019 yeah how are you bill forum and i would invite you now if you 'd like to speak uh to about yourself without champion if that 's what you 'd like to do thank you very much mr mayor and thank you for the to the councillors that 's just in relation that the da i 've lodged for consideration today which [Music] [Music] includes [Music] um [Music] um and i really appreciate it there are no questions thank you very much for that and uh i think we disconnect this but you can continue to do what you feel like those shoes on the youtube channel thank you thank you extra tom we will now go to compromising the limbs [Music] [Music] [Music] the recommendation and answer any questions should there be any and i would convince i guess you 're making one comment this early agenda substantial involvement general across the region notices humidity issues have any questions on the report yes i 'd like to just comment on the second item there feedback regarding the uh to present that to you as some of the thoughts that council might provide at feedback i am somewhat disappointed actually however the comment has been made the destination country in our back lacks the funding to effectively support the last region of new zealand [Music] um [Music] [Music] um um um um is [Music] presentation but there is a draft to be formulated in regards to separation of transportation feedback preliminary feedback to that that 's draft crafts and should we make sure the council will pursue that draft when it comes out and you can be sure the attention has been paid to things such as congestion mainstream or issues about the impact carer as well as the uh yes um is [Music] is [Music] um [Music] is [Music] [Music] um [Music] is another question is um us to actually places that will be suitable for pre-poll and for officers because i think you know in the past we wondering if the general manager is on to that looking for specific places um but there would be some areas where there was a crossover in the report you 're talking about the background that 's right that 's the point i 'm making is that the council has already adopted a code of conduct for council it 's a separate one for committee members we delayed the council staff one until the undertaking the consultation with the staff consultant committee now that 's happened it 's appropriate to adopt the council staff concept [Music] [Music] um to do with fairness equity harassment in the workplace disclosure of pecuniary interests conflict of interest obligations [Music] manager which is the six month review of the delivery program and the 2021 operational plan you know there 's something we discussed at the information meeting chancellor smith thank you the difficulties of the last six months of the year in terms of what we were dealing with in with covenant and so on council has still continued to work and achieve lots of important milestones such as the upgrades [Music] carrying on a on in a more limited and coded safe way but we 're still able to continue them and i think that 's a great thing and we should congratulate our staff because they 've continued to work hard and to log in a lot of important milestones despite some of probably it 's been an extraordinary effort by our staff over the last six months or so and it should be knowledge only publicly i suggest that perhaps something that you might understand and some of them i mean it just hasn 't times like this just to remind you of the viable path of people 's lives council does play and when i say council talk about the people on the ground doing the work and it should be acknowledged and should be acknowledged so i is [Music] youth council from council to speak with your wife this one thank you basically could you go second council of notices [Music] council and i 'm saying that do you have any comments on this this was meeting before christmas and i would just like to thank you for attending the your acknowledgement of what youth council has done and it certainly means a lot to the council that they have the support of them and i believe at all youth council members so council is going for both if councillors are looking at the list there we had we had eight i think year 12 students two of whom are remaining on the books because they 're remaining in power but we 're not in college or one of them is working at the mines and we 're not entirely sure how much they will be able to contribute but we appreciate the fact that they are staying on and we 've also had a couple of people leaving and going away to school unfortunately so we had six applications and we accepted all six of those applications and so on the first column lewis and rudy goff are new ones on the second column cohen howden is a young new one zachary holborn and razik shaji who and i sorry yes and i missed in the first column alyssa sharma as well and uh we 're quite confident that that we will be able to get these people up to speed and that they will be as good as um unfortunately we have a meeting next week questions good luck okay please please pass on to the youth captain for your support please uh either the comments i 'll need to robert clark at the resolution carry is a donation to the consideration of the donation of the carrot triathlon club the recommendation there to approve a donation 30 54 sorry 440. uber councillor walsh [Music] [Music] um most councils were able to be here at the end of last year when they were given an update by the council on the study happened and again i thank councillors for their enthusiastic and positive reception of that these three dot points represent the next steps moving forward and they 're they 're quite clearly explained in the background um so that i don 't i don 't think i need to stay anymore except that we are looking forward perhaps to having a positive response to our grant application uh sometime late next month but uh we 'll see dominating as identifying up to yes um it will be wonderful if eventually we do have a country university center here but i just wanted to suggest that whoever is putting together a [Music] education foundation and um money to assist students with university courses and with take courses and i was wondering whether to keep trying everyone in the tent whether in selecting a committee whether it 's worth approaching them um and if anything i wanted to talk to them about it i understand that ella delaney is the uh [Music] yeah i support this and um i think it 's interesting that it 's um this is company awards council that is coming for council today and clearly shows the caring youth council considerable number of million dollars to um do something like this in the schools and i was told today that the public school is they 've got money to employ three teachers for three days to work with children that have sleep behind companies have been learning where they 've been felt and left out so i think this should go well with people something that 's worked on the hub system and i think if we apply for money it should be very well received and um [Music] the figures that they 're stating how far children fell behind [Music] some people think that children are only often babysitted at school with continued teaching that they didn 't actually learn something so we need to provide an impetus to keep that going in these times where suggestion is a good one although i think that the two groups would probably want to remain separate because the education foundation will still want to support people who are going away as as many still and in terms of what counselor wright said i believe the high school has advertised for a position to be something similar but of course the hub would be for senior students and post school students as well i also just say that i hope and believe that some people have you found appreciation of what teachers do i equally had a newfound appreciation of what hackers at our supermarkets do when i had to pack my own groceries almost inexpertly my question is i agree with what we are doing here but i was thinking is there something although we know in the report um on the writing reform is there something in this uh i 've read through all the yeses and those and the report itself um is there anything in there that we should be following up other than just noting this report is there anything in that report that we really feel we started this a long time ago so i 'm a bit hazy on what we actually drink for in the beginning together as anything that in that in those reforms that we could raise again and say yes this is okay but we really want something else and i actually look and i 'm thinking i don 't really know and having sort of a recant in my mind what the report said that the director has got a pretty right hand some of the issues that are arising do not relate particularly to us yes so again because issues [Music] um and i agree with the chair that there are a lot councils with large mining facilities within their boundaries which has raised a lot of discussion further [Music] well we 've been waiting for this report to be released for a long time so and by now everyone 's gone off the boil about something so i was just picking maybe something that hasn 't been addressed that we actually felt yeah another one that came out of the significance of new south wales i would suggest it would be great normalisation for another labor council there 's some real issues really issues there are potential significant rate increases in some of their their rate players and there is a suggested change in this which would allow some categories of buildings and um businesses so that 's good um yeah there is there 's nothing that we haven 't covered that hasn 't covered that 's absolutely mr chairman can i just pick up and it 's important this is but it 's the issue there 's a comment in there about water and sewage where you have that almost system to be able to take some of the flexibility of 't know but if that if that requires true and brilliant it doesn 't it doesn 't trust some of these skills [Music] [Music] it 's an area that does at least allow us to reflect um what what is happening in our own area as far as water and sewage is concerned what is needed what the plans for the future are all the rest of them we 've been very diligent about that sometimes to the detriment of their reputations yeah so but so i think we move down that 's in relation to ordinance who are special rates not rewarding certain charges but of course lead to the other that 's right because one of the serious rates wouldn 't come under this rating before it 's only if it was if we employed a special rate at all land that 's right because the sewerage [Music] [Music] is i 'm sure that question was also checked out an opportunity the new brain category through driver and leg the increased single building the state parks and so forth national parks and so forth in the environmental land to this question was asked this also applies to those private grants and would it apply to proportion of the property which is tied to any problem consolation it teaches the confirmation of the um three thirty two three three two three three two three almost keeping to acknowledge the release of decisions from closed meetings council council secondary councillor thank you no comments so for the resolution in favor against three which is the second quarterly budget review recorder ending december 31 presentation councilman i was hoping it 's going to be a new era as we 're continuing to continue on the surplus shown there of course as we 've commented before i think last last quarterly review um surplus this time it 's a little bit more but you need to remember that a sizable proportion of that is actually unexpected ground ups before just added that we are now halfway through the financial year and the first and second quarter variations show some improvements and deteriorations in large part because of decisions that council has made along the way but we should expect those to continue because things arise thank you to the comments laundry part necessary with the resolution of caridon another right focused services director of the investment investment investments and financial [Music] against carry on number nine director of corporate services three five five uh art gallery advisory committee council no sorry second account that 's council beta right sorry um look this is from last year i think one of the positive things from last year from november last year was the amount of people that they know [Music] number 10 for the director of corporate services three five five three minutes the friends of the gallery council knows you 'll move those and then we 're the second of the last council of peter right thank you um [Music] pathway [Music] so should we formally note that or not and have a particularly to add a dot point to what you 're suggesting the council should write to the members the four members of the advisory committee thanking them for their contribution well that is an important question i was at the opinion oh sorry yeah um the art gallery advisory their own uh separate articles doesn 't i forget the word someone might help me out what their job description um and i i noticed that those members who were friends of the gallery while they can 't always get to meetings [Music] [Music] funds from the friends of the gallery are being transferred to the advisory committee is there any need to to change or expand the delegation to incorporate i can 't remember and council on those may i can 't remember exactly how the delegation was deepened but [Music] they [Music] it went to their specific goals so the question then got point two there i said this last partner said this is the money to be transferred to the root cause [Music] [Music] [Music] knowledge of these people but i do know that they have supported the gallery since inception and i think it 's a very important uh it 's important to note that they 've actually been a very active group and a very supportive group and raised a lot of money to provide funding for the gallery for art and for acquisitions over important that we write to them and actually acknowledge their contribution because they have done a fantastic job it 's a little sad that they 're actually going out of view but it 's also the sign of the times that people haven 't got exactly the same amount of time to provide and also we have a very organized gallery committee and a very good director who takes on a lot of the roles that these people originally were handed so i think it 's sad that we can see them go but also to tribute to them that they 've gone for so long going on and also raised a lot of money for the to support the gallery and uh and we really thank them deeply for their contribution thank you i 'm sure the letter will reflect that and thank you for raising it i think we 've been appropriate if we didn 't actually have someone come to the chamber about that we appreciate the work that they have done over a long period of time and the value of the volunteers and generations um infrastructure operations is the in regard recycling industries report directivation there i 'll second the distribution council of wall street and council members [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] i agree with all of that when i personally had this recommendation i 've cheered to be part of the big brother and uh [Music] the reasoning behind it i just wonder whether [Music] to continue to encourage [Music] it was put in place at a time that we didn 't have other facilities to collect and encourage recycling which we 'd like to continue to do so great framingham frame emotions on the run is [Music] [Music] so we need to get rid of the ice all right it 's it 's you know sometimes um um i 'm noting that uh one of the dot points in the background is that golovkin woodstock residents have access to a different type of service now i i just let counsellors know that i did receive and passed on to the general manager um just before christmas and and that time has uh a very detailed critique of the woodstock the new [Music] points documented by photographs and that sort of thing and i know that the director if i said general manager i bet you i meant to say the director and i know that the director is going to have a look at that and see how it goes one of the points that was made was that the twice weekly few hours before christmas was inadequate or not just afterwards or something was inadequate for the number of residents in an allegation coming along and i suspect that that was a particular post-christmas great english etc but it 's it 's something that perhaps with both stock and guru gold council might take into account in future festive periods and all of that thank you i think this was a decision which we will support yeah [Music] [Music] hope it doesn 't lead to more rubbish being dumped on the side of the road that might be able to work that out as we go along but um it 's quite obvious that they were being used for the wrong reasons facilities [Music] she 's ducked out through the final doctors [Music] item number two is the biosecurity legislation mr mayor i think that this is a good thing that we 're doing having two equal biosecurity officers one uh doing the north of the shire and the south of the show i think it is and i do note that in terms of the operating costs comparing the previous system with this system there the amount that council will be expanding is pretty much identical to what was extended in the previous system thank you for the comments all right active and so we need to upgrade things to meet that criteria too it 's a bit different than it was before think this will do just one question there that sort of four by six truck set up with journals for spraying that seems like it 's a bogey drive type truck quite a heavy truck they 're quite entertaining we 'd be a bit awkward in and around our roads that 's the one that 's going to be replaced one that 's not available thank you uh [Music] thank you just some of the work they 'll be successful here and we 'll hopefully uh as part of that 's because it will be driven by our own remember which is what 's intended in our report yeah [Music] thank you uh thank you mr chairman uh personally to just comment that 's disappointing that we 're unsuccessful we 'll consider this application there and please at least there is a this recommendation let 's talk about allocating the uh music phase two of the global ways and infrastructure programming use all of those things however basil says i want to do the short form because so i guess if we 're going to commit to this i think that i 'll probably be surprised if no one 's not prepared to commit to this yeah we need to know what 's going to happen if the wheels fall off get this through the chair um there 's a fair bit of council discretion in getting the repair grant um this why advice would be that this project won 't have any problems in security [Music] [Music] we discussed um this at an earlier meeting and quite quite small modifications and that they won 't they don 't materially affect uh the development at all and i do um thank you for listening mr larsen for coming on and speaking to us in such positive ways we 'll do some some wraps for our staff because sometimes it 's the rip facts and not the vote case that that people bother to give but i think that given that we passed the original development application and given also that the objections to the modification while a number of them were the same those that that were individually written and and the ones that were the same have been very carefully assessed and the questions have been replied to you i think that we should pass this away yes first of all the arborist has said that those trees need to go the landscape has supplied a uh an extensive planting or show that will be an extensive planting of various shrubs and trees which i think slightly longer term should alleviate the concerns of some of the people who are concerned about what 's happening then whatsoever for us to reject the modifications mr chairman i support those comments i actually think this has been very very well appealed by our staff and also by the applicant as far as this is concerned i understand how it has been very cooperative right through this process it 's disappointing sometimes i think when we read this the commentary around some of the objections the tone which someone expressed and quite frankly um and the attitude towards their staff in some cases the way that 's expressed is disappointing and there are some there is some commentary in there that is objectionable in their respects and it should be called out because people can have a right to make to express their apprentice they have a right to object to whatever they like but there is there is a certain way to do that and there 's and they need to express it in a way that 's respectable as far as professional stuff so as councillor wallace has just said very is there is a way to raise issues and accepting comments but unacceptable in regards to that observation this has been appropriately assessed is assessed in accordance with all the rules and regulations that need to be assessed but done very well in the comments the tasks and assertions not directly but inferred reply offers a resolution always available i declare you carry it down by the number two from the director of directory environmental services 30111 straight 2020 i think it 's heritage consultant he suggested that the impact of the sign of the building 's heritage is relatively insignificant this is a situation where designers put up and i resume the um the owner of the business that did it didn 't realize there was need for a uh development application just to make sure that and the sign can remain just advertising good business and good good good local products thank you very much mr chairman of the college in everything that we do these days as far as our advertising is concerned we know and that 's what should happen in this case here whilst i concur where the comments have been made about objectionable or anything like that i think it done after the event and the council not necessary you 've lost your own reply because i put in the resolution director environmental services again airport master plan again we have a working workshop on this the recommendation through the points you got a exhibition is for 28 days and i 'll very much value the commentary that might come back because hopefully some people know more about airports than i do i 'm sure it will stimulate some kind council amenities i thought you did anyways [Music] it 's intended to reflect what is uh something we 've been working on for some time and and to make sure that it operates as they will be really good therefore it conducts itself in that sense and we don 't sort of you can have the next one i think it 's an excellent report it 's it 's very detailed and i do too look forward to any public comments and i do note that contained within the report is the need to review this at 10 yearly intervals so i think it provides an excellent basis going forward that with some revisions thank you for the comments mr chairman i support this and um as council smith said that it 's being said the claim needs to be reviewed on a regular basis this is it 's been reviewed now and since the subdivision has been completed over there and a lot of sites have been sold you know will be developed and we need to make sure that the system operates over there to provide any new um that we have the necessary means to let those new developments operate safely on the airport and also interact with the existing developments and ensure surfaces are kept up to a standard required by [Music] aerial controllers regulations and this is a area of care that 's um is developing more important as a as a business sector for the town and and with a bit like one day we might get some form of passenger air service back and um it will be a good this plan will help maintain that to be in a good situation to offer that whether it 's only on a contract basis the comments i 'd like to re-run it with i 'd like council military just to make sure i didn 't comment right i think he will tell you infrastructure and i 'm sorry both of you um directly for running all the services yeah modification modification 61 straight 2018 councillors these are fairly minor modifications basically internal modifications that don 't change either the number of bedrooms or bathrooms and so on and some change of access to the site in that the ingress and egress is from the same place and there 's a little keyhole part and that 's adequately covered in the changed conditions so i think that we should support this application council i agree the footprint of the building is not changing so um the modifications or the changes are so minor and i think it should be supported so to do with the driveway it 's not clear on the matter i couldn 't receive a map if it 's coming off contrast to drive or shed thank you along the lines that she 's already indicated because i think it 's quite proposed sort of the underlying i suppose perception that the director earlier today it 's really um deja vu in some respects in that maybe the the terminology has changed just a little bit certainly the personnel have changed but in actual fact the push there that we don 't know how pressed to manage our land when i say we i thought i 'm talking about our council our planners the people that represent our communities but more importantly our farming communities is an absolute disgrace to show the the the arrogance i think in some ways as far as this is concerned with the way it 's written is is something that we should push back on very strongly with uh we went through a a terrible period about i don 't know maybe 20 years ago well we started that that 's right but by the time we got it resolved i think later it was probably 20 years ago where we had numerous public meetings we had numerous fights within this community which divided this community in some respects because we had certain portions of people they should utilise their lands to get the best use out of what is the food basket of certain new south wales and should be acknowledged that way that will continue to happen i think that we 've basically got our planning land use plan right now after a lot of hard work there 's always particularly interest that we need to do with that but it and that also is picked up in [Music] the director 's report so i would encourage us i know that the day can you pick up on papers talk about tomorrow well that 's worth a little bit of time and i would like to think perhaps we could get some further information on that what will be i think in talking to the director today and i don 't want to prove what she might say about the report that it might be a strongly worded response to what is some of the commentary that is proposed within the webinars they called [Music] you know i fully agree with what he said about um being grilled from afar and just reading the with the 1990 lep where they uh was it 85 something uh lots of land there for development on two hectare sites because it was non-prime land in fact he was irrigating it so i suppose it wasn 't primarily a year ago anyway that 's that 's the problem we have and as it talks about the housing and building and so forth the dpi have still got this thing in their head that you need a larger area of land around the house because once you put a house on it it becomes less valuable but they get to understand that the owners footprints are the best fertilizer for the full rural land and then only to the curve that they can live there they also their planning there was that they wanted less houses in the in the area so that mining companies wouldn 't have to deal with as many gland openers within the guidelines that come down and this right to farm it 's all very good because often the people who tell you how to write your card are living in a different world not the real world i agree with much of what 's been said and i i didn 't think when i first read this that might have been written by mary kay [Music] to 674 we have the policy problems presented to us and quite frankly it 's roach it 's rubbish i just can 't believe couldn 't believe that you know they invent this sort of tribe in this day but anyway somebody 's got to try and justify their existence i suppose i believe that that might be further comments we are being live-streamed colleagues and what we say is subject to reality thought on that opinion sometimes when you have one week that 's that 's not just that consciously yes mr mayor i wonder if through you i could just ask the director a little bit about these workshops that staff participated in last year and and i 'm making an assumption there and i know i know what counsellor knows says about assumptions but were these workshops for people all over the state that weren 't just workshops for us through the channel work all accountable across the ladders thank you thank you thank you i thought it does make a comment i think that the the concerns that the director has highlighted in terms of both the planning proposals and the workshop and so on are really important ones and i thought particularly at the notion of the planning policy then being voluntary in which case as the director says what 's what 's the point of the policy and i i was certainly concerned with as the director was with the concept that there was misinformation going on and there was language indicating not trusting planners local planners to understand what they were doing and while i was reading it actually one of my first thoughts was there 's nothing here about climate change scenarios and i was i was pleased to see the director highlighting that as a potential problem going forward with this mapping and his concept of prime land and so on so i 'm i 'm very happy to let the director and her staff handle their response because i do have some faith i 'm going to about this probably all night given our history but i think the director 's report is a very good one and i congratulate that for that i do know that i think we do have probably the 28th of january response i assume we can and i think we discuss this all night and we all come out probably still agreeing a bit about the issues i want to chuck a couple other ones in my camera i 've heard the report i think could work 100 accurate but i didn 't know she also sent us out a couple of maps a couple of sheets and information sheets in terms of ag value and gross domestic product comes out of agriculture in this region including region and india 's enormous who are undoubtedly a fertile agricultural powerhouse in the state and when you add that to the infrastructure australia report some a couple of years ago which indicated that this region and we talked about the region was one of the top seven regions for gdp predicted by 2031 and that included obviously mining and other other components one indicates in conjunction with this the value of this region these planners and these departments will be far better off working out how we get product to market how we get further growth and infrastructure back into our regions crossing the blue mountains accessed access to the the sap in in parks access to canberra airport issues such as playing wander around and air i said at the moment around agriculture putting some confidence into the conversation around the increased capacity of women which is that water which will be a real driver around agriculture as we move forward i think the government so these agencies could be well advised to be focusing on some of those big picture infrastructure issues rather than trying to tell us what to do in our own backyard but in actual fact the council understands the issues and our staff understand the issues in many respects they are responding adequately when you talk about land use conflict also and that type of conversation staff really take that aboard and are really cognizant of all those issues so i just tried those extra comments but recommendation very strongly and i 'm glad my colleagues are supporting as well for the comments if i reply thank you mr chairman i think all of our comments have been consistent around the time of how important this is that when i i go into boston i certainly trust our staff and certainly our director as far as this is concerned but as i said i have a discussion with the san fernando how impassioned she is and her knowledge in this area is really important what we need is that knowledge to be acknowledged and used by we had back then were that no one could make a living on less than a thousand hectares of land and all the rest of it call it the prime agricultural land and non-private all the rest of it all that sort of stuff created a whole lot of anxiety amongst our farming community and local our townships and our villages that service those farming communities so we need to make sure that we get on top of this really quickly the point you just made it 's one that the area makes to the economy of new south wales and australia is huge they should not lose sight of that and therefore to touch on something like this with a lack of understanding a clear lack of understanding of how important that is is a real concern and we need to get that point across our local minister needs to understand that our local member needs to understand that as well because this is this is probably the most important issue on us the start of the year but potentially this is the most important issue we could deal with this year because it could have huge impact if it 's not that 's right first comment stopped by there 's one replies done off of the recommendation i was invited all in favor against declarative inaudible regarding thanks to those who organised and participated in the australia day commemorations yesterday including a letter of appreciation to the australian ambassador and to the committee and um and certainly thanks to the staff who were kept yeah unless you comment urgently that 's that 's the most no one 's objecting the motion which is the right or letter we acknowledge the gentleman mr jones had three minutes to report out that council formally acknowledges the contribution of all all participants and organisers of the australia daily event do you wish to speak any further no further comments i 'll put the resolution in favor again now another business i will take a matter to close the meeting of the public public considering according to the clause 10a the act the following 1082a a report from the act says the acting director of struck operations reported from the director of tractor operations in place council subject is the carer aquatic centre operation and the reason the matter and information that personal matters concerning particular individuals that so we 'll go we 'll gather directly often

recording of this council meeting by speaking at this meeting you agree to being live streamed and recorded please ensure that when you speak account for meeting that you ensure you are respectful to others and use appropriate language at all times and kara council accept no liability for any defamatory or offensive remarks or gestures made during the course of this meeting I would also ignore the issue in traditional custodians of al-andalus together working people and making respects to their elders both past and present do we have any apologies mr. chairman just a standing apology from councillor witty and any other apologies take no further apologies we will move on to disclosures of interest any councillor or staff which will indicate in relation to this matter if you need to declare interest and if so whether it 's a pecuniary and non-pecuniary interest from the nature of that interest share nobody needs to declare an integer on this in wishing to address the council in any matter on this public forum is not required therefore we come to the one reform that 's anonymously published medium that is a report of services in regards to zoning proposal playing within the dam area to recommendation therefore I 'll move it mister Chairman 's council a millisecond billing account for a lot days and up Thank You melody which would speak with this board you I 'm finally bravely mr. chairman and really this is just a melody as far as we are concerned it 's the recommendation from our staff but it 's it 's really to do with just the reason and father this of clearly sister with them in the document that if this is my response this is past that there will be a make other application then as far as the planning of that site is concerned as to what will happen later down the track so this is purely about a planning issue and about a reason Indonesia and it makes sense to move that we thank you there 's a second it which is watch you fall in the same trap we all fall on a little button to let you talk i just endorse counter miller 's comments it is a planning proposal or to have a rezoning done nothing obviously are the part of what has to happen the eventually do i will come in for that areas this is all gonna be actually go to public exhibition and go to the minister in the people that happen so thank you for the comments yes I do have some comments firstly I think it should be noted that this planning proposal has been prepared by water New South Wales as as is proper and I will be supporting the planning proposal however I do have a couple of comments and some unease about it and the first comment is that there where there is and I forget exactly how many hectares that we are proposing to rezone from an environmental conservation to an operational land and that has to of course be done in order for the reflections holiday park to be relocated I understand all that and I certainly don 't however much land it is and I just have been looking and can 't find it the proposal talks about only a proportion of that some 30 hectares I think that will actually be used for the reflections caravan park but it 's the much larger site that water New South Wales wants us to rezone so I 'm just wondering what the purpose is rezoning that much larger site is it so that there can perhaps being you know further development down the track I 'm not sure but it 's a question that I would like council to ask and I well to answer the second question is that there are some areas as has been I didn 't have been identified in the background into this proposal of environmental concern some areas where there 's some at risk or threatened biodiversity but there 's nothing to tell us what that three is and there 's although it talks about later down the track there will be some steps articulated to mitigate the any concerns we might have there 's nothing as I have read it in this 's at risk and any hint of of how that is going to do have some concerns about water New South Wales and the department environment asking us to agree to a planning proposal where we really don 't have full information about the effect I plan to vote for it I don 't want to let up but I would like council to be asking those I have from commerce but I 'll let the director make a couple of comments that may answer some of those questions that is probably partner will be around the fact this rezoning not about a DA yes the director I can answer those questions so it 's a process that because I 'll deal with 162 hectare site first so when it is easier to have the boundaries identified as the entire lot at this stage knowing that it will just be the 30 hectares in the end that will be resigned so once we get to a point where the the department is happy goes to public exhibitions etc we do the actual mapping the actual site will be shrunk back expressed we remain as an e as an easily that 's point one point two where we understand the constraints of the side in terms of environmental sensitivity there are a number of potential Aboriginal sites that are already identified there are some vegetation types that are also protected these are these will be protected they 're designed that we 've seen the preliminary design that we 've seen or the cut before the caravan park completely avoids this area these areas so there 's no development on the area where it 's vegetations protected and also not no development on the potential Aboriginal heritage sites that those studies are also being undertaken as we speak or the DA there 's just some time constraints in terms of this initial process so they will fully be investigated in the rezoning and we don 't know whether the department will ask to halt studies to be provided during this rezoning process and my I 'm imagining that they will be so but they have been certainly identified in the DEA process or the potential the pre DEA process and as well constraints on the site thank you and you for the comment I just can 't_''_550.53 all right yeah thank you I 've just been the eternal pessimist um it 's interesting that they 're making a application to change this to operational type land or tourism land and that and sounds like they go for a bigger area so then they can manipulate the 30 hectares excludes anything excludes these sites but they had to do they they look at all the all the land that 's gonna be inundated with the higher with a new high watermark to make sure there 's no aboriginals or endangered species or have to be shifted before the water comes up can I can I have answer that to some extent and rectum oh oh coming off that the I think we 're getting a little bit ahead of where we we are where we are simply rezoning land the other issues of the being talked about would be something that has to be encompassed by DEA and the proper proper and thorough process we 'll all those issues I would imagine will issues this was seen as the maps that you 're having in the business paper are not necessarily there draft and some of the conversations are being had is that there may well be changes made to to that that particular footprint that we 're talking about so I think we need to focus for just lady 's own and the other components of the conversation we 've seen we 're having now are something which will be addressed I would assume fully and thoroughly and rigorously in the delay process when that when that comes around and when the both reflections on state water ready to launch something and have something with with which they 're immigrants but the points are winter well my counselor knows they always going to ask for a point of order on that mr. chairman because yeah the motion put forward was only for that we note things and that 's going to go on public exhibition surely what we 're talking about now and talk about later at a later date and when it does arise you appropriately correct councillor lobe thank you support the recommendations and this is a natural progress of what what 's eventuated we has been an existing Park there and it might have to be shifted if the if the walls lifted and this is the process going borden it 's in the interest of your Shire and the community health benefits and everything else so I support the proposal going forward thank you Thank You counsel right we probably all have a comment right reply councillor Miller announced that they 'd end up dragging an account to the Miller Road reply mr. Chairman I did it 's has went quite rightly stated this is really a proposal to put this on public exhibition it 's really just about rezoning matter what this does nothing else I 'll put that up with the resolution to do we need a formal vote that I 'll put the resolution we need to form about colleagues all those in favor three hands please carried unanimously thank you colleagues I think we all know that 's the only matter on the agenda so we will now suppose the suppose a meeting and yeah _"

smith 's got a hand up council fagin thank you any comments or questions i 'll put the resolution always in favor again declare that carry we will now go to the recommendations from the general committee meeting on 12th of july and the first one is the investments the resolution to to note the investments i 'll move that council of fagin councillor walsh thank you any times or questions on this no comments or questions i 'll put the resolution on their favor island number two is from the director of infrastructure operations which is the okay council smith 's got a hand up thank you council walsh yes mr mayor i think a co-text this size uh deserves some comments in that um while we what we said at the committee thinking uh there are three main parts two or three major parts to this one is the filtration plan upgrade the other is the other is the mirror liner for the 50 meter and the type of pool and the third is the splash pad and the estimate that cost estimated cost is 4.5 million but that any progress on it will be dependent on 50 percent bad and it seems it 's a very prudent thing i think [Music] i 'm very pleased to see this this company for council and hopefully it 'll be able to do the secondary speed right reply not necessarily item number three from the director of environmental services is a comprehensive dcp review i 'm happy to move this but i 'm going to suggest that we have a new.2.2 and 0.3 just can become 0.3 and 0.4 but i 'm suggesting that after conversations at the the exception of the width of in part d part d4 page 34 that the width of rural without roads in larger three events remain at seven meters and and that the second one is that we delete part c two from the documentation of the exhibition i have to speak about those you 've the issue is around the width of the road currently seven meters i think there was a general feeling that the dc abuse can be varied we can reduce it to a smaller uh width if the circumstances do to prevent it and a sensible way of going about it but you can 't increase it that easily so seven metre status quo will be 10 under circumstances these are can be varied the other one is the issue around the which is not mandatory if adopted it could cause some issues and concerns and costs for for council and council staff i 'm suggesting that we leave that out for the time being and if we need to we would need to have perhaps a more considered approach and conversation about this in isolation mandatory um it 's not necessarily a key planning issue for the carers shire and it does create unnecessary ministry burdens i think we believe without not that we should ignore it completely and then we revisit those two changes i think it 's a good document i congratulate the staff on the work they 've done it is something we need to be adopting and the b2b does i think fit in here [Music] it 's there as a background document in case people want to read and read them in conjunction so the comment council is making you want to capitalize on what 's going to do thanks mr mayor uh i think stated pretty well all um i 've just added section c2 which is [Music] um fauna flora sorry not full within towns calls too much advice if you 've written as you said and actually i 'm just wondering whether we could change the wording on 0.3 to the just to make it clear the lep plan 2012 is a reference documentary or this for the purpose of this part of the public placed on 't need any information the second happy of that yeah yes yeah good thank you all right any further comments no further comments um given that i would of course show you i think council is picking that one up about the the vegetation in urban areas which we 're the parts see to which we 're going to delete that at this point there are other statutory regulations due cover do cover that topic as well dgp a good nightmare you 've got good guidelines good ground rules for staff to follow developers to follow and i think this came from the exhibition i 'd encourage everybody with an interest to have a look at it and pass their time back to us i 'll put the resolution those in favor again we need to display i think our hands colleagues yep um council kevin wright yes that was it then we come to a recommendation from the director of corporate services which is sorry from the director of corporate services which is a um housing housekeeping matter to note the release of closed closed recommendations from council so or questions doing none i 'll put the resolutions in favor against declare account carrie thank you very much [Music] donation from insane championships wrestling proprietors i 'm happy to move that council of faith in council smith council um this is uh we 've done this a couple of times and i 'm really pleased to see it 's back on the agenda and the insane championship wrestling organisation are back in the ring as to say and that we can support them in this way as i know you the mayor enjoyed the show last time that he went and i 'm just hoping that we can that it can be held again because i think it 's a it 's a really great it 's a great thing and it does entertain us and we need a lot of entertainment at the moment as things are a bit short of that so hopefully this will go ahead and [Music] i 'd just like to add my thanks to mr james lanham the pope um not only for public service that he provides in terms of entertainment particularly belief also for the very full information that he provides to council to an endless made atmosphere so that made it very easy to make a positive decision and thank you mr lennon for all that you do thank you council all right yeah i support the uh the recommendation i just have one question or a concern that um he had a uh estimate of the promise for the higher the civic center but nothing in writing and i just hope that that is what what it 's going to be it seems a little bit light on to what some other organisations have been quoted whatever happens happens i don 't want to see to be to get a shock the bill thank you i 'm sure the director of corporate services has taken that on board thank you thank you very quiet thank you sorry for the time do i reply i don 't no i don 't think it 's necessary and um i wish them all the best for the show okay thank you i 'll put the resolution all those in favor all right traffic committee i 'm sure some of the traffic community will do something of this thank you mr chairman and just before i as far as the report is concerned this is a combination of two traffic committee meetings the minutes of two trading committee meetings and therefore it 's a long list of recommendations many of which have already been uh acted upon and are in the past but with those few words i would like to [Music] point out i think that the first nine recommendations are from the traffic committee meeting minutes from the april meeting and the the the remainder from the traffic committee meeting that was held on the 15th of june um with that explanation i 'd like to move that the recommendations be endorsed by council with the exception of uh recommendation five and that i would request that that recommendation be referred back to the traffic committee meeting the further traffic committee ready for further consideration uh before it 's reported back to council thank you council councillor thank you councilman speaker mr chairman i think that just in clarity as far 's about uh speed humps up at the belgium hill um i think that certainly is probably from uh the meetings i 've chaired there has been some uncertainty about where this request came from um and i know that councilor walsh actually chaired the last trading committee meeting and he was of the same view that there is some uncertainty about where it came from we need to properly consider this and to see whether there are this is the right way to approach some hurnish behaviour up there or whether there is a better way of doing it that doesn 't impact on maybe access for emergency vehicles except etc which is one of the issues around speed ups so it 's just around let 's let 's properly investigate it by the traffic committee meeting and perhaps that might we may well come back with the same recommendation but i think let 's do the research first catalog going on uh lee following on councilman mitchell 's explanation around uh 0.5 um yes i i think of all those recommendations there were very well supported trafficking that up at bitcoin street um this should give some clarity what should happen where it 's come seek to join onto the street the football team thank you for the comments council play um yeah i um i was quite pleased to see the speed humps in the um in the recommendations because um like as part of one of the playground adventure playground um organization community thought that they 'd be a good op off a good option but um there is it mentions a report being done so i was i 'm surprised that it 's been rough but it doesn 't matter that 's fine if there needs more more discussion about it that 's okay but there does need to be something done on the adventure playground to slow down the traffic which is tunes up and turns around and hoons back down the side with hundreds and hundreds of kids running around on the other side of the road so i think you know it definitely needs consideration happy to think that you 're going to consider it a bit more but i was pleased you yes um just regarding um recommendation number twelve the way i read there will be a medium strip at the tea the section of redfern street in malaya street in the car wash um i understand and it 's the need for it but when it 's designed we want to make sure that wide vehicles can still use the intersection because they did something like that a commander at the swimming pool and um headers just without their without the harvest in front of them they can 't get through the um the roadway the cement comes out too far from their footpath and where the medium strips place so i just want to ensure that there 's um enough room for for a normal white vehicle i suppose if that 's not in such a term that um can still manage to get get around there and semi-travelers can turn without running over things thank you i think that 's a a valid point i 'm sure the director picked up those comments but i think in the past we have sort of tried to make sure move around across the bridge in some form somewhere someway so you might just keep that in your mind please i 'll show you i 'm sure you 're already i 'm sure we already have but through the chair what was reported to the traffic committee with a lane width of five meters on either side of the median island and uh so that 's wider it 's probably the narrowest uh portion of kendall street but there 's also more width than that when you take into account the width of the diamonds and where the signage is so i think that 's been addressed in the design that was presented to the traffic community as has the turning movements into um thank you thank you any any further comments on the report they moved and seconded no further comments i will ask the movies to speak again i 'll reply mr chairman i i think the comments that have been counseling have been noted but i think we did this is an issue that certainly needs um further consideration um and it 's it 'll be a that needs to be sorted once and for all as far as the activity has increased dramatically up at bellevue hill and we need to make sure that all of the users are protected obviously from the homes but we also need to make sure that we do have uh good access up there if there are unforeseen circumstances such as emergency vehicles need to access it for excellence et cetera and so it 's about doing a proper assessment of all of that before we do report i 'll put the recommendation always in favor okay again declare carried out item number one sorry two from director of infrastructure and operations which is in regards to the two prime recommendations regards to directive infrastructure operation which is the fixing country roads round three and where we would specifically spend the money can i ask a question please first yes i just looked at the emails late this afternoon before the meeting and the director said to me you held out about recovering loads weren 't won 't write something to example refer to this through the chair that 's number four report once it 's the i o number two and it 's complete and accurate as presented thank you thank you one second any comments or questions and just like to say that the program uh if if the funding uh uh application is successful and i congratulate the director on that putting this in the uh the council will need to find other funding partners of about 25 so um but if uh if we get this funding uh it enables a number of very well used sections of road particularly joining two lots of power in a couple of places it enables um a couple of sections of roads with the vertical used to be which i incurred carrie item number three for the director of infrastructure operation four dot point recommendation in regard to the relief park and the crown reserve nanny title manager 's advice council smith 's got a hand up the school teachers got me and you just stayed behind good tensions to me yes as this is quite a complex response and as always it has been very well assessed and course but back to the 1930s also so it 's good to see that another event more important and larger proud reserves is um it 's going to where the the plan will come through hopefully this is another of these uh reports draft plans for consideration and it goes through a long process and i congratulate staff on doing a great job and um and we forward to the next history list yes i just like to uh comment that this is also important uh we i think have always uh gatherings that uh we would like to upgrade some uh toilet system toilets for over in this section and probably uh probably uh it 's it 's probably important that this this uh actually happened before um any changes are made to the toilet block over there i know also that the eagle needs some repair too so um whether or not you 've got to refer to the crown lands over that i don 't know but uh anyway it would be good to have this through because of that thank you for the comments no questions i 'll put the resolution in favor against the turret carrier i don 't know item number four from the regular infrastructure operation who 's the recommendation in in the ceiling physique roads attack recovery money and to ensure that it 's acquitted on time and to the places that we 've said it was going to be and look forward to seeing happy thank you secretary i think this is really moving our seal road network out pretty much in most areas where we should be particularly the ben logan in the kenny 's lane area where i know there 's only kind of my potential actually there 's a fair bit of traffic getting out of that road with various people using that as a as a back route to get out to down the road something that will pick up picked up my staff um whilst was out there though i did directly you 'd have a look at mia 's road which i think might overcome finals you might like to might have something to look at that 's all but the department recommendation is fine road about providing fifty seventy thousand dollars from the carry over and 1819 race recovery funding towards roost construction and re-routing a tea tree road thank you without correction i 'll now go to the da-47 australia 2021 mr mayor this has been referred to council because it proposes a minor variation of about 10 through the dc peak in that one side will be a bit less than 0.5 closer to the boundary than the dcp recommends it 's been justified by the opponent um because of the design of willing that if it moved it would be happening ruthless to a different boundary so there have been no objections from neighbours so i 'm perfectly satisfied that [Music] i 'll put the resolution i was in favor signify those colleagues all right [Music] the recommendation there for approval with conditions um for the record um mr oliver was going to come in and speak or address this in open forum but couldn 't get the technology sorted but i 've had no indication from him as whether there 's an issue with this from his perspective or whether don 't know it 's there he 's one of his colleagues so i 'm going to move that or something different um [Music] storage sheds would be structured there we lost five car parks it 's been justified quite expensive by the applicant that just potentially has been accident that 's not and i quite understand what we can 't move elsewhere and elsewhere of a visual mission of a very beautiful golf course so while unfortunately we will explore our parks we 're still am parking here and there 's a parking outside it 's also used at times the second waste display yes our support for council missions uh the point about uh car parks probably won 't be missed big simply because of the number of trailers go up there with with uh golf buggies on uh take up two parks and never leave nowhere yeah for the coins i 'll put the recommendation always in favor pa colleagues need to signify [Music] please established business do we have any motions or requests for motion urgency council center yeah i think um you know i see a lake report regarding the cctv um investigation in cairo so you 're you 're having to move that as a notion we deal with the matter please have a second to please counsel i know so we 'll deal with there 's a matter of urgency i 'm quite happy to be accepted as a matter of urgency having discussed with the council were right um council right you want to tell us about your emotion what your suggestion is please i think we sent something around diarrhea yeah you 've got a copy of it um um basically uh uh council investigate uh the possibility of installing cctv in certain areas of the town after discussion with the police and the carer business chamber as well as ourselves council yes thank you you got that and the report to come back that 's fine general manager we 've got that um second done thank you councillor to speak yes mr chairman i raised this after the discussion with some police the chipley police command last week they indicated cctv is a useful um useful piece of property and the culprit that 's done the criminal activity and he mentioned then that he did have a small budget to assist with this so i thought while he was thinking about it we could discuss with him in the business chamber what might be available and um he did have some idea what type of cameras are the best suited not the models really just what they can do and um i think it 's something we need to get to um just protect our assets and uh any people that are doing the right thing in certain areas that can be uh interfered with by someone else other than that it 's just uh bringing us up to speed with what we we do to eliminate certain events in the in the shire and uh although their report said that things were static they seem to be a base level of time that 's acceptable over five years and it doesn 't increase the matters wouldn 't ever decrease the budget but it is a bonus but we 'll never get to zero but uh i think that 's i think this is um a great initiative and i 'd like to see it go ahead and care just not only for deterrent but also safety of people in the streets as well um other regional parks has done really worked well with cctv like to see it happening cara as well absolutely thank you mr chairman uh i 'm certainly happy to support the recommendation but i think that the uh the report that does come back to council needs to fully incorporate not just the generous offer perhaps from the police that have a small capacity within their current budget to have this looked at but um that the current expenditure i think is really really important as far as this is concerned if it 's it 's going to be installed it needs to to make sure that it not only does the job now but it does a job into the future but therefore it needs to be properly modded and properly maintained and there 'll be a cost associated with that which we do need to it needs to be part of any report and um i 'd like to see once the consultation has been done in the investigation had been done if there is a a positive recommendation that they 'd be investigated by health business defender and all interest to exactly not only um the recurrent expenditure but we should best face the uh candidates i think it 's important that we look at vulnerable organizations as well as making extremes different practices so i 'd like to see instantly escape support this and i think the police didn 't indicate that the media we had it would indicate that we would probably have a conversation with them about [Music] i think in terms of also a conversation around alcohol free zones in some of the parts what that might look like as well so but i think to formalize it is a good move and i acknowledge council right i don 't know if police have a big budget for this but there could be other grant funding out there which will kind of time we see around public safety and health and well-being which may lend itself to this ongoing we can 't expenditure valor the other point it 's going to be who 's going to monitor it and what house it can operate there are all conversations with the police the vicious chamber i think i 'll stress with this so the council is not suggesting that there is any great amount of lawlessness out there but it 's simply a matter of trying to work for our community and work in conjunction with the police to help them i think it 's just a matter of another tool if it comes to fruition which can be utilized in conjunction with the police and there 's another another tool not necessarily a sledgehammer approach to discipline and there will be other points of view in regards to the cgt cct footage as well third comments one reply mr chairman army writer replies um i support what council miller said probably except for the police budget i don 't think it 'll be a very big budget but if they do put a few dollars in it 's um they 've got to be the skin in the 're going to know it costs everything and here we go thank you thank you thank you council right i 've put the resolution all those in favor against i 'll declare it carried um i ducked there was no late reports from council officers i assumed with that one fellow manager [Music] operations into closed

public forum no public forum mr chairman nobody 's registered for the forum thank you in which case we will move to the agenda itself and we will firstly start with um confirmation of the minutes to the meeting held the 12th of 11th of may sorry thank you any comments on that i 'll sign those that show an accurate record i 'll put the resolution all those in favor all right all right against i will declare it carried we will now move to the director 's reports and the first direct report is from the director of corporate services in regards to the investments uh i 'll i 'll move it councillor smith i wasn 't watching the council that someone on a second place councillor walsh thank you any comments or questions on this yes um yeah right council alright ted just a question um item number three general fund base um balance we got nearly eight million dollars sitting there 1.9 odd million dollars in the czech account and six million is that six million to be spent in the foreseeable future quickly or it seems to be a lot of money to have on call that 's all through the chair the balance and the call account would only be there based on council 's immediate cash flow needs i can 't give you the details off offhand i can take that on notice what those requirements are but the intent is that any surplus funds are at the best rate possible in a term deposit based on thank you it just when you add that onto our other investments it sort of increases it to nearly 32 or 3 million that 's all it 's really a 30 increase which is which is good in one respect yeah thank you through the chair i can add that we 've recently received the advanced grant payment financial assistance grade that would have added i believe to the tune of about 2.4 million dollars to the balance of the money thank you any further comments or questions if i just might comment mr mayor it 's obvious that um you know could be grant money that 's still waiting to be spent so thank you i 'm sure there 'll be a number of explanations councillor smith do you wish to comment or said from the director of corporate services is original art gallery policies um any comment on that any updates from the director perhaps any comments on that um i think your director is going to make a couple of for one comment anyway through through the chair i 'd like to draw a note to uh an absence of a word um on the second page uh under policy review this policy policy shall be every four years uh absent and i will make that uh conclusion thank you councillor fagan you were asking a question or going to move this or i i 'll move that with a change i really don 't think um on page three and item one under areas of areas collecting and collection development the word uv ray i don 't believe it means it explains it very self very well um well i don 't think we need the word israel of work of important artists i think we need to don 't i think it 's so you 're playing you 're happy to move it to go up the exhibition but with that change of a uh you change the word with the appropriate phrase to describe it yep yes absolutely do i have a secondary section councillor walsh councillor fagin you used to speak at all um look i i think this is actually quite you know it 's exactly what we 're supposed to be doing with these policies is that reviewing them and to fit the times i think this is actually uh i 've read it and i can 't see anything blaringly obviously bad about it so it 's must be good um there is uh that that word just stuck out as being something out of place and probably not appropriate at that this in this policy so i 'm happy to move it and put it on public exhibition i 'm sure if anyone 's interested they will be um able to comment publicly thank you councillor walks you in the comments i generally speaking i was um in favor of the the document the one query i had which i spoke to the director about uh before the meeting was that there is nothing in that about the public art committee and the gallery director 's relationship with that committee and etc however the director assures me that there will be further work done on that and that could well be added to the policy later on um in fact perhaps even the director might like to explain that in better words than i have thank you councillor and through the chair uh councillor walsh 's comments were related uh specifically to the sculpture park council may remember that when they endorsed the acquisition of the sculptures from macquarie uni that they also instructed that gallery director and myself engaged public art advisory committee to come up with the best operating model for the sculpture park and and bring that back to council that work is still in progress and uh still needs to be brought back to council so uh so far as that the um the policy does not comments yes mr mayor i 'll get council on nodes did your hand up cancel the names yeah i just want can i um just ask confirmation of what um councillor pagan was talking about where what page are we up to with what we were talking about ufra uber i and the general manager i think we actually looked we actually looked at up assassins manager might be able to throw the explanation can you i 'm fine with the word i just don 't know where it 's at well it 's on on page three counseling number under 1.2 collection policy objectives specifically under 1.21 all right yes sorry about the pen clicking colleagues councillor smith um a couple of questions uh referring firstly to the introduction on page 27 of the ipad and item three which talks about various disciplines and and this um update has eliminated um one discipline which was already there which is craft and i 'm just wondering why that i understand that the practitioners of various disciplines including so it 's not an exhaustive list but i 'm just was there list through the chair i i 'd need to take that on notice i don 't under i don 't have a reason for that okay well if if you could that would be great and the other um and and more important question um and i just can 't_''_670.24 uh okay yeah it 's on page 27 of the ipad and it is items three um which talks about being mindful of sanctions governing um biological or geological material in terms of quarantine and that sort of thing and it 's it 's similar in a way to 0.4 below it but 0.4 which talks about being mindful of religious sanctions um particularly of indigenous cultures um point four says the gallery will not exhibit objects in breach of their sanctions whereas point three above it just says that the gallery will be mindful of sanctions and while i certainly trust our current director and our gallery director and so on um who knows future i 'm just wondering why it doesn 't say and will not exhibit objects uh collected in breach of those sanctions direct do you take it on yeah okay so maybe if we could just um have particularly of of that item three um because i think that that 's that 's very important and that we make it absolutely clear so if we could have something um before the next meeting that would be great in terms of the intent there further comments oh just a question please have your question and i 'll come to councillor yeah all right um can i get clarification the recommendation said that we adopt the draft policy with councillor fagan said it was going on public exhibition which is um what are we doing um mr chairman through the chairman the intent would be just to adopt it there 's no need for this to be placed on public exhibition right thank you thank you councillor miller um mr chairman well firstly i with response to that that comment from the young general manager i would be concerned about it not going on public exhibition to be honest with you but the question i have firstly before i make some comment of it is who actually concern i have with it mr chairman is is that it appears to me that it faces a whole lot of expectations on the a volunteer organization the which is the advisory committee to basically have overall responsibility of directing the director of the gallery director i 'm talking about without any need to have any consultation at all with council except there 's one small mention here and i have a i guess a fundamental problem with that because we 're overall we are going to be held accountable for this really important um cultural um area of of our town and our shire so i just and perhaps that 's been done deliberately or perhaps it 's been done by just just a um i don 't know why that 's been done to be honest with you but i 'd like an explanation for that um because um i think that you know with what did happen up at the the um the sculpture park and all the rest of it it certainly demonstrated to me that we do need some at least a requirement that there that would be taken by the subcommittee as i read it now basically the subcommittee directing or consulting with the the gallery director and and that 's as far as it goes except if they want some extra funding or something like that which they would make a submission and come to council so maybe i 'm jumping at shadows here but i just think that we need that clarified mr direct do you want to comment any of those questions through the chair i 'd say that in response to councillor miller 's comments that the policy hasn 't substantially changed from what it was previously endorsed by council the director of the gallery does operate under a strict budget and any major acquisitions or spend uh does need to be endorsed uh through council so council does still maintain uh that control over the gallery so far as a from a financial perspective the advisory committee is i understand is a 355 committee and does have a counsellor representative on that committee and although uh councillor is correct so far as uh the members of the committee of a monthly basis and council has oversight through those mechanisms well yeah councilman thank you thank you mr mr tim danny i 'd make on that is that i i i don 't think there is some significant changes here whilst it could be taken that a lot of the changes are cosmetic because they referred to now the gallery director whereas before they referred to the director and certainly there would they would it 'd be reasonable to assume that the director would be in this instance yourself before this change because you would be held accountable so i think that that 's why i think this this is a significant change from where it was until now and we need to get that that clarified in my view through the chair i 'm unaware of the history um prior to this if the director of the gallery was still referred to as the director or that 's been a more recent change um i 'm happy to take the counsellor 's comments on board in regard to that um ultimately uh myself and the general manager would be 't have pedantic here well i guess i have been pedanted here mr chairman but i but to me we 've got an assurance but i mean from you michael and i accept that i really do accept that however the document doesn 't reflect that in my view um sorry i mean i 'm are you in a way i the conversation short at all but there are probably three options one is we just do nothing with this and send it back for the consideration there 's a motion on the books that we we accept this but i think that the intent of that was that it was to be a draft and hearing them move and secondly and knob their head so they 're going to shake their heads or they thought it was a draft so what we would go to council would be a draft we can either look at the information maybe next week or we can send this to the council meeting with the knowledge we can actually make some amendments and clarify some issues before before it goes to the council on we put on the out as a draft mr chairman i just wonder i mean there seems to be some uncertainty about the intent whether we heard the general manager say the intention was that we would approve it tonight and recommend the county council for approving now are we are we saying that or are we saying that uh it 's to go to council for council to decide whether to put it out on public exhibition or not what do we should we do i think i think it 's i think it 's for us to determine whether it gets adopted directly or whether we want to put it in a public exhibition so if we we as a council want to put a public exhibition that should be where it goes and i was just looking at the move and the secondary if that 's what they were their intention of an understanding of the motion they were putting and they were both nodding and that 's where they that 's directionally they thought it should be known um i 'm happy with them to to be honest i thought it was going out to public exhibition and i don 't know where i 've got that from but i didn 't think it was but okay so i and and look and taking on board what bruce is saying there is um there is no recognition of the um fact that it 's i don 't i can 't see any recognition the fact that uh it is a 355 committee and the director is under the responsibility of the director um the director of the gallery is the responsibility of director of cooperative services and that hasn 't been that 's not indicated in this um maybe we can put something like that in that it 's a you know this uh the gallery is is um that but i don 't know whether that 's suitable or not i can 't tell you that um i can only have we we have a emotion and given the fact that we 're going to put that onto a public exhibition um if we want to do something different then we better better sort 's intending to go there appears to be a need for some conversations between now and between now they 're going to counsel for any sort of adoption or even young public exhibitions uh do you want to refer this to the information meeting or do you want to let this go through as a recommendation to council that goes on public exhibition with the knowledge the next two weeks we can make changes to what goes into the public exhibition if we remind you mr chairman can i just through you could i ask the director as to how time sensitive it is is it time sensitive or can we have another just defer any decision on it have a discussion about it and then it can come to the um the july council meeting or the july committee meeting and then the july council meeting and it may well be that we adopted at that stage who knows but i think it through the chair it 's not time sensitive per se and i 'd be more than happy to take it offline and speak with the councillor to be technically correct and follow me procedure we would either have to deal with the motion that 's on the books and defeat that i guess or or the movement second that could withdraw the motion if they remind her i 'm happy to withdraw the motion and just wait inside there councillor wash councillor you had your hand up yeah i am happy to do that i think we can draw the motion and make uh for um further consultations so you 're you 're happy then to withdraw the motion and seeing you 've moved and seconded you 'd be happy that i 'm getting worse in your mouth but you 'd be happy then to note the report and the there be further further consideration prior to coming to council in july yeah um so that 's what we 're now voting on does anybody want to add to that or add comments around where we 're going yeah i thought the yeah i thought the motion was just to adopt a draft the draft of the of the policy itself that was amazing that was who were adopted for the purpose of going on public exhibition where we got to the move and the second up but in light of the conversations we 've had the recommend that that motion has been withdrawn and the movement sector have now moved to for the matter to be noted which will go the council meeting to be noted and the matter to be go directly to the july council meeting that makes sense um just about just a clarification mr chairman it wouldn 't go directly to the july council when there 'd be some consultation and uh i would report the intent would be that it would come to the committee meeting in july is that what your intent was yep that 's what i think go through the committee meeting and we can include a couple of things such as the public art policy and some sort of uh oversight by the director of corporate services and council in that and changed the words slightly um so that could come to the july committee meeting and maybe the friends of the gallery too yes yes this would direct the general manager got that recommendation comfortably everybody comfortable where we 're going comment just a question please so we 'll be coming to the information meeting next weekend uh next week or we 're left with any any changes or any questions about how we interpret things to just go straight to the director i would think it 's an offline job to the director directly keep everybody else in the loop and it will come back to being correctly pointed out coming through the committee meeting in july right thank you i 've got it right i think at the end okay yep does anyone wish to speak at all some up write a reply no i think it 's an opportunity to include some of the things the matters have been raised i think it 's a good opportunity to commit to include those things and come back to us for further um it 's it 's it 's it 's okay it just needs a bit of help a bit of uh adjustment little love okay with that i 'll put the resolution next item is from the director of infrastructure and operations is the southern lights led streetlight implementation there 's also a report on this at centroclass yes yes thank you um i i see we 're receiving and noting this information looking at the background there are a couple of options there in terms of funding full council funding and initial funding by essential energy with payments by council are we at some stage going to be asked to vote on those options is is this um is is our discussion now going to be the basis of a uh a further report to council uh through the chair the the paragraph there on page one indicates that the uh draft operational plan includes the contribution towards the led funding by essential energy so i wasn 't proposing to council to give them another report just to give them this is the information required to kick the project off so mr mayor if if i may as i still am not entirely sure that that that that means that we are um proposing to um to repay i think the annual funding as a repayment rather than an upfront contribution is that correct uh that 's that 's correct so the model the model from essential energy is ten years of uh annual repayments yeah okay thank you okay does someone move the recommendation or something different please yes i 'll move it mr man thank you council of commissioner councillor node thank you um do you honestly counsel a better right you had a question or a comment yes uh just a question um it says that we can 't loan fund this because we don 't own the um the street lights within the um essential energy funding model they 're going to increase the rent to us to cover the for 10 years to cover the the cost of the of the capital um the capital items so therefore we have we we would owe them we are buying them and what about the street lights in the main street we had to pay them we had to buy those new ones in the on the center strip of the main street because it wasn 't covered street lights but we don 't through the chair the the ones in kendall street are a privately owned set of lots by council so council owns those led lots uh the process for any other street light is that they 're owned by essential energy we pay them to install them so this is this is uh this program is for the uh all the other street lights rather than that private one in kendall street which we own what about the street lights in target car parked and so forth we were going to take them down one stage when we 'd had the thing because they weren 't going to do the car park up so we were going to take our lights out so do we own those lights or is that we 're just playing we 're just playing strong arm where are we in the in the target car park oh i think there 's three essential energy poles and the uh there 's a set of poles on the council what used to be the lachlan hotel land but it 's now council which would be theirs so when we get these led lights they don 't just put a new bold lighting system on the existing pole they put new poles up do they uh they 'll put what 's the whole fitting changes so you can 't you can 't retrofit like a [Music] mercury vapor lamp or something like that you 've got to put put a whole new head on it but you can use the pole can you yeah the arm and the pole would remain all right all right it 's good does it move does it move wish to speak council speak i 'm sorry um well uh i actually have a couple more questions rather than than wanting to speak i think it 's uh you know by and large fairly self-explanatory two questions if i may refer to the end of it and one is the option for the smart controller and i just wonder through you to the director in a minute if we could have an explanation which we 've probably had before and i 've forgotten i apologize as to what go without that option and the second question again through you to the director is in the last paragraph uh we 're going to do a review of the existing street light fittings across the network and i 'm just wondering what that review will entail and what is the purpose of it uh so starting with the second question first councillor the um uh what was reported to centroc was that um it 's not central central jail is that council should consider engaging graeme moore who is the consultant who has done um most of the negotiations for the central uh new south wales jo in terms of setting up the southern lights stuff so we 've we 've asked for a fee proposal for graeme and he 's going to come along his job will be to um audit our lots if you like um and ensure that the fittings that we replace to do the job a fit for purpose if you like [Music] okay and and the smart controller the smart controller is a um allows the dimming of the streetlights um the the uh jl is that by the time our led rollout um comes about it 's unlikely that that part of the deal will be finalized so we would be in the same position as say about the city council who may have to look at retrofitting that if they want to do uh street light dimming into the future okay um thank you for the questions council members you got you got you got your microphone off i 'm learning to pick with someone to talk and get your microphone off i haven 't mine 's on oh sorry on i 'd look at the red light and mr chairman i guess it 's just for clarity 's sake around the resolution i would have thought whilst we 're budgeted for this amount that we 've not at any stage approved um the go ahead so this resolution really should be if we we adopt a record a recommendation that we spend this amount of money with an understanding there 'll be there 's there 's likely to be a variation once the the review that 's just been spoken about i mean this here doesn 't_''_2056.8 basically say anything other than that we note the report and it says that we we may you know we 're certainly going to be up for this option which is the um so you 're suggesting we note the report and endorse well that 's that i think if we 're going to spend the money we 've actually budgeted but if we haven 't been to my recollection we haven 't agreed to that to date um i mean there 's 30 million dollars in draft budgets yeah we haven 't adopted to spend it all yet i realize that i 'm just looking for without sort of putting words in anybody 's mouth just trying to find a way that we just no just a question then we 're at their council right well it 's a question following on from bruce 's like bruce has made a very good point are we suggesting that we just endorse the expenditure of the the money or we endorse the program or i 'm just trying to look at it well mr chapman uncertain to be honest with you there is some uncertainty around what the final cost will be at this stage so i mean it 's very clear that um if we commit to if we note this report and if that means that we 're committing to the 20 443 annually for the next 10 years um but there 's then it says in the last paragraph of this report and which is a good information report but it says [Music] resolution that 's all and just to clarify that the twenty thousand four four three is a one-off payment um the um uh the payback to essential energy if you like is is uh funded through um electricity savings we 'll we 'll save money by installing led lights for the first for the first 10 years of the program we won 't save as much because some of those savings will be um taken by essential if that makes sense yep yep then i think the general manager might comment peter um yeah thanks mr chairman um there seems to be a bit more smoke so the the or less putting into uh essential energy a fee for getting this ready to adopt and when they change the lights over the payments will go through our current street light payment system which is an automatic payment system under our budget so we won 't be really officially seeing what it costs uh through the chair possibly the best explanation is on page 34 of the ipad and if you have a look at that table and the far right hand column of that table it talks about the annual savings street lights to be upgraded by leds by council your annual savings in power cost is around 144 thousand dollars yeah street street lights funded by essential our annual saving is forty thousand dollars that 's only for the first ten years and then and then our annual savings will go up to that hundred and forty four thousand dollars does that clarify that yeah but that 's all that thank you for that but that 's all terrific i guess i 'm just just wanting to clarify what we 're i don 't think we should be should be adopting a resolution tonight that we recommend to council lake expend this money general manager do you want to chop on that one yes mr chairman i mean you you could still have a resolution to note the report but yeah in line with councillor miller 's thinking there you could also have a second resolution uh that in relation to the bulk led the bulk street light replacement uh program proposed by essential energy that council adopt the essential energy funded model uh words to that effect i suppose is what councilman miller i think he 's talking about and and i and i assume thank you for that paul but i assume that that means along the lines of what that 's consistent with what um the director has just said yes so all i want to do is have the record the recommendation clear and concise and transparent if those words do that that 's fine but if you haven 't got a mover mr chairman yet i don 't think you have have you i mean a second yeah mr mayor as uh you reading was that councillor smith moved that and council note which i believe seconded yeah resolution along the lines of the general manager 's suggestion the second dot point yes we 'll tidy that up that 's what i know who said we 'll tidy that up what happened then i didn 't hear the tidy enough but i think i think that the terminology was probably the recommendation will be will be worded well so what am i saying what 's the second dot point please mr general manager can you run that again please yes mr chairman it was me that said we 'll tidy it up because the words i perhaps offered a moment ago weren 't quite as concise as what they need to be but words to the effect of that that in relation to the proposed bulk streetlight upgrade that council adopt the council sorry the essential energy funded model and it could refer to this particular item of correspondence as i say i haven 't got the word in there but i think that 's the intent okay happy with that thank you you councillor smith is everybody clear now what the recommendation is saying i 'm not all that clear i 'm um you know i think i 'd speak against it till i get more clarification that on i don 't know if it 's on page 34 or 33 the ipad and that that table that we just referred to about the savings and it says the table below provides a revised cost estimate inclusive new funding support provided by the new south wales government now street lights to be upgraded to leds by council which i presume what we own is 1393 total capital costs payable to essential energy of 729 000. 140. so is that by council or by the new south wales state government someone have someone else through the chair just to explain it uh number of upgraded graded luminaires 1393 that 's the same in both rows because that 's all the street lights in cara uh the one there that says total cost payable to essential energy if uh council um was uh paying for it up front the total cost payable to essential i 'm put i 've put in the report the twenty thousand four hundred and eighty three consistent with the um [Music] with the uh draft operational plan the annual savings on the far right column uh 144 thousand dollars savings in street lighting bills if we uh pay the 729 up front um if we pay the 20 000 up front every year we 'll save 40 000 in our street lighting bills um councillor smith do you are you happy to leave your right reply your comments to the right reply um yes council loves you to speak at this point i 'm happy councillor walsh i can see your hand up yes just a question um i take it then from uh what uh the director is saying that this doesn 't also apply to the villagers the streetlights and the villages is that correct uh through the chair my understanding is it 's all of all the street lights in the local government area good good if you did man just mention cara yeah any 233 in the car or local government areas in the shire don 't think it 's necessary i 'll put the resolution all those in favor aye against all right declare it carried item number one from the director of environmental services the modification da1 affords back 2018. uh mr chairman i 'm going to mute mine and i 'll just i 'll walk out of the room thank you and if you like i 'll text you to when it 's back on councillor walsh we 're going to yeah yes mr mayor councillor smith thank you to speak councillor walsh yes the uh changes indicated uh very minimal and um as indicated in the report i think um it only improves what was already approved so um i think uh i 'd recommend council mr council for approval council smith uh no mr mayor nothing to add really any further comments write a reply i 'm just trying to find a very number um i will put the resolution in favor please so i can see your hands all right um we got them all yep yes thank you claire that 's against there 's nobody so unanimous and ring i 'll send the carrier pigeon we 'll just hold 30 seconds while we 're getting back we put some smoke out the chimney it 's mr mayor while we 're waiting hello i 'm back i got the text thanks paul i got the text counselor smith do you want to raise something organized later no i was just going to ask um and it 's um you may deem it inappropriate we had no apologies i haven 't seen

any defamatory or offensive remarks or gestures made during the course of this meeting there is nobody registered for public forum so we 'll move on to page three of the ipads where we deal with the agenda sorry the conference confirmation of the minutes of the meeting held 15th of june 2021. someone be happy to move those minutes please thank you do we have any comments on those at all or can we put those as a true and accurate record leave no comments i 'll move that baby put as a true and and then go to the agenda proper and first first of our three reports is to note the investments in financial report to june 2021 there 's a recommendation about that with the backyard documentation provided so i wish to move that the show noted well thank you second to please council of fagin you 're putting your hand up thank you i am i have a question as well take the question yes go with the question um just as far as the investments go i note that on the um on our loans and the purposes of loans and things we have noted what the loans are for um i know we have quite a large number amount of investment in um 27 million worth of investment and i know that is a lot of that is actually uh for projects and grant money that we 've already uh marked for further spending i was just wondering if we could have some indication i know the waiangla sewer handover money is in there but could we have more indication of how much of this money is actually earmarked think it 's a little bit more a little bit deceiving or not setting not said at all a little bit um unsure of how much money we actually have to spend on um or even just a breakdown maybe not on the on the um investment portfolio but just a breakdown um included in this investment report to say or in this report to say that we do have this much money and it is already allocated mr chairman we i could put that question to the director who 's also an apology this evening he 's unwell but uh typically we don 't record on a monthly basis what 's tight and untied funds uh that best comes around quarterly so it 's i would be surprised if it 's feasible to do that uh with anything other than as councillor fakers indicated the money that is set aside for the weinberg sewer treatment plant works yeah okay um well we do get that in a quarterly report maybe we could include this you know in some part in the fact that we have got these funds invested you reporters yes please yes i was going to say actually that the um reserve any comments about it to the final financial position is given uh in the next month 's um quarterly budget review which will be up until the end of june i think um everything that i can see there otherwise is satisfactory considering the year of the year that we 've been through thank you any further comments now for the comments okay we 'll move on councillor you need to write a reply no thank you probably not i 'll put the resolution in favor against the declarative number one from the director of infrastructure and operations is in regards to the procedure tender for project management services for the pool so i wish to move that or something different council leave that please thank you no second employees council knows council of smith here to speak um mr merrill i 'll i have a couple of questions just as to making sure i understand how it all works um and i 'll i 'll then observe a writer reply that 's okay okay director confirming that we are looking to appoint a project manager now who will get everything ready for um all the documentation ready for when we are ready and also undertake any grant application uh is that correct i 'm not sure whether that 's correct um and then the the project manager will sort of go into recess until such time as as we 're ready to proceed whenever that is is am i right in what i 'm surmising uh through the chair i would say that 's correct we do have a grant officer who would probably um prepare the grant applications but the project manager would be providing the bulk of the information to that grant application okay and if i may just follow up follow that up mr mayor would we be paying the project manager a retainer to remain in our books until we needed that that personal company again before you answer can you before you answer can you turn your volume up a little please how 's that feel a bit more if you could did you find the right button councilman any rate the um they wouldn 't be getting paid to retain a no but they would they would uh be keen to stay on board because they 'll get paid when the second stage of the project comes off underway the actual construction okay thank you and just confirming that the 50 000 that we have in our budget will cover the project management at least for the interim period we presume that 's that 's the intention and um we 'd be hopeful that that 's um but we will have to uh where whatever the market comes back with i suppose thank you mr mayor catherine i hope you second this do you want to speak you 're muted [Music] i think it 's prudent that the project managed to be sought because i think on a project such as this having someone with a background in uh doing that sort of work is well worth while having um yeah obviously it 's well listed as to what needs doing the filtration plant upgrade the liner for both pools and this and the splash pill the estimate very very well put there that the project will only go ahead though at 50 grand funding can be can be achieved and that 's that is what council had decided when when the project was put to us back about last september i think it was so uh and the role of the project manager is well described on page 26 of the ipad so uh i think i think this is um an excellent way to go about it so further comment that we 're we 're in line with um councillor nades trying to help you through the technical issues council of plague and council of walsh our council of faking their council will repeat the right sorry oh okay um just um you mentioned dirk that there 's something happening in griffith is that where you this sort of idea came from and i know they 're called in and so you 've obviously seen this in action and it seems well i 'm very unfortunate great idea and i think we don 't have the manpower or the expertise to do this type of very 'm really pleased that we 're going to do this but um you mentioned griffith so is that something that has been done before for them in researching through the chair and researching our various uh councils who had used the mirth technology for their pool renewal so contacted griffith council and this this was a methodology they used to deliver their pool reconstruction project thank you wright i did say you go to your next but council know so there 's a secondary i 'll go to council letter right now i 'll connect the council notes if he 's gone yep that 's cool yeah just one question um what 's the superintendent 's services that are renewal what 's that what are they going to superintend it sounds like the operation of the pool so that 's the superinten uh superintendency roles in the contract delivery of the design and construct contract uh rather than supervision of the pool pool operation right thank you it 's been a long time since something has happened down there and it 's and it 's been long overdue and on just going to comment i think it 's exciting it 's a positive step it 's the right direction forward and i hope that it 's picked up the council and the photograph council we 've been talking about it for some time getting this plan right getting it organized i think it also gives a commitment to the community as to what we are going to do down there including uh retaining the toddler 's pool as well as the doors of splash park which was a tighter splash pad i 'm sorry um so the best of both worlds i think it 's not been built yet but it 's a step in the right direction and part of the process to to move forward with what council has been talking about and can you do further comments right reply thanks mr mayor yes i agree with councillor fagan that this is the way to go um i think it 'll be a cost saving really to employ someone who has experience in pool reconstruction and and the in particular and finally just for what it 's worth three um grant to council being used for the pool is worthy of discussion i 'll put the resolution in favor declare it carried unanimously item number one from department of environmental services and there 's a big document big document which has three there are three dot points to it which is essentially to the recommendation to put the comprehensive dcp for 21 on public exhibition i 'll move then i 'll second it capture the world council of fagin thank you council of the world could you speak thanks mr mayor there 's some a couple of points to raise i think uh certainly this is to put the draft uh out on uh public uh for public comment for 28 days and it 's also i think very expedient to also put the lep 2012 out at the same time because uh they really when you read through the the the draft dcp_._939.199 it uh the it and the lep walk hand in hand um one one would not be able to work without the other i don 't think and uh certainly it 's um uh those affected by it but perhaps those who might be might think they might be affected by it in the future to please take a look at this you might only need to read the sections that you know are interesting you that or could affect you but i think please please uh we do need the public 's comment on it the aim is is to review the existing document and update where necessary revise and add where necessary uh i know too though that the key issues are on page 30 and particularly uh note also the inclusion of part c part c provides guidance for assessments that have biodiversity impacts a summary of all the changes is on page 30 attachment 1 page 32-35 i think if any members of the community want to find a particular part of the document they could certainly as well as using the index they could well have a look there it just gives a brief summary of what the changes are with that i commend it to the community to offer their comments uh yes i 'd like to um if i could putting on the on exhibition as well the local environmental plan 2012 we aren 't expecting people to comment on that are we um through the chair um i 'll need to just um just make sure that we don 't have any legislative um issues with notifying them both together but no that 's not that 's not in any way being commented on it is just the dcp yeah so it 's we 've got to make that clear that it 's actually the tcp that we 're asking for submissions on and that the lep 2012 is actually just to make it more relevant is that that 's the case yes that 's the case okay thanks um and also just congratulations i think it 's a great document i 've said that before it 's um very easy to read if you 're interested in planning so um it has got lots of bits and pieces to it and i 'm sure that people who are interested in their neck of the woods or their part of town that will be affected by this because there are some very detailed items in here and streets identified and different things identified and if people have you know a small amount of time they could actually find those parts of the dpcp and they should read them so i commend this to everybody and hope that we have a an interesting conversation with the community thanks for the comments councillor smith thank you um yes i i do uh commend the director and her staff for what has been quite a monumental operation despite the fact that there are no major changes to some parts i 'd like to comment specifically on the really the discussion of whether we should put part c 2 that is the the biodiversity controls for areas that are non non-rural on public exhibition and it 's something that the director has asked us about i 've had a read of them i 've had a read of the advantages and the disadvantages and the director 's comments and uh really given that we it 's quite a complex issue we don 't appear to have staff with the expertise and also that i don 't believe that it is a big problem with you now shine i would personally be in favor of eliminating it from the public exhibition because i think it 's likely to cause what may will be needless angst yeah peter wright um councillor smith 's um seem a bit confused by all that but um there is a certain amount of um biodiversity control on the existing dcp process um it 's got to be done on on town development um it 's often only desktop but um i i don 't know if we should be deleting that because someone might make a comment on it um just a question can i just clarify that sorry peter it 's only one section of the biodiversity chapter it 's only where it applies to urban areas for the uh state environmental planning policy vegetation urban vegetation not the duty was commenting on the not the entire chapter thank you um just get my head around the lep has to be adopted first and then the dcp is created to allow the objectives of the am i on a bit of a right sort of a track there or not the director through through the chair um well not really a dcp is a non-statutory document the lep is the statutory document basically the dcp 's forms local provisions yeah all right thank you for the comment i 'm councilman i was just wondering if council smith was moving an amendment to the motion but she 's not yeah i was a bit perplexed about it and i think the other thing is this goes out on top of the exhibition so we have a chance to review it and amend it ourselves on public exhibition this goes out and probably exhibition for 28 days we 've adopted an important nice time for public exhibition at a council meeting so we can discuss and clarify that point between now and the council meeting anyway um and secondly even if it 's on on public exhibition doesn 't mean to say that council is not in a position to make further comment either as a council or as as individuals in terms of the areas we which do arise over the next few days few weeks as we look more closely at it you got to all right you were i just um to put it out if if it has got a if what council smith 's saying could make things difficult for the urban development it 'd be better not to put it out there to start with because if it goes out there it is a good strong support for it because it 's on the internet and everyone 's looking at it we might be able to um put in a submission to have it taken out if we think it 's wrong so i think we need to have a decision before the council meeting on if it is relevant to them our dcp or not i 'm not going to speak for councillor smith but again i think that my reading was that she was putting something after conversation not maybe an amendment it 's something we need to continue to watch and consider councillor smith i 'm not quite sure but i that 's correct that 's what i if we had some discussion of it next week yep that can be arranged i 'm sure he might he might actually talk to the director about what what that conversation might look like for the information meeting please any further comments that for the comments council of offshore movement you 're assuming you 're a reply thanks mr mayor um i don 't see any reason to delay it and i certainly wouldn 't agree unless there 's good reason to raise i wouldn 't see any reason to amend it either i also once again just urge um various people for example the traffic committee and the access committee i think there 's a lot in that that they might care to read and comment on and but certainly the ratepayers i would hope that they um [Music] at least i offer some comments that um we we don 't pick up everything that might be need to be discussed so it 'd be wonderful if we do have comments from people about um just uh anything that is what is concerning them uh i also thoroughly agree planning and environment deserve a big uh congratulations for this document that 's been put in front of us business so we will _"

meeting you either comment a question I just yeah even it 's there 's different people listening tonight I think our positions has been maintained fairly well under they do to the it has been impacted slightly by the co-ed die Dean and so forth but I think management 's got things in place and we we seem to be um holding our level of liquidity that similar to what it was previously and we just got a word for word thank you for the comments rod reply unnecessary up with the resolution and all that all those in favor aye instead he cleared carried over number three donation we pushed and deal it on Country Club we need a moment that 's a lot of it right that you think in there you know saying I heard a voice somewhere yeah no thank you any comments or questions on this once again it was discussed in committee and I it 's a and I think with the way things are at the moment for small organizations like the building on Country Club it is a really good thing for council to the other the comments before Sharri asif the recommendation all those in favor gently clear carried on to number four donation request cameras Tedford the recommendation their donation 50% for the high fees back to move that please means taking account to the wealth they commit to a question mr. mayor I 'll just highlight again although we discussed it at the committee meeting that this refers to the event that was held in 2019 unfortunately there isn 't and instead for this year and it was an oversight from the esteemed committee that they didn 't ask but it 's something that we have have always done and I 'm happy to do it again for the comments in favor my against you Tara carried on another five investment policy recommendation a we 've got the draft investment policy yes torch a question yes this policy if adopted will incorporates the ministerial investment order which council has to comply with investment and the main one of the main things of course we must always bear in mind as preservation of capital favor I 'm right again carried I remember CQC work health and safety policy look at the screen cancer and Willis is light on yeah I 'll second Bruce your light came on were you I didn 't touch anything bill okay faster than the mover I 'll move it to the right thing you taking the please hold on make you cancel the world any comments or questions on this one well once again it 's a policy that we have in place so say staff know what what they need gives them guidelines from work Health and Safety policy and also Council knows what their responsibilities what they 've had input and so forth into the into the responsibilities and understand what is necessary for the word force to a operate under a safe position thank you any for the comment the comments area wouldn 't think of resolution all those in favor all right against carried item number seven the water in New South Wales allocation councillor Smith no counselor knows thank you thank you a comment or questions on this I think we before you have had a more recent update or whenever more recent update on this yes mr. mayor it is good that we do get monthly updates and I think that the most important thing in terms of most of Cara Shire is that our allocation carers allocation remains unchanged at a full allocation and I do know that there are continuing inflows into why angular and as of today it was up to fourteen point eight percent which is a large volume of water but still we 'd be hoping for a lot more to come in there to give us a bit more security I think the the commentary around that also we are aware the management plans the river ran or the dam at Waterloo the ran through to December this year so ever even fly we 're getting it now pushing that date back substantially the decision that they exhibit all the time the question please yeah the director um did I hear right last week or since a fool or a large percentage of high security water for the next financial year on the recent dean flows I think what the through the chair what the report indicates is that there 's no based on the current level of the dam there 's no general security access until the level of the backlog quantities in the dam so that in this in the body of their report they talked about how many gigalitres that are required to allow the issue of general access water high security water is currently the report to 97 all right thank you and I see who you guys happening urban community through adversity all right there 's something like that if you 're the questions comment with the resolution all those in favor I 'm getting steady clear carried by the number-8 director environmental services and there 's gas to naming naming and renaming bridges through streets and places okay I 'm over thank you yeah I 'll say theater I think you any comments or questions on this once again at a policy that just gives guidance to council staff and regarding aiming of bridges and roads and streets and most important that this be looked on in that our emergency services of course have got to be able to identify very readily or as soon as possible whenever there 's a an emergency vehicles they had ambulance police or fire brigade they have an idea of their Maps where to go see for the comments for the comments requirement this area up at the resolution all those in favor all right again keep clear of carried item number one the Director of Corporate Services is a relationship close decisions number zero when you 've been made aware of a big arena move that please housekeeping yes mr. mayor Angela Smith thank you a second the place counselor knives thank you any questions on these but the resolution always in favor high-density Claire carries number two from the Director of Corporate Services is the weighing up sewer service service service is billing as recommendation there in terms of just noting a report which puts that a public arena and there 's a made you release being done as we speak and well remove that recommendation please anything L needs me another can do cancel the world thank you and you commit to a question mr. Merrill I 'll just say that this has been a very long process that we have worked through with water New South Wales and various other bodies and we finally have what we believe is a sewage system that will serve the needs of the town and hopefully the reflections part as well we are proposing to begin billing from the start of the new financial year I believe and I think it 's important note that one of council 's requirements was before we handover of this sewage system was that the charges for Wangler residents would be the same as the charges in the rest the Shah better commit I think it 's also mr. mayor if I may comment it 's important to note that yes ownership is being transferred to Council on the 1st of the 7th and with that of course comes the responsibility of running the scheme it 's also important to note that the old scheme as it was with the what we would hope in the future is continued use of the reflections holiday park and possibly also some of the houses that are up for rental in the village that the use of the old system was totally unable to cope with what was what was coming into it well I hope that even though this was going to cost the residents some money or to join the rest of the rest of or joint our council on having a sewerage system it 's something that was absolutely necessary for the environmental point of view and also particularly from the tourism point of view out there at that village and the engine reflections Park any further comment for the common thread required not necessary perhaps I 'll put the resolution all those in favor all right all right against he cleared carried on fire number three from the Director of Corporate Services easycap sport recreation plan is a recommendation there which I think it 's been formatted after our conversations last week at the fascia meeting we would cancel the Walsh Oh second the plays Hankin go on this I think it 's going on when you 've got a long way to run I think but it 's a first step if I could come and yes it is the first step and I just urge all who are involved in sporting or leisure activities in the Shire and I I specify emphasize no SCARA but they become involved in this and it it 's could have very interesting consequences and the years to come because I would suggest it 'll be this plan once once the enacted would have would be an important reference point for any applications for funding not just from state and federal government but also assistance expected by various bodies from Council as well I would also just suggest to to the various organizations in the town that are involved in or in the show that are involved in in the sport that and leisure that they it 's not just council owned organizations that are going to be part of this that 's we 're inviting everybody that there but the rugby union club be at the race race organizations also and thank you have the opportunity to have an input into it other comments just a question to the director if I may I would be assuming that when they next steps in terms of the scope and a project timeline are determined that will be something in the form part of the major projects update we get to informational meetings briefly chair yes that 's correct thank you any comments any further comments or questions on this just a question in the previous plan and that the contact officers being a been one of the community officers we then do two one or well and that 's only a shared job so it 's half a week or something um if we got another staff if that community officer hasn 't got the time to devote to this thing we have another staff who the drift toward an embryo I 'm just a brick towards that but I think that might form part of the next we 're taking on axis vertical through the chair the the initial person will be the existing community development of so who background in sport and community involvement so well-well experienced in this area thank you no I understand that I just yeah that 'll be good so the comment or question well just commenting on if I may it so some might say it might be a wish list but it 's it 's something we ought to find out from different sporting organizations what they think the need is going forward and that 's what planning is all about is how we might operate into the future and whether it 's putting a grandstander which said callous oval which goes over the dog track and the dogs can run underneath and people can sit up and it 's all wear out the aether and and it 's strange where money can come from somewhere and there 's Council of all said if we got a plan a no idea at it might come to fruition when you least expect yep all right any further comments or questions right reply put the resolution all those in favor against carried either member for proper services is the three five five committee minutes I may mr. Muir and councils will note that the account is occurring the lockdown there have been true zoom meetings held and as well Youth Council has participated in two sessions with a group called why lead why lead had been invited to come to Paris of youth week to run a full day workshop for various leaders young leaders in the community as they 've done twice before but obviously that wasn 't going to happen the Youth Council participated in these two sessions personally for their their own leadership and and to do some work on mental health and to do some work on how to take the lead in various ways in the community the comment just definitely comment oh really I really like council Smith I enjoy reading the comment that each of the members of the youth club a check I 'm feeling a check in on each other and the MDX and I think that 's very very sensible in a very very mature thing to do for a Youth Council yep thank you thank you yes you for the comment or question I am against Patera carry quite a number one director infrastructure and operations which is the grass water 16 subject the report we noted in regards to the little merry update so I move that Kevin I know Kevin Wright thank you you can till the right second dude thank you thank you any comments or questions on this was just big at all yeah this Mary 's being quite difficult for some time and we now run up the quality of the water in the bores seen an area where there is no shortage of water and I always thought that the Glossop 's I can get it out of the Cairo system thank you did you shake it we could speak can 't_''_1472.25 you get to the waltz yes I 'm familiar and I think this is the drought that we 've just made true is obviously presented us with a wonderful opportunity to secure an emergency supply for water for Karen and I this is on the early steps yet in this one of the reasons why we 're unable to place financial figures there at the and further information obviously will be given as soon as that is available it will give confidence for growth of industry and population here in Cara having this secure a secure drought supply and I emphasize secure drought supply and never years I never used the term draft about eradication or drought you know making them trying to make the point of no drought can ever affect the town again it 's just something that I think is we should seize with our hands and obviously from the report our staff are doing that for the comment mr. chairman just a couple of comments I 'm happy to note this as recommendation says but I perhaps through you to the direct that the last two dot points on six 563 I think are the really important ones where we do actually talk about either purchasing and general security groundwater share permit race for or seeking ministerial intervention that 's the advice were received on the 8th of May is there been any progress in in either of those areas tonight and through the tier we 're getting feedback on applications I 'll keep you posted but no no further information available as to how much water the regulator modelers have at least I think you can I can i I added that that that currently there 's a letter being drafted and waiting I think my signature to shame to administer willing to pay be to inform who we 're up to what we 're going and these things will be included as part of the part of let it come to a member to make sure she 's aware of where up to well wizard mr. chairman can I respectfully suggest that before you leave tonight that you saw in that letter if I can just the directors chemist staying he 's office I 'll be behind the designed it was very design but yeah and that 's part of the recommendation when he is in the report is to put that into what we 're doing and we 're give it is and to make sure the minister is fully aware and the world ye shall ask all the agencies are aware of how hard were working as I don 't pandemic and everybody knows and I think it 's not careful with bench and rain we 're not capable people will forget that war Drusilla precious commodity and I think that that you and I and all our colleagues are firmly the opinion that this is the time the opportune time to really be looking at ways of showing up carers water supply into the future I think that we 've got to continue to make use of this this natural disaster so to speak which is jumped on us but otherwise and it council the whilst you 're alluding to it will be having these folks are II the next generation will be having the same company same conversation that 's only out of the sixties and their juice generation blames the other generate the previous generations all they all their sins and all their problems so the comments yes mr. chairman if I may I support the concept and here we go project going forward with because it 's a one-off type thing it 's something you just you can 't develop you you need if you can get it to our treatment plant at a reasonable cost and so forth and how are we going to access this water and just commenting on what what councillor Miller was saying there um the minister in the intervention I presume is but you think that they 'll make an allocation to do what they did with K Dara and when they wanted water out of the Lachlan they who I am in the morning they they lived a motion to disband the amnesty on allocations and they moved to give them three and a half thousand milliliters and the top asked to they put the amnesty back on it 'll be something winters ministry intervention would be they give us an allocation but I 'd be more in favor if the minister actually bought existing allocation out of the aquifer so we wasn 't seen that we 've come in and going water that on top of what everyone else 's water is on which may reduce their allocation going forward and just that we 'd be a that they 'd be seen as a fair comment on that and I 'm not going to disagree completely accounts or the right but water is an incredibly complex scenario temperature how humidity Higa 's license our license is valid so we need to be mindful that as we move forward and when I takes you in the complex it is extremely complex for the comment like a reply put the resolution put the resolution all those in favor all right again declared carried item number two from the directive infrastructure and operations is the care yep our improvement plan and there 's a note there 's as we as a variation through the over to a while these victims I 'll signal thanks what 's me thank you you just speak ill of the world so to speak yes this is just an amendment to the plan that move so quite some time ago for stage two of the depot improvement and it 's very important particularly when you consider the current scenario of with with the coded problem of a virus problem and the amend the amendment Ani enables the separation of critical infrastructure works works water and sewer something which must be able to operate from day to day if necessary and obviously that will enable the separation of staff if if required or because of the virus further comments on intended speak very quickly in supporting this councillor Walsh has now that accurately isn 't not about creating silos in the DEP oak was something we 've worked very hard to to try and if if they were silos work very hard to make sure it 's one work force and no suggestion with one section of the work force is more important than the other was everybody in this cabin no team pandemic is incredibly important but what it has highlighted I think it 's the need to ensure that some of those who are involved with on the critical critical needs and critical supply and water sewer of course those in that critical area they were able to maintain that service in the future so planning has to be around ensuring all we possibly can do to make sure those services can continue uninterrupted and so that 's I think the catalyst should there be other other pandemics other situations to have this sort of secure area as well for the comments yes mr. chairman I I support this recommendation um I was part of the working party that was given a tour around the upgrade some three weeks ago and I was very impressed with the with the plan and how they 've been implementing it I was actually more impressed with them with the passion sewed by the employees and what they 're trying to do and here they going to achieve it and it was interesting to note that instead of knocking down a building and building another one that in a couple of years time they they 've seen the that they can save that building and implement it into this new upgrade and it should be commended for that they are actually thinking beyond just what 's currently in front of them thank you but the comments rod reply put the resolution all those in favor again clear carried this leads us now to item number ones they 've written of our metal services which is a straight 2018 which you owe me mr. chair councillor Smith so second please yeah no ii it council 930 stand up thank you mr. speaker okay yes so firstly these are very minor alterations additions to existing amenities in the last resolution but nothing of any significance which means that a these the amendment to the stage two plan doesn 't have to be put out to the general public for comment and it also means that even though council is both the owner of the and the applicant counsel does not have to ask someone else to assess this so I think it 's it 's going to give a lot more usable space which I 'm sure will be used not only during the October 19 pandemic but in a lot of other ways as well so I think that for an extra forty six thousand dollars given that there is a saving of 14,000 from the building not being demolished this is worth money worthwhile no noise but-- mr. miriam are you showing up trouble for making too much noise and flicking paper more suffer because i comments and I will put the resolution that 's a da colleague so can I ask you please shifting some you need I can set your hands raising please I declare that carried unanimously thank you let me see all the hands Thank You colleagues item number two from the director Environmental Services is CD CBE project update recommendation for knocking there I 'm happy to move it but can I ask a couple of questions please I 'll go a second or course you can yeah councillor Walter second that councilman of the floors yours Thank You mr. chairman and in first they can go congrats like the director on the progress tonight on this and this is a really good report and I 've had a lot of really good complimentary remarks made each time I walked in this room so so well done on that but I just like some clarification on you do mention in the report Kate about the count of the refurbishment of the cast-iron lights the ceiling of the of the rough work and also whether there 's an option here to look Kendall Street working overnight type you are we going to deal with that tonight or we 're just noting this and or do you what do you need a decision on those because if you do did you see if I 'm happy to move that we do I but I just online store as far as this is concerned the ceiling of the rock walls is underway so that 's fine because yeah the refurbishment of the cast-iron leads I also think he 's very important and there 's only one company that does it and they 're in Sydney and so I think that also should be done because they look you know they need they need renovation but still that 's that 's a council that 's something that I 'm taking advice on the night work yeah so I wanted to put that to Council because it is an extra thirty nearly thirty eight thousand dollars to do a week of night work the week of night work would demolish that entire side that means the night what the demolition wouldn 't take place during the has to be done on the during the day the Telstra pits need to be done G a so there 's still a significant amount of work done during the day however it may be more convenient to the shoppers and people accessing the shops to not have the excavator running all day for the next week it was hearing hearing that council member on hearing what you 're probably thinking or thinking out loud is it maybe chicken dot point if you 're on time I 'm sorry mr. mayor interrupted you know you 're right I was sort of trying to watch you and it there 's a lag there 's a lag between the noise and that the non satis the Oshima suggests that maybe is the second point but that is where you probably gotta go second point about accounts we 're proving that a variation for that particular thing the other ones I think appear to be covered Thank You mr. chairman I think two the two issues really is the cast or life 's refurbishment and also the work to be carried out for cost and if we make a change to the budget to accommodate both of those your your your happy to add that in secretaries and and the the segment is quite happy to read that to the we have heroes idea thank you you should speak now counter the Milanese block that well mr. chairman I 'll take that much as I said I was a little unsure whether the director was asking for this to be approved tonight I 'm happy to do that because I doubt what this project would be slowed down I think it says I 'd said and so it 's been really well Betty I think we should enable it to proceed as quickly as we can I agree with their comments around the cast-iron light I think they are worthy of button furbished and incumbent on us to do that and as and secondly as far as be that the week of night work I think makes purpose has made all of us know that is the busiest part of our LED without a death and if we can get that for that of stuff sorted it in that week doing it after hours makes perfect sense to me for the amount of money extra money standard cost I think it is a sensible solution to council Rock yeah it 's just a question to the director so will they be able to concrete some of those sections you thought as they actually remove the pavers the whole area will be fenced in yes with accesses into the shows yes concrete can be only done during the day yeah but I I think they one of the the only problems that people seem to be having with it is the actual noise from jackhammer if needed and also the the digger that 's the area outside their business and I think that if we can help in some way by alleviating that I that would be a good result even though it 's going to cost us an extra thirty seven thousand whatever yep but the Chancellor Smith yes mr. mayor I support the resolution as as it has been enlarged the recommendation and I think that that southern side is is a mentioned but also because it 's a side where there 's a school that backs on and so on and then there aren 't many houses around so there 's unlikely to be in effect from overnight noise I have a question through you to the director if I may regarding lead the Heritage gas bids and that is is is there a plan to put some lighting under that to just sort of highlight them make them a feature no because that would be far too complicated to get power extra power to those locations so not at this stage noise okay that 's a shame well they were actually that the design is to actually draw a light into the cellar they 're actually lights yes the prism lights actually reverse reverse the light I guess but no there 's no plans thank you for the comments yeah couple of questions first right um with the with the pavement glass boxes is that 9,000 something dollars for the five to be refurbished or is that each well it 's very good said for what 's got to be 's no leeway in our contract that these people can work at night and take that out just it 's um if they 're not working overtime I 'm only working at eight hours a day that they 'll be working during the day or something we haven 't got a variance of or is it 275 percent extra is a pretty good overtime right no I 'm just covering so the network is covering the contractors bosses cautions that 's all right also um I 'm on page 119 looks like we 've we 've drawn down nearly all the loan we 've only got about 42 K left at the loan we haven 't used any of the stronger community grant we 're at 1.5 million left you feel comfortable with that 's going to cover everything your slip yes yes well that 's good yes we have some minor variations there 's been a there 's been a number of variations already that 's all right I just summed I 'm sneaks away on us that also on page 120 page 120 where expenditure has been funded loan drawn down we 've only spent about 80,000 we 've gone 1.4 million yeah so the line gets included been expended last so we spend the grants first and so we 're just starting to tap into the loan now but it 's been drawn down it 's been drawn down so that 's not been spending that 's right not yet there 's only four hundred and fifty eight thousand left out of all the actual paid they 're paid to date on page 119 you 've gone down 1.4 37 million but the expenses after they 've been paid there 's only four hundred and fifty eight thousand left out of that one point four three seven million so there 's a fair considerable money have been spent sixty three seven four seven you mean or is it that 's that 's the line that 's one of the sorry that 's the drought communities grant you looking at the graph on page 119 showing red you 've lost be there the income right on page 119 we 've got any tongue yeah got great community grant then we got alone and we 've drawn and actually actually paid the data presume that 's what we 've drawn down yeah but then when we go down where the expenditure has been funded from on page 120 of the iPad page two of the report of the attachment B like loan drawdown is in purple yes banany looks like about eighty thousand dollars has been spent I 'm not trying to catch you in it I just prize I 'm just I can 't follow you so maybe we could come and show you because that 's the date that loan was drawn down with that amount so we have only so you 're right where 's this expenditure has been funded from then we 've only just started tapping into the loan all right Donna they talk to each other no thank you any further questions I don 't you just council right that you follow-up and the director they don 't side with Bejoy my name if you 're not quite understanding which might give you a satisfactory answer the way this is why it 's counselor Miller mr. chair no need to say that I thought our poor confidence in the director to continue up by managing this project as she has today which has been very professional and I think as far as the comments the questions we just asked it 's very clear that as far as loans are concerned we have to draw them down they sit in our bank account until we spend and that 's the case as far as this is concerned simply so well and I 'm pleased that the key is that the council is going to support the second part of the resolution which is the changes to read that the expenditure items slightly to accommodate for the cast iron Heights refurbishment and also working for that one week to demo demolish these the southern side to limit the impact as far as noise and accept was concerned so all council does support that thank you or Thank You council more I put the resolution all those in favor aye against declare carry item numbers three from the director Environmental Services is to drop locally of there that we get to a counselor wall chicken councilís me thank you you just be gentle with me again to the wall tree and they came to the wall clock Thank You mr. mayor and this is what I would suggest is a wonderful document or two wonderful documents in fact one covering Kara and the villages and then one just relating to the villages I do urge all they are right buyers that and they put it down so how to take advantage of having some comments on this because if there 's any way in which it can be improved I for one would love to hear hear any comments if there 's any any criticism moment and it 's justified once again that 'll certainly be looked at I even commented to someone the other day that I have my feel like this document now that I 'd be very happy to when I see it used as a tourism brochure for Kara so wonderful wonderful work so far I realize it 's coming out on draft exhibition and I do urge everyone to take a it 's the me I endorsed those comments it 's it 's been a protracted development and protracted in a good sense in that it has involved a lot of consultation with each of the villages on a number of occasions and of course the most part of HUMINT has to comply with government regulations which indeed it us can I just suggest talking of public exhibition given that some of what we would normally do which is perhaps more more face-to-face meetings and sending out and making available hard copies they can 't do that because of the 19 situation can I suggest that as part of the quite extensive public exhibition framework 28 days on exhibition particularly sent to the corporation and the chamber for comment as well as of course anyone in the wider community but can I suggest pleased that the a notification by email we sent to our contacts in each of the villages so that they are aware that it is available on our website and they can promulgate and publicize that within their communities so that we get as as much commentary and to this document and I get a count all the lawyers country around the world has been done by staff and in fact relations and roll down but to the community I really think we 've got to seek them to be engaged there 's so many planning documents are so many ideas that are held by state and federal government agency to stay covered agencies which I guess a perpetuated time and time again and we see the Department of Planning population figures is the classic example those sorts of figures so again our own planning statements right I think is very important that gives us a document with which we can go back to the department 's and say we understand our own region we understand what Freight Transport should look like we understand what transport should look like we understand the issues that our community needs addressed we understand and we can seek support from a region in from a state rather than city in isolation so I encourage you but to get out and to really have a good leaders doctor so the comments yes sorry often talk about we let the show we let the villages and so forth and the rural people know that you know like you are part of the shire we do look after you and about Cara but I think these these two documents actually put something on paper for now each area integrates into the show and it also if it 's adopted after the exhibition period and go through all the processes future counselors and village members will have a document to work from for the future development of the of these areas within the Shora thank you thank you Thank You councillor right any further comments I noticed we 've got councillor fighting with this welcome to council about the obviously the safety plan any further comments on this rod reply under put the resolution all those in favor I 'm against that he can carry do I think number four the directive director here I 'm not sure which would be a five spoke 2020 I 'll move mr. chairman simply councillor Miller that stuff into place second counselor noobs Thank You councillor Miller Thank You there is no doubt that in my mind that the council should accept the recommendations from director and from the department it 's between them will assess them obviously they unfortunately there does seem to be some animosity between the applicant and the objection the object also but I think that the objection has been fully considered and addressed as part of the whole process and we do consider very setbacks and adjust the boundaries pay attention on a regular basis and this is not difficult there is no reason in my mind what we should not approve it can image to speak now thank you any other comments or questions please yes did the original was the her original approval given for the shed at both stages but when the shed was built but also when the various fittings were put in it to create a toilet and bathroom no it was done under certificate the shape was Egypt wasn 't it was done so we didn 't have anything to do with it oh so that that approval was done under yeah that it actually says that in didn 't pick up the shaking better pick up the first date so I realized that but one of the things that concerns me is that when that sort of development could have its origins in that fashion as to just how whether or not we 've got enough authority to actually stop something that may be intrinsically bad for the area going into that now I also am concerned about the fact that we have tend to approve where there 's minor minor boundary setbacks needed but this is this is a bit more than a minor in the fact that it 's asking for 10 made us to be expanded out to up to 50 in other words as 1440 meters difference I just am a little bit concerned that these so often these things come to us I don 't mind where council can use its discretion and put something through but I do just want to make note of my concerns about what this what this does and what it can lead to I understand would understand that the 50 metres was there for spraying reasons had was for that and I would hope though that this does not come back to cause any problems in the future regarding any chemical yes in that area there further comments yes that 's a little bright Thank You mr. mayor is following on from Council of Walsh has comment about about spraying and said back it was for aerial spraying as the 50 meters setback and this would not be a viable aerial spraying wouldn 't_''_3593.35 would not be allowed in this area with with the Residential 's and vineyard so close it was I just couldn 't follow your original comments from the mayor and Whiston council Miller about the original approval or something but there was a period when Thompson 's dairy was approved until we until we adopted the new LEP that farm sheds didn 't need any didn 't need a DA if they were used their operation of the facility so that shed could have been built under that arrangement there Ford wouldn 't have come to council and but they did I think I right I read it they did jump to or something but I think councillor Miller hit it on the head as neighbors aren 't getting it if neighbors don 't get on it doesn 't matter what what we say mister pity he didn 't inform Council of the unit of the inappropriate septic system when it went in rather than twelve months later God who you bill counselor Smith I 'm sorry mr. Muir just on that point about the neighbors objection I think that the point to be made and councillor Miller did make it is that there were a series of objections and each one of those objections has been satisfactorily explained and satisfactorily answered by the proponent of the DA a further comment reply resolution I was in favors of the a quality I can see all the Hang Seng kid carrying am asleep okay colleagues that I think he 's the any negative no late reports any notices of motion and in urgent matters no no it 's right sorry thank you I 'll take a motion to close a meeting to the public considering according to 10a of the act to follow into close counsel the subject is the carob is etre Center license reserve one nine double five double O five six I 'm sorry reason commercial information to the confidential nature that would disclose prejudice initial position of the person who supplied it they can report from the general manager intend a 2d one also is the sale of rock three Cairo Airport the reason again commercial information of a confidential nature that would have disclosed prejudice to commercial position of the person who supplied it and thirdly ten a 2d one of the Act also drink of infrastructure operations is tender nine stroke 20 replacement of you care aquatic route kwatak center roof the reason commercial information of a confidential nature that would if disclosed previous a commercial position of person who supplied it move we 're going to close counselor place on the council Hagen thank you taking the place in the middle of MQ I put the resolution all those in favor again against I declare their carriages all the fine a second colleagues on awful _"

    "text": "[Music] okay thank you i 'll go back and i 'll declare the meeting this council meeting open and i will pay my respects to the traditional custodians of land and emerging i would also remind everybody that we are in accordance with government 1893 live streaming and recording this council meeting by speaking to this meeting you agree to be live streamed and recorded therefore ensure that when you speak you are respectful to others and use appropriate language at all times and council accepts no liability for any defamatory or offensive remarks or gestures made during the course of this evening and it is a little bit difficult and i make that observation at the very beginning we are having a virtual meeting which we are allowed to do and given the covert 19 restrictions and some of the issues that that are being faced we 've decided to to have a a virtual meeting nonetheless i 'm sure we 'll get through this in the appropriate proper manner and consider all the disclosures of interest and i 'd invite any councillor or staff to indicate in relation the report of the item you 're declaring interest interest in is whether the interest is potentially not pecuniary and what is the nature of the interest no one has come forward therefore we will move on and assume that that is all dealt with we now have apologies and applications for leave of absence and i have apologies from councillor miller and councillor kevin wright would someone like to move that those apologies be accepted and leave absence be granted please council smith and councillor walsh uh i will put the resolution um all those in favor all right against declare carried any just signify councillors with a hand i can probably see it if you really don 't want to oppose something just make it known we now come to public forum and we have a list of people who wish to speak and i welcome you all thank you for your patience in this difficult time and we look forward to hearing from you just when we get to issues around weingarten i 'm not trying to prevent any debater discussion but you might just be conscious same message even though you probably consider it to be most appropriate that we we do get the message um so the first person i would invite to um public forum is sharon delba sharon if you 'd like to come forward and i think go to the lectern and take the opportunity [Music] the important thing tonight is we don 't lose that sense of humor i just got my face mask stuck in my earring i have the same problem [Laughter] good evening mayor west councillors and council staff thank you for organising these facilities to allow us to be here and present to each of you i appreciate the extra effort it has involved in delivering these last minute changes for covert safe requirements so thank you very much my name is sharon delbo and i am here to speak on behalf of my submission to council on item one long term financial plan draft integrated delivery program in my submission i have asked council to consider five initiatives to be implemented from 1 july 2021 to the 30th of june 2022 to be clear i was of cara council instead to allocate from funding from within the council 's existing budgets as suggested at the bottom of page four i will start with the garage sale trail at a cost of three thousand two hundred and ninety seven dollars per annum i am pleased to see your suggestion that it can be considered and recommended for inclusion in the 2021 2022 operational plan i will certainly put my hand up along with many other residents to support this program with more than 110 councils involved in in this program it is another step for the people of cara to reduce our waste to landfill and reuse where possible events are important to communities allowing its residents and visitors to connect and celebrate and we have a lot to celebrate in karashiya i am pleased to see councils active in this region with the said suggested level of support already in place but there is room for more my request was to provide community groups access to funding to give them the opportunity to hold covert safe community events that they organize and that they are responsible 000 from this new grant they could enhance their annual open garden weekend to include guest speakers workshops markets or even a high tea in one of the amazing gardens this would increase the number of people attending the event and the spend in cara another example in summer let 's have outdoor movie screenings in one of the open spaces along the beautiful lachlan river you choose which side of the lochlan river or let 's support our local live musicians and have performances from the rotunda in braum park on a saturday evening this industry has been hit hard by the pandemic the capacity of these events will adhere to new south wales health orders if the requested amount of 50 000 is too high i would rather see a smaller amount included than none at all start the event start the new events sponsorship program at 10 000 or 20 000 for its first year council is aware of the importance of events and as a result allocates a large sum to the festival of international understanding to address the concerns of the pandemic as listed in south wales restrictions is not doing me any favors tonight i want to say events can be held safely and our neighbouring councils continue to hold events during the pandemic under the implementation of a covert safe event plan the health of those attending is paramount and use of qr codes hand sanitizer or even circles sprayed onto lawn for allocated seating keeps people safe we cannot afford to wait until the pandemic is over to hold local events next initiative council meeting recordings now this one is working in my favor tonight when i suggest to get rid of the clicking pens from the council chamber because they contribute to background noise in the recording who would have thought that all of the councillors would also not be physically here tonight i will let you draw your own conclusion but it is quite quiet in this room here tonight i think this request speaks for itself in an attempt for council to increase its engagement with its residents i fully support your recommendation to include 30 000 to upgrade its audio visual equipment in the 2021 and the 2022 let go of my request to increase community grants program to see that the event sponsorship fund may be supported and finally economic development i 'm pleased to see council is working with the local business chamber to partner and develop a new agreement going forward at this point in time i will respect council suggestion and bring back the consideration a future budget proposal economic development can now be known as revenue making it the fourth r for council roads rates rubbish and revenue in closing please consider funding community events under a new program or add it to the existing community grants program in the washout all we need to find from the existing budget is 10 000 20 000 or up to 50 000 to have an enormous community impact and from my experience i would suggest looking in engineering department budget as they 're always flushed with funds all the best with tonight 's meeting and decision making and thank you for listening thank you thank you sure the engineering department agrees but anyway thank you for that presentation uh the next any questions counselors no withdrawn and he and another person had written submissions around kentucky road and devil area and my understanding is be and i want to remind people that i didn 't stop watching you sharing that we normally allow five minutes so i just remind people speaking in future the five minute uh what we allocate um penny would you come forward please thank you and good evening everybody my presentation is about the proposed raising of the down wall for y angler and looking at it in the framework of the council 's projected strategy for 2017 to 2036 and whether any financial application has been allowed for what costs could be incurred by the council for this very major project bill i wonder if you received it last week i sent you an engineering report proposed about what the extent of is what 's required to build this extension of the dam wall have you had a chance to read that that was the report that was compiled by marianne slattery that 's correct so my understanding is that 's part of the report that was presented to the on behalf of other people and as part of part of that project yes one one aspect got one aspect of one submission of many submissions to that particular inquiry yes what i found particularly interesting please it 's peter the council of peter wright [Music] thanks very much thank you um i believe you have said that should the project proceed that there won 't be any costs incurred by the kara council and yet by looking at that engineer 's report by default of where the wall is there will be costs and implications suffered by the people of derby 's falls possibly waiangala and given the scope of that engineering report it could also require quite a deal of road upgrades and subsequent maintenance because of the number of trap trucks that will be traveling along those roads to provide the material to build the dam wall now this engineering report is very conclusive in the quantity estimation it provides and it there is an extraordinarily large amount of material alone which would be required to extend the base of the dam to then support the increased with that that the quantity of the water in the dam may need to be reduced quite substantially for three or possibly four years simply so that the work can be undertaken so i 'm putting this forward that there could be considerable cost to the cairo council for roads which may not have actually been included in this strategic plan because i don 't think the dam was even mentioned before 2017 it is something that has been proposed since that plan was done so the impacts i 'm concerned about are on the kara taxpayers carry council taxpayers the potential impact on tourism and as a member of the tourism board here why angler is obviously a very big attraction for people and if that level is reduced to an estimated 30 percent then it doesn 't have the allure that it has ray excuse me i will i will invite my colleagues to answer the question if they want to you just continue please penny they can ask a question at the end of the presentation okay sorry yes i would point out right thank you yes for community consultation there have been information sessions which have been one way by orchestrated by water new south wales so my concerns are the potential costs to be incurred by the council these costs have not been included in the existing 2017-2036 budget the business case for the dam is still being developed and it will include the environmental impact statement and has the council prepared a budget for costs to support this proposal and i thank you for the opportunity to speak thank you thank you um would anybody like to ask that question ray are you questioned on statement at all i just wish to make a statement that um the views expressed by penny scott are certainly not the views of counter tourism characterism has remained quite neutral in this other than giving information on tourist statistics and information on likely benefits that they might see that is the only communication the characterism has had and i don 't think that it is appropriate for any other view to be expressed thank you um we will now invite uh the next speaker who is registered who please friend um okay brenda is here more to listen and observe rather than provide a presentation but thank you for the opportunity okay thank you penny appreciate that there 's an opportunity if you want to comment now that 's fine thank you um next person registered is david webster david [Music] yes thanks very much thank you mayor councillors general manager thank you for the opportunity to address council this evening about the long-term planning financial document before you tonight i 'm also representing waianae counterpoint group a network of community groups and individuals in the region who support a cheaper more efficient and less impactful solution to securing lachlan reaching water supply than the proposal to raise waying to damn wall we lodged a submission pointing out that the documents before you do not meet the requirements of new south wales government integrated planning and reporting framework they must reflect and respond and support the implementation of the care community strategic plan 2017-2036 this document doesn 't seem to do that this the strategic plan does not include the wyangladam or raising project the karashar community has and its impact we object to the long-term planning documents referring to council support for the y-angler project and specifically the council staff 's time is allocated to advocating for the project ratepayers funds and staff time should be spent on more pressing projects like the completion of an integrated water cycle management strategy the draft lockland regional water strategy identifies a range of water security options and commits to the business plan for the waiangla project but where are the other options the reality of climate change requires some innovative solution raising the wall is not innovative karashar does not have a water security problem and was not threatened by water shortages in the last severe drought the various costs and impacts of the dam project on car rate payers needs to be acknowledged and considered by council rather than a blanket support for the project with no informational consultation transport and infrastructure sustainable raising the wall i don 't know communities near and above the dam wall will be impacted by increased heavy vehicle traffic and increased inundation we have a letter from derby 's falls progress associating community to the waianga project where is the budget for the continuing cost for all the shy roads outside the town of kara the project will ultimately be managed under the full cost recovery and user pay policy this means that the cost of carer water licenses with water new south wales may increase dramatically carrot town water is already expensive have rate payers been asked if they want to pay more cara ratepayers have the right to know what the increase costs award of road maintenance water licenses and other economic and social impacts of the project might amount to the most recent financial assessment from new south wales treasury is that the project will cost up to 2.1 billion this is to increase water security in the lachlan by 21 gigalitres very expensive water there are other concerns with the project during construction such as increased competition for the rental market demand for housing in the car area is already outstripping supply with talk of setting up construction camps near the work site how much economic activity would kara expect to gain the promise of using local construction businesses looking for new apprentices and they can 't fill them most large construction projects rely on outside workforce and outside expertise stay for the project and move on to the next no long-term gain for cara in fact with a large project like this on completion the town could go backwards the project construction is estimated to take four years disruption to the tourist industry especially with the holiday parks having to move above the new water line is a key economic consideration a prolonged water level low water level to allow construction will have a major impact on both water security and on recreation recreational use four years of additional heavy traffic movements on local roads will affect road safety and road conditions the increased inundation area will cause loss of prime agricultural land and production from local farms that support cara businesses this is another economic loss to the region promoting car as agricultural as excellence i don 't know we ask that the long-term planning document before you tonight are not adopted we want all references to the wyngladam project be removed we have tried to it doesn 't add up there are many inconsistencies the strategic plan should be linked with the community plan the environmental theme should get top priority without it there is no well-being and the impacts for all are great it is not value adding it is not valuing each other and what we have natural resource management for excellence it is not i thank you for listening to me but before i go i would like to let you know who the wang counterpoint group represents why angler counterpoint group represents affected land holders in the inundation area of which there are 74 counter-rate posts who do not support the wyangla project derby 's fall progress association urban landcare incorporated upper lockland new south wales farmers association hovel 's creek landcare group inland rivers network central west environmental council lachlan flood plains and wetlands group and birdlife australia and sorry my voice is so croaky i 've only just got it back thank you um any questions collee no questions um kerry are you wishing to speak kerry smith you 're in the room you 've registered thank you and and you may wish to replace my mum 's stuff but please just try to run out of those quickly if you can please and if anybody hasn 't got the um come up on your ipad it 's kerry smith who 's also talking behalf of the wagon counterpoint group thank you kerry good evening councillors mayor and staff i think the two previous speakers have covered quite clearly the importance of you to reconsider the um the advocacy of the raising of the damn wall project i think you need to actually go back to the drawing board a little bit further and actually do a little bit more research in regards to the factors that have been pointed out mainly the environment and the impact upon it have you actually spoken to land care groups within the area that are going to be affected mum has mentioned some but i know there are others involved especially here in the actual region have you actually factored in the the infrastructure impact upon the increased traffic when you have a look at when we actually have a look at in regards to that which is a concern that 's one of my major concerns is because we are actually going to be directly impacted by that we 've just received a letter from glenela quarry stating that they are looking to propose to increase heavy vehicle traffic on our road battery road that we actually currently live on this road is a major artery road leading to carra is thankfully being upgraded due to hilltop 's council however according to the da that they 're currently operating under there are three intersections that haven 't been upgraded now in the da it clearly stated that these intersections would be upgraded to accommodate the heavy vehicles that are actually on this road these three intersections have not been improved we actually confronted the council in regards to this in 2016 and received a letter from council reassuring us that these works would be done or at least under the planning process it is now 2021 and there has been no progression no planning and no communication room council that is actually being even considered now we 've received a letter trucks on the road an additional to the 20 that we 're already receiving now and again those intersections have not been addressed so i seriously could uh well i i 'm very upset and quite frustrated that the council are now then considering increasing traffic according to this dam raising wall and project when you haven 't even dealt with a current da that 's currently under your care that was issued in 2007. so how is council going to address the additional traffic when one road one road out of many roads that are going to be used by these vehicles can 't_''_1663.44 be upgraded or deemed safe in under current d.a so i do question that and unfortunately during due but to the budget there 's been no forecasting or any consideration to this current issue the other issue that i 'm a little bit concerned about is we have teenage children the environment is a very important element in our future business in the rural industry and i do believe that the environmental impact is probably not going to leave a very healthy environment for our you go back and have a look at the drawing board and your natural resource management plan and maybe re-look at the strategies that you have stated in t3 of the strategic plan under the theme of strategic infrastructure in regards to actually looking at innovative projects to secure the water supply and not rely on a state government resource that you can 't control because if you actually have a look at the plan in t3.2 that you actually wanted as a strategy to be able to control your water but then your strategy in 3.1 a has something to as is you 're actually advocating for a resource that you won 't control it doesn 't make sense if you are innovative and looking at sustainable resource management i think you need to come up with some other ideas and how to look after our resources and not just look at the lachlan river there are other other ways to actually secure our water resource so i strongly suggest that you maybe go back to drawing board and think of a few other ideas i do do believe that maybe that 's a good point for you to start having a look at so i do thank you for listening to us but i really do seriously hope that you reconsider and do a little bit more research before you advocate for such project thank you thank you thank you [Applause] thank you um we 're going to move on obviously because we don 't debate with members of the public um unfortunately michael are you are we now clearing the chamber out or is that which means they will not have an opportunity until they go back onto youtube to see what councillors may have to say as part of the adoption of the um [Music] budget as a revenue policy and operational plan council rights but we 're not going to have any bait now that council is this sort of debate just before the last speaker there was someone walked in there like i don 't know if that was mr pottinger or something um i know i 'll i 'll if the director 's in the in the room if i 've missed someone time for someone to address the council through the chair bill uh that was me walking in i had a phone call that i had to step out forward thank you thank you so we will we will move on but i 'm sure that we will all have a bit to say during the operational plan the revenue plan we now move colleagues to the minute of the previous meeting confirmation meeting ordinary meeting held on

celebrations i 'm not sure exactly where those uh celebrations are going to land at the moment but uh the feeling of uh of uh youth council is uh generally speaking that it 's probably not going to be appropriate that the activities we had planned continue the only other thing i would mention is that hopefully for being well before the next month 's council meeting youth council will make it six monthly presentation to keep council up to speed with the activities that they have been involved in thank you thank you thank you credit comments council better right you 're happy no further

minutes of the tidy towns urban landcare meeting i 'm sure council smith will move thank you have a second to florida please council peter wright thank you you should speak councillor smith uh again just to say that uh tidy towns was going to have a busy school holidays because we were going to have our usual two-day recycled art workshops i 'm about to formally [Music] can those tomorrow and will unfortunately be contacting everyone who and there were a good number of parents and caregivers who 'd enrolled their children but with current covert restrictions it 's just not possible to do unfortunately for the comments yes mr chairman yeah certainly the um it 's become a regular discussion at the um at the committee meeting they 're trying to um to implement a succession plan the existing members have been there for a long time and getting to a stage responsibility in the actual organizing of things um a large part of the committee is made up of uh derby 's falls into a lesser extent gulag members and possibly one from uh from carer so if uh anyone 's listening to this tonight um you want to play a part in the um in the tidy towns and urban land care of it 's not just picking up papers not it 's things we can implement to improve the um the natural resources of the area and um and clean up some of their their problems that we 've created ourselves so i 'll just put that out there if anyone 's interested in joining and become a member to contact council or councilman smith thank you councillor are you for the comments or questions does the move wish to read movies reply yes thank you and and thank you councillor wright for that and and it is very true as illustrated unfortunately by the meeting that we had last week where there were through a diversity of circumstances we only had two members there and so we didn with lots to be done there so i certainly second councillors a councillor wright 's call for anyone who would like to be involved we are involved in the diversity of activities clean up australia day national tree day lots of ways we are involved in recycling education keep new south wales beautiful awards and a host of other things with lots of ideas which would be able to be put into practice a lot more easily if we had more members thank you thank you councillor smith i 've got the resolution i was in favor all right against declare it carry the next item is item number eight which is the statutory view of cemeteries and crematorium act and there 's a resolution there which is very strongly worded so i 'll move that please councilor walsh thank you council federal thank you did new wish to speak thanks mr mayor um i was appalled to read the the uh australian cemeteries and crematory associations suggestions about what various councils regional councils might do to assist sydney with its problems regarding lack of space and uh the only was for us to pay a uh an increase or a pay payer funding uh to assist them to find space now if their long-term planning is that uh poor that they can 't uh make sure they 've got a um a few extra paddocks to to have a cemetery in that should not be our problem out here i think um stating our opposition to the recommended financial model is uh the appropriate measure for council to take there 's a second wish to speak further the main point to make is that um [Music] we feel that our council is um our council 's long-term plan is is sufficiently uh covers any extra ground that we need for our cemetery and an operation and um and to be imposed with a one size fit all the money taken out of our system to support someone else 's system is a little bit tough thank you thank you for the comments i think we all let it endorse the comments of both yourself and counselor walsh um for the comments will i reply oh put the resolution i he 's from director of environmental services in da42 stroke 2021 um lot 27 in dp 608 to 86 to 88 boundary road there 's a recommendation there for approval with conditions do i have the mover please council of walt thank you council of fagan you blink council smith thank you council smith you should speak down to the walls yes mr mayor the um this is um this approval can only um be enacted if uh sewerage is actually laid onto these blocks um at the moment there 's uh we need a two hectare size block for any area that does not have sewage attached to it and i think the development here is probably anticipating that at some stage in the next few years this may happen um certainly i don 't have any problems with the battle exercise blocks but they certainly to fit our regulations they 've got to be of a certain size until such time as sewerage has laid on over there in that area of west caro thank you for the comment have a question please yes certainly um condition number the applicant must connect all new lots to the plan of subdivision to council 's articulated sewage supply system in accordance with the so forth engineering design does that mean that the house that 's already there it stays on septic or is it going to be hooked up to the sewer too the director answer that question please that that 's that has to connect to the sewer as well because it 's a newly created lot all right i think but i think the question is it doesn 't it doesn 't impact its current standing no that 's not something yes mr chairman um i reluctantly support it i um the uh with that verification on this that the existing lot will have to have sewage uh connection too because i thought the only new lots created would be the two extra lights but but between that but i just hope that our engineering and our councils going forward do give this applicant an opportunity [Music] to progress the um the d.a by implementing the sewer system over there it 's um my concern is that we to commit to it in the final end for it to happen and um i presume you can start some works without the uh obviously got to have the sewage connection before you can start any any subdivision work thank you all right you 're you 're muted mr mayor i speak well when i 'm here to write a reply did i reply no nothing then i 'll put the resolution i was in favor please signify and i need to show your hand um council never can you each other yeah thank you i 've declared carried no everybody 's right peter 's right you 're declaring you 're supporting it just michael your photo is sitting behind mine on the screen so i can see your right hand but not your left hand that makes sense yeah they have my screen structured um i can see your eyes sometimes so we now move on that covers the committee agenda so we now move to the draft integrated delivery program 2017 2018 2021-22 for the operational plan 2021-22 the draft 10-year financial plan the revenue policy 2021-2022_._2909.24 we some some suggested changes does the director have those that we can add as we go please to the recommendations uh yes through the chair would you like me to read them out uh yes please which will form it which were former.3 i 'd assume yes um that in addition to 0.2 that council adopts with the inclusion of amendment to the strategic plan to read that council adopts the project that 's strategic plan t31a to read that council supports the project subject to all the relevant studies appropriately being undertaken inclusion of an of an objective to participate in the garage sale trail in fy 2022 inclusion of an objective to invest in the upgrade of technology in the chambers for the purchase of purpose of live streaming council meetings the council notes the inclusion of an increasing workers compensation expense an increase in the wages for the container deposit scheme aquatic centre an increase in the mayoral allowance members fees councillor superannuation contribution cemetery internment service levy and an amendment to the aod calculation across the funds does that all make sense colleagues yeah i don have a clear understanding someone someone wants to adopt so move that we adopt the the recommendation with the inclusion of what the director has just written read out and that would be i hopefully put in writing and provided to us reasonably quickly not today but but we all understand what we 're what 's being said i think councillor smith you 're happy to move or is that raising your hand okay the second day councilor walsh council smith thank you mr mayor um i would first like to thank everyone who made a submission to the various plans for the thoughtful detailed and passionate submissions and also thank those who came along to the chamber tonight and spoke equally thoughtfully and passionately and i would like to assure all those people that you were listened to that we have thought about and had some discussion about what you have suggested and despite the fact that the amendments that the director has has just mentioned don 't cover everything that you wanted that does not necessarily mean that during the term of the next operational plan that there i 'd i 'd first like to speak briefly to those people who [Music] wrote and spoke about the y angler damn wall raising certainly council wants to wait until the state government whose project this is has gone through all the processes of appropriately not only speaking to people but through all the processes that need to be gone through before they can make a decision and before council as you heard from the amendment and make a decision as to where they stand about that so council is very much in a wait and see mode in terms of that that being said i don 't believe that there is only one side of of any coin in terms of this project secondly to address the many points put up for consideration by sharon delbo some of which council is happy to adopt within the next operational plan others of which will be considered in one form or another um i would just talk firstly about the suggestion that more money be put to towards business development and economic development in the shire it 's something that council of money in various ways already to the business chamber in terms of the premises that they rent in terms of the events coordinator at the tourism board and through a number of other initiatives we certainly don 't have the finances i don 't believe given the tight line we walk because we are not able to and we do not wish to or think it 's appropriate to um ask for a special rate increase we think that would be too much of a burden on our rate pairs so we walk a very fine line in terms of appropriately resourcing the many activities that we need to do we consider that the business chamber and business development is currently appropriately resourced but that 's not to say that if there are specific requests put to us that we won 't look at them the only other one that i would address is the idea that council has a fund for helping community groups with staging events as i think sharon is aware council does have a community grants program and i think she is aware that council of course in the current code situation there are not a lot of events going on and those that do go on are often changed or cancelled so when hopefully that is behind us we will look at that again and adding that to the grants program all of that being said and again thank you to all those who were concerned about their shire and did respond um and put submissions in what i think that we have here is a a raft of plans from the delivery program of four years through to the 10-year financial plan and the current operational plan that i 'd make two points about one is these plans need to be passed uh before the end of the financial year to make sure that we are able to continue operating appropriately and to pay people appropriately and so on in the coming financial year and two that i think by and large this is a a fair and it is a well-balanced and it is a well thought out program that makes the most of the money that ratepayers pay us to have the future and enables us to do the best we can for our rate paths thank you second i wish to speak yes mr mayor i would like to make a few comments i too would like to thank all who uh spoke tonight at the open forum um one thing i would say is that part of our strategic plan from 2017 to 2036 is that we were council was aware that we needed to have a more secure water supply for cara and i also remind everyone that three times in the last 40 years the water the level in why angler dam which is our primary source of water supply is uh has been between four percent as low as four percent and in two other occasions under eight percent i 'd also uh like to move on to uh sharon delbo 's uh comments and once again i thank her very much for what she though what she had to say um i would suggest to her that she talked to characterism about um the um the first um item she mentioned about event sponsorship courier uh help run events and if anyone has any suggestions about events which they would like run i think tourism is probably the appropriate way in that council itself does not have an event officer the community grants i do feel at the moment for this year anyway they are adequate the garage sale i think that has possibilities and once again that could be something that could be worked with through um both council and tourism economic development as councillor smith has pointed out considerable funds are already expanded between employing a business officer and also the money that we have assisted the carer business chamber with in recent years and yes i thoroughly agree with the uh that kara council 's record meetings should be recorded and could be recorded in a much more appropriate fashion and uh i um we 're already aware that um we 'll be looking at that in the not too the other thing i would like to draw people 's attention to though is the page 40 on our ipad which is page 2 in fact in that um in that in and capital contributions and also the the cash flow i think it 's important that people before they ask council for too much money they have an explanation of what all of that means and how that money can be used and i do urge anyone who doesn 't understand that to come and see our council staff and and ask them about it uh a lot of work has gone into the uh the budget and uh the financial plans there are major infrastructure projects which are under investigation or planning and uh i won 't go through them but uh also there are a number of other key improvements infrastructure projects that um are we don 't have money for at the moment and would be either hoping for additional revenue or decreased expenditure at some stage to be able to undertake them they are all listed on page 41 of the uh on the on the ipad or page three in that plan a lot of work has gone into this and i want to acknowledge our council staff for the work that they have done to year they put it in a framework which as a counsellor i find much easier to follow and i as i said rather than become too long-winded i would just advise any member of the public who has needs to understand more about how that happens how the budget is put together and and why we have certain facts certain items in it that they do approach our council staff and ask the question thank you for the comments that 's the fagin great thank you i 'd also like to thank everyone who contributed can you hear me correctly um and uh and also mention that this is a pretty uh infrastructure budget we haven 't got a lot of money to throw away on well to use on really um community type activities and other things unfortunately if you look at the major infrastructure projects that we 're actually undertaking this budget they 're very um they 're very water and sewerage and um and interest very boring infrastructure projects unfortunately but we don 't have the money to actually do the the very fancy things that we budget is the aquatic center redevelopment and we haven 't actually got the money for that either so i think this is a very responsible budget and we have got a lot of infrastructure that needs replacing and needs extending and needs to be built in the next five years and unfortunately that doesn 't allow us um a lot of money for other things such as the civic square update in the art gallery and the street lighting and other things that we 'd like to do so um although this is a a uh this is a very much a you know what we call it tea and toast budget very much a sort of boat budget that requires um us to become very down-to-earth and and and sorrow about how we we plan our next five years and the things that we need to do and i 'd just like to congratulate the staff and they 've done a great job as well and uh thank everyone who made a submission we can 't hear you bill that 's because i forgot to unmute and i was paper sorry a couple of i think quick comments because i don 't need to provide say too much but i do acknowledge firstly the contribution of the staff and you my colleagues for this document and the way it 's been worked through it is a significant document but it gets gets discussed various forums on the way through as well as at this particular point in time and as council of fagan said we cut our cloth we don 't have we don 't have unlimited funds so we have to work at what we see priorities but the same token we do put on the agenda items and issues and and aspects of what council might like to consider doing subject to funding and to put those things into our planning process so at least we we understand that community does understand so i think that 's something worth noting it is quite an extensive document when if it 's read in its entirety there 's a lot of a lot of dollars a lot of dissections of dollars as well but also a lot of work organization and i think we are lucky that we have the staff that we have but also i think you my colleagues deserve credit for this as as well um so i think it 's a responsible document we don 't have a lot of money i think that the comment was made in the national general assembly last week that a lot of councils are sitting on somewhat of a a a knife edge if you like in terms of maintaining that balance between providing for their community and providing services their community expected entitled to expect and being able to actually fund those things and provide the finances for them so it 's a never-ending never-ending dilemma if you like to to to come up with the consensus of what is appropriate and what might be something that we have to hold over for a year or two years or chase funding funding for unfortunately um i just i don 't particularly want to get into a discussion about what was presented for him other than it 's just lovely to see people responding to the budget and comments but just in regards to to the wyangla dam uh the first time i make is that the the publicly and privately we 've been saying since day one that that this had to go through a process it 's like any day it has to go through a process and that 's no different to this and it 's no different to the stance i 'm not going to get caught up with at this particular point in time comments around may increase or may have this impact or may have that impact or or the report from from mary a slavery which was designed to be against the dam and it 's a point of view it 's a valid point of view perhaps but it 's only as someone indicated early council if it 's only one side of the of the argument or the conversation i should say not argument but we know water security is an issue in kara we know water security is an issue in in the lachlan valley and we need to understand that and despite the fact that cara may neighbors who may not so we in the valley so we need to be recognising their needs and their wants as as well um and i think that 's that 's quite important and the fact that we 've supported one goddamn is something we said in last year 's operational plan so it 's not it shouldn 't be new to anybody i i just uh also go back to the central water security study of 2009 which did indicate that there was going to be water security issues in the region which needs to be still maintained in our minds and when people 's and i think you 're aware colleagues that i 've been working on on various water related issues since 2014 when they 're looking for some other way of other methods of providing greater security in the lochen valley given the lochman valley is one of the ones most under threat by considered by water new south wales in the state government i think it 's responsible we continue to look at that the one that i do do look at is this throwaway ways of of dealing with water security issues and and i 'm been heavily involved for quite some time and i 'm still waiting to find out what those what those cheaper and more efficient ways might be and i 'm sure the state government will be delighted to hear those as well but with that it is a response to a budget i could talk about water for quite some significant time again my colleagues but i 'll leave it at that and we will move on and i just again acknowledge a few my colleagues and senior staff i 'm putting stock in this very responsible document together further comments yes thank you mr mayor first comment i 'd make um sharon delbo 's um presentation and also the notes she put in it the most important thing i recognize in her application is we can use existing budgetary provisions but use them in a different way or reallocate or something and i think the garage sale trail program is is going to be funded out of the waste area so the waste department so it was a adding it on to what we already do and i support that idea 100 because in the in our briefing notes if we just added it on the things that was in her application was it 'd be 178 000 or something and that would be 2.74 budget increase which would be all of our increase under the rate pegging arrangement so i just congratulated on what um on what she put forward and they 're all good ideas and how we can come about to fund them um the winery damn it 's um i appreciate what you 've said there and it 's um i hope you 've been speaking to hilltops as strongly as you 're speaking to us because their their council is involved in this um in this project if it goes ahead and that 's the contentious point as if it goes ahead because there is a lot of studies have to be done and business business cases put forward and if your information is getting to those planning people it will it will be heard and [Music] we 'll i 'll just wait going to be built that 's when we will take a bigger interest in the infrastructure needs of our shire we 've already highlighted them already about the roads and so forth and if it does go ahead and the normal budgeting process and what 's needed for auxiliary expenditure to get the job completed we should come out with a better road system than what we have now and that maybe i 'm pie in the sky but i certainly congratulate the work you 've put in there and there 's a lot of points that we should think about thank you you turned off i turned it off things right kicked off to make sure there 's no noise in the background and i 'll leave it on um write a reply no mr mayor thank you to all who 've contributed thank you uh i 'll therefore offer the resolution or resolution i was in favor all right against declare carried item number two from the director uh queen 's birthday honours list this was raised i think council are right you might want to move this 'm not sure the page it is but it 's one about the note the queen 's birthday on us and we write to the recipients offering council resolution yeah i know i 'm quite happy to move here so i think you 're raising the committee we should do it so council all right happy to move it our second to please yeah thank you to speak councillor walsh you don 't need to we can do it right we 're just formally as a council recognising the um what our resident three of our residents have been awarded in the um in the recent um queen 's birthday honours list and dr louise baker for services to uh wilson and barbara calligan for his services to music and kate chapman for service to community most and a lot of us that 's been through the the uh the community um community group they formed and kept running it 's um and there are three very good people that um deserve recognition and we 've often i know louise baker has won some awards but i think many people and everything for for granted and i think there 's a very good recognition thank you thank you second we should speak just congratulations to all three of them wonderful to see their record being recognized any further comments write a reply i would think this will be up at the resolution it will be unanimously supported always in favour hi again again i can call that unanimously supported thank you item number three is the financial assistance to marathon health headspace thank you council of shoes uh thanks thanks mr mayor i don 't need to say much except to say that uh headspace has proven to be over a number of years something that has been a great boon to the young people of karashin and has been extremely well utilized and i think that uh giving them this bit of assistance to um give them a kickstart as they move into new pres premises and uh start their operation again is um something that we are pleased to do for the sake of all those young people in the shine thank you for the comments yes yes 'll try and make a positive out of the negative but it 's it isn 't a negative comment but this five months um foregone um rent would impact our budget by twelve and a half thousand but hopefully for every twelve months after that we 'll be receiving approximately thirty thousand dollars so um it will have a benefit to our budget but it um also have a great benefit to the uh to the to the youth of karashia thank you thank you further comments i think i think your last point is correct issues about the benefits to our to our youth and the role headspace can play i just hope that 's going to make comments with committee meeting

support the business chamber and uh it 's a good way and it 's great to see the carriage cash cards are being supported in cara and um 300 000 is spent locally which is fantastic results and there are a lot of cash cards out there but they aren 't aren 't ours so it 's great too that we can actually have our own cash card in the community what was the comment no not necessary write a reply

release of those decisions with council of agriculture council members did you cancel a night do you move thank you um i 'll put any any comments on this it 's housekeeping any comments i 'll put the resolution of those in favor all right all right again against declaration number two financial assistant grants is a report there that we note the report from the local government grants commission regarding your phone the calculations payment of fair grants four facts recommendation there four point three exactly councillor fagin thank you councillor walsh mr speak councillor fagin no just to say that um this is um pleasing always nice to get money from the government um although there is a an interest uh there 's it 's interesting how they continue to play us before the end of the financial year and then catch up later so it 's a bit confusing um this is going to be something that we we 're hoping to increase over the next couple of years but at this stage we have a slight increase of four point three which to speak uh nothing divided i i just think that uh maybe council of fagin we should i could comment on on the the national general general assembly in the conference where it became apparent that the metropolitan councils were very keen now because of covert to keep their grants there have been previous conversations about they might be prepared to you know forego a little bit to give their rural cousins a bit of a leg up but i think they 're now because of cabernet and the impact is having on the metropolitan areas they are very keen to and their involvement in some of the social stuff uh they 're very keen to to um to to their their fair grants but they do also lobby for more and the the general assembly is still talking about one percent of taxation as opposed to now currently 0.6 even though the former the immediate past minister for local government did suggest that that um there was benefits in there was a disadvantaged issue in doing that in the context of all the money that councils had had of course any for the comments yeah just a question um in the background the last part of the first paragraph it 's paid quarterly but then [Music] 50 in advance and we have four quarterly payments after that which is equivalent to one eight payments um just a bit um ruth did mention that it 's a bit hard to follow but um it 's an interesting way of playing something yeah is that is that a comment or would you like to direct it or comment the director 's smile again i 'd like to comment on that it 's just a comment we 'll still get it the 5 million and 35 000 that 's a valid comment no one want to comment on that further um any further comments on that write a reply uh ryan o 'clock at the resolution i was in favor yeah sure i 'm happy to have that we write to we write to the minister of local government and our federal member on the expressing appreciation of continued support of fairgrounds taken did someone please counsel the nobe thank you sorry yeah councilman with his hand up sir um do you need any further conversation on that council or right you haven 't put her or do you want to speak to him oh it 's pretty straightforward no yeah well shut up baby yeah um it 's pretty straightforward but we always think we should we deserve more but i think we should be thankful for what we are getting and there is a lot of other money going around too and we did have it stopped at one stage and to get 4.35 percent it was well above inflation or what well it might and be now but um i said i don 't think it would be there anyway it was agreeing with you sorry yeah it 's better than 2.6 right right peggy yeah that 's right any further comments right reply not required probably i 'll put the resolution i was in favor against carried on number three is the donation of the cow sports person of the year and it 's ejecting his 500 donation a little bit a little bit late for the world second councillor uh peter wright you should speak at all yes mr mayor 500 is um considerably less than they were requesting but i think it 's in line with what we have provided in previous years and um i i was actually wondering where um some of the ten thousand dollars that was anticipated that the function would cost was coming in but um yeah anyway i think five hundred dollars is an adequate amount yep all right so the comments i i attended and gus warland was king speak uh any further comments write a reply i 'll put the resolution i was in favor again against declaration number four of the minister 's message of superannuation for councils that we note the report um uh could i um off the back of our workshop uh previously could i add that second point to this uh this item that council endorses the payment of superannuation to councillors commencing the first of july 2022 and its inclusion in the long term financial plan yep everybody happy with that yep so i want to move the report with that look i think this is one of those um things that we 've been talking about for quite some time about um my my concern has always been as to whether or not our council was truly representative of our the people here in our our shire and whether or not the opportunity is there for people who um own a business or uh work in a business or who have young children uh if they wish to join local government whether or not that opportunity is there and i this is just a small move towards making that a bit more possible for them and making it a little bit easier to do that to do it i 've always been concerned about um the age group of not just our council but many other councils that i 've seen around the the uh the state and um you there 's a number of people sort of under say 55 60 years of age it 's clearly fairly small proportion of our councillors and mayors so i i think this is a move in the right direction thank you for the comments no further comments thank you no further comments i 'll put the resolution on those in favor all right against declare carried if i 'm on my agenda properly the next item is from the director of environmental services we 've got do75 track 2019 which is 14 london drive recommendation for approve with the condition who 's the best glasses councillor smith second council councillor welsh thank you very council of asian thanks for watching the punch there 's a move wish to speak yes this is a number of fairly small and mostly internal modifications the major external modification is the moving of the garage forward a little bit and the main reason that this has come to council is that according to our dcp a garage should not be forward of the line of the rest of the building the move brings it only a slight wave forward it 's still six meters away from the road which is in itself not a really main road and it 's been sufficiently justified in terms of being able to allow them for an access stairway of emergency from the building so i think it 's been well assessed and well justified further comments they want to put a fourth bedroom on the ground floor i don 't know when that area was set up for development that any two-story buildings couldn 't have a bedroom on the ground floor but apparently we can now is it i 'm not aware of that one well that 's what one of the neighbors told me up there and i said did you put a thing in he said i thought seeing i couldn 't do one the council wouldn 't let anyone else do one that 's been properly assessed yeah oh that 's all right i 'm sure that would have been picked up is there do those things lapse after time or [Music] not well i 'm not even sure what what thing you you 're referring to a two-story building in that in that area couldn 't have a bedroom on the ground floor yeah but it 's a comment being made by by somebody that hasn 't been i 'm not doubting a provided the details in terms of what 's what the circumstances of the day may or may not have been i don 't know thank you i don 't know yeah further comment yes mr mayor i i support this because uh hey it 's a modification to a previous da and the modification is a variation to the development control plan and uh i quite agree with the information provided that it is justified any further comments for the comments write a reply i 'll put the resolution on those in favor d.a all that in favor dignified please against the council of rights voting against it declare it carried um and may i respectfully suggest council right that where those sort of issues are raised you clarify the director before the meeting so we the agenda on the ipad until this afternoon thank you um i will move on direct doing track operations karate towns um endorse your creation of there 's a recommendation there sorry yes i 'll move it mr mayor smith thank you secondary happy too councillor thank you chancellor smith mayor this is something and i think and hope that there was a lot of support for the initiative certainly tidy towns is very excited about it we think it 's a great way to engage young people in the uh the concept of recycling and uh we will subject to council 's endorsement be moving forward with the competition and with uh seeking support from the business chamber for the comment council knows your second that you want to speak yeah i think it 's a great initiative i love seeing things like this happening in the community and i 'm looking forward to it going ahead thank you any further comments wrong reply i 'll put the resolution in favor again against declare carried item number there 's no further items late reports from council offices no late reports no no reports from offices sorry no notices of motion um bring no notice of motion then there are matters to deal with i will then take a motion to close with me to public public consumer records as well as then adapt the following two of two items here one is the the airport to fly oz the reason is the information that would have

Mara just and three what counselor said in that I certainly encourage everyone in the Shire to have a good look particular having a look at the delivery plan and its financial supporting statements for the next year and there are various summaries that would make having a look at that very easy then people who wish to can find something that they have a particular interest in further on in the document and read about it in a little more detail but those who do read at least the summary would see that as councillor Walsh said we have a large number of big-ticket items coming up in the next four years which is the the time of the delivery plan and going on from that and they include things like the Aquatic Center renovations the low level bridge looking for a new bridge over the Lachlan West Katara sewage a whole lot of very big ticket items and if you look at the financials for each of these sections of the budget you will see that there are forecasts of negative territory for some of them such as the water and sewage for a number of years those are things that are manageable and are due to very expensive pipeline in the next year and the few years following on from that those are all budgeted for and they will come out of those particular sections so I think people who have a good look at least will see that we don 't have a lot of money to play around with if we want to make the improvements that are necessary and that will add to the amenity of the show further comments anybody anybody else wish to add to that I would just make a quick quick comment if I may and and that is obviously supporting my colleagues in their comments already made I think this is also appropriate to acknowledge that the pandemic is causing concerns and issues they are community council is no different to anybody else but when looking at governments in particular the local government does not have the same capacity that state or federal government does in terms of running deficit budgets in terms of putting money back in to the community this budget is framed around going forward you 're ugly yeah I 'm fine anybody not got me are it everybody else is hearing me counselor right yeah but this budget is framed around moving forward with the full knowledge of what might lie ahead of us but it would be it is fully responsible of this council to continue to increase our charges in accordance with the CPI and accordance with the right thing so we 're able to provide the community with the services and the facilities and the infrastructure for growth that it would be responsible to do and I think that we showing some leadership actually doing that to not do that some people might suggest and not let increase our fees and charges and our rates would put council both this year and in future years behind the eight-ball quite significantly so I think this is something that we need to make sure the community fully fully understands other governments are able perhaps to provide all sorts of services and we will be looking to the state and federal government also to providing some services and support for for local local government that enables us to continue to employ our staff and as I community and the community spec 's because it 's pandemic will end and we need to make sure we come out of it as well as we possibly can in the future I would make one comment in terms of fees and charges has always been speculation about more than sewer charges they are clearly identified in this plan in terms of where that money will go a long term but I also note that that part of this year 's operational plan is to actually actually be investigating any rate of water management cycle plan which means that those charges and fees will also be something that will be clearly and carefully looked at and the community will be certainly made aware of what councillors plans are both short term and long term and where that expenditure will go counselors maybe put the hand up D water and mr. Mary I have two questions if that 's okay and through you to the general manager the first question is regarding the comment that we 're looking at a shortfall due to the cottage situation this year of around half can at an appropriate stage get some more information on the specifics of that so that 's the first question all and set the general managers in eyesight in the line of sight and he 's nodding his head yes thank you and the second question is regarding the postponement of the council elections that 's mentioned in this document we know that it is mandated that after at a certain period of time after each election the new council has to develop a four year delivery plan I 'm just wondering that would normally take place after an election this September does that then laps until after the election in September 21 and will that then be a three year delivery plan if so mr. chairman councillors may recall one of the recent circles from the office of the local government on this very matter which did extend the current delivery delivery programmed by one year thank you anybody else wish to speak on the resolution before us no further comment yes I can throw a count for the better and I yep yes mr. mayor I spot what other councillors later they already know but and the people of Kara know that this is a budget and this is where we think we need to operate at the moment moving forward and but as with all budgets if something comes up and has to be adjusted these there is there is ways that we can make adjustments if the if this if people having trouble making their rates and so forth we can go into plans with them also there is a lot of discussion at times about the price of our water and you it 's the price of water cannot be just looked at between one town and another town because every towns got a different operation system to deliver water and and they can be in a different way through a redevelopment plan and so forth but as the mayor said about this upcoming review of their water issues we will be looking at ensuring that these services are delivered then a young at the best possible price to the users thank you thanks Council right any further comments write a reply counsel the world resolution or is in favor please thank you and against I declare it carry Thank You colleagues that concludes the meeting we have a meeting at five o 'clock obviously but there is a different drop in connection so we 'll declare this meeting closed and we 'll leave with this meeting for a time being thank you _"

Marius I did I did have a question or a comment to make if I may and there was some confusion affiliate about Council of Fagin 's declaration of a non-pecuniary interest in the matter and what that is now correctly noted in the resolution in the paragraph below headed to closure disclosures of interests it 's still noted as a pecuniary rather than a non-pecuniary interest thank you we should move that happened that happy that minor adjustment it made a little Miller thank you can 't watch me any further comments on those I 'll put the resolution all right against carry we now move to the excuse me the mirror minute in regards to the garden center playgrounds water line there 's I recommend a sand there 's a mirror a minute which I would be pleased to move for so much the second that place I was leaving the mr. pink Thank You councillor Miller I counsel at this very briefly speaking to this this was something we did discuss at a at a previous very emotionally so it 's concerned the work that is being undertaken and the money being provided is for work which we need to take to our own water supply we know that the screens have actually been purchased and so we actually the state stayed young state government money to actually do that work as far as working with central plants that concerned I think it 's very important to recognize that they are count a level five restrictions and we have been the beneficiary of coming from Central Plains to to care and the long-standing agreement we have with affairs always provided for a two-way flow of business I think something that we need need to be doing and I point out for pretty for human needs and emergency supplies only but counsel Miller wants to provide any comment I let me to take questions Thank You mr. mr. mayor yes just to just to add to the comments you did Mike I think that they 're two very important points one there is no agreement with our engine console as far as this is concerned the report clearly shows and secondly the giving some of the work done which is to our benefit is when they 're negotiated agreement with central table ends is finalized in the coming months as well and that 'll be a really important document as far as this is concerned so I think that with those two one areas covered off clearly covered up in this report here I think we should all support the proposed and acknowledge that the word between down as far as this is concerned so far including the work that 's been done by yourself and this is a very important project for water security emergency water suppliers and it 's something that we all should support thank you for the comment or question counsel the right to go to close to they 'll come to you counselor yes mr. mayor I acknowledge what councillor Miller just said but why you spoke in your report it appears oranges has been driving their case to get water out of the system when they need it but that 's all to be negotiated going forward isn 't it there 's no it 's all that we the we have to be pretty careful just what who influences the deliberations on the negotiation of the agreement I think that we 've we 've demonstrated they 're pretty pretty fair capacity to dated to to influence the direction some of these conversations take and I think we also need to not get hung up on any one particular community the report clearly says this be water gave the central table there 's only a to using the Rockland Valley but when it comes to critical human needs and emergency supplies I think we need to be I think the broader community would expect we would be a little bit supportive of those communities that are struggling to put water in their pipes for their communities under though under those circumstances I think we need by a true regional gaming 's I mean some of it game to regional emotion some of the stuff that we make sure that we actually do support our neighbors as far as that any agreement we 've pipelining we only have an agreement the temperate pavements the report clearly says Terra mr. chairman just to clarify and make it very clear what I said this is not about the development of orange it is absolutely not about that at all it 's about emergency supplies only and that that 's why it 's important as far as the agreement is concerned how 'd you clearly said it I thought I said it clearly enough but assigned a guy this is not about the future development of orange at all it 's about human needs if and when there is another major drought situation or whatever Thank You captain Fagan I just wanted to know in a similar way is there any other this is orange councils the head of the great little ahead agreement is there another part of this agreement that orange council has with ctw or orange council has it and on the project underway under this agreement as well or is it just us it doesn 't actually say anything about orange I agree the money is being provided meant for Truckee New South Wales and oranges that had council doing the money the overriding committee of all Caravela many of our eggs in the German in December ago they water the way it is in content then will then run was that the the allocated money will then come to Carroll council who were project manage the whole thing within carats including the new design we already got the equipment of the design and the expenditures money and the central Koblenz and we will get that money and if we run over that 's our problem not anybody else 's an eccentric over lands we 'll get the balance of money which is which has been allocated to to their operation again if they ever run what 's been allocated and that 's their problem not the counts so no liability to Cairo to pick up the tab if that runs over at this stage as far as I understand there is a connection between orange and temporal turbulence but there is no agreement been formalized between our intercept okay that 's at this point I 'd also add that there 's a 500 meter leaves between Cara and car core which means that it 's almost consider pumping water directly back to tak or even you probably could because that the cost would be quite significant I think that we need to consider that we also look at the report coming up furthering in this agenda we 're dueling on for example and template overloads our level 5 that 's not there 's an issue there and it 's also there 's not good hanging up too much on no that 's fine thank you I just thought it was a bigger project if there 's something else happening no there 's nothing else nothing else this is this is the foolish vintage of the 5.5 million dollars thank you yes mr. mayor I think it 's important to know that the main beneficiaries of this are going to be first of all ourselves in power of three hundred and fifty thousand for the intake screens and also the villages particularly hopefully not have to go into the sort of water restrictions I have at the moment sequencing to note though that those villages are predominantly in the in the donkey bomber electorate or a higher obviously of course rental is in their in their own right so there 's a lot of a lot of a lot of areas going to benefit greatly from having the greater certainty that this will do and I never use father I think that 's a misnomer this is just giving greater certainty to a supplier particularly particularly when brown strikes thank you just one correction Chicago is inter bond by the government area to any any further comments or questions Thank You colleagues I just come up very quickly with one further comment and that is that we need to consider that this is helping to to relieve some of the pressures that may potentially arise through like a rain water shortages but also plenty out the carriage I counsel has on more than one occasion been a beneficiary of water coming back to us from sensitive areas water so we have been a beneficiary of this pipeline this sort of a this sort of an agreement so they could say that we keep that 's good they keep that in MI and freeze off with resolution wise number two incomes of Meral minute is the cave igniting financial support report which is which is basically the local government New South Wales format in terms of a request to support I would happily move that recommendation in all those points or entice me thank you and just speaking at this I would note that the second dot pointing to you me may be financial assistance to support council employers especially in early childcare in that area the government how about announcements the last into 48 hours or three days in regard to some of that measure being kicked up for some of those workers in those those areas so that one hasn 't been kicked off completely but Alicia 's been some recognition and support provided over the balance of the report I think it 's been important that we follow it for the comment councilman Smith no mr.

be clear carried we have the c55 committee minutes of the Friends of the gallery council better right thank you any comments or questions on this nothing to add it 's it 's very quiet at the any cards for the comments or questions I 'll just one comment mr. chairman following along from my last question perhaps they could look at having a virtual cool drink and a yes ivory with the virtual tour thank you when you throw the comments or questions a requirement necessary I 'll put the resolution all those in favor against Peter carry item six which is a suspension of charging interest rates on our standing gets and we deferred this one of the council meeting there was a recommendation that we do this I 'm concerned and the issues raised about that there 's some want to move that or something differently please we defer this matter for further consideration down the track yeah your microphone councillor Miller I did have some concerns about it no I I go to some directions from yourself really my initial reaction that this hasn 't changed at all I don 't think we should be making a blanket decision on suspension of charging interest at all and there is an option for our ratepayers to to come to council if they 're having arrangements and I think that that 's how it should be so the direction I 'm safety from you is to actually just kick the can down the road a little bit or my preference is that we actually don 't adopt this recommendation and we encourage people that are having difficulty to been paying their their own debts to come and talk to the appropriate people Council I would it 'll give in my comment I would be quite happy if we were to at this point not go down this path and we might revisit it in three months time but we also encourage community to to talk to our staff if there are issues the other one I would raise is that businesses are entitled to apply now for a state government grant of 10,000 which is the small business Covino down support grant and the guidelines on that ground specific around about it 's for payment of utilities second dot point council rates so there may well be there may well be other methods whereby businesses in particular are able to get money from the state lot of a lot of support out there than we probably don 't quite know where their support lands just yet point of order if I might yep I think isn 't this just this is just to defer decision this isn 't about talking about anything else this is just about deferring the decision the suspension of the charges decision and we can continue to defer this is my order if you want to move what if you want to move that that 's what 's there we defer it does who counts me council me sorry it cancel my order mr. chairman yep has it been a mover and a seconder of this or with there hasn 't been a move in a seconder and they will be in due course council all right well I 'm just kidding now I 'm just concerned with the seems to be debate without knowing what we 're discussing okay mister mr. chairman just to clarify then I thought some direction from you as to how we would deal with this I will move that we do not adopt the suggested outstanding debt at this time thank you you can speak to Miller yes mr. chairman and just to clarify what I said earlier I actually think that there is and to confirm booth and support the comments that you made at this stage I think that as we know there is certainly for all of our ratepayers that have debts with them with counsel to there is a facilities there to come and if they 're having difficulty meeting those obligations to County Council and talking appropriate people to enter into arrangements to well to pay those debts secondly there is no I 'm number of packages that have been announced around support packages as we go through the cowbird nineteen issue and and you talked about some of them where which is about businesses certainly as far as even our pensioners and that received to our payments and those again would support helping them pay their utilities etc and and also with the new starting or there 's there 's a plethora of other options at the moment and I think that if we need to at some stage need at the moment to do that come to the walk yes mr. mayor I was originally somewhat in favor of council doing something people could leave a position with since it 's become apparent that the previous speaker pointed out that there 's quite a bit of assistance available through both federal and state government and they have a federal and state government have a far greater ability to raise raise raise some taxes or borrow some money or even print some money if they need to and local government cannot do that we 've got to we 've got to make sure that we 're always fit for the future and as pointed out to my previous figure if anyone has a problem with their rates water to reach whatever if anyone has a problem with them it 's always been made very clear that they can come form of payment with Council so the comment yeah what 's is been any policy come familiar from the local government sociation about any foreclosures on ratepayers from not paying rates during this co-ed thing where nothing comes from that Wales or from the minister but care tri-council like all other councils have a very very lenient policy when it comes to foreclosing on ratepayers and that 's not something that we really ever get in the powerful be chipped on the odd very very exceptional occasion so I think all councils we 've got a very good track record have been very very supportive and working with their communities for the comment thanks mr. chairman appreciate that no wasn 't saying we want to start doing that but I just thought with the landlord thing and you can 't have addictions of tenants and so forth that modeling something nothing aware of no Christian please mr. chair yes Leonard the original motion was to the further decision until the April council meeting that 's that 's now isn 't it yeah all right so I want to speak against it because I can 't see what but now that it 's it 's only to defer to tonight I don 't understand how we we weren 't deferring it at all really well I mean probably the technical way dot point you can move in a second or a B we note the committee that without the committee recommendation and then we do they do with this is a second dot point but it still it still is from the committee recommendation we made no decision and flicked it straight past them straight through to be built with tonight at the council meeting and the the minute the minute that the motion as it stands now is that we at this point we don 't take any we don 't provide that interest holiday or subsidy you know I 'd like to speak against it I 'd like to defer it until a date because I don 't_''_1713.019 I don 't like the the reason that when we 're just going to can it all together we don 't know what 's happening with with this with the covered we don 't know where the community where we 're heading as a community if we if we can at all together do are we allowed to come back and review another night tonight just can i the the mover and the move and the secondary of movement it might not hit my reading of it and my understanding is that we are not taking it up now but we will revisit it when and if we need to at any particular point five I can 't get other councilmen of you wanna clarify your motion Thank You mr. chairman and I thought I made that very clear in itself where I say that this time at the end of the motion all right because it does there is an opportunity here if things become you know circumstances change of course we would really look at it but for now but under current circumstances I need to do concur and actually a question thank you further comments I come back to you counselor while Fred you further comment quick one councillor Walsh and I go to accountability it 's just just a quick thing regarding any possible which I understand that basically a program that takes about five years to actually happen so I don 't think there 's any any need for anyone have any fear that council will ospry to you to sign me up was I think guess the wall just did it mr. mee in that case I put the resolution all those in favor all right against carried change page I 'm sorry we now come to the item number seven on the agenda 305 committee the draft minutes of the order of risk and Improvement Committee minutes be noted there 's a recommendation there note them I 'll move that until the Walsh remove them I guess is the instead large timers ever member the committee are happy to second that any comments or questions comments or questions we will move on the resolution all those in favor hi Jane so declared carried item number eight which is from the Victorian construction operations is tipside green waste pickup I 'll move it mister Marilyn counselor maybe the second of this thing counsel and counsel a mellow councillor Smith you is just speak to that at all yes miss I have in the two weeks since committee meeting as I indicated at the committee meeting sent this recommendation and the accompanying background to members of of them but I have spoken to the majority of them and of course this recommendation or this investigation came from that body towns recommendation unanimously they are in agreement that the background to the recommendation clearly shows that at this time it is far too expensive and inappropriate to come to bring this green waste collection it being the recommendation I would note simply is that the introduction of the service is not considered for the draft delivery and operational program for the next financial year therefore should circumstances change in any major way and I believe they would have to be major we can read look at it for the comment I put the resolution all those in favor Clara carried either number nine draft copy gates and people bypassed policy resolution resolution their counsel to Fagin thank you I was second to place councillor Walsh thank you there any comments counselor Fagin at all no this is just a tidy up of a policy that was updated and I think it 's a very good move and it makes it easier for going forward thank you and all

've got points there they 've come to the wall Thank You councillor Smith second set thank you any comments council the world you know I think I spoke quite a bit about this at the committee meetings

item item 11 da da 2023 Melaleuca circuit move move councillor Walsh again thank you comments counselor Walt come to council because of the variations of the high height restrictions for that we have on buildings and new buildings and because of the positioning of this residence have quite rightly suggested that this should be allowed to proceed and I agree with them any further comments councillor Fagan no comment no comment require not necessary to be a colleagues and I can see you your hands please but already over the cameras doctor wall yep thank you just for the public record anybody here is unable to see and interest that I can see that all the counselors there at the meeting have everybody in favor of this particularly developed architectures if I eat the carry next item is a sneaky to the one the bottom of the page I don 't know the 12 is the local for a strategic planning statement I think we note the report of the director has suggested this matter be deferred until May can the director in the director just not that two-thirds of my thank you report be noted the method be brought back to the May Committee meeting Ruth bacon we move it thank you could suck if they 're taking it away thank you it 's too busy to look me directly to make sure I didn 't said instead of said that time frame was not me what we 're not capable of meeting so nobody can still a favor second counselor Walsh Council if they can do it just big at all as cage has suggested there has been some changes and some different maps and things needed so it 's a good opportunity to tidy up a few things that were missing it 's a great great report and we need to get it right and get us community when as soon as we can but there 's no use rushing us and I think it 's a good time to hold things back that we say any for the comment thank you in the correspondence from the from the director today it was noted that the department had asked for some questions like questions that have come in since the the committee may be through the chair they sort of coming up with all sorts of things as people look at it you know in the department so they 're asking for a map of Cara in the in the in the document which may which is a which is a plan of what 's already there basically with a few suggested amendments which may when we got when we get there darn I think I 'll circulate that before 's my future things on it as well thank you thank you thank you councils all right any further comments or questions I 'll reply reply every corporate thank you now reply I 'll put the resolution I was in favor again so I declared carried item number one from the general manager 's report to this meetings directly the meeting is subject is round two of the 2019 2020 Community Grants Program as a recommendation there we adopt a number of a number of bodies the total of 26 thousand dollars and a few and twenty-three organisation to move that one of the members of the committee the panel want to remove that this council amendment of a second to blows cancel now you put the end up of you think you 've canceled the notes would be enough Thank You mr. David just absent million I know that you it was reluctant to get a mover and initially fund that but I think they understand a bit because they were not the Kooning it was expressed as far as committee members were concerned as far as some of a good job that was finding it to our organization the community and that 's good secondly can I commend the committee for the work that they 've done as far as this is concerned to get it to a stage where they can may I recommend that we have proved it so I think that all of Mosiah worthy will be worded recipients I 'm sure that good use of the funding so the comment come carefully counselor knows to encourage councilors me mr. mayor I won 't take part in the debate because of the non-pecuniary interest I declared but just for the information of councillors you would note that in the natural resource management section there were again no applications and definitely before the next round of grant funding the committee will be reviewing what sort of things can be applied for and making some or recommending some relevant relevant adjustments to councils thank you thank you counselor counselor walk it could be that we 're doubling up to some extent on our rim donations because of the money that 's available or made available through the schools in particular to the show ground and also I remember correctly across the league the golf club for planting so I think probably we 're at cross-purposes a little bit and maybe we may be a review of that would be a good idea Thank You councillor right hand up yes mr. chairman I wonder on page 48 Cara jr. rugby 's application was sort of sits with the purchase of odd then it goes down it did come up now what 's not the referee audio there 's another question I see a couple of the soccer the senior and junior shockers I think we 're asking for applying shirts and that would it be too much to have Cara Shire embroidered on them to see we 're buying them or assisting part of a sponsorship thing or is that outside the part of the policy of the committee committee committee currently dealing with the quality that council the guidelines at council I just think that in the past we have asked that those bodies getting getting a donation to acknowledge the council the community support that we on anything maybe that 's something that we take on notice and discuss another forum and maybe the members of the panel councillor Kevin Wright and counselor Smith might have conversations with that their panel as well and come back with a comment the counselor but we 're never in the past each Pig did that and I think it 's time to to start it now but it 's a good it 's probably something that hasn 't happened before so we happens all over just to supplementary to that then mr. maryk perhaps if it went to the to the Sports Committee body for discussion if they get funding if the nation probably what 's an optimal yeah sorry thank you for the comments cancel it Smith mr. Muir with for a second time if I may with your permission obviously what normally happens if and when there 's the grant funding is passed is that council hosts the morning tea for recipients obviously that won 't be at the present time so can I suggest that there is a full list of participants published and that information days as we speak I have done a small video recording this afternoon and there is going to be some publicity both through the normal media also on on our councils web pages and so forth which will play that in the video and we 'll list all those who have been when responsive feel like they 've been able to get the money other council always all yelling so you 've probably I should have I should have made that comment to start with I 'm sorry Thank You mr. mayor maybe we could do a zoom meeting with all them all there 's a lot of it you preempted the decision from tonight I didn 't I I didn 't name anybody I just did video Thanks and no names that would put to honey and he any public any media until this council maybe has been adopted any council develop none of us would so the comments reply I 'll put the resolution all those in favor against be clear to carry the recommendations that we discussed earlier I think tidelands is obviously very careful about the I think it 's you know what we have to do they 're not actually usually I just say you 're like town what I 'm supposed to be asleep that 's all I don 't know what causes it when people go to talk there 's a yellow ring around you screw acknowledge me it 's it 's a highlight Hey so hi hello I will not start some of those I misplaced I 'll put the resolution as in favor aye item item item number two from the services in regard to you mr. mee hold on we 've got the line borrowing thank you the salmon off I couldn 't find it page 74 of the iPad that 's why I 'm back looking for you I 'm not come on the hardcopy if I think Casa de Vega like I was pausing for a reading reading item number two from the director I 'm doing nothing you move move the item which is line but this has not entered in 21 Loring 's move that they take into place councillor Smith thank you do speak counsel this is a really good outcome for us we got this recommendation which we should who should be unanimous with this if we look at the projected done interest rate at the moment it 's obviously subject to what Willis the sums are drawn down but we 're talking about two percent at the moment which is significantly lower than many many of our current line borrowings it just just reflects the the situation at the moment as far as interest rates are concerned but it 's good that we can actually take advantage of that if we look at the three young projects which we 're talking about here then the debye redevelop at the line level you replace the line liberal bridge which is so important to us as we discuss we 've discovered many many times and of course the recibe the footpath refurbishment in its I think as far as the third one is concerned and so it 's whilst we 've got a little bit frustrated at times and how long it took us to to give us where we could commit that project and on it there but I think it had we convinced it straight away would be part would be paying seeking to be getting more higher interest rates above the earth so what we intend upon so it 's a good outcome all round but don 't and it 's a guide and opportunity for us to take advantage of that to corpse arrangements as far as the borrowings are concerned yeah thank you further comment the second which will speak mr. mayor the only thing that I will add three projects funding will be used that loan seeking has already considerably earlier in time being approved by counsel this is us it 's it 's now that we need the loans being approved thank you for the comments no further comments below I 'll reply just make one quick one is that the information cancels with the first day the depo from what I understand I think members of depo working party will be invited over there to have a look at observing safe distancing rules and regulations and I 'm sure that I can get the general manager or freights and photographs or the counsels of the safe mode as well it 's just a note that that stage one has been completed which I think he 's hiding news so the comments right reply Thank You mr. chairman I think and I did touch on it I think the gazebo Davis been a mosque that we continue to get updates from indirectly so I don 't who is the manager of that project I think that it should be said publicly in there and the progress that 's been made there and the quality of the work that 's been made there and also and White 's been handled by the director in liaising with the business community in particular but all the community I think we should acknowledge the support that we 've been getting from the business community gammites true because he 's causing significant disruption however the end result I think speaks for itself thank you I 'll put the resolution all those in favor all right again slowly so Carrie now I can go to buy the number two from the corporate services which and I know you all would have picked up that little bit of a gremlin and we have a light report all right a corrected report the general manager is advising that we will be better to note this report and we will deal with the corrected report as I lately clear that 's on removing out if you book please come to the wall show you end up those second two please thank you I 'll put the resolution all those in favor again again again slightly favors have Religious Council decision I 'll move mr. chairman they recount on the Miller second earthquakes I 'm a second that counselor kinda knobs thank you if anybody we should to speak on this at all the tiny house key it 's a few housekeeping it 's a formality that it 's a requirement really that as soon as is a we 're able to any matter that 's dealt with enclosed committee as soon as we 're able to be released into the public arena that 's what we 're doing on this in this case thank you any further I carry number one from the director of infrastructure operations which is claiming relief on council owned or managed properties of 33.3 document recommendation there so we should move that or something else me thank you second to please catch all the names you liked em once a second yeah thank you I 'll say thank you to speak counselor mr. me I 'll just say that this this recommendation comes a mandatory on that conduct that has been put in place by the national government commercial eating premises during the 19 dec 2013 13 are Crown land and so on not necessarily direct owned by council there are not a large number of them but it is appropriate that we authorize the mayor and general manager to negotiate appropriate payment relief in line with the code of conduct with the fees or the licensees or the units of such properties if needed but the comment now I just thought I think it 's a great initiative in those times thank you for the comment mr. chairman just a perhaps a question to the general world so there it 's of operations but so I guess the clarification if it 's consistent with a code of conduct why do we need to adopt a recommendation at all if it 's if it 's pipe it 's caught up in the recommendations the National recommendations anyway just a clarification I 'm not speaking against it poor poor and I 've just asked the question sir Ector the main the main part of the recommendation is that the mayor and general manager authorized to negotiate that relief and I guess you 're right that we 're just reinforcing the method of negotiation will be in accordance with that God very good answer director well I 'm still not sure why we needed that to be honest with you perhaps I can speak for it I I think where it won 't be reduced with it without our knowledge that they we give you the power to operate under these things really like if if they went and done it and then we heard about it we said well why won 't we tell the starkness so that 's sort of it horse it 's you gotta follow under it and it 's not a blanket flavor I have to meet certain criteria from my under principle three so any any any for the comments over in polite any further comments they further comments rider E and O for the comics write a reply and I 'll put the resolution others in say that I 'm against you to carry over number two from the director is the jabber committee let me let me find mr. chair and very very light as you can see as far as the tracking committee is concerned I 'm happy to move the recommendations thank you have a second of that please and singing the notes Thank You Council Miller you got our pre-law at this one yes mr. chairman any questions Chancellor Smith get you a to speak councillor Miller I 'm sorry I shamed mr. Chairman I indicated I 'm happy to take questions and then you probably see it Thank You councillor Smith thank you mr. mayor I don 't think it 's appropriate that we allow our council Miller to get off too may to just explain the rationale behind dot points two and three and the recommendations the rationale really as far as point two is concerned is that the this purchase of a new community bus in the bus run for the community and needed somewhere that could accommodate that and there was a couple of alternatives one was that we could we would lose a a one of them parking space or the disabled or we could do us what was being suggested one of the options there are three options presented to us is to actually move the bus zone to the south by three one three point one meters which accommodates the the current disabled car parks plus the bus car park zone and just made perfect sense to the committee as far as I was concerned if it 's unanimous decision to recommend to council and the second one was to the third point the second point they 're around that the corner of Brisbane Street and Beau Street was to make that site there was some uncertainty about some of the parking times there as to is just standardized that thank you someone else had a question didn 't ya just following on from dot point three there so how far up those Street or Brisbane how far up brisbane street does it go right up to the to the corner or from both street or is it just it says on the corner but there 's two crossings here now already mr. chairman can I suggest you we try this yep there the actual distance is my idea of fun it could give you a wrong answer that 's all I 'll do is I 'll just sneak back to the report and give you the answer and I can 't remember I should have read the report again but I didn 't know that 's all right sense and it will be all from 00 a.m. to 30 p.m. inclusive thank you and you 're happy to support this with that advice coming the detail a bus like you can 't a little right I 'm happy to accept it in an implement it and if it doesn 't work we can change it the question is all advice from not Eagle template for the minute for many Jabba yep so we 'll move on if you 're if you 're happy any further questions any other questions for the question is rod requirement necessary I 'll put resolution wise in favor all right against T player carried and the director who finds that before the meetings area might just give me a signal and we can do a little bit provide that advice item number three from the instructor operations really Kaveri 2021 program listing there of works to be done the so in the program to the wall check into please yes awesome cancel please right thank you there 's move what you speak at all yes Justin it 's very pleasing to see the program [Music] can tell you having driven a couple of those roads yes yes that the recovery particularly I mean having to do quite a bit of watering over the last seven or eight to nine months to actually do any work on right so let 's hope we can take advantage of maybe some better weather reasonable rainfall rather comment sickness happy any comment others wish to make is just that we should continue to note this is a federally got federally funded federal government funded program which I think we are appreciative in which we need to maintain our roads and that we encourage the federal government to continue to provide this sort of support for our communities rod reply put the resolution eyes in favor against against you Clara carried light light report which usually one in our pink folders deals with the amended quarterly budget review statement we 've all seen that in some form I 'm happy to say mister to the World Council the Walter is moving encounter another seconded yep sorry yep you 're right do you any mistake first or Lobby right like I 'm happy less counselor Wall Street first I 'd be doing a bit lenient they come to the wrong to you it 's just big they 're gonna he what counsel with Vegas questions I 'm just um could I 'm just interested in there is a mention I 'm sorry I just I had skiing a rule we 're putting back referring a rural waters game and I 'm just if somebody would like me and what that easy so I can 't couldn 't think what it was or where came from somebody could there 's a deferment of funds general manager picks a other sorry I 'm just trying to find it might account for the Welsh leak and then come back there question when we find it I do anybody who sees the report doesn 't get too excited over the ten point five million surplus that 's showing there because that is a surplus which [Music] is incorporating a number of our grants that have not been used yet they 're on in books but they have not been used yet and an actual fact our net operating profit for the year is five hundred ninety two thousand so I think I do it 's great care and people really reporting this and getting excited over the fact that council may has revised have a revised estimate for this odious than 460 twenty ten million five hundred and twenty seven money which is already listed for use not yet used Thank You counselor well the second day which is big I think that probably just sign up with your addiction counselor while all that glitters is not necessarily gold thank you for the comment yes mr. chairman said them this new read this slight item replaces the template on the first page of the item in the agenda yep but that wasn 't the previous quarters was that the previous quarters one up to the 30th of December 31st of December or I think it 's from another year I think if you read it you would have picked up but it was the wrong year somehow it just got mixed up and I hid now watch it I guess because everything seemed to be improved for a lot more and what those figures were there I had two or three phone calls very quickly a couple yourself never counsellors it actually picked it up and read it so if I 'm sure the director got a crank call this morning and these things happen and consequently has been amended the car I thought it looked pretty good because I live in the past and that 's I 'm not sure everybody got a comment on there but a lot of smiles counter the Fagan if you found what you 're looking for actually disappeared she she disappeared off screen you may be looking if I might mention she may be looking for the couple of statements in the report regarding the 5,200,000 for the emergency drought drought emergency water supply project she 's over here at the Phil Amari one but unless unless I get a text or something we can 't we can answer their questions later but we can 't sort of hold hold the stop sign up for the Train so she hasn 't she connecting to audio counsel with account gentleman he just picked it up so he might use those yes mr. chairman I can 't give the explanation might have to defer to either copper service director infrastructural operations director but councillor Fagan I think is referring to on on much more pages of the iPad but page 10 of this document it year and includes rural residential water reticulation of 450 mm because also mentioned I know in the Director of Corporate Services report to the information meeting and it did say that was going to be subject to a further report to Council which I assume will come at some point from director infrastructure and operations and other there may be able to shed more light on it than that question counsel if I 'm welcome back there sorry I rent uses a lot of electricity to zoom um yes and especially when you 're out in the wild yeah no that was what he was asking about but I don 't remember anything about that and I was wondering if I 'd miss something and along the line hung over City thank you any further comments on this rod replied to me offer the resolution I was in favor all right against he 's clear Carrie no like no motion to notice just a question if I may mr. chair mr. mayor um I think the director of infrastructure operations just sent a note out to us and he indicated to be under this 00 to 30 one is that on Vine Street the director to make a comment please and then you can ask a question of the victor because I haven 't_''_4113.63 got that in front of me so I assume has come out with yeah yeah through the chair that 's a bit experimental so I copied that from the report and pasted it in the zoom group chat and it 's gone out to everybody yeah disappeared quick it 's up on it 's up on the screen your phone on me not on my iPad I 'm the fritters cadmium I know I have to be quick okay I can 't win from E so in summary it 's the report is this cut discussing the use of the existing care of public school bus stop of Brisbane Street and it 's really just changing the timeframe of use of that bus stop there 's no change to the bus stop length or where it is or anything suggested as part of the report yep okay thank you and I think thank you for that which just goes on to the zoom meeting to anybody and that 's a good operation Thank You director thank you but be mindful colleagues it if you but that is part of the meeting and that a check is available to any member of the public who is the recordings Adam reporting yep mr. chairman you what you asked for it any wife you don 't notice most of their notice etc I just think it would be appropriate to acknowledge the RSL sup range in the organization of the an sac patience as of the weekend I think that that I know that the community embraced it I think the organisation of it was excellent and applying in the last was just I think you want to express some appreciation to the people who run the Medical Center for the manner in which the flu injections are being conducted asthma two different weekends I appreciate the fact that their own fundamental to the success of that acknowledged as the general manager takes that on board but also I think the idea would have probably come from the Medical they handled that was really tremendous I did and can only just amount of tremendous amount of praise from the general public they say you 're happy to move this is another it matters a matter of urgent business some a second matter would and business think you put that be do it as a matter of business all those against him favor you carried I 'm happy to see a big ship it as a matter of business your most your motion is that we write to the Medical Center and congratulate them on the innovation and the initiative in terms of the drive through flu injection clinics they conducted they organizing conducted they 've got it moved by Councillor Walter I think counter the millisecond that further comment on that I put the resolution all those in favor your consideration was mr. mayor with these coded regulations going forward and every area and New South Wales it 's a bit different like we 've got no actual people with the virus in the era sire so will we be able to talk to someone there possibly read relaxing wonder what the provision is for each council talking to the state government to get things open up I 'm not sure what my colleagues might think on this but my opinion is that we will do absolutely nothing until guided by the health authorities both the National Authority and the state of Nu any any contemplation are lifting or easing restrictions and movements I think it 's it 's been a great success to date that we 've been able to but as a community both in our community and other communities they keep typically the impact of Cayo Venado into to the lower level that it is I think it 's probably fortunate yeah sure that we haven 't received any any Coburn event cases that was amazed we 're not going to get one or get get some in in the future so I think it 's important that we continue to bunker down and to completely support the the regulations and the directions that are provided mind the both the federal and state government bodies and authorities are out ground this matter we 've got I the restrictions end of the week so maybe the state the federal government will come up with something but when they do we will react that until then I think to be quite have been too hard I think it would be responsible didn 't else but to support the state federal government initiative in their directions mr. Chairman I wasn 't suggesting and we do something alone but do we can we go to access to talk to buy the free local government to the health people to see what they 're thinking about areas where there 's there 's no virus at the moment for them but I think I think that the virus wait for someone else to make a suggestion points might happen to take about the point I 'll take a I 'll take a motion to close the meeting to the public in accordance with can I have the act the following and there 's significant wonder significant numbers to get through so please bear with me the first one is a mayoral minute 10 a 2 a of the Act impose council subject concerning particular individuals second one is 10 a to do one of the acts from the general committee recommendations the subject is rivers Road been group which replacement tender five-stroke 2020 the reason is commercial information of a confidential nature that would have disclosed pre give us a commercial position of the person supplied it the third one is the general community recommendation that subject is RFP for request for tender for stroke 2020 caravan park management services recent information that would have disclosed can confer of emotional advantage on the person who with them counsel is conducting or proposes to get back business next we have Ken a to see of the act general committee recommendation again the subject is pitch and reduction program for CBD the reason information that would have disclosed further commercial advantage on a person within Council is conducting or proposes to conduct business we have been another one which is from the council report some council offices 10a to do one of the act for the director infrastructure operation subject is came to eight 2020 replacement of plan 51 which is a row suction confidential nature that would have disclosed prejudice and commercial position of the person who supplied it following one is 10 a 2 d 2 of the Act Directory infrastructure operations again subject is New South Wales Fire Service Precinct the Cairo Airport reason is for a commercial advantage to a competitor of the council and the final one who 's a duplication of the pigeon reduction program which is a separate report bodies comes under the initial report that I did read through so we have covered all those reasons for closing the meeting to the puppy to consider them in accordance with the act or someone like the move that are it may be that ways Meridian Smith signal council council Miller off at the resolution all those in favor against I declare a council please be clear carried I 'm sorry the presume leading off for the public all this a lot of looking law was looking good guys still live _"

okay we are live streaming so I 'll he clear the meeting open and I would acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land in which we gather the rotary people pay my respects to their elders both past and present so I would again acknowledge that you 're all aware as counselors that we are live-streaming this particular mating and for anybody who is watching this I would be point out that the general manager myself and the council chambers other directors through our president are in their offices as Tory councilors in the council building on iPads or computers and there is the remaining councillors are at home and are on zoom '_''_86.7 so we 're all present not all present but those attending and meeting our present and are actively participating I will take an apology and application for leave of absence I 've had one application leave the apology and leave absence be granted please don 't move counsel the world shaking the council oh you 're right all right thank you Peter I 'll put the resolution that leave of absence be granted all those in favor all right against carried is closed of interest at any council the needed or member staff name to declare an interest in ran on the Kokiri and I neither man are in the air gender about the deal with they know public disclosures of interest will move forward to the public forum and the there is a opportunity for the community to address the committee or the council in you know a form of public forum those have been in this meeting have not taken that opportunity so therefore there is no public forum and I just again point out to people in the capital train but physically the general manager and myself we then moved the confirmation and minutes of the meeting he 'll not March twenty twenty second to council of Smith thank you there 's any questions or comments relating to those minute saying none those in favor aye again study if they 're carried I would do these chime those in a minute we now have a report from the general manager either number one on thank you page number page going on on the iPad in regards to the postponement of the 2020 local government elections to be now you have to be held in September twenty twenty-one I 'll move those council a second for a walk through any comment any comments or questions I 'll just briefly say mr. mayor that that means a couple of things apart from a one-year extension of the current term it means that the next term of office will only be three years it also means that this particular council in September will need to conduct elections for the mayor and deputy mayor as per the state government legislation amendment yep yes I just mention that my familiar that I think this is a a very sensible approach by the state government in that I feel also it would be very difficult fray even if an election was able to take place it would be there 's a number of new members not knowing just where we 're going to be financially and you know barriers other projects of might or various other things so such as the visitor center and why caravan park we don 't know what 's going to happen there over the next three four five or six months so I think this is a very sensible think they have happening and I applaud it thank you any further comment against Eclair carried number one from in the Director of Corporate Services in regards investments to report there to be no good I want to move that or thank you I 'll second it councillor Smith thank you you can speak to council the welfare issue you need arise not at this stage really I think it 's just interesting watching the average interest rate and the the down cutting down curve on it again certainly our money investors not going to be earning nearly what we might have thought of might you know even two or three years ago so the other thing that 's a bit of an unknown rights and particularly water right and also general rates it 's it 's too early to tell you just how that 's going to work out and say we 'd have a better idea by the interview just watch miss no I 'm sure me you got a comment the only comment I would make and the touched on rates firstly to remind people to counsel do not have the same part if you like this right in federal government we have a more more more digitally and trying providing stimulus package essentially but I would say to anybody in the community that who is having trouble with any of their rights or their vision charge is to contact counsel maybe I can work through well the comments rod will reply but put the resolution all those in favor I can 't carry out of number two from the Director Corporate Services the minutes of the Youth Council making held on 9th of December 10th of February and March army aside from those days so a second to flourish for Chancellor sweet I 'll second up can 't look better do mr. Muir I 'll speak particularly about the third set of minutes and counselors would have noted that we have had an AGM and we have a new chairperson Stacy Austin and we have as per the recent Youth Council policy code deputy chairs being cake price and Olivia McNamara and those people have been working very strongly for some times so I anticipate that they will prove a boon for us the only other thing that I would say is that that last set of minutes talks about the Youth Week activities that were planned by the Youth Council obviously all of those had to be canceled because of the COBE situation and I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating all the members of the Youth Council and leave the barren because they weeks to come up with an entirely different set of Youth Week activities all of which were conducted online and they included things like uploading a video of innovative ways to pass the time during covert isolation dad challenges there was a an online meeting with the local members Steph cook there were host of different arrangements and online Trinity of all of which together with only a couple of weeks to go and all of which worked very well so I would like to congratulate the Youth Council and Linda Barron for all the work that they did to get those up and running and to participate in them you for the comment yes mr. chairman pretty right regarding item 3.4 in the in the March meeting they did approached me to to seek advice for the where 's the thousand dollar donation to the RFS could go and I spoke to the zone management and I didn 't come away there with a very good feeling that was just going to go into a big pot with some other community money and they 're gonna buy sand fire vacuum cleaners or something so we we 've come back to do something in the lines or brigades which is a big difficulties RFS and the GAR FSA and given ten thousand dollars to each Brigade to spend on necessary equipment and but there could be holes there that we can fill up as well I think Linda was young a ring the mayor but so we 're just making sure that that thousand dollars is spent in Shire thank you thank you thank you thank you counsel all right yeah I 'm not I 'm not not familiar with that one yet I just kind of touched on one differences councillor Smith didn 't make about the video confidence they had to review discussion that had with death cook I was fortunate man to sitting on the first part of that like speculating on cetera that I want rather than you should even there to be the Youth Council being pressured on what they didn 't tell they manage that particular equally forum for the comment I 'll reply I just thank you mr. mayor for those comments and I will pass them on and also thank council leader right for his work on liaising with the RFS thank you to know this it up with the resolution all those in favor all right against I declare it carried next item items free is the gallery Advisory Committee minutes the resolution may yeah I can 't_''_748.91 put a millisecond of that counselor Walter moved to the capital you 'd like to see I could see that he I could see you moving in the mood or trying to find the buttons I thank you mr. chairman listen this council wishes to say something I just I do have a comment I wish to make about the gallery directors report but years I was just going to say that yes I note the gallery directors report it is not a lot else that one can say at the moment the gallery is closed unfortunately it 's very sad about that but let 's just hope that all can we can move towards a wonderful fund raise a plant and wonderful anniversary on the 31st of October the attend you 20 years since the Gallery opened and it 's always a good thing to be able to celebrate these things and sort of perhaps pay a little bit of homage to the people who had the foresight to see that this gallery did happen it 's a wonderful asset to our community and I of the caling collection will be once again taking place where the Calvin prize collection will be taking place councillor Miller Thank You mr. chairman and I concur with all of those comments that but but whilst I 'm reluctant to to me perhaps seen as being a little bit critical a couple of these items have mentioned in the gallery directors report did concerning in the sense that as we know we 're very excited to have made the arrangements which were led by the gallery director regarding the sculptures that have been most of which are now been installed up in scope under the auspices of the public art committee and concerns about I think the statement that 's made in there particularly at the first one two new concrete slabs this face things and designed and located by the gallery director well I wonder whether that 's correct or not or at least what expertise the gallery director may have had as far as designing a concrete slab for start and I just wonder whether that 's correct or whether the if that is correct that would concrete slabs the second part I think is more concerning and it 's where one of the sculptors was doomed to be too small for up in the sculpture park I understand that but I would have thought that they 'd be at least that the public art committee would have at least been advised that we needed quite an alternative arrangement or more then a spot for that that sculpture and that again has not been forthcoming at all this is the food when I read this was the first though made aware of that that I think is that there 's a concern going forward if we are going to have a council committee to oversee and to look at the all of these activities rip around public art we should be included and as you know I 've always reluctant to a bit critical of council staff publicly but I think as far as this is concerned this is having the public aware when it needs to be commented on so and if we look at some of the proposals we 've had as far as some in keeping with what is proposed down there into the future or not it should be considered as far as whether it should be going there at all and until such time was that conversation his head it shouldn 't be placed them yeah I I would concur that Council another and I would hope that we will continue to pursue that one old firm is the comment that I 'm not sure what complication or the conversation then having to get these gardens or not they are that the capacity that have the right of reply to all writers leader but I think there is equally whereas I that the proposal the sculpture park probably came out of it at the Japanese garden because since the design head and got drunk pick it up and run by your father for members of the public committee are buried and I 'm also with something established by rotary many years ago and I just wonder if they 've had any conversations about what 's been happening as well I needs their counselors mister yes thank you mister me I don 't_''_1031.409 Advisory Committee in any way they 're very hard-working I 'm just looking at the the committee numbers of present and those who were apologies I 'm just wondering whether they in fact had a a quorum so they 're meeting in which case these would have to be ratified at a later stage if they don 't have one yeah okay it 's about a valid point that I think they could still make a report to Council even though it might be a Minority Report mr. chair notes were made very clear I wasn 't being critical of the Advisory Committee at all as far as this is concerned but I was certainly had some concerns about some of the the wild as far as the gallery director is concerned I didn 't didn 't quite a anybody should should take your comments have been critical of the committee because with the committee absolutely no involvement with that so so shouldn 't in anything conferred at all for the comment rather reply I 'm losing every resolution all those in favor all right if they 're carried now did I miss 30 I train together is okay yes Friends of the gallery I 'm working a hard copy because I can 't think from my peg to so friends the gallery I 'm moving I canceled the clear to write thank you Fagin Fagin comments or questions no it 's no comedy the young they 've just got operate through this Cove at 19 thing and hopefully they 're still with us to continue on their good work I 'm sure they will be yes the only comment that I would would make is the same as for the last recommendation their peer not to have a poram so it 's I think it 's just something that they need to be reminded of that these can 't_''_1199.74 be actual minutes until that such time as its ratified back for I think these are very important committees to council maybe it 's something that where the council could actually be be actively kind at the Shu members for that committee all those committees as an option that we might like to just discuss down the track we might the resolution was in favor all right item number five Director Corporate Services it 's in regard the council approves of suspending suspension of charging interest and outstanding debts between 1st of April this year and 30 September this year um Chancellor Walsh well checking the place yes I 'll second it the Angela Smith thank you you just be careful the world yes I think it 's something that 's been given consideration by quite a few councils if I remember correctly and it 's the being the third tier of government where possible if this might give that little bit of help to anybody who 's but but at the same time making it very clear that the debt is still there and that would be a suspension of charging interest on debt for that for this period the the other thing that intrigued me is that when thinking about this was that the 750 dollars the buzz I think sent around to most people by the by the federal government to try and get us all go and spend money and Molly 's on toilet paper I suggested that that might go on utilities and correct me if I 'm wrong there but I would presume that those that are a bit pressed but probably already spent upon power gas and phone so it 's and probably this was going to be that little bit of help to people who receive a rate or a water bill and stress to pay until they get back into employment or get a get their business functioning again you know mr. mayor Councillor while she spoke very thoroughly and compassionately Eman yes thank you ix for the book review on this I think that we go we need to be very careful about putting a blanket press release or anything else out there that we are considering this here because it 's there were certainly some people have been absolutely negatively impacted by going forward and and it 's still uncertain and it 's going to be uncertain for some time however I think it could be construed the other way that we almost encouraging people did not pay because we 're not going to charge interest on it over be really careful about it I think that don 't you know the the intent I think is fine but I think that the point that has just been made by counsel while some degree his whilst it might be construed us a little bit misleading because he made an all encompassing statement about the 750 dollars was received by everybody well that 's not quite right no but some people did receive that and you would like to think that they would be paying using that to pay that fully utilities including their their water bill however let 's get back to the point that I 'm making I just don 't think that we should be putting a blanket now anybody that doesn 't pay their water or account I 've been extinct six months there 'll be no interest charged on it I think we should encourage the feeblest will always do cubby counselor if they 're having trouble paying their their their accounts to come in and that and their lives which will remain and that could well be that we do that oppose the the to be to a basis rather than just a blanket you have any suggestions and how we might word dish mr. Tara I don 't know if the council is of a mind to do something like that on well I think we could just perhaps the different term we can have a discussion about it out of the mix the week and we can we could work out the wording of it and just deal with a direct at the council meeting I think the the thrust of this is fine it 's about the blanket part of it I have some concerns about and you know nobody else might agree with that but but that 's what I would like to just see happen with perhaps the DA the general manager or or the Director of Corporate Services got a comment about interesting council is thinking about there in terms of being selective in how you can do charge or not charge interest so I 'm just not sure where you 're going me well well mr. chairman just to clarify that I just think that this here decision that we are going to defer all interest for this six month period making very clear that as Kessler was who said that the the account is still there and the yeah will need to be paid going forward but it 's a suspension of the interest part no but I just think that that should be just part of the normal arrangements that we do have if somebody 's having difficulty around paying their account and they should come in and talk to us about it rather than make a blanket decision to do it I will make comment mr. chairman the one of the reasons this report has come before council is that staff have no delegation that 's one of the things that can 't_''_1554.45 be delegated so it 's either an individual basis and you may well get hundreds of them or it is the blanket approach all right yeah ice I have similar thoughts to councillor Miller to offer a blanket suspension I this goes for all council deaths as it was it only related to general rates and water and sewage and waste have with council or through the chair it 's solely directed at water and search and on general rates well thank you thank you for the director for that I think well that should be included in the resolution and I think there should be a application form that they 've got to fill in to apply for it so they actually have to tell us that they they that they want it rather than we just give it to everyone just some then that brings us in that that brings them in the way we can talk to about getting the rest of the about paid the capital amount paid so it 's probably going to get messy and that 's going to take more time but I think we need to we 've got three letters there and they 've made the effort we haven 't seen the letters it 's that the council receives free letters I don 't know what it was or what it regards but at least they 've made the effort to contact us but it looks like the ones that don 't efforts and a lot of our debts are with people that don 't even live in terror and I just think that needs a little bit more wordy ended of what it applies to and and some form of applications thank you that 's all the did you ever end up you are stretching look like something extra something cancer of my iPad that you what do you speak dippers all right it cancel the walk yeah if that I understand the feelings of councillor Miller and counselor right and I 'd be perfectly happy if this can be worded differently or put in a different light for the council meeting and I 'd be perfectly happy to suggest that we defer decision on that so you 're you 're happy and I 'll take that if you 're happy as a movie to withdraw the motion in favor of moving something else to the second happy withdraw the microphone yes mr. mayor I think that there are some valid points made but we do need to do we need to be able to work out how we can assist people taking advantage thank you I 'll move that we defer this for a decision directly to the council waiting for decision counselor counselor Walsh we 'll check another drawer yes okay thank you all right thank you the motion has been withdrawn and the motion there 's places that we defer the matter and get so we defer the matter and have it go directly to the consumer there becomes a little ticket that comes at a loss I think we don 't need to discuss any further mr. move wishes some sort of write a reply of the resolution I was in favor I 'm against it carried so we now go to 54 44 44 for me what do pool risk committee before I get any further one for the draft minutes can be ordered risk any improvement committee to be noted second there I guess I 'm on the committee ocean seconds it is counselor rod any questions we went through a lot of we went through a lot of items things were thank you cramping my counselor counselor right I 'm happy to take questions at 00 partying and finished six minutes past 00 so we certainly are there have fees on that particular day and should say publicly but we have a long meeting but it is quite a rigorous process that gets involved Chancellor what 15 years the water ordered you were able to give me any idea just what that 's going to entail I mean when we talk water we 're talking very wide-ranging portfolio if I could call of that is this to do with the accounting of water as we 'll do with river supply or as a to try and cover everything that council covers in the water I think that really the minutes in my recollection account to the right I want to help me here but my recollection of issues that we 're seeking that 's concerned about what the ordered offices water order would look like and we were asking them to provide a scope of that of that order when it 's available read bit concerning but there was no real background to at all so the idea is to ask for some sort look like given the fact that just a couple of words in report but had no real relevance perhaps we might be other have a copy of that at some stage or is that in committee now though you should be getting I will Jim councilors are getting a full copy of the audit committee agendas and go back and it should it should it should form part of the audit committee heir Devender I think something can know the order to office would be open and transparent which is what they demand everybody else one would never suggest that they would have to rules with me for the comments yes am i mr. chairman that was one item that the ordered office was going to do something and they haven 't done it or they requested but the rest of the other two paragraphs that was around our mitigation with the possible boards of marrying licensing and the directive reply the applications are being made and what is available regarding a license and allocation through the Department of Water and thanks counsel all right energy do you want to and so if council walls or other councillors go back through the previous order community agendas you won 't find anything you put it office attended one of the central audio total these Alliance meetings and flag at the maybe utilities upcoming and all that we ask or think if they 're going to do that give us a little bit of a look at the scope that they 're proposing to order utilities on scene there nothing since thank you thank you doing lemonade go any further comment now for the comments because a mover wanted to write a reply no thank you I put the resolution all those in favor aye high against I declare carried next item on the agenda is item number one can direct the corporate director environmental sorry Oh third time lucky director of infrastructure and operations in regard to curbside green waste pickup as a recommendation there I 'll move it to Chairman Joe Smith Thank You councillor Millers gotta you hand up so so I cancel if I again you wanna ask a question there I do can I ask a question green waste in their normal rubbish bin is that is that what happens now I know that happens now is that a problem for us yes through the chief the greenways guys in the normal rubbish bin it just goes into the landfill so it 's not really a problem I suppose you could say it takes up could take up more volume but it is crushed by the Quebec so I 'm small amounts of green waste do go in the normal rubbish bin often well I expect so I expect people would be putting their lawn clippings in the in will be well mr. chairman you 'd like to think that they 're actually using those in their composting but Don will tell as far as that 's concerned many of us do have composting and do use as that 's where we put our lawn clippings in there green waste to some degree so but I think just speaking in favor of this here I think this clearly says when it might be considered the draft delivery program not wise to plan for 2021 but that doesn be considered at some stage in the future because sir but as this report clearly says the significant cost associated to this and we would need to actually get to a stage where it 's able to be to be processed enough that it becomes a viable commercial operation or were able to put it down right through the town all the rest of it so I think common sense approach at the moment but I think beyond the track it may well be something that we can consider I will apologize to councillor Smithers mover the motion and I 'll go back to her to have a say and oh you 've got a hand up not giving you further strike at it that 's that 's fine as the mover of the motion I 'd like to firstly thank the director and his staff for looking into this on behalf of or on the back of a recommendation to council from the Tidy Towns committee as councillor Miller said it 's it 's very clear that it 's not something that is economically viable at the moment and would be prohibitive for many and particularly at this time so I do support council the Miller 's comments that at some future time this may need to be something that we look at again we are looking at expansion of the capabilities of the Murph and of it hopefully becoming a more and even more regional facility and perhaps down the track the green waste consideration is something that could be revisited I do have a question mr. mayor and council presuming that this is passed at the council me I would like to forward this recommendation in its entirety with all the background to this of the Tidy Towns committee so I 'm wondering if that is is acceptable to you mr. Muir should it be passed at the council meeting certainly it 's acceptable because these are public public documents so you 're fully entitled do that and and add a respect for them and tidy towns committee maybe you want to provide them with a copy of these before the council me they 're entitled to know they arranged it so they may well want to we should offer them that opportunity so yeah please feel free to do that thank you I appreciate that and can I can I just ask now to the director could Forge me this in a separate file so that I can send it on thank you I 'm sure that can be done the directors gonna nod his head is me he just did yep counsel pit road yes mayor I support the recommendation and and it 's been stated that it 's it 's too expensive and if we go to sell it that 's got to go through a licensing arrangement and ever have all the food labeling standards on the side of it and I presume the majority of the big green waste as I said comes in small lots and trailers or utilities as sent round to be mulched for some new use and thing but perhaps wrathgate could use an idea of part of recycling is setting up a home composting or something and then the following year they could have a competition of the best grown vegetable on the compost thank you maybe the the public face of them the compost means willing to trade for the comments councillor Smith give you a road reply shouldn 't you like it it 's cancer looks like you got your hand up no okay just on my iPad you 're on the screen in front of you know my bedside put it up ages ago so you might like to take it off or something I can No my hands there you go but I want to put coke on the next thing no no replied needed mr. Muir thank you I 'll put the rift the resolution all those in favor against Gary all you need to do colleagues most of you I can see your faces so in your AGA and just put your hand up beside your faces sort of you know like that I can see them clear that carried next item is the public gates and by a pass policy to draft council of say can you remove that or do you want to just yes I 'd like to I 'd like to change the title if I may risk so could we have a call it vehicle buys past policy public gate and vehicle bypass this new policy like I just like so if the director is if the director is happy of that because it doesn 't doesn 't interfere with any state government rules and regulations about public gates and and public access if that doesn 't change that if that can be changed that interfering in that state government rule issue with that it actually I took out decided motor no bypass which I thought was quite old-fashioned understand so vehicle bypasses for bypass I think has a definition in the act but that 's not that change changing telephones I will move the motion with that change if that 's okay recommend data yeah you just make that Castle Italian yes though it 's quite a clear policy I think it changes things nicely and but I do think it it was beginning to look a bit like a heart attack and I felt that we needed to put some big big killer movement in it so I 've moved that thank you you so there 's anybody else wish to speak on them just a question of I might cancel it so these gates that are put up by council oh yeah on 19 you know I think the body the report has been issued for quite some time I think the budget report telling us that there are some gates across public roads which people in some cases either closed or in other cases have a lot of them I think you clearly spelling out the fact that that 's not accessible on public roads we 've know sometimes to have their own personal security issues so they feel that may or may not be the case if you can 't block a public road and we know that council graders don 't go through closed roads closed gates I mean this was a matter of make sure those gates are open there 's a wreck you want to clarify that or I 've got a reasonably accurate thank you hmm that thank you mr. chair and thank you director Thank You councillor Wolfe I question most to those that are already gates have one already Adam director might want to comment on that I did make the comment in the follow changes in the policy was to take away the annual review these gates because it wasn 't and and the intent of the policy now is if there 's a problem with the gate across a public road we can use the opposite rather than a wholesale going yet move existing gates but I think it 's realistic with the amount of resources that I have to let you know that we will go out and address every gate if there 's a problem with a gate that comes up like prism on that you 're all aware of we can use the policy to address it but good thank you further comments or questions mr. chair I 'm just Miller you you were raising your arm or you know this was just a quick comment I think there to combat that explanation it 's a common set it further comments driver reply No thank you not required I 'll put the resolution all those in favor all right against patiently and roffels working item number one is three minutes of the natural resource management committee 2.2 point 7 into a right to move I 'll second it yeah yes yes you wish to speak counselor well as I mentioned at the last council meeting there was a change in the chairmanship of lead in our in group and at that meeting we did whatever nation that counsel that mr. John Rankin would be thank for the work that he 's done over the years and member pretty welcome groaning well good to see that also that he intends to continue on even though he 's having some health problems the other thing was the wonderful take-up of the of the solar panel forum that was held I originally thought there was about 90 to 100 people there but they I note in the in the minutes of their meeting it suggested that there might have been about 130 hundred thirty-five people ways that was very successful and I 'm hoping that now will be will be able to progress on and and organize more functions like that that can able to give counsel some feedback from as to what has happened and what the public are interested in so and I think in some ways recently is last year or two we 've lost our wire a little bit and I know the director of Environmental Services has been somewhat unhappy about the way he thinks we 're going but we 've there are a number of other things which we do have been doing and doing very well and one is the smaller environmental grants projects which have been taken up very well by the schools and I 'll note that that 's also somewhere there in those minutes as well no and it obviously there won 't be any meetings now until such time as the virus and problem is in somewhat mitigated so we 'll look forward to starting again man thank you sticking to wish to speak cancel wish got a hand up go to you thanks mister me I was interested in a lot of the work that is being done by this in our committee and particularly I was interested in the city assist counsel and I just like to flag that I at the end of this I 'd like to move a motion concerning investigating where the council should join that if you have a if you have a look at the report it does say that I 'm going to prepare a report for Council okay great thank you [Music] just just nothing on my screen on iPad but there 's something up on the big screen in front of me I can 't I can 't read his anybody anybody else wish to comment on that what do you mean on the meeting now on the on the on the agenda item yes yeah um just a question regarding the Botham ever item or whatever is that is that the little pot of trees on the southwest side of the Japanese gardens isn 't it yes that is it and that 's been of concern for some time well it 's been raised by one of the members who lives near there and I have suggested to him though that it 's not necesarily Bay disease that I think planting trees sometimes groups don 't necessarily plant the the correct type of tree for a particular area and sometimes they might plant trees that need a bit of room too close to each other and the Darwin theory takes over then the survival of the fittest and I think that has happened both of those things are evident when you take a look around at the moment there 's 12 dead trees there at the moment that need removing and they in my mind anyway and I 'm not an arborist by any means but we own a lot of trees and I would suggest that instead of that gray box and white box which seem to be the predominant varieties of trees up on that on the ridges and just below and that the probably the wrong variety some of them are some of them not even native to this state some of what has been planted there in the past while I give great credit to people who were planting did plant those trees I think you know we need to take a bit of a look the what is already obviously native to that area it 's councillor walter council the figures got a hand up but before i go to council a while so i would just simply say welcome councillor knobs i don 't know how long you were waiting to get in that i just saw it on the screen and we couldn 't i do or closer to the screen to see exactly what it said so just just got you in so i think in future someone 's waiting to get in then we probably need a text or ring the ring i 've got my mobile phone with millet on so maybe even sounds general manager so maybe if there 's a problem getting give us a give us a ring in future but brought them counseling I hope you 'd never wait too long and I 've got to say you 've started that you wash it we only got the top of your head from your eyes up but we 've also got weighing the dam for sure obviously showing us you 've probably started a thing for know that when the discussion about the sculpture park we had with the public Weiser II committee that council did a master plan for the area so maybe that 's available and could be looked at as part of that report leads to what 's happening up at the Arboretum just a suggestion there 's already a master plan for the site no thank you further on the 18th of March meeting item number one point to other matters that they 're asking for the committee policy to be updated that there 's the general manager and the directors just do that or then it come to council page one of six in the paper it 's the first page of the 18th of March meeting what what what number sorry one point two yeah mr. chairman I can certainly look at the policy review schedule and see when that policy is due to be reviewed between now and the council meeting I said it hadn 't been done since 2011 so then they 're just looking for an update I just more freedom thank you two points just two the operation manual for the committee 's it 's one thing and that 's what I 'm talking about in terms of the policy review schedules which I 'm sure get around to doing not that I suspect it will change very much the delegation to the committee is another matter and that 's something that council reviews every year so I lived in 12 months of every election all right thanks very much for the comments I 'll reply very I 'll put the resolution all those in favor all right any cleared carrier thank you item number 2 the director Environmental Services is dia number 2 numb sorry da to 2020 being locked 1 2 1 3 Melaleuca suited carer recommendation it therefore approval with a number of conditions if the report covers this very well and suggests that the reason why it 's different but they developers or the Irish seeking when you have a look at the buildings up there the landscape plan is is and the taking into account the proposed landscape plan on the higher side of the building and fact that the original complaint and he seems happy with with it I see no reason for counsel to refusal affiant I 'm sorry this way it 's been well documented it 's well the aesthetic many variable X is very comprehensive and I think it just explains it quite well it 's a very large house and a very large block and I don 't think people will get out of tape this year in check thank you for the comments yes mr. chairman for my this is the third house in that area that 's had the same problem with a height restriction when we do a review of the DCP is there any reason why that they 're going so high is it just personal preference or we had escaped with the with community expectations of height I I would have thought that 's personal first some desires by some of them owns the land I must have build a house free country I think the DCP is something we obviously always look at but the BJP is probably standing in good stead in terms of having some form of control buildings being regulated thank you for the comment rod reply yes if I could just mention that I am there 's always understood that the height recommendation for DCP was what they are simply because of overshadowing that can take place in more mostly closely settled areas so that is certainly not pertinent in this case I 'll take those are something now we need to vote colleagues will need to clear their vote if you raise your hand counsel what Smith you providing for again so I can see cancel a Fagan counselor node so I 'd be clear I can for those who might be watching this big records I can see all those hands and they should all be on your screen so I did clear them out the matter character unanimously thank you item number three from the directly Ron Miller services is the draft to craft care local strategic planning statement there 's a recommendation there because had a phobia to dot point that go there 'd be a tradition remove that something else well I would move it but with the suggestion that to be prepared to admit who just mentioned what I think might need to change I would I 'm just wondering whether you might be more prudent than to refer the method directly the council know that you can refer to the council and anybody who has any issues to raise raise them with the director with the next by the end of the week now there 's an elderly 20 council to ensure the director can then redact those those comments into the report so we can sort them in so you having to move that way that we and and that any comments be provided to the director prior to the end of the working week mr. chairman to the right account to the wall speaker if you move the motion I 'll come back to you just for a number of reasons and there are definite a number of it 's probably nitpicking but I like to see everything correct and there 's a few few errors there in my history of care and also one of the maps a about flight connections in decay seems to indicate the plane with the strip coming in onto it and also and I think just to clarify a few things in the villages for example was bold type they 're referring to in the Goolagong report referring to the log cabin but it 's an underneath the factor of the of the hotel and also the same out of Woodstock really it refers to the the Memorial Park at the interest of Woodstock the photo is of actual sports ground and I think it can be to those who may not know the area that can be a little bit confusing but also when at the start there are mentions that Evans name the area Oxley Plains will in actual fact he named at Warwick Plains Oxley Plains was later years by Hamilton Hume for an area down southwest of Goldman I think if I remember correctly but certainly in Evans a diary refers to it as Warwick claims so I 'm I am sure that the director can expect a call from you sometime next two or three days to make these these observations I 'll write it down Smith thanks for me yes I do call me call me the from Hill well I think it 's it 's a terrific document there are a couple of typos and punctuation things that I would also like to see fixed and my apologies to the director but I didn 't get them in earlier it 's just amazing how much there is to do in these times of lockdown but I will get the meaning by email by Friday thank you Thank You councillor Smith and I I would pick up on on the comment that you did make was that have always got to be some adjustments and changes and I think the director would note that I think we should also acknowledge the Minister matter work the women to the religious retreat she planning to start with and also they would work this Connie has Easter fun as well so we 're fortunate over the start we have to do this for the comment yes just a question mr. chairman Peter item could I could risk the councillors get those those changes or whatever or comment so council right visually if they 're in bother Claire has a business this week the director will have a chance to make the amendments and that will then amend it copy or them come out their business papers at least so yes we will see them and I just out of interest and I 'm probably I 'm sure that if account for the Walsh will counsel but Smith the thing I mean they might even say so you all and thank you for the comments write a reply declare it carried no late reports I mean any now notice the motion no matters of urgent business I will then take a yeah and there is my colleague they 'll then take a motion could we 've gold to close them into public your considering the court and I have react following three items one is indirectly reference tractor operations subject is rivers Road Bengaluru bridge replacement ten to five straight 2020 the reason commercial among information of a confidential match that would be disclosed

Jim it is before you did I wonder whether you actually what no no stop the question that this future ah sweet least our son what you may give you give are you lifting an amendment the timing is really suspect mr. chairman but it 's but secondly I think that the actual timing of this to him that we make to the general manager one or lengthen the have the opportunity to have a public comment normal start to get back within the park prime stance is to time and what 's interesting and three [Music] he 's been comin did some is something it 's fair enough to for them to have a discussion my trailer ever met the way things have changed in the last fortnight we are going to do this and see up-and-coming is just too difficult and I should have we have to wait for the scene to me told to remind me of procedures well they grand experiment we help each other to dos [Music] absolutely the Bible to say that sort of [Music] [Music] [Music] I think it 's wonderful to have this coming in there 's money has played by about cannot say that I think it 's actually if there 's also how that means meaning which is great as work this is the only one put a lot of work into these application because there was quite a few second I will know that these threats are not easy to do and I appreciate that clarify that you were successful I for that nation I was molding was unsuccessful but firstly I think it 's fabulous that we 've got this funding I think it 's terrific that it 's going to the villages and and particularly with that in in the main it 's going to park areas my only concern is the Woodstock Lions Park councilors might remember that there was an application for some grant funding by the appropriate association or walk back for shading for the plant pigment of that part and that application was didn 't make it into the package that the me of dollars will be something that council decided on but there was a lot of discussion about that and I 've had discussions with the director and with Chris Cunard about the concerns for usability of the play equipment there without covering given that summers tend to be longer and hotter and given the concerns that for children to actually touch and there was some talk about working out other shading methods such as some quick growing trees to the west as as we know that the shade sales are appropriate for a number of reasons that 's so I 'm hoping that the director will take that into consideration and if there 's any money or time anything such a shame to be done with true look at other alternatives mr. mayor the issue was really bad with the shade cloth very useful very serviceable done a sensible approach to it because I just that box and I think there is lead image that was a replacement another representation that 's the plot k2 because of any Sheeran wish I thought too after the drug you were you know that 's my comment this is what I understand this grant was a product for my counsel and counsel will be doing the work the villages have to be consultation with the ability to a certain extent but we have to operate under our standards and the second question is counsel find alluded to was this had a ceremony for last week or was this a separate part of the application we made and the funding was it was a presentation last week at the air club which indicated that billing re receive funding through all that they would send or receive again they had also given funding excited the area or at least certainly through the funding for the villain I recall does that have any crossover with the funding that we approved in rat tubes a drought apologizing may prevent issues were working for change but if I might mr. chairman I guess I 'm a concern we we 're sort of really pressed we see that they have a problem with watch bit bunny some degree but a lot of different projects is whether we can actually achieve you know reasonable time I was really good for the aid of this report and saw that we did not have to have this police completed until when you read this all really because I mean it 's really important yes we need to continue to work in front of us canceled this year that about Russia versus visit Mike you can catch monogamy that sets or compensates of Christ I was wondering how we would handle this mr. Chen does it happen at the school so we are expecting a report that for me and you it would be a bit of times where I suddenly discovered it 's a whole world one that 's very but there was a relative actually this gated community the community on scan but how much yes it does on the page to the item it appears like to ask the director fees including sponsorship money as a donation through the chair know what 's been stated there [Music] see something inside that 's beating this other word Authority is just it 's just a sponsor you mean the talents are part of discount well can I correct that through the chair there is an item on in 10 500 for sponsorship so anything that has been given there 's also another 500 once of shoot so anything provided to the step that is has been concluded there and there 's been a donation to travel on a better question the question of my vitamin 20 of the village to pay a private limited that was I thought originally it was the southern Rio holidays was the so does that just be it would change that officially or so this is subsea tree or so there 's several holidays it was for exact copy no I just thought what a sighted brew maybe a company not a company in now thank you I won the victory cooperation to make this game series game hand moving in I think what we were informed of last week and then the report here we 've tried to assess what the extra costs are and been to the slavery world accreditation of the system and marketing is much every part in persistence and and this this money goes into the accountant the other money to make up any shortfalls and it occurs so people doubt they 're going to pay you hire serious rates and the people who care there 's a very difficult situation in the way this at the moment and and over any fluid which is the biggest problem with this and in the sense we 're taking that leap of faith into the great unknown I don 't have enough information apart from my knowledge of the director and his due diligence to say where this sufficient or insufficient that I do trust the director perhaps not so entirely trusting of the state government by entrusting or councils ability to should our revenue stream or the other screen indeed be severely compromised to make mr. chairman I 've said no she had many of the views and I 'm certainly hopeful that the optimism bears fruit and as you know I 'm serving just magically so having a longer coat remember that that 's been around the table because you know what in the hay that remain former project which was through that time we were the sole that big impact and it did cost a lot of the anxiety of a lot of money innovation I was certainly not creating a request to me rictus_,_2771.42 competencies at all I have two sisters concerned but having we 've been once just do expect this to be passed tonight the other side of this coin needs to be at least put in the public arena most practices this decision is concerned because they we should at least be concerned about this project can afford because some there 's been issues with the delivery over to start with ongoing issues and they are will be ensure that it is in terrific working order all the rest of the funds have been allocated to it will do what capsule a right and set them able to compensate and [Music] some time ago not accepted final climatic final time seeking assurance everyone was canceled devastated and the campus was missing the TV 's trust will certainly nothing on that campus buildings out like they shouldn 't be but connectors will require Chairman 's now when you hear the comments I tell you one board one speaking quite try that some and what 's here is that facilities been built that cannot and cost came up and covered by the existing users of the facility and that 's why we 've had these few extra amounts of money putting it up front and staff have done a good job there to protect to the best of their ability and they are ability of the future of the future costs of their operation and in trying to be positive I 've always seen where a steering systems gone into an area some good development usually comes with it and just hope the park area to accept the challenge put something there that will be good for the area and intake this facility whatever there 's proper levels we haven 't got some compensation come forward Carrie I do watch okay next item he 's by age 40 but we think wasted you better call thank you firstly I think the director for the report it 's it 's very comprehensive as I read it I started making notes because I thought how can we speak but as I kept reading it was all explosives so it 's perfectly understandable is to rethink that we 're able to facilitate this change if we agree to it without a gateway determination my question through You mr. Muir to the director is just looking at the map seems that only a very small portion of the land was used land that is designated environmental management and the risk is already light or I in one way into and I asked three views that 's great that 's great okay thank you one more wonderful for than that no don 't my speaking listening certainly something that 's pleasing to see because [Music] the where the problem was were right about ten years ago and following the pressure mr. Talman they were given a choice which he wasn 't very happy with the time please please come back now and but basically well you what you 've got to do is what he was advised to do ten years ago that 's definitely disappointing some developments taking place they which probably has not had appropriate approval but anyway amazing to see that this is now in front of Council of hoping that a bull council will give its approval for the comment yeah ask the director this morning that question just exists the corner of a fishing pole on the street and young rider but it seems to hit around I thought where it is for this survey a new hood map there is a green triangle to set the path to positive wonderful corner and once I love the book and there 's a quite a large bright reserve in that area so it 's funny funny group you know I just yeah well I see my same comfortable and you 've asked the question whether this change the effect of the West carrier channel southern bypass I thought it 's going to go through you nervous any really exactly what it is and I think she said it to everyone so angry food that means before you okay question this seems to be a simple system than what we 've had to do with drive service this is a different class these which I know I seem to see plug it 's an it 's an error it 's an anomaly Council in nearly paid prices and the way you a liar that is just automatically given to us that was on Jan identified all those eight times so we just use those maps we don I agree with mr. chairman this obviously was because there was an indication there was going to be a small charged play attention was about who said that coin [Music] just a question sorry Rico a question mr. minute regarding the access Drive waiting there has to be an excess driveway constructed in accordance with castles engineering standards does that mean it 's a sealed driveway assuming that is the face but it doesn 't say put a car butterfly I won 7-3 they 're around the i-12 like one you might strike you yes at 8 mr. Chu not having to thank you I just a very large house yes particularly as it 's on question if I may give this to men or at least all questions the background to the DA talks about one non-native tree and the vector the aerial view of the site seems to show quite a number of traders do any animus on resuming the rest of natives but do any of those troops have to be I think I 'd know sorry there are there are and I 'm sorry that 's he must have deferred the previous ones from the committee meeting the day I mean off the streets creeper I should get down just looks like there could be a bit of a war going on this going to build the highest house we get the best views it 's good to save someone doing something better comments morning mr. chairman I just I think that Bostick they 're coming they 're coming to him hardest into this it 's a interest in what having them I going to be here on apartment having been personally impacted by to buy cream you know so many years ago five prescriptions a concern I think that this just really just makes perfect sense particularly my life the panel workshop that was held I think probably had about 90 to 100 people in it yes very well attended and very interesting questions coming out of that so I think that was something very worthwhile unfortunately I was when a conference last week when the ad in the [Music] newspapers you know I would like to just publicly thank John Rankin for carrying Metro they are the core area where a bonus for Cara that have that sort of version showing the interest believe in you sort of flag changing any political point to yes I would like to say that [Music] [Music] trying to except my passion which is really to do with as far as council meetings I conservative cities and clarification on the water to rise of their obsession getting some information like peaceful firing action epic except that if you ever motion to accept that this one that you 've accepted the resolution or the favor or carrying a like a gang to be there well mr. chair that the motion is that we actually write to the Minister for local government to seeking clarification on how the weekend or and some dispensation I think for the industry as to how we conduct meetings for the foreseeable future I think that we can see the open forums all the rest of what we do perhaps it 's all the motions to speak whether we are weather incisions that 's right mr. chairman if that 's really adjustable neck stretch just cannot hold weddings unless we are face to face we 're unsure about section shirts on our communities because that was an issue that is that 's about the function of of the elected Medical Council 's to carry on their business you know so following the guards and all the restaurant made it 's probably time that we at least I 'm able to look at conducting up meetings as virtual meetings where there was so much technology around there actually what I 'd like to do that and we need to be able to get some assurances from the war for dispensation from he 's really at a stage where yep as you know there 's the general manager now it 's always very hesitant they 're attending tonight me and certain indicator that it will have about number of people within the admin form that we have no assurances that were carrying out sort of the recommended process processes of heightened by everything else is such that we do live in a part of the battle and full of all supership future issue of you know system how we feel and and and now we able to say is that like long people face department according to practice type of cancer it 's not having a a client family so they can become like the Norwegian category mr. Jim just just to clarify that that is actually this is for personal future until such time as we work at West room what is were all we is that it 's interchanging based upon either changing almost on the our beginning more important than the elements that were education from there maybe that that we further an answer was tomorrow and then oscillation about what schools will be closed to all sort of things so I think we need we need assistive fabrication get on the front Porter Street so that there is some assurances that governments will continue between the operations of character council tonight post on camera kappa can 't pull counsel from the National Council people I shouldn 't expose revenge of multiplicity in Council is a masculine positive people business and secondly can i to be one of the active operations again came to playing I keep putting a writing right up again the reason is Commission information of a confidential nature that would you disclose prejudices commercially to to 2020 place typically for 572 to seems cool but keeping trucks again the reason is Commission information of a confidential nature that would disclose position supplied it Oh careful another second camera for low resolution _"

help you find some bugs in your backyard it 's called a viewfinder and you can make it out of anything you have handy i have found in my kitchen some teaspoons look at that i found four teaspoons and i 've joined them together and i 've made them like a little diamond and i can hold it up to my face and use this as my viewfinder or when i find a bug i can put it like that so i can look at the bug through my viewfinder i 've also made one using some textures that i had you can use pencils or if you have some long crayons you can use them as well but what i love to make viewfinders out of is some sticks i found in my backyard so i just need four ready one two three four and i can join them together in the corners more corner to join right here so let me get my tape and i 'll just wrap it around oops didn 't do a very good job of that wrap it can wrap it wrap it wrap it around and just squish it really tight tada there 's my stick viewfinder i am going to go now looking for some bugs in my backyard and i might even do a little experiment with some ants and the muesli bar that i 'm having for my afternoon tea sounds pretty interesting let 's go and have a look when looking for bugs i found this little guy high up in my mandarin tree looking for some mandarins to eat i think and he 's crawling all over the leaves he 's green like the leaves so he 's a little bit hard to see i 've used my viewfinder to find this bug where is he let me go this way a little bit there he is use my viewfinder to find this bug crawling on the leaf also in the mandarin tree i found this spider hiding underneath a leaf in between the leaves looking in this tree i found a spider web that has the spider 's dinner in it he 's caught a little fly in his spiderweb this is my broad bean plant and the bees love to drink the honey from its flowers but i have to be really careful not to get too close because there 's a lot of bees buzzing around this tree they might sting me i 'm gonna do a little experiment i have a teeny tiny little crumb from my muesli bar and i have some crumbs from my piece of bread that i had on my sandwich and i 'm going to sprinkle them here on the ground ready i 'll show you like this i 'm going to place my muesli broth crumb right there and i 'm gonna sprinkle some crumbs from my bread and i 'm gonna see if the ants come and take them away let 's go and see if they eat them i knew the ants would love my muesli bar can you see them crawling all over it [Music] ants love sweet muesli bar crumb there 's even one on top of my breadcrumb having a snack here 's another aunt who 's taking a crumb back to his family oh and he 's shared it with his little friend and now they 've both got crumbs i know gabrielle has something very special for us now she 's going to show us how to make one of these it 's a bug hotel for your very own bugs in your very own backyard christina had so many interesting bugs and insects living in her garden and most insects and bugs are actually really good for our gardens and that 's why today we 're going to build an insect house to try and get some more insects to move into our gardens now we 're going to use different things to build this insect house you might like to use this milk container that i 've cut a hole in the top you might have another bottle that you could use that you can cut space in it as well or a cardboard box or even something that you 're going place for the insects to move into and an insect home is somewhere that insects might lay their eggs might keep them safe from their enemies and it gives them shelter in the bad weather as well or they might even just hibernate in there in wintertime so the first thing you need to do is decide what you 're going to use to build your insect house now if you use cardboard the insect house won 't last as long if you use something with wood or even some recycled materials like this but you can still use a cardboard box maybe just make sure that you put it under shelter because it will last longer but your insects will love it no matter what kind of thing you use and i have now collected a whole lot of things from my garden area so i 've got some leaf litter from the ground some twigs some bigger kind of sticks some bark and i 'm even going to use some recycled clown paper cylinders and cardboard and if you collect things that are already in your backyard this why then they might recognize them and come and move in when you put them into your insect home so the first thing we 're going to do is start with putting some layers in our insect home so let 's start off by i think maybe we 'll put the leaf litter at the bottom here we go leaf glitter this is the litter from the gum trees i have around my place so the insects are very used to the smell of these these leaves as well and there might even be some tiny tiny little insects already living in this leaf litter so tiny we can hardly see them so that 's a nice first layer some leaves and then for our next layer we might put these cylinders that i 've cut up from my paper towel like this has become a nice place to hide it 's like a little tunnel then let 's put some of this back this would be a good next layer that i 've collected from the trees i wonder what kind of insects might move in maybe some lizards 's put these sticks that i 've just broken up to make them a bit smaller and it depends where you put your insect home as to what insects might move in if it 's on the ground you might get lots of ants moving in if you hang it from a tree you might get some butterflies or some moths moving in as well okay and then let 's put some of this recessive cardboard up as well in here because insects like this cardboard as well fold it up put it into the house there and maybe another one of our cylinders and let 's finish it off with some of these really bigger kind of pieces now i think our insect home is just about ready and can you see all the different spaces that the insects might like to move into and because i think this might be a really good one to hang on a tree i might get a piece of string and tie it around the top and tie it up to a tree around my house and i can 't wait to home i wonder if you can build an insect home as well and invite some insects to come and move into your garden have a great day everybody bye hi everyone we 've had such a great week learning about all of the kinds of insects that you might find in your garden and i have a story that 's got lots of those insects in it and it 's all about a spider and on the front of this book i can see a spider 's web and it 's called one hungry spider by jeannie baker one hungry spider i can see he 's starting to build his web spun a web between two branches three birds flew close by the spider kept still she did not want them to see her four grasshoppers came jumping along and one landed on the web broke free leaving a big hole five dragonflies flew up but stopped before they touched the web [Music] six spiderlings blew by on the breeze three landed in the web hungry spider will eat them seven ladybirds were flying high one got caught but the of ladybirds eight butterflies flooded safely by nine wasps hummed by wasps catch spiders so the spider left the web and hid ten noisy flies buzzed along many were caught and the spider had a feast the web was torn and broken so the spider pulled it down and ate it the hungry spider is building a new web wow that was a great story wasn 't it and i wonder if you can find some spider webs in your backyard spiders are really interesting to watch as they build their webs but of course we need to make sure that we stay a distance away to make sure that we stay safe from spiders but now i have built myself my own insect frame and i 'm going to go looking around my garden to see what i will find through my insect frame and the first thing i 'm going to look at is what has been eating my passion fruit vine if you have a closer look at the leaves here you can see they 're being nibbled by some kind of insect so it 's time investigation to see what insects getting my passion fruit fine bye _"

    "text": "all right well uh ready to start with daniel good evening my name is alejandro blanco i 'm part of the multicultural health team in western local hill with western sydney local district uh and tonight the presentation um we 're going to divide it up i will introduce the first 11 10 slides and then danny will continue obviously if daniels want to complement what i 'm saying he will chip in and i same for him um [Music] what is the next slide the purpose of the presentation is basically information about the virus uh has been designed for a general public and in line with the latest information for the therapeutic goods administration regulation the australian government australian state government so it 's quite official the information that you will find what is what we will try to cover tonight is um basically um how the vaccine will work um how the vaccine can protect you um why get vaccinated there 's a lot of questions about the safety of the vaccine that we will try to answer your questions and how to um this is important point reliable where you could get reliable information on the vaccine next slide so what the vaccine do well we could say mainly two things one it will increase exponentially your protection um against virus so as a person you will be far better protected with one and the second doses but not only that the second um the second leg of this protection is that increased ability to go back to your normal life but not only that you protect the it will you vaccinating your i mean the vaccine will provide protection to the people you care about friends family and your community and not only that but it will help to the community to go back to what normal life used to be available um next now we 're going to show you this video that could be has been done by health and it could give you a an idea about how the vaccine work and your immune system effective code 19 vaccines will offer protection against the virus helping to prevent death and serious illness but how do they actually work like other vaccines such with a needle this triggers an immune response in the body which is the body 's natural way of defending itself the vaccine will strengthen your immune system by training it to recognize and fight against the virus that causes covet 19. vaccines may contain either killed or weakened versions of the virus that causes the disease or a small part of the virus such as a protein there is no risk that you will get the disease from a vaccine when your immune system recognizes this virus or parts of it in the vaccine as being foreign it responds by creating memory cells and antibodies that will protect you against future infection or disease as a result you 'll be less likely to have severe covet 19 symptoms after a vaccination to learn more visit health.gov.eu [Music] um these three pictures to give you more information and grab and make more graphic uh following from the video these three pictures gonna give you an idea of how the how the vaccines work in the first picture number one you could see that the red figures are contagious the green no vaccines around so there 's only people who are contagious and people who are successful susceptible or waiting to be um to get the virus the second picture is only a few people that has been immunized or getting the job um those are the blue ones so you could immediately see the difference that the blue and the red i mean the red are getting smaller or less more yellow guys um so the blue even though are less and not many this have an impact on the community the third one is eighty percent of eight billion eighty and eighty percent of people who received the vaccine and you could see that the um contagious people who are the red are really really in the minority the yellow one we are susceptible to be um infected are in the real minority so um as you could see the impact of the vaccination and is really um really important and just to add something into this one as alejandro has mentioned is daniel here so especially the the the last one so the last one was more below moving forward because uh by all means the blue people represent people that are immunized so they are immune and the red people are people that are contagious and and the yellow people are people that are just like a normal people like the way we were before the pandemic so by all means we 'll have red people and we will still have yellow people because of some other reason so yellow people will be there let 's say about kids that are not yet to be back then at the moment and maybe people that got other health issues that could not be vaccinated because of the health issues based on the recommendation from their own issues so at the end we 'll still have people in our community that we also need to protect and by having that number of blue people like let 's say 80 percent as our prediction or where people communities are the whole country is moving forward that now we are protected and so it 's so crucial for everyone here and to get vaccinated so talk to your doctor and do protect people who are vulnerable like those that got other healthy issues that they cannot get vaccine or maybe the kid the younger one so and that 's the way forward so the last uh map we 're looking forward and that 's where we are heading to ether nature thank you keep in mind though that even though you have you got you you see a lot of blues the vaccine is only one tool in the safety toolbox even though people are in the blues and vaccinators are majority you still need to keep some simple simple simple measures of safety like washing your hands or use the mask so keep i mean see the vaccine as a one big tool but not the only one and is some complementary with other measures as well so um how does the vaccine protect me and the community is very simple more people are vaccinated more people can fight the virus and if you have the ability to fight the virus the main thing is going to be you stop spreading the virus um so bill contribute to uh community or uh slow the capacity of the v of the values to change to mutate them and become a new variant that 's very very important as well um who can get the vaccine everybody the vaccine is free for everybody regardless of you have medicare car or refugee status or visa status um and it 's completely free so you go into the vaccination hub close to you talk to your gp or chemist um close by and you will have the right to be vaccinated it 's completely voluntary i mean the advice nobody gonna force you to uh to get the job it 's completely voluntarily but as you will see uh when you finish the presentation it 's extremely extremely important to have um the majority of australian with the vaccine not only that but think not only that but could you go back a little bit um if think about your family yourself your community being vaccinated you really contribute to make them safe um [Music] as you can see in the present media all the rest of it some people asking can they wait again the problem up to maybe june this year before you could say okay there 's sometimes but we got this new delta variant from the virus um it come up around june to australia and we found that it 's extremely extremely infectious it 's around 60 to 70 more infections as the previous variant alpha um and it 's spread very very quickly so um the risk of get the virus increased um get to the uh of being hospitalized increase with this delta variant so the covet vaccine it will protect you the best protection will be done will be get by the two roses um so you will have the first sources and depend on the vaccine either astrosenica physio um you will have a period from the first to the second one daniel will explain that [Applause] danny all right okay what happened if we get um the coffee 19. i mean um there 's uh there 's a there 's a few symptoms there uh fever runny nose headache diarrhea sore throat there 's another very serious symptom that includes chest infection inflammation of some cases dead not everybody got those symptoms but there is a very high risk for you to get part of that symptom or even um or even dead for pregnant for pregnant um women is um is doubly important because the pregnant women are more successful or they increa in increased risk to being hospitalized uh being being admitted to intensive care and needing some support for breathing which is three times higher during the pregnancy um the complication for the baby increased around 1.5 to 2 times higher of being early born 36 before 77 37 week of pregnancy and obviously the need of admission the baby the newly born is three times higher so this part here as andrew mentioned before um we have two type of vaccine now in australia so there 's one more being approved but you still uh will be started from next week uh modena and i think you saw that on the news and and the federal government talked about it so we 're not gonna talk about that today but let 's talk about these two type of vaccine we been approved for people as we recommended for people under the age of 6 years old which including pregnant women and has been approved for 12 years plus so and you got to have two doses for five as well now is uh the the time frame is between three weeks up to eight weeks now so when you can have your first dose after you add your uh second dose after you have your first dose so that 's for father and for asenica has been recommended for people uh adult 60 years and over here in australia and has been initially approved for for 18 years plus so acl you require two doses for astronica the first one uh and then the second one would be between four to eight weeks so that the time frame you can have your second one uh personally i have my assassina in april and that was before it was like a three three month and so and i 'm under that age that was recommended by that time and so and now it 's okay for anyone a tds plus to slide to talk about later on and these two vaccines are all effective and you need at least two doses for them to be effective and to protect you uh against copy 19. and what they does they reduce your risk of community transmission so it helps you not to spread the the buyers into the community or to your family one so it 's quite important for us i try both of them so do the calling 19 vaccine work that 's a question a lot of people ask because this that doubt and it has proof in real life and then during uh clinical trial they both worked so uh they reduced of coping 19 both either astrazeneca the one that we have here and in real well we have seen that uh in the uk united kingdom because we here in oslo we 're using the same vaccine that are being used uh in the uk and the lie or and all the outcome or the experience of the research is coming out there is also uh we also have to defend on that because we 're uk in real life situation so they both reduce your risk of getting coping 19 and then they also reduce your risk of being hospitalized uh from covering 19 and that 's from england and scotland as well and they also reduce your risk of passing that to somebody for example your or people that are on you so that means it 's quite important for you to get vaccinated so that you prevent yourself and you prevent your loved one against the kobe 19. so this question as well uh do the choline vaccine work against the delta variant which is other questions that people ask yes it has proven that it worked because delta baron is a new one but having either python or asenica it helps you it protects you and it protects your lifeline because once you protect yourself you also protect somebody further to you and then it also reduces your risk of being hospitalized same thing both as a zenica and it also proved that in england because we have seen uh the benefit of these two vaccine in the uk so the the so you gotta have those two doses for you to get full protection so that 's quite important now this question is always uh a kind of interesting question because people ask so what else do i need to know does this vaccine save other cells or do they contain that yes i got those questions around but what research has shown that uh having kobe 19 vaccine cannot give you covet yourself so by getting vaccinated you cannot get kobe there 's a lot of confuses out there people you know listen to it through social media or other fake fake news media so but you cannot get covered by getting vaccinated it does not contain those those are vaccine do not contain uh genetic material or cannot change your dna so people presume that with misinformation out there it can 't dna no it does not interfere with your dna and that 's based on real life research and it do not contain animal product meat eggs products and does not cause infertility as people presume so all these two vaccines here we have in australia they have for all of us to use so the question is see because there 's a lot of information out there that we can listen to and i know we can listen to other information overseas because australia is a multicultural nation so we have our own news channel here and all because of through social media as well we 're also getting news overseas which sometimes are not relevant to what we have here so advice from the help is that use cycle information whereby you know the right source which would i will show you in a minute whereby you can get those accurate information for you to make your decision because a lot of people are making decisions based on information they got on the internet or the the the listen to it overseas which is not again i will this there 's no evidence base with those information and answer to some of the common questions here if you speak other language other than english so you can find more information in your own language and have to take the three languages so through our help uh of misinformation there so we advise you to base your audition based on drive source which i 'll show you in a minute so what to do next and how you can help so the question is everyone will have a different views about the benefit and risk of all these two vaccines but it 's always based on your medical history so what information what is important to you or how you see that and so but the the the main advice here you start that conversation with your with your with your doctor or health expert because they 'll be able to guide you and they 'll be able to give you more information that could be accurate information we come from reliable source based on evidence based on medical research and talk to your doctor your doctor knows your medical history your doctor know you more than anyone and your doctor can tell you the benefit of you having the vaccine if there 's risk involved your doctor will tell you based on your medical history so recently we got changes uh because of astaxenica it was the age of 40 and then recently they have there have been some changes from target that anyone 18 years plus can have as a zenica and given the information like given the outbreak we have now so it 's quite crucial for everyone to go out there and have your vaccine whatever vaccine you have because this vaccine are all safe have all been tested in a clinical trial and they 're all working real well so whatever vaccine you have so you better go and have that because we don 't have time to wait covered is there uh and the only way out of corbett is for us to get vaccinated so anyone 18 years plus you can have as a zenica talk to your gp because your gp know your history so if there 's anything that will prevent you from getting as a zenica then your gpu will tell you and all the gp are working harder to support everyone to support you and to support somebody as well so it 's good to respect advice from your and talk to them always because the moment anyone between the age of 16 to 59 years old within the lda of concern can book either from all the hub so either from olympia park or from macquarie field or from other areas based on closer to you we people from cumberland are from western city here these four algae underwater seen a local district we can go to olympia park you can book them there you can also book with your gp or pharmacies so and and and and and that 's the recent information so the this one here uh additional information that we just thought would be good for you to know is just about what do we mean by close contact so what is what do we mean by uh summary contract what do we mean by a casual contact and so it 's quite good for you to know these things so a close contact person is someone who has been closed uh with a covered positive person and you might have been impacted with the virus and so what happened once you 've been there so you get information from uh they will send you sms because if you identify they will send you sms and you get that message from them telling you that you 've been a close contact for a person with a copy 19. so what do you do from there you need to get tested uh go for a test straight away and then you isolate for 14 days regardless of your outcome they will give you instruction about when to go for your first your first one goes right away then they will give you instruction about when to go back for another one and then you have to remain in isolation until you see your you receive you you get your 14 days and you are confirmed negative for those 14 days period and [Music] someone who is also like a second contact is for your contact as well as a close contact so some of that being in contact with you while you 've been with that close contact it 's also a sign of contact from the court it 's not like a data close contact with the person that got impacted are also close contact they also get instructed from the from the near national warehouse or if you can identify them as well it 's good also to tell them so that they can go and get tested and again you need to isolate until they get there their results and that one so they can either be told to get maybe two tests and then once they got negative then they can go out and if you are a casual contact there are also two way for you you know that you are casual contact so uh near natural health will send you a text message or they can call you that you 've been uh a close con a casual contact uh for for for for casual contact in other location either at shopping center or maybe somewhere whereby you meet somebody and that 's through the the the the i the qr code that we also registered and or maybe if you identify that yourself as well because you if you look at the information online on the website help and then you identify that you can get you later on maybe four days time so what you need to do go and get tested right away and then you isolate and get other people to know that you 've been a casual contact and then and then wait until you get your result when you get a negative test uh then you also need uh you also need to follow the instruction from the nearest health about your next one so the key important thing here so whenever you receive your information from news as well you need to follow those instructions an important thing for you to do you need to wear a mask within the same room if you 're living with other people and do not leave your house until you get your negative result so so and you also need to monitor your symptom if you get a cobalt symptom and like running nose flow symptom-like you also need uh to isolate until you get your negative test result now so the question about food and other things and a lot of people are asking this question as well but this is families that are positive or maybe in isolation is a huge number nowadays and so people are a bit confused of what to do and so sometimes what they do you get just go and do things and help other people so the only way for you to do you need to so health will contact you let 's say if someone is in isolation so they 'll get contact from the help and then they 'll be given information about what to do and what not to do and but it may take some time for them to contact you so and if you are concerned or you need food you need to contact our public health unit and tell them what you are need and if you don 't get through that number because it 's too busy so keep trying keep trying it will go through the other close the people the council so maybe you talk to council and they can also see how they can support you and for family members it 's not a good idea for you to deliver food yeah because if you might not be safe for you to go to to those places so the only way for you to do so you better make be in contact with the council as well they can support you i know from blacktown city council that a group of people that uh put themselves together but they 're working together with the police and policy giving them that clear and like a permit for them to drop food and then they 're also working with with help in how they can deliver those food you know in a safe way because you also need to be protected and while you 're helping somebody you need to look up for yourself and so that 's not a high way for you to do so i think like that one like knowing when to deliver the food and when to leave it and when to get away from that so you need to be advised and you know to get some support around that one and the council or health cancer for you around that so gathering so gathering is is not like a good news uh but not we 're seeing for people outside the top algier so they got a bit of a of a good news and people we 've seen our top lga that are elder or concern so if if a family got a double dose they can go and uh and do our door our door for adults with double jab the people that are pulled vaccinated you can go outdoor and and an extra outdoor setting uh but that was in the top uh the five kilometers is still so but that 's only household members so someone from another household even though they have a double gap within this algae of concern let 's say within parameter cameron lga black and lga the ill child the node is allowed to gather but people outside the top lga five of them can gather outside that mean people from another other world that are full of vaccinations they can gather but not yet in our lba so where to get reliable information so we can get more accurate information from this website here the asylum government the partner government and national center for immunization research and surveillance and then therapeutic good and second so these are reliable information whereby they 're being updated from now and if there 's any information you want you get that there so most of the information that i translate you will also get them there so it 's good for you always to go for a right source before you make your decision about vaccine look maybe daniela if you allow me it 's very very important considering that you live in campbell and lga that when you go to any of these some reliable information sources you will have a lot of information in community languages or you could use interpreter service so don 't don 't dismay if you uh if your english is not that good because news as well health um website for instance got um the main language cover including chinese australia arabic spanish a lot of information in that not only in pamphlet formats but we got some recordings in community languages that you could listen to keep in mind that sbs on the multicultural television they covet in different community languages as well so if you need to use the telephone like the telephone lines for information you could use the this which is a national service translate translating an interpreter service um and starting from there yeah thank you alejandro so for the sake of time as well we just i think we 're almost done with this one and then we give you time to ask questions so the the best advice we can give you as your health care provider talk to your from a doctor uh talk to your medical specialist by any information you need around your vaccination so and and you can call national coronal virus and coping 19 helpline so that number 1800 0 2 0 0 8 0 and then as andrew mentioned so teas is there which is a translating and interpreting services so you can call that which uh one three one four five zero and you ask the language you want to talk to and then they 'll put you through that one is available seven days a week so important thing for us pull uh vaccine boxing uh gap so you pull a vaccination will you see how to practice good uh safe corporate discovery certain behaviors so which is uh get tested once you have like blue light syndrome go for a test and practice hand again so every time so which is working your head with soft and water at least 20 seconds and you check in and check out this is important it 's also quite good for you to do for yourself and for others so maintain uh 1.5 meters or two square meters and wear mass which is now mandatory for you once you leave your house so an outdoor indoor unless you may be exercising and then important if you have not been vaccinated go and get your job your job right now so that 's quite important and that 's the only way for us to go out of this pandemic so thank you uh get the job for to protect yourself to protect your family and your community so it 's a time for us now to to get your question so if you have those quicker uh stephen is here and you also help us to respond to some of the questions you may ask this is very interesting there 's a few interesting questions in the chat um thank you guys i might just uh introduce stephen first um so dr stephen corbett is joining us as well this evening he 's the director of the center for population health and along with alejandro and daniel they 'll be able to answer some questions this evening um i will go through the ones in the chat first and then i 'll just ask if everyone can if they have a question use the reaction box at the bottom of zoom to put your hand up and then i 'll just ask you to unmute when we get to your turn so just bear with us as we get through it hopefully we answer your question along the way if not we 'll definitely try and grab it tonight so first one we 've got a so uh for children that are under 12 at the moment um is there any information available at a vaccine perspective uh dr stephen you might be on mute at the moment is is steven around there we go i think you 're up here uh we can 't hear you at all dr corbett uh daniel alendro are you either able to provide any on that information on that uh so what what was the question uh so for children that are under 12 is there any information at this stage around being able to get the vaccine or any information on when that might become an option oh so as far as uh what i know so the atari which is the border that are a proper vaccine so this here working on that so the only information available now is uh for 12 years to 15 years to be given a model so which will happen soon so but anyone under under the age of 12 so you 're still not uh being workout and if there 's anything then at a time you will still do some update um about that but there is some experiences overseas that are looking into it but it we are talking about from 12 years old upwards but not downwards yet excellent um so and here a question about eligibility so we had nasrulla i believe who has tried to book an appointment for pfizer but told wasn 't eligible and they 're currently a student is there any sort of basic criteria around eligibility that you can let the crowd know about or how to actually check you about your eligibility oh all right so with uh eligibility yeah this is like eligibility checker on online and there 's a lot of changes as well from now to now like the first one so when five was available so it was changed between which which was under the lg of consent so between the age of 60 uh to 39 and then it changed to 409 and then out of 59 within the algae of consent so anyone under that between the age of uh 16 to 59 within lga 12 lga can access further and then n1 so across the state and so can access as a zenica so as long you are age 18 years a zenica anywhere either through your gp pharmacy or to within the main hub that being identified the natural warehouse so it depends with age so depending with your age where you sit and depending also where you want to uh to get that sometimes you can try booking online and then because if things are booked and then you cannot uh get your appointment on time and that 's because of maybe booking and the availability at the center so maybe you can check it elsewhere and there 's no uh you don 't require a medicare card or anything to qualify do you uh for let 's say if if you go if you go to your gp or pharmacy so they might ask you for medicare card but if you don 't have medicare card you can go to the hub so either like anything that owned by the state you go like orleans park though yes they they can allow you to get your job without medicare alone you can go to other id like a personal id that can show you at you to confirm you guys don 't mind could you share the link in the chat for the eligibility checker um that might assist nasrulla with finding a spot to get the vaccine sure thank you um yeah we 've also got one here from sonya uh are you able to explain the difference between nr mrna and non-mrna covert 19 vaccines i think doctor stephen that 's a very technical question it 's probably for dr stephen can you hear me now yes we can thank you very much okay hi hi everyone sorry about the technical problems uh um the difference between an mrna vaccine and a um an astrazeneca yes um the mrna is a little bit like a um a template uh it 's it as soon as it 's injected into your body it starts making uh antibodies it starts making the protein uh that that forms the the spike on the outside of the virus and that and and making that protein stimulates your body to have an immune reaction against the virus uh the astrozenica works in a slightly different way in that it actually has same template on it but it it 's not it the virus in astrazeneca is is a whole virus it 's a benign virus with the same template on it it 's it 's it 's a subtle difference but they both they both have the same effect they produce the protein uh that your bod that your own immune system then reacts to and and that immune reaction protects you from getting uh seriously unwell with the virus i hope that explanation is clear enough for everyone and dr corbett just to confirm um what do you mean by a benign virus uh it 's it 's a vehicle for it it 's a vehicle that that uh uh the virus doesn 't survive in your body at all uh it 's just a it 's it 's a viral particle which is a vehicle for um a piece of dna which makes uh the protein that you need to stimulate your immune system the virus does not survive in your body excellent and um just following on from that do any of the vaccine have side effects that saw that question no it 's not clear that they do we do know that people with kidney disease are very very uh vulnerable to the effects of um of of covert itself but um kidney disease has not been reported as a major side effect of any of the vaccines that are available to australians excellent so uh dina 's also asked the time between fisa has been stated as six weeks um and she 's actually had her second one three weeks later um is there any further information on the time frame between the two jobs yeah the recommendation is from three to six weeks um in in some places um they 've they 've made it six weeks the the outcome in terms of immunity is probably about the same um in some countries they 've delayed it for six weeks because of a shortage of virus a shortage of vaccine um so so it just allows you to space out the vaccinations a little bit more but the recommendation is is between three and six weeks for each day excellent um and uh we 've covet 19 symptoms does a person 's cease becoming contagious or being contagious so um usually it 's about um from the onset of symptoms uh it 's usually about 10 days when they assist but we have people we have people we put we put people uh in quarantine for 14 days after their symptom onset uh or their day to diagnosis if they don 't have symptoms and and we think that after that time they are no longer infectious uh um uh in the community probably it may be that with the delta virus that time is slightly shorter but we haven 't changed the rules yet so it 's 14 days and we almost never see anybody being infectious after that period and that 's that 's why the quarantine period is set at that time excellent and uh we 've seen a bit of information recently about moderna coming to our shores yeah um can you give us a basic description between the difference between the pfizer and the moderna vaccines almost none is the basic description almost none a different owner um but uh similar um principle and they 're mrna viruses they 're giving you a piece of mrna which makes a protein which makes you immune which stimulates an immune response which protects you from getting sick so same thing excellent and uh this is probably a bit of a theoretical one uh how long do you believe covert could potentially last um and let 's i 'll reiterate a bit further here so assuming we get to our 80 double dose vaccination um do you think there could be potential future lockdowns or border closures or we get to a point where the 80 herd immunity is enough to keep open well let me tell you a little story about this because because i think many uh experts around the world think that covert probably now is going to become an endemic infection that is it will always be with us and and um and so we have to learn to live with it uh and as the years go by uh its power and and its ability to cause illness and death will diminish this is what happened in 1918 years after that the flu was still very deadly and serious but it had diminishing power the amazing thing about about covet is that we 've developed a vaccine in a record period of time so that 's enabled us to uh for most people avoid hospitalization and death if you have the vaccine um but i think uh and eventually we hope later in the year a vaccine will become available for small children and and then once everyone is vaccinated we 're going to have a lot more protection against recurring epidemics of the disease hopefully we won 't get any more strains like the delta strain which are even even worse than the delta strain um and and cause uh more mayhem uh than this one has but but um it 's quite likely that that that this disease will be around for a long time but what we hope is that um is that its impact on our health and the health of our vulnerable population such as the elderly and people with chronic disease will diminish as the years go by in 1918 it took nasty influenza virus really to disappear and to stop causing a serious disease uh i think i think it 's a hundred years later we will have we haven 't_''_2875.28 we 're only starting now to get effective treatments against this virus and i would think that they will emerge in the next couple of years and and more and more people will get vaccinated and hopefully uh the crisis will abate that would be and i think already in many countries in the world people are starting to live with this virus uh and for their lives to get back to normal and i hope that that will continue um in the coming months and years excellent and uh we 've got the next one from sharon and david and um guys uh just jump in if i haven 't interpreted your question correctly i think what they 're trying to ask is if they have had covert before and another member of their household also then becomes positive for covert um is there a reason why they then need to isolate does your body create any sort of the virus on it certainly does it certainly does but we have seen reinfection with the virus no no question about that there 's re-infection it 's just like the flu immunity is not perfect but hopefully if you if you have the flu jab or if you 've had that version of flu already this year the illness you get will be less severe but but you always have to be you are certainly not um you don 't have a suit of armor to this to this virus um if you 've already had it you 'll get less severe disease but but it certainly can infect you more than once i mean there aren 't many diseases where that doesn 't happen measles is one you only get that once uh but we we already know that this disease can re-infect people excellent i think that works well with the next question as well so um even after getting the two jabs is why do you think people still catch covert or can you still catch kevin yeah they can immunity immunity is uh is always relative than others people who are elderly generally your immune your ability to mount an immune response diminishes as the years go by so uh uh people who are older can 't amount as a strong and immune response and that 's why they 're more vulnerable but we do know that um people of all ages are protected from hell death and serious illness by having the vaccine so so um i think we can be confident that the worst excesses of this virus can be can be met by getting high rates of vaccination in our community excellent from a health perspective uh for asylum seekers that come to australia without any form of identification how could they access the vaccine if they just roll up to the vaccine hubs they will be vaccinated there 's no there is no barrier that 's really important particularly in this municipality uh i can i just say a little bit about about the epidemic in cumberland because it has been one of the worst hit the worst hit local government areas in new south wales and in australia i can i see uh cases fall in cumberland which is fantastic news and i think it 's in part due to the the great response from our community to get vaccinated but we can 't_''_3077.359 be complacent uh um uh and there 's many factors in cumberland that uh that have perhaps made it take off here i think um i think we do know that there 's a fair bit of overcrowding in some of the dwellings in cumberland and that 's certainly a risk factor um uh peop lots of people are still working all over sydney and that 's been a risk factor in construction sites and factories uh so so there are plenty of risk factors in cumberland but but um the great response in terms of getting tested and getting vaccinated i think looks like it 's beginning to have an effect and let 's hope in the next few days that effect can continue excellent and i think we 've already gone through uh the difference between the two vaccines which are cleared up first in terms of australian citizens looking to return home is the should be getting to try and come back cinderfarm is the chinese vaccine i don 't think it is an mrna vaccine unless i i mean there 's a number of chinese vaccines so but i i didn 't believe it was a an mrna vaccine and there are some issues about acceptability of of cyanofarm in some countries so um so the whole issue of the acceptability of vaccine vaccination is far from settled and um and even some of the vaccines that that we 're having here aren 't um it 's not completely clear whether they 'll be accepted by um authorities in every country in the world so that 's a matter which has to be resolved but i think as we move into a phase where the airlines get back into business and and and the world gets back into business uh there 'll be a rush to resolve those difficulties and uh just in your experience so far do most countries have some form of mrna vaccine available or is that limited to certain countries um um as i said i i i i in china and i i wasn 't aware that any of them mrna but i 'm i 'm not fully informed about that um uh india has had its own vaccine production uh uh and i think uh um i think astrazeneca has been the main uh uh form of vaccination in india but i i again i can 't_''_3221.599 be quite a chapter and verse on that i don 't really know um and um you know there is there is a global rush of course to get vaccines to the whole world and and uh companies like pfizer and moderner and johnson and johnson uh and astrazeneca are all competing and um i i think it 's important uh at this stage of the epidemic to uh uh i heard saying the other day the best vaccine in the world is the one that 's in your arm not the one that 's sitting on the shelf because because what 's important at the moment to control this epidemic is that people are vaccinated all the vaccines seem to be very effective in reducing death and reducing hospitalization of people were scared about the side effects story with astrazeneca but but i 've had astrazeneca most of the people in the health department i work with have had astrazeneca uh um and uh and we think it 's important that people understand that although there are risks the risks are vanishingly small and and and and the protection afforded by the vaccine at this stage in the epidemic is is something we all need to have uh so so uh that 's that 's the message i have excellent and we we 've seen a bit of information coming out of uh fully vaccinated countries like israel recently around potential need for a booster um is there any consideration from australia 's perspective at the moment on how that might play out look i i think that there is uh uh and and it wouldn 't be a surprise uh that we need a booster just like you do with a flu shot every year uh and that wouldn 't be a revolutionary uh um thing to happen in in vaccinology uh but but i think a lot to vaccinate everyone in the world including people in the poorest countries before the rich countries start holding the vaccine and getting a booster uh that 's a sentiment which is widely has been widely canvassed and once we get two vaccines um we we have a good measure of protection 80 to 90 protection from from death and hospitalization so so um so you know there will be calls for a booster i 'm sure but i think it 's also important that the whole world get vaccinated because of course we live in a world where people are traveling all the time and and whilst ever there 's uh covered in other countries it 's it 's always a risk to australia as well so so um so i think there 's uh and you know it 's important to say that vaccination is not just about personal choice it 's a it 's it 's it 's a it 's an act of love in some ways because it 's a recognition that that the community will benefit and and it 's not just about your own do have to think about about the protection of the community at large because if as we 've seen with the delta virus if the virus gets away from us everyone is at risk and and and that 's why that 's why uh vaccination is an unusual thing because we do know that that we 've got to get everyone on board for all of us to be protected and uh and and you know we really like that message to get through loud and clear excellent and uh we 've obviously seen some supply issues for the vaccine in recent times are we planning to produce any onshore or will we remain an import of vaccine only no i i think the astrazeneca is being made under licence here in um in australia and um and i think i i think it 's quite likely that uh that similar arrangements will be made with other vaccines in the future um but uh um but you know you have to understand that the development of a vaccine to a brand new virus that no human being has ever ever is something of a miracle uh um you know we still don 't have an aids vaccine we don 't have a vaccine for tb uh there are some diseases which for which it 's incredibly difficult to make vaccines but but new technologies and new discoveries have made the development of vaccines are incredibly quick compared to uh years gone by we 've seen one develop very quickly for ebola in recent years and now one for this virus it really is uh an extraordinary thing that that we are able to be protected by our vaccine so soon enough it 's in its appearance in human populations yeah excellent uh abeer would you like to ask your question rather than me just read it out hi how are you everyone thank you for the meeting uh question one it 's about the possible possibility about the providing um the rapid antigen testing i mean the result will be after 15 minutes something like that yeah quick and easy test for like in shops schools or anywhere with i mean crowded places and active places and the question then because you know this stress after someone if if i see like positive i will be shocked so after that we need to deal with this like psychological and in like some advices medical advices so maybe we need some advice like courses or like catalogs or anything maybe in in our council like maybe the the food the medicine the what i have to do if i like yeah yeah no no i don 't like to go to hospital or i can or i will not go to hospital what i can do in my home yeah yeah and and um okay so so the first question uh uh just remind me the first question was about so rapid energy and testing will be available in creating rapid rapid testing is a technology which is being used increasingly particularly in workplaces and in the uk they 've used it in schools i heard an example today of uh well of a large company that that 's done 20 000 tests in the last few weeks they found 10 cases of of covert before the person walked into the rapid antigen testing is that it 's not always accurate so they found 10 true cases and they found 10 that were false positives but they were able to deal with that very rapidly and that kept 10 cases out of the workplace and it probably um prevented the factory from closing down and continuing with production and protected fellow workers from being exposed to that so it certainly does have a place it 's not cheap not all employers will choose to do it there is active consideration about whether it can be used as a way to get kids back to school i think we will see the roll out of it in many places in our society as a way to get back to normal life but it 's not it 's not it 's not a panacea it 's not going to be something which will solve every problem um um kids for example won 't like having something stuck up their nose every day that 's that will definitely meet resistance there um and and and then you have to run around chasing after false so so it is a potential tool which can be used but whether it it gains widespread use i think we just have to wait and see um and getting to the second question of empowering people to know what to do when they when they get covered that 's very important and of course it is a it is a serious infection it 's important to say as i think was mentioned in the slides that for most people it passes with relatively little uh problems uh it 's only in a minority of people uh where serious symptoms develop and um and so um and so the principles that we work by here uh when a family becomes infected when someone in a family becomes infected for example is we try and separate the infected person from the rest of their family now in the earlier parts of the epidemic we were able to um send the infected person to a special hotel called special health accommodation and keep them separate from the rest of the family and that prevented the family from becoming infected that 's become case numbers because these hotels the these it 's now the biggest hospital in new south wales there 's special hotels it 's got thousands of people in it and it 's very hard to get people in and and and so families are having to isolate from each other in their home and in many homes particularly in cumberland that 's proving to be impossible and we 're seeing large families all get infected and that 's not an outcome we want to see so so yes but if you do have the ability in your home to isolate from your other family members having separate bathrooms bedrooms uh eating facilities then it is possible to ensure that you don 't get infected but but it 's it 's for many households it 's very difficult so so we are still trying it we 're thinking of establishing a special hotel here in western sydney so that we can do the same thing that we 've done in other parts of the city in recent months um we 're at a particularly difficult stage because we are seeing hundreds difficult to deal with every family 's problem we 're also delayed in actually reaching families and giving them the information they need and we 're working really hard at the moment to try and bridge that gap um so but i think that the the tail off in cases in the last few days in cumberland is very promising and i believe you know we would like to think it 's due to some of our efforts in the efforts of the community to get tested and get vaccinated and and and with any luck those trends will continue so so i i know i haven 't answered all of your questions about what to do there 's plenty of information available on the new south wales health website about what to do if a family member um gets covered uh uh um and perhaps we can talk to council if there are any gaps if there 's stuff in language if we need to translate into languages there 's already a lot of information available in other languages and we can work with councils to uh to make okay yeah and i 'll i 'll provide a link to uh what we 're calling our support forum at the moment where you can we want you to minimize the risk to your immediate household by um as was mentioned in the presentation visiting family members you know under good will that you 're delivering food but sort of engaging and potentially picking up the virus so if it a food need a clothing need any sort of basic essential items um counselor are helping to either support that directly or engaging with local ngos and charities to meet that need for yourself or your extended family members so i 'll include that in the chat um or and you 're welcome to contact council as well to have a conversation with me but we 're definitely helping to support because we understand health is inundated with positive cases so as dr corbett said they may not get to you immediately after a positive case has been identified um but we 're kind of helping in assisting and covering that gap so if you need those essential items to reach out to council and we can get that organized for you so hopefully that answers what you 're after could i just say one more thing yes one of the things that 's really surprised us about this epidemic and this virus is its ability to be transported but in the air um you know with coughs and colds we always thought it was sneezing on people and and touching surfaces and and um but what we 've seen with this epidemic is the virus the people who are especially in the few days before they get symptoms just by ordinary breathing talking uh they can emit virus from their lungs which can infect people in a household quite easily not just people up close but people a few meters away from them and that 's the scary thing about this virus it has the ability to be very infectious uh in indoor settings and and of course families large families uh you can imagine if there 's a person in a large family that 's that 's enjoying family life together it 's very easy for this virus you have to wear masks inside um the risk the things that increase the risk of transmission is exercise and and uh breathing up inside so having a gym in your house isn 't probably a great idea uh uh uh um uh uh singing and talking loudly we know that that that really increases the the amount of virus that a person will emit if they 're if they 're sick um so there is some guidance about how to minimize risks in houses but but we also think that probably the best bet is to physically separate infected and non-infected family members about 80 percent of the infections we see is transmitted in households so that 's where we 've got to target a lot of our thinking and prevention activity and and and of course for many families the options are fairly slender as to what you can actually do excellent if um if you do contract the virus um once you have had it what sort of uh delay period would there be before you 're eligible to actually get the vaccine and it 's still six months you will have some natural immunity from uh uh for from the the viral infection that you that 's you will have an immune response and and after that it 's recommended that after after about six months you can talk with your doctor about that but that 's the normal period of time it 's been recommended at the moment excellent um and sharon you 've got a question here around council ranges and outdoor gatherings unfortunately the police powers haven 't_''_4144.48 been extended to council ranges um so they are not able to go down and move people on um that it would be up to you to contact either the police directly through your local police area unit number or to contact crime stoppers to report any sort of uh gatherings that may be against the the health orders that are currently out so unfortunately it 's not something that council can step in and manage directly um okay so we 've got um so if you 're over 60 are there any opportunities to get the pfizer vaccine at all is there any way you can talk to your doctor about that um and doses of pfizer are increasingly becoming available um uh yeah the best thing to do is to talk to your gp and see what opportunities are available particularly if there are some reasons that you you you medically might need to get fizer rather than astrazeneca but um but but uh that 's the best advice at the moment excellent and you 've already touched base on uh overseas organizations are looking at uh vaccines for younger children so we won 't answer that one again um however on the return to school from october 25 going forward um is in your opinion are we minimizing the risk to children still in their return or is there concern that sending them back to school at this point in time may increase the risk of them contracting the virus yeah there are a lot of concerns about that and we 're not so concerned that the children themselves will get ill but what we are concerned about is that they will then transmit it to other family members that that 's very good at giving infections to one another and and then they 're very good at giving it to other family members so so that 's the main concern and ultimately why we 'd like to see kids vaccinated as well but there 's a tremendous harm of course as well at keeping kids out of school um it 's denying them a whole lot of stimulation and and and development so in making an important decision like this we have to weigh up the harms and the benefits and i think that 's what the government is doing at the moment and you know there 's a lot of pressure of course when getting kids back to school and because of course the kids aren 't at school then parents have to stay at home and the whole economy is impacted so these are very difficult but important decisions and uh and and i think some of the uh it 's not just the medical advice is working hard to try and concoct a best uh a best compromise i suppose between those those rather conflicting outcomes do you could be taken in tablet form as opposed to an injection um i doubt it at this stage i i mean um it could be a um a skin patch might be it might be something that would work uh um but uh there 's a whole lot of new vaccine delivery technology that 's coming online and and nothing surprises me medical technology can come up with so but at the moment we 're stuck with the needle and and that 's what we 've got to do for the next couple of years great and uh savannah you may have missed earlier but if you uh either don 't have a medicare or you 've got issues with your medicare card you can still access kudos arena and the macquarie fields centers you can turn up and get your vaccination without requiring to show a medicare card you can okay um so we did i think we already touched on uh that you can still carry the virus even if you 've contracted it previously or after you 've had the vaccine uh you can get reinfected that year olds um is there going to be an option for vaccination uh when they return to school like at the school or will they need to go to the gp or the sort of the super clinics that have been set up at the moment look i think there 's a lot of work going into facilitating that that uh that next phase of the vaccine program um and the details aren 't all up to hand yet but uh but they will become very clear soon i 'm sure i 'm sorry i can 't give you definite information about that right now um in terms of the ingredients in the vaccine uh there 's probably too many to list but are there particular ones that you think would be of interest to um to call out i guess in terms of um if you were uh allergic to anything that might be in one versus the other or something that maybe they should consider when they talk to their gp about which one to get no there 's nothing that 's been highlighted in that regard um which you know about and there are some there are some people with some very rare medical conditions who are advised not to get certain kinds of vaccines but that 's extremely rare we have a big school vaccination program every year and every year we get kids who are allergic to vaccines um and it doesn 't say you know the reason doesn 't seem to be clear it 's not something that that 's that we ever get to the bottom of in terms of um what 's in the product itself but but um we have no reason to think that these vaccines are any different to any other in that regard we always assume that a tiny proportion of people will have an adverse reaction to vaccines um and that 's why we get people to wait after they have their vaccines we watch them closely uh to make sure that they 're not happening because most adverse reactions occur in the first few minutes after a vaccine but we do that for all vaccines because because uh you know there 's a lot of diversity but by the exercising of caution and by understanding um who 's at risk we we can minimize the harm that comes from uh adverse reactions to this and other vaccines excellent and i think we 're starting to hear that there may be another potential strain uh i think in south america at the moment um is it likely that uh additional vaccines may need to be or changes to the vaccine may need to occur or the booster shops main booster shots may be needed for that purpose yeah the future the future this virus has done nothing else but surprises since it began and and the emergence of the delta strain is has been uh an extraordinary thing because we 've seen a virus emerge which is thousand times more infectious than its previous incarnation um and other other mutations may come along um what 's encouraging though is that the the vaccines seem to be just as effective against the delta as they are against others by and large and and particularly in their ability to prevent death and severe illness so hopefully that will happen hard to predict these things um and um uh we just we just have to wait and see i mean i think i think the world has has uh has ramped up its ability to survey populations and and look at the harms caused by vaccines by new viruses uh our scientists have been able to respond rapidly to any changes they may need to make to the vaccine or treatments so i i think i mean you know the world will be focused on this disease until it 's well under control i 'm absolutely sure of that and uh and so far uh we 've had astounding success in being able to match whatever the virus throws and uh we 've got a bit of further information from sonia who had asked about the overseas vaccinations that are available from your and you may not be able to answer this question but from your understanding is there anything that an australian citizen could do to put themselves in the position of returning home or could they return home into isolation for example and get the vaccine uh while they could you know because they can 't get what 's being offered in australia at the moment they could return home and i guess get that to stay in the country what do you know anything around them overseas who want to come home who aren 't vaccinated yet is that right um from my understanding of from sonia she has had vaccination overseas but it may not meet um what australia is recommending um what could she do to put herself in a position to be able to return home yeah look look it 's a bit of a gray area at the moment if she 's talking about sign of farm i think i think that 's unclear um i think australian authorities will probably require a vaccination with one of the vaccines that they approve of the tga approves of um is there a listing on their website for overseas vaccines that not necessarily provided here within the country um i think i 'd have to get back to you about that i 'm i 'm not sure about that detail i 'm sorry um um very strict uh and i guess um i guess uh uh you know once australia reaches its vaccination target it will start to look seriously how the borders get reopened and and that and that will have to involve the consideration of of um whether we think you know how do we how do we know that people who are saying they 're vaccinated are adequately vaccinated when they come here and and that 's going to have to be a part of our normalization of code so sonia we 'll take that offline and hopefully we can we can find some further information that we can share with the community in terms of the origination of i guess the the vaccine um you know how it was set up is it um was it based on the size virus vaccine previously did it come someone 's potentially saying maybe 1998 not sure where they got that that date from but was this a previous incarnation of the vaccine no people have been working on new vaccine technologies for some years and um and yes it did begin with the public health measures um research on that more or less stopped but but it had a legacy and and the development of mrna technology has been very important uh the development of viruses as vehicles for vaccines has also been important there was an australian invention which didn 't quite get over the finishing line um so there has been a huge amount of research on um on new vehicles for for vaccine delivery and you know my understanding is that one of the great things about mrna vaccines is that they can be rapidly adapted for new variants that come along and so the long lead times that normally accompany vaccine development may not be true for for any new vaccines that have to be developed for your new uh coronavir experience excellent uh sorry just for everyone that 's asking my name is daniel from the community development team just in case you need to contact council and ask for myself um so here 's an interesting one um if you unknowingly have the virus and you have had your first or second doses of vaccine what sort guess the vaccine is for you vaccine won 't work until two weeks after you had it uh and and so um and so if you get if you get it at the same time unfortunately you 'll get the illness um whatever that may mean so so um so the vaccine and and of course getting two doses it gives you the maximum protection so so uh if you get an infection any time before that uh you won 't have an optimal immune response does that make the the double dose less effective than someone who has not had the most okay um this one 's probably a bit too political but i 'll put it to you for your opinion anyway um do you think that there 'll be any sort of mandatory uh vaccination requirements for younger children so under 12 i guess similar to our normal vaccine procedures that we have look i think this is an important question for us as a as a society i note that president biden is making a lot of noise at the moment about saying the people who of course he 's got a big problem in america with uh vaccine resistance and we we have a lot of people here who are similarly inclined um it does come i mean australians from what we 've seen new south wales um australians by and large seem very willing to take the vaccine to protect themselves and their families it 's impossible to vaccinate everyone because other some people a small proportion will object on a whole range of grounds mostly uh when vaccine levels get above 90 that 's enough to protect everybody because you don 't get the disease moving from one population to another um it just depends really on on on how infectious the virus is because um but we think that the coronavirus is about the same infectiousness as chickenpox and most of you who 've got little kids will know that um when chickenpox comes to a school everyone gets it um and so and so um you 've got to get vaccination rates of chickenpox well above 90 to stop that happening um and and i think that 's probably what we to start thinking about um you know what what what what do we want our friends and families you know do we find it a good thing or an acceptable thing for them not to be vaccinated if they 're coming to your family picnic you know um because and these are things we 're going to have to right we make decisions like this all the time i guess about smoking and about all sorts of things but um but but um i think what will emerge is that is that vaccination is a way out of this horrible pandemic and and that probably people will start to um think about it as as about what their what their responsibilities are to the community not just about what their own fears and concerns are about their themselves and in in terms of uh something you touched on earlier so someone that does contractor virus creates some form of natural response to it for the future um how would you see that in terms of someone that 's had first or second doses versus someone that has the natural response par um obviously it 's important you know that we 're getting people vaccinated um i guess this may be more relevant for someone that isn 't eligible to get the vaccination because of a medical issue or something um would they have some sort of protection you think in comparison to first or second look i 'm not an expert on this i have to say i a lot of my colleagues are more expert than me about about this particular question um generally speaking the natural infection confers a strong immune response but vaccination is still recommended um the relative strength of that response is something which i guess will emerge in research over the next couple of years because um i will be able to see what happens when waves of infection hit a community and whether natural infection or immunization actually works better but um i think at the moment it 's probably a little early to tell but i 'm sure that sort of information will emerge in the next year or so let 's hope like when i was a child we don 't to try and encourage that amongst children they used to yes well particularly german measles because because of its effects on the unborn fetus and um there were certainly rubella parties that were called and um but as you say they used to have chickenpox parties as well and um um but coverts too serious and illness to have a party about it so definitely um i 've got a nice shout out here to to thank um yourself and the uh the gentleman from new sales health um everyone 's really appreciating your responses tonight i think it 's a really good opportunity to be able to ask questions directly from you um just a few more i think we 've got till we 're done um so as is uh i think i did cover your question but is there something else that you would like to ask are you still there as is oh we might come back to as is uh joel 's would you like to ask a question hi there thank you for um um me for this uh session it was very informative people that have haven 't been um unvaccinated and they have contracted the covert 19 um is there any chance that they can go to get um some sort of information to say that that they have had the cover 19 that 's a good question um uh the that hasn 't that hasn 't been resolved yet um um you mean a certificate saying you 've had it just like a certificate just saying you 've been vaccinated yeah just so you could show that to your workplace um do you mean in terms of the six month period before you 're eligible to no no what he 's saying is that if you 've got immunity from from having had the disease should be allowed back to your workplace that requires vaccine vaccination um it 's a good question and i don 't know the answer but it 's something which will emerge uh i mean i think i think the vaccination requirement will stand um and the only way of really telling that you 've got immunity is to have a blood test and see what your a way of resolving the problem in the future you can tell whether you 've mounted a good response or not but in terms of certification um that question hasn 't yet raised itself enough to be a um you know i 'm sure that question will need resolution in the months to come okay great thanks for your time okay thank you sorry i wasn 't able to answer uh as is uh we 've got you back on board i think yeah yeah yeah i thank you so much and now i would like to to thank to doctor andy and camilla counsel for organizing this and just would like to get some clarification from the doctor and doctor said that six months later you can have your you can have your vaccination after you 've been attracted coffee and and what about if the person like you know he gets the vaccination he got he got the chap but he or she doesn 't know that he or she had the va and the virus so inten unintentionally the person gets the facts yeah no no there facing a serious illnesses because he got the he got infected and he got the chat no no that would that that would be fine there 'd be no problem with that all right the second question i would like to get clarification if you 've been in infected by kovi and you get a recovery of course and you get recovered and you know now there are a lot of restrictions been easy for only double those vaccinated people and what happens to those who are recovering and cannot have vaccination and after before six months you know would they be having the same rights as vaccinated people well i think i think at the moment or something like that i think the moment the answer is no but it 's a very good question and uh and i think um i i think that um we will need to develop a policy around this uh there at the moment there is not one um but it 's a very legitimate question and i guess i guess it 's never risen its head in in australia because up until so you know before june probably less than a few percent of people had actually had the infection so so it didn 't it wasn 't relevant but now with so many people having had the disease but still it 's only you know maybe 150 000 or so uh out of the population of millions um the question will need to be answered uh but at the moment um i think what the only the only exemption or concession been given is to the vaccinated but but it may well emerge that having had the diseases is is okay as well but it 's not it 's not a policy at the moment all right thank you okay uh georgia question from you uh georgina sorry uh yeah hi um hi hi yeah just um just a couple of questions um number one is that um it was announced on this morning 's news that um that firefighters are happening to work as paramedics helping ambulance drivers um during the pandemic um now obviously health care workers have reached a breaking point um is that also because that there as well within that particular area well i don 't know what area i don 't know what area you 're talking about but but there certainly are shortages because lots of nurses and doctors have had to go off as close contacts of patients and that 's been a big problem in our system uh and that i didn 't i hadn 't heard about the firefighters but that doesn 't surprise me okay so obviously if they have to work as paramedics they 're obviously then replacing um i mean so i mean to say if the firefighters are working as paramedics they 're obviously doing a replacement for paramedics just to give help first give first stage to the needy in um in preventing and contracting the virus is that right look i 'm unaware of who 's who 's um stepping in for who at the moment if you 're saying that there are firefighters that may well be the case but but there are you know there there are um you know the health system is stretched beyond its limit at the moment and and emergency departments and so um all sorts of actions are being taken which we wouldn 't think about in normal times but but these are emergency situations and a whole lot of different solutions are being sought and found okay yeah and also also to um does the um virus um i mean so i mean to say how does the virus get fragmented into the sewage treatment plants oh well uh uh uh it 's it 's it 's it 's i guess a pretty obvious fact that uh i mean coronaviruses generally uh infect both the lungs and the gut and so and and we said we secrete viruses that we 're infected with in our in our waste uh and that gets into the sewer and uh we 've been able during this pandemic for the first time in my working lifetime to use the sewage as a way of finding out where the infection is and it 's been remarkably accurate so if we get um if we get if we find um the virus in parks in western new south wales um and say well and then we look hard and we find them so so um it 's been a remarkably sensitive and uh uh method to to try and map where the virus is showing up and and if we get a sewerage detection in the town we go hunting for the virus very hard um so it 's been very useful and helped us to control the epidemic in the last couple of years okay i think that 's all thank you good thank you thanks rojana and i 'm just conscious of time that we did advertise this to finish at eight o 'clock and we 've almost reached nine o 'clock so i might just uh finish off with uh the last question from a beer maybe it 's a funny question but i 'd like to know if we will get rights for asking people if they have a vaccine or they are fully vaccined or not in the future like if i want to deal for someone and maybe he will be close to me like barbara or anywhere yeah i i mean i have right to ask that caused some problems in the future if i ask this question well i think i i can 't think of any reason why businesses couldn 't ask that for example um and um and then whether you have a right to exclude people or not i guess these are legal questions which have to be answered but but um my own son lives in cyprus and he has a vaccine he has to show his vaccine id every time he he goes into a restaurant and and do we need some from somebody i mean the idea of a vaccine passport or a vaccine card um these are ideas that are being floated at the moment i guess the lawyers will have a look at it in terms of discrimination um but in many parts of the world it 's already being used as a way to open up the society and and and to assure people that that uh they 're they 're um in a safe environment um and uh there 's people who will be opposed to that point of view um and i think we i guess because um because i think people will need some reassurance that uh that going about their normal business is safe and um and people who are unvaccinated definitely present a risk so so i i think we 're we 're going to be treating on new ground here in terms of uh what we require of citizens to uh uh protect themselves and others as we go forward maybe we need some rules like sterilize everywhere or make everything clean that 's part of it but unfortunately as i 've said earlier um a lot of the infection is is through the air through air through ordinary breathing and so you wouldn 't know and and and just because someone i mean of course we think we have to be hygienic as well and wash surfaces down that 's an important part of it but we do think airborne infection is an important part of this of this virus and and um and so that means we have to be cautious about uh about how we gather together with other people uh how we enjoy each other 's it may change the way we do things uh um at least for a while and uh um and uh i think uh uh pandemics have a way of doing that um um you know so uh the the uh [Music] the the many of the rules and the conventions that we adopt uh in terms of hygiene and social interaction have been shaped over the decades and the centuries by what 's happened with pandemics and and uh i think for example mask wearing should remain a part of what we do in indoor spaces for a long time to come i think we 're stuck with masks for a while and i guess it might be a situation like many countries in asia like korea and china and japan where it 's just a normal thing for people in the winter especially to wear masks and and that might be where we have to get to uh in the future at least for the next few and a vaccine passport may be a part of that array of of measures excellent well we might uh finish it there to dr corbett alenandro and daniel from new so is health this recording is going to be put onto cumberland council website so if you suddenly think of something and you want to double check if it was answered in this session it should hopefully be up within the next day or so i 've also put the link in the chat for our support form so again if yourself or any of your family members are in need of food clothing financial support please reach out through that form um so even if you haven 't been uh you haven 't contracted the virus virus but you 're still isolating for any particular reason or you need help please reach out to council and we will either support you ourselves or put you in touch with our local services and definitely recommend visiting the new south wales health website to make sure you 're getting up-to-date information particularly as modena becomes more readily available and you know we 're looking at information as we become less restricted in movement in society um please make sure that you 're remembering and cleaning as was recommended in the presentation tonight um and obviously you 're eligible to go and get the vaccine by walk up at kudos or macquarie fields or visiting your local gp or canvas that are offering it at the moment and just a final note that again tonight we weren 't able to provide any individual medical advice that 's where a recommendation is to speak to your gp so if you have any further direct concerns related to yourself please make sure you reach out to them and hopefully your local gp will be able to support you in better understanding which vaccine is available for you if you 're eligible um dr corbett did you want to finish with anything any final thoughts yeah it 's just that you know cumberland is still uh a danger zone for this virus it 's important to know that and and we have and you know we we probably we anticipate it 's going to be another six to eight weeks before the case is full uh back to single figures let 's hope and and uh so time uh um i 'm happy to have another forum to answer people 's concerns because um it 's really important that that we do everything we can uh to to get numbers in cumberland down uh we 're a bit worried that testing has gone off the boil a little bit and uh um and we don 't know if that 's why the numbers have come down so we just have to keep our eyes really carefully fixed on cumberland in the next few weeks to make sure we 're staying on track and and we 'd like to work with council to to make that happen excellent well thank you very much everybody for coming this evening hopefully we 're able to answer some of your questions and provide you a bit more clarification around what 's out there and how to support you as i said visit all those identified spots that we said for any further information um and hopefully everyone has a good night and you enjoy the the less restrictions as we move further forward and you know we gather that herd immunity thank you very much _"

    "text": "hi everybody welcome back to other bush school connections i hope you 've had a great time playing with sticks last week this week we are going to be playing with my favorite thing let me see if you can guess what it is i 've got a bucket of sand i 've got a bucket of dirt i 've got a jug of water with a wooden spoon for mixing and i have my favorite clay that i 've mixed with a little bit of water to make it extra squishy can you guess what i might be making here i wonder that 's right i 'm making mud we are going to mix all these things together to make some mud so you can come a little bit closer and i 'll show you how i 'm going to do that so in my bucket of clay i 'm gonna pour this border into here with the clay oh that 's really sloppy i 'm gonna pour that into there i 'm gonna use my shovel and i 'm gonna mix it all up like that that 's mix mix i 'm gonna mix mix mix like that and i might add a scoop full of my sand or maybe a couple of scoops a couple of scoops of my sand here i 'm gonna mix mix mix i think that needs a little bit more water what do you think i think it does too let 's add a little bit more water okay squish squish squish and keep squishing okay i 'm gonna pour a bit more water into here like this and now comes the fun part instead of using my shovel i 'm gonna use my hands to get in there and make some mud are you ready here i go oh squish squish i 'm squishing all of the clay in squish squish squish it 's good getting dirty squish squish squish squish squish ready look at my hands oh they 're so muddy but it feels all slimy and it feels i can feel the sand in my fingers i think it needs some more squishing squish swish swish you can do all sorts of things with this special mud you could and smooth you could also add a bit more sand like that and do some more mixing make your very own mud pie look how different that looks now that we 've added all of those things to make it all nice and sticky i know gabrielle has her own mud kitchen that she 's made i 'd love to see the type of mud she 's cooking up hi everybody wow christina had so many great ideas how to explore mud and how to make some nice ooey gooey mud and i 've decided to make my very own mud kitchen here today and maybe you 've got some pots or pans at home that your mum or dad aren 't using that you can use to make your own little kitchen maybe you could even just use some recycled containers well here i have put some leaves into my very special coffee and i 'm going to add some dandelion leaves as well some flowers and more leaves oh that looks really nice and tasty now over here i 'm going to add some water to this mud and i 'm using some wooden spoons that i had but if you don 't have wooden spoons you can always use sticks to stir your pot of mud as well now i 've got some water in this billy can i 'm going to pour it in and let 's see is it getting nice and gooey gooey gooey mud oh round round and round sometimes you can even put leaves or spark or grass in it well this is looking really nice and gooey mud and i 'm going to use it to make some mud pies in my little containers so let 's fill them up ready one mud pie and two and the rate i think i 've put so much water in that this mud is really runny gooey now here are my three mud pies and i might decorate them with some different things i might put some leaves on this mud pie that i 've collected from my garden and i think i might put a feather on this mud pie i don 't think i might put this rock that i found mud pies i think i know a rhyme about that three mud pies in the mud pie shop oohy and gooey with leaves rocks and a feather on top along came a friend with the money one day they bought a mud pie and took one away oh let 's take this one away with the feather on the top so we had three mud pies and one mug pie went away how many are we left with that 's right two two mud pies in the mud pie shop ooey and with a leaf and a rock on top along came a friend with some money one day bought this mud pie and took it right away how many mud pies left just one we had three and two got taken away so now we have one mud pie in the mud pie shop ooey and gooey with a rock on top along came a friend with some money one day they took the last mud pie and took it right away how many mad thighs left none looks like i am going to have to collect some more going to have a story all about how some animals in the bush made a special recipe sounds very interesting i hope you have fun making some mud pies today bye well gabrielle was cooking up some wonderful things in her mud kitchen and she said we were going to read a story about some animals that made some things with mud hmm i 'm pretty sure you guys may have already heard this story before it 's called wombat stew wombat stew hmm i wonder if they use any mud in this story to make their wombat stew wombat stew is written by marsha vaughan and it 's illustrated by pamela lofts let 's have a look at one bat stew one day on the banks of a billabong a very clever dingo caught a wombat and he decided to make one bat stew one bat stew gooey brewey yummy chewy wombat stew platypus came ambling up the bank good day dingo he said snapping his bill what is all that water for i 'm brewing up a gooey chewy stew with that fat wombat replied the dingo with big grin if you ask me said platypus the best thing for a gooey stew is mud big blobs of billabong mud blobs of mud dingo loft what a great idea rightio in they go so platypus scooped up big blobs of mud with his tail and tipped them into the billy can there 's our mud squelch squelch around the bubbling billy dingo danced and sang one bat stew one bat stew gooey brewey yummy chewy wombat stew look at all the mud bubbling out of the billy can i don 't know how that 's going to taste whilst sing out from the shade of the ironbox came emu she arched her graceful neck over the brew oh ho dingo she fluttered what have we got here gooey chewy wombat stew boasted dingo if only there was a bit more chewy she said but don 't worry a few feathers will set it right feathers dingo smiled hmm that would be chewy righty-o in they go so in to the gooey chewy brew emu dropped her finest feathers around and around the bubbling billy dingo danced and sang lunchy wombat stew oh my goodness look at the poor wombat he 's starting to look very worried oh blue tongue the lizard came sliding off his sun soaked stone silly dingo he hissed there 's no flies in this stew can 't_''_713.2 be one bad stew without flies in it and he 's stuck out his bright blue tongue there 's a lot to be said for flies agreed dingo rubbing his paws together righty-o in they go so lizard snapped 100 flies from the air with his long tongue and flipped them into the gooey chewy stew look at his long tongue my goodness around and around the bubbling billy dingo danced and sang wombat stew wombat stew crunchy munchie for my lunchy one bath stew he looks very happy at the moment doesn 't he mr dingo up through the red dust popped echidna wait a bit not so fast he bristled shaking the red dust from his quills i 've been listening to all this advice and take it from me for a munchie stew you need slugs and bugs and creepy crawlies oh i don very nice dingo wagged his tail why i should have thought of that righty-o in there go he said so echidna dug up all sorts of creepy crawlies and dropped them into the gooey chewy crunchy stew the very clever dingo stirred and stirred all the while singing one bad stew one that stew hot and spicy oh so nicey one bat stew i don 't think the wombat likes the sound of that at all just then the sleepy-eyed koala climbed down from the scribbly gum tree oh look here oh he yawned any bush cook knows you can 't make a spicy stew without gum nuts leave it to a koala to think of gum nuts dingo laughed and licked his whiskers radio in they go and into the gooey chewy crunchy munchie stew koala shook lots and lots of gum nuts oh i missed a page oh here we go oh there it is aha cried dingo now my stew is missing only one thing what 's that ask the animals that fat wombat wait stop hang on dingo you can 't put that wombat into the said radio i 'll taste it and that very clever dingo bent over the billy and took a great big slurp of stew i 'm poisoned he held you 've tricked me oh my goodness it does not look like that stew tasted any good at all oh dear and he dashed away deep into the bush never again to sing one bad stew wombat stew gooey brewing yummy chewy wombat stew oh my goodness the wombat looks very happy now doesn 't she and that 's the end of the story that was a very funny story about all the animals tricking the dingo into not eating the wombat i think it would be very yucky to eat some mud and a mud pie but this is the one i made earlier and i found some gum nuts like we had in our story so maybe i can add them to my crunchy munchie mud pie have a lot of fun making your mud pies guys see you next week _"

been able to make some awesome shadows this week we 're going to be looking at something i 'm sure you all love playing with let 's see if you can guess what i 'm talking about they can be short or they can be long and they come from trees they fall on the ground you can pick them up they can sometimes be a little bit dangerous if you 're not careful with them do you know what i 'm talking about yet that 's right i 'm talking about sticks i would like to show you all of the sticks that i found in my backyard are you ready i 've made a bit of a pile i 'm going to show you all the sticks that i found can you see them this is my big long pile of sticks that i found in my backyard hmm that like to show you all the things that we can do with sticks in our backyards let 's have a look we can use sticks to measure things i 'd like to use sticks to measure how far it is from my busch garden all the way to my veggie garden let 's see how many sticks i 've used see if you can count them with me ready got one two three four five six seven oh look at that bendy one eight that 's a little one nine ten and i think there 's room for just one more ready eleven there we go eleven sticks to the veggie patch i 've collected some sticks that i can use to make some shapes look at this shape it has one two three sides i made a triangle i wonder what happens if i move some of the sticks so i put one that way one that way one the top can you see what shape i 've made now they 're all roughly the same size all those sides roughly so that makes a square let me take two long sides one two and one short side if i add another short side what shape does that make can you see it makes a rectangle fabulous now i have put my sticks in size order can you see that i 've started with my long sticks all the way down to my shorter stick there are lots of amazing things we can do with sticks but we have to remember to be safe and i 'll show you a safe way to hold your sticks if you hold your stick down next to your body you 'll make sure that you won 't poke anybody or hurt yourself that 's a great idea isn 't it bye hi have you seen all of the awesome things that we can do with sticks we can measure we can make shapes we can do all sorts of great stuff did you know that sticks also help us tell a story about our backyards that 's what i 'm doing now i 'm making a story stick that sounds pretty cool let me show you what i 've got so far in my garden and i 've wrapped oops something fell off i 've wrapped a lot of string around it can you see all the string that i 've wrapped and wrapped and wrapped and i helped it along a little bit by adding a little bit of tape at the end like that and now i 'm starting to thread on all of the things that i 've been able to find in my backyard so so far i 've got this black feather it 's black feather here this tells me that some birds it 's a bit black and white so maybe it 's from a magpie that some magpies have been visiting my backyard i 've got some gum nuts here on the end this tells me that there 's a gum tree in my backyard as well as this bark right here this is the bark from a gum tree and these leaves come from a gum tree as well i wonder what else i can add on one of the things that fell off was this seed pod this looks pretty interesting doesn 't there 's this might be a home for some bugs maybe but i 'm going to try to add it to my story stick i 'm going to thread it through it might be a little bit big whoops a little bit big to add but i 'll see how i go i 'll add it on there i also have some of this that i found on the ground this is rosemary this tells me um that there 's some rosemary in my garden and it 's going to make my story stick smell really lovely so let me see where i can add this i don 't think this seed pod 's going to stay so i 'll just sit him there let 's see if my rosemary can go in there oh yes it can there it is there 's my rosemary right there i also found this flower that had fallen off one of our blossom trees so i 'm going to use some of the petals i might just break it apart it had already fallen off the tree so i 'm okay allowed to can add this to my story stick to add a little bit of color oh there 's a bit that 's got a bit of here we go let 's see if we can put it in here next to the rosemary this might be a good idea to push it through here there it goes oh some of these petals a little bit soft and fiddly but let 's see if we can get it on there good job dinner there it is it 's adding some nice pink color to my story stick i 'm going to add my rosemary in here so it still smells nice there it goes into there now i 've got one more thing that i wanted to add because this looks these two things look very interesting i found this leaf that has two different colors on it that 's pretty cool and i found this twig that has some teeny tiny gum nuts on it look at those i 'm gonna add these maybe to the top where there 's not a lot i 'm gonna add that one through there the bottom [Music] and i can keep adding to this the more i explore in my garden it looks really cool doesn 't it now the other interesting thing about this is that everybody 's story stick is going to be different i know gabrielle 's making us one now that 's going to be really different than the one i 've made wow i really loved christina 's story stick told a wonderful story about the things that she finds in her backyard and i have made my own story stick now about the things that i have found in my backyard and if you have a look here you can see some nice soft feathers that the minor birds have left behind in my backyard so my story stick tells me that those minor birds visit my space my story stick also tells me that i 've got these interesting shaped leaves that have fallen off my passion fruit vine so i know i have a passion fruit vine in my backyard i also have these beautiful lovely yellow leaves and they smell lovely as well because they a lemon tree in my backyard i have lots of these really long thin leaves and these are from the gum trees i have lots of gum trees around my place and that 's why i haven 't had these little gum nuts that are on the sticks as well i have lots of other different shapes of leaves long leaves from the grevilla tree and some of these nice brown leaves as well that i 've collected from the ground so my story stick tells me a story about the trees that i have around my backyard it tells me a story about the birds that visit my backyard and the great thing about story sticks is that i can undo it all and put all different ones on if i go somewhere different or if the seasons change because i think in autumn i will have lots and lots of different kinds of leaves that 's what makes story sticks just such an interesting way to tell a story now i 've gone busily and collected lots of leaves and lots of sticks in my backyard i couldn backyard but i thought i 'm going to use those sticks to make some fun things so i 've used some recycled packaging to make some shapes and i 've cut out a star shape from this one and i 'm going to use one of these sticks to make a magic wand so you might have some tape you can use to put the star shape on the end of your magic wand just like this and it 's not just a stick anymore it 's a magic wand maybe you could do some drawing on your star as well or maybe you could make some magic abracadabra well let me see what else we might use with one of these sticks hmm this nice long stick would be a really good fishing line so i 've got some string i 'm going to tie to the end and i 'm going to put one of my shapes that i 've cut i 've got a fish shape but you could make any kind of shape maybe you could make a shark maybe you could even make a starfish stick and i have the best fishing rod ever so there we go i 've got a fishing line i 've got a magic wand and i 've got an amazing story stick i wonder what you can turn your sticks into that you find in your backyard i can 't wait to see all the wonderful things that you can think of thanks for listening bye what a great week we 've had learning all about different kinds of sticks and i 've made a campfire a pretend campfire with a whole lot of sticks that i 've found and i 've even got a pretend marshmallow on the end of another stick and campfire is a really good space for sharing stories so what a great place to share our story of the week which is all about a backyard and all the different things that we can find in our backyard and we 've already had fun exploring wind and shadows and sticks so let 's see what else there is in this story and it 's called backyard magic by wendy shiretti and harriet hobday backyard tilly 's forehead creased what can i do now hmm i think mum turned the television off her box of toys did not look exciting sweet singing drew her to the window where a little bird met her eyes the bird seemed to call tilly followed the sound into the garden to investigate where is that bird could it be playing hide and seek she looked inside the flower pots and searched up in the trees until he reached for a branch and pulled herself up it 's a climbing frame she surveyed her kingdom but could not see the bird anywhere where is that bird tilly searched under a bush and tilly came across a magic wand could this help me find the bird a magic one stick just like we made abracadabra instantly the wand became a bird spotting telescope it 's not a telescope it 's a sword and it 's a fishing rod it 's a broomstick tilly tilly where is that bird crouching in the vegetable patch tilly discovered a tiny wildlife park with snakes and armadillos and even a rhinoceros rhinoceros where is that in the sky is that a dragon chasing a dolphin no the dolphin is changing into a bird hooray the cloud bird escaped the dragon oh wow where is my bed looking around the garden beds tilly found a hole in the ground a wonderful spot for a lucky dip and she hunted for gifts to wrap in leaves a purple flower a shiny stone a four leaf clover who wants to make a wish tilly tilly where is that bird at the bottom of the garden tilly picked up some large leaves perfect for a twirly skirt till he danced along the ocean shore where is that bird the sun began to sink slowly towards its bed tilly time to come inside called mum but mum there are so many things to play with here and i haven 't finished my game of hide and seek tilly tilly [Music] there are so many wonderful things to discover when you are out in your backyard and maybe you can play a game of hide and seek just like tilly did with her little bird friend see you all next week bye _"

dinosaurs and some leaves as well so many interesting things that you can do with shadows they can even help us with our artwork wow well i think that looks like a great prehistoric forest dinosaur that we drew using shadows have fun everybody once upon a time there were three billy goats gruff called big gruff middle sized gruff and tiny gruff they 'd eaten all the grass in the valley and they were hungry but to reach the next valley they had to cross a bridge and under the bridge lived a great big grumpy troll how could the billy goats gruff get across safely they all decided that tiny gruff should cross the bridge first and off he went trip trap trip trap trip trap trip trap across the bridge in the troll said who 's that trip trapping across my bridge i 'm hungry and i want me said little tiny gruff wait for my brother he 's much bigger and fatter the troll said hmm all right but i can 't_''_437.52 wait all day so off went tiny graph chip trap trip trump trip truck trip

trapping across my bridge i 'm hungry and i want to gobble you up right now oh it 's only little me said middle-sized gruff i 'm not very big wait for my brother he 's the biggest and he 's the fattest hmm all right said the troll i can 't_''_482.879 wait all day so off went middle-sized gruff trip truck trip trap trip trip and ate some nice green grass and then a long came big rough trip trap trip trap trip trap trip trap across the bridge and the troll said who 's that trip trapping across my bridge i 'm hungry and i 'm going to gobble you up up and see me right away so up climb to the troll and he got such a shock when he saw the size of the great big billy goat gruff that he fell down down down down down into the water below and landed with a great big splash well the water was so cold and so icy and the troll got such a surprise that he became a friendly troll and now he says who 's that trip trapping across my bridge you 're welcome to cross anytime so the three billy goats gruff go back and forth whenever they want fresh green grass and they all lived as friends happily ever after and that is the end of the story _"

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome back to another bush school connections i hope you all loved collecting some leaves last week this week we are going to be looking at the wind the wind how do you know when it 's windy hmm let 's have a look and see if we can find some ways that we know when it 's windy the wind blows the trees it blows the leaves and makes a rustling noise can you see all of the big trees moving the wind moves the clothesline around and dries all of the clothes on your clothesline the wind can even blow the clouds across the sky we can also feel the wind on our face and we can see it blowing our hair the wind also spreads the seeds of plants around so that seeds and new plants and new trees can grow in the bush that 's very interesting isn 't it gabrielle has found another way for us to know when it 's windy let 's go and see what she 's doing bye for now can you see the wind blowing the leaves the clouds across the sky maybe you can feel the wind flowing your hair or the wind on your cheeks is it windy at your house today maybe there is big gusts of wind maybe there 's just a gentle breeze is it a good day at your house today for flying coats maybe you can make some kites of your own today to fly on a windy day but you know what i 'm thinking how can we find out what direction the wind is going and how can we find out how strong the wind is each day and so i have an experiment that we can do today to learn a little bit more about wind let me put my kite down and i have some bubbles do you have some bubbles at home so when i blow the bubbles let 's have a look and see what direction do the bubbles go in will they go this way or will they go that way there 's only a very gentle breeze today so let 's have a look and see what direction these bubbles go ready way the bubbles went they went that way which i think means that the wind is blowing this way today let 's try again are we ready let 's blow some more bubbles and the bubbles are going the same way again and you might notice the bubbles are just moving very slowly and very gently around the yard and that 's because the wind isn 't very strong if the wind was blowing stronger the bubbles would move a lot faster and maybe they might even go up a bit higher let 's have another go and see what the bubbles will do this time are you ready oh this time the bubbles are going this way did the wind change direction or wonder there 's lots of things to learn when we blow bubbles and maybe you 've got some bubbles that you can learn a little bit about in today and see if you can work out which direction the wind is coming from and if the wind is coming in big gus or just a gentle breeze have fun experimenting everybody hi everyone welcome back that those bubbles that looked like a lot of fun i know i love bubbles now we 're going to see if we can make a mobile using some things that we found in nature and that has blown off the trees because it 's so windy so i have collected some treasures from my backyard i have found some of these these are some dried flowers that fell off a tree i 've got some of these i 've got some leaves of all different colors that have fallen off the trees as well i 've got some of this this is bark it 's been so windy today that some bark has even fallen off the trees oh my goodness we 've got some bark we also found i also found these these are seed pods do you remember before i said that seed pods fall off the trees and spread their seeds around well that 's what happened at my place and i also found these these are gum nuts that have fallen off one of my trees as well they look pretty cool don 't they can you might know already i found a big long stick and i 'm going to make a mobile so i found a big long stick like this and i 've used just some string or you can use some wool and i 've tied it to my big long stick and then i 've tied some of the treasures that i found to the string so on this one i 've put some of my seed pods that are nice and light and are going to blow in the breeze on this one i tied a little bit of bark on this one i 've tied some of my leaves my green leaves that have fallen off the tree and on this one oh can you see it blowing on this one i tied my dried flower i 've got one more spot left right here do you think i should add my gum nuts i think i should too so let 's tie them on here they are these are my gum nuts i 'll just stick this here so you can see i 'm gonna tie it into 'll tie just like this it 's a bit stuck i 'll tie it into a knot oh my goodness can you hear the trees with all the wind blowing in the trees i can hear i can hear it and [Music] finished there we go this is my wink mobile and i think what i might do is i might stick some string here and some string here so i can hang it up like that awesome i wonder if you guys could hang up your mobile somewhere in your place so you can see the wind blowing your mobile i know gabrielle has a song now for us about how wind can blow some boats well wasn 't that a beautiful mobile that christina made with so many beautiful pieces of nature that we can watch gently move in the breeze well i 've got something else that needs to move gently in the breeze and it actually needs the wind to help it move and that 's the sailing boat a sailing boat needs to pick up the wind as it sails along the water to help some of our own boats by folding some paper so you 'll have to listen and look very carefully at these directions and maybe we can all make a boat together so what you need today is a piece of paper the shape of a rectangle and then we 're going to fold the paper in half just like this to make a smaller rectangle shape and then we 're going to fold it in half like this to make an even smaller rectangle and then we 'll open it up and then at this end side we 're going to fold in this way to here and this side to here can you see the two triangle shapes here and then we 'll fold this piece up this side and then i 'm going to turn my paper over and fold this piece on this side so it looks a little bit like a hat doesn 't it now this is a bit of a tricky step now we 're going to open it up just like it is a hat but then we 're going to fold it can you see what shape it is now that 's right it is a square shape so at the bottom where it opens up we 're going to fold this piece up to be a triangle shape and this piece up and now we have a triangle this is another tricky step now we 're going to open it up like this and fold it back down again so it 's kind of like a diamond and then we 're going to pull it apart just like this and close it up and it becomes a boat just like this so now i have an orange boat and i 've got a green boat and i 've got a blue boat and i 'm going to make a sea for my boats by using a container and pouring some water into my sea it 's looking really great and i can even feel some wind now but this is going to be very exciting just pour the rest in and let 's sail our boats on the sea one two three sailing boats on the sea now i can see wind moving the sailing boats around in the water now if you haven 't got any wind to move the sailing boats around you can use a giant leaf like i found to make some wind can you see the wind that that leaf is making to make the sailing boats move around or you might even be able to make yourself your own little fan and you can fan the boats around to the water and i 've got a song about three sangling boats three little boats sail in the sea bobbing along so peacefully along came the wind are you ready and blows one away how many boats are left to play how many boats are left we had three and one blew away so now we 've got two boats two little boats sail in the sea bobbing along so peacefully along comes the wind and blows one away how many boats are left to play just one boat is left one little boat sails in the sea bobbing along so peacefully along comes the wind whoosh and blows it away how many boats are left maybe you can make yourself some boats today or maybe you can even collect some natural materials and make some boats that you think might be able to float i 've got a piece of bark here and a stick and a leaf let 's see if this might float in the water wow this little boat sails in the sea bobbing along so peacefully [Music] i think i might find some more pieces of nature and make some more boats and keep playing but when i 'm finished playing with my water i 'm not going to waste the water i 'm going to tip it into my garden because certainly my grass and my plants need water have a great day everybody i hope you 've enjoyed learning all about wind this week and we look forward to hearing about your windy day adventures thank you bye _"

    "text": "hi again everyone and welcome back to our bush school connections and welcome back to my backyard i really really hoped you all loved looking for birds last week this week we are going to do a little bit of investigating in our backyard and look for some please that 's right we 're going to look for some leaves we 're going to see if we can find leaves of all different shapes and sizes in our backyards let me show you some of the things that i found i have found this one here this is a yellowy greeny type of leaf isn 't it i found this one here this one is a little round leaf that 's very green i found this stick with lots of leaves and they 're all very brown they 're all very brown leaves i 've also found some very interesting leaves that look like they 've been eaten by bugs wow that 's very interesting i wonder if i can find any more interesting leaves around my backyard let 's go and have a look i have found these leaves like they 've been made by a velociraptor look at those i found this one that looks like it has a nest of some sort inside can you see that it looks like a bug has made its home in there that 's very very interesting isn 't it i found the leaves on this plant their leaves on this plant are very very hard and stiff you can hardly even move them they 're so hard and stiff then i found the leaves on this tree are very very soft the leaves on this tree are so soft the leaves on this plant are all different colors we have green and purple and some leaves have both i found this special tree in this special plant and the leaves on here actually smell like lemons ah let 's see it does smells like lemons and if i rub my hands on it then my fingers smell like lemon there are even some leaves in my veggie patch that do a special trick with water watch this so i 've got a cup of water with a dropper i 'm the water when i drop it on the leaves wow it 's making little beads in the sunshine let 's get another bit ready look at that look at the water falling off the leaf that was a lot of leaves different types of leaves i found i wonder if you can find as many different types of leaves in your backyard let 's go and see what gabrielle 's found i 'm sure she 's found lots of different types of leaves in her backyard as well bye for now wow christina has so many different kinds of leaves in her backyard well i 've gone on a bit of a treasure hunt in my own backyard with my puppy dog sheldon and we have found a whole lot of leaves that we 're going to use in an art activity now and what i do love about leaves is the kind of patterns that we can find on these and if you have a close look and sunshine at some of these beautiful patterns and even the spotty pattern on this one so we 're going to do we find on these so i 'm using a great big piece of paper and i 'm going to organize my leaves on the paper and when you 're binding leaves if you put them on the paper so that the bumpy side is facing you then you 'll be going to be able to capture that pattern closely i 'm going to put a whole lot here and different size ones i have lots of gum trees around my house so i 'll put some gum leaves as well some big big leaves and some round leaves and then i 'm going to put my piece of paper over the top just like this and with my crayon i 'm going to use the side of it to see if i can catch the pattern in the leaf can you see the gum leaf i put on the on the paper let 's see if we can get some other leaf prints well that one looks nice can you see the patterns there and this one as well lots of leaf patterns coming you might even like to sticky when you 're getting the patterns off them because it is a little bit tricky to do wow look at that shape leaf and the patterns on that one this one a pointy leaf well i can see very clearly all the beautiful leaves that i have had on the paper to create my own leaf patterns i wonder if you can collect some interesting leaves in your house today and maybe you can use a crayon to rub over the top and see if you can make some leaf rubbings as well thanks for listening everybody we 've got a story all about leaves coming up hi again everybody well this week we have been talking about leaves all kinds of leaves so i thought today i 'm going to read our story next to these giant leaves in my gardens and the story today is called the bush walk and i have a feeling there 's all kinds of leaves of wonderful creatures in this story the bush walk i can see somebody is walking in the bush and on the front cover gives us a bit of or reptiles that we 're going to see in this story the bush walk by sandra kendall the bushwalk i love to walk in the bush if i keep my eyes and ears open it 's always an adventure what kind of sound does it make when you walk in the bush maybe you can hear some crunching of leaves underneath your feet sometimes i think all i will find is green brown trees and plants we found lots of leaves like here haven 't_''_498.4 we the gum trees but then i discover a splash of color maybe you 've seen some blossoms on the gum nuts like these and hear a trilling song i can hear a drilling song now or a croaking crawl down called down by the creek what kind of hmm who would do some croaking what kind of animal would do some croaking that 's right some frogs can you croak like a frog broke broke if i look carefully i might spy a lizard on a sunny day lizards like to sit on rocks and sun themselves i have a lizard that lives in while i hope we see him soon or even see a snake slither off the track and i can see all the different leaves that are around the snake here just like the leaves that we 've been investigating today once i surprised this spiky fellow do you know what kind of animal this one is this one is an echidna he 's very spiky and he likes to eat ants and startled some very gray flashes crashing through the shrubs some wallabies bouncing through the shrubs some animals can be tricky at hide and seek and there are lots of animals and insects that can camouflage themselves this butterfly is camouflaging and blending in with the brown leaves so nobody even notices she 's there there 's another insect that 's good at camouflaging in with the leaves and some have clever disguises look at those beautiful green leaves and i can see where he started to munch at them maybe you found some leaves

    "text": "hello everyone it 's gabrielle here again and i have found a place to sit in my garden to be part of nature today i wonder if you can find a spot to sit in your backyard where you can watch nature as well we call these places six spots now a sit spot needs to be a safe spot it needs to be a place that your mum and dad or grandparents can still see you and somewhere in the shade so you 're not right in the sunshine but it 's a place that you can watch nature around you so once you find your thick spot take some big deep breaths and calm your mind and then have a look around you can you see some things far far away maybe you can see some trees in the distance or some clouds in the sky maybe you can see really close down to you maybe you can see some insects in the garden or maybe you can look up high and see what 's happening above you are there some birds in the trees now have a your hands maybe you can feel the wind on your cheeks or your hair blowing in the breeze with the cold air on your face maybe take some big deep breaths can you smell anything around you maybe you 've got a beautiful garden you can smell some flowers or some herbs growing in the garden and now let 's have a listen to the sounds around us close your eyes and have a listen what can you hear in your garden i can hear lots of birds around me can you hear some bird sounds i know you might be able to hear some sirens or some cars or some people talking but try really hard so you can just hear those birds or those insect sounds and i 'm thinking i wonder what kind of birds are making that sound i wonder how far away they are and i wonder what they 're doing so from your sit spot today i wonder if you can have a good look around you if you can see those birds that are making those sounds and i 've got some pictures that you might see in the cumberland area the first bird is the white cockatoo you might hear him squawking squawking as he nibbles food maybe from the gum trees around you or flies with his friends above you maybe you might see some pigeons now especially if you live in a unit or an apartment pigeons like to sit along the edges of the windowsills and they make that lovely gentle cooling sound you might see some of these birds the black and white magpies it 's like almost nesting seasons for magpies they 'll be building their nests and laying their eggs so we need to be very mindful of the magpies at this time of year you might be lucky enough to hear this bird a kookaburra i know there 's lots of kookaburras in the pillowway area maybe you can see a pokeball from your sit spot now if you live near a park you may have some of these birds visiting you because they certainly love parks and they love to eat the rubbish and the garbage things as well and this is the ibis see today he 's got a very big sharp beak helping himself to some bugs and worms from the soft ground and this is one of my favorite birds i 'm lucky i have lots of these around my house the rainbow laura keats and they love to eat the nectar for maybe the gravelias or bottle brush or even the flowers from the eucalyptus trees the most beautiful birds to watch because they 're so colorful and one bird that i 'm pretty sure everyone will see today is the minor bird because there seems to be lots of minor birds here in the cumberland area so they 're the ones you might see hopping from tree to tree and they 're the ones that you might hear around you there 's so many wonderful things to see and notice from your sit spot and you know what sit spots just aren 't great for children but also it 's a really good thing for a grown-up to find a sit spot just to come out and to take some big deep breaths and notice what 's happening around her gigantic backyard let 's see welcome everybody thanks gabrielle this is my sit spot i 'm sitting here behind this beautiful tree and did you know that in summertime this tree grows nectarines and plums we should probably have a look at it in summertime to see if it has any fruit in it but today it 's just got some flowers and some leaves so gabrielle was talking to us about some birds and the birds that she sees in her backyard when she 's sitting and listening quietly can you hear some birds i can hear somebody oh wow i can hear lots of birds i wonder what i can make that would help me look at the birds do you know i 'm gonna make myself some binoculars look would you like to make some binoculars i 'll show you how so i have just used two coffee cups they 're the paper coffee cups that you get when you get a takeaway coffee or hot chocolate or maybe a baby cheeto you might get from the coffee shop i know your mums and daddies could i used two coffee cups and i cut out the bottom i 'll show you how i did it so i 've got a spare coffee cup here and look still got the bottom on it so i just got a pencil you might have a pencil in your pencil case and i just pushed it into the middle of the cup like this then i just used my fingers to rip out the bottom a little bit gently so you don 't rip the cup but you rip out the bottom like this and then there oh i can see straight through it and then i just used some normal sticky tape and taped two of them together and if you want to make yours nice and colorful you can use some textures i 'm not sure if you can see you can use some textures and make it really really colorful let 's come a bit closer so you can see here you go you might be able to see that no there it 's nice and colorful i just used some normal textures let 's see if if you know what this is ready i 'm gonna do some circles circles circles circles some little feet and some antennas smiley face what does that look like oh can you see it 's a little caterpillar how funny let 's go exploring in the backyard with our binoculars are you ready i wonder what birds i can see up in the trees you guys i 've spotted something very special would you like to come and have a look i don 't know if you can see him but up in the tree is bird called a tawny fog mouth ah can you see him sitting there look there he is she 's sitting up in that tree oh my goodness look at the wonderful things you can find when you go out into your backyard wow that was amazing oh wow i think we 'll have to tell gabrielle all about the bird that we found but do you know what gabrielle has got a story for us now it 's a very special story about some birds i think they 're big birds i think they the bush school we recognize that aboriginal people have been teaching and caring for children on this land for many many years and so our acknowledgement to country is a very important way that we start off our story times so can you have a feel of the ground underneath you what can you feel today can you feel some grass or some dirt or maybe some sticks are you ready here is the land here is the sky here are my friends and here am i we thank the daring people for this land on which we share our stories today and last week it was national aboriginal and torres strait islander children 's day so today we 've chosen a story by an indigenous artist an illustrator called the news under the bed and there 's lots of birds in this story today just like the ones we 've been discovering around our own cumberland area and it 's by leanne j edwards and in the front cover of this book i can certainly see some baby emus there 's one two three four five six and when love looking at the e-news they 've got three emus that live there emu 's under the bed on saturdays i visit my auntie dolo come in aunties girls she says do you want to help me make some feather flowers auntie dolo has all kinds and colors of feathers i think i can see a white cockatoo there she has feathers from more hens magpies galas and cockatoos see this one comes from a guinea fowl and these ones i got from a tawny frog mouth auntie dolo says oh my goodness look how many birds are in auntie dollo 's backyard did you find that many birds when you went looking she shows me how to arrange them together and wrap cotton around them to fix them to the wire time for lunch hey says auntie dolo we make some damper out the back with uncle rex and sit under the gum trees look at me i say beautiful says auntie dolo and now i 've got a surprise for you i wonder what that could be what are those scratchy noises

we thought it would be lots of fun if we could bring the bush school to you so we 've decided to send you some things to do in your backyard can you tell me what your backyard looks like i know there are lots of different types of backyards some people have little teeny tiny small backyards with only a little bit of grass some people might not have any grass in their backyards at all some people might just have concrete or pavers some people might just have a balcony or a veranda and not have a big backyard but i can tell you that i have a very big backyard come on let me show you the most favorite things that i love about my backyard i love that my backyard is so long it 's very very long and i love that my backyard has a a big veggie patch there 's some tomatoes and some cauliflower and broccoli with a net over the top so the bugs don 't get in i love that my backyard has lots of fruit trees there 's an orange look there 's some oranges on the ground there 's a lemon tree and a mandarine tree can you see some mandarins hiding on that tree i can but the best thing about my garden that i love the best is sitting in the middle of the native garden and listening to nature [Music] let 's see what we can hear my goodness that 's so relaxing i wonder what gabrielle loves the best about her garden let 's go over and see thank you christina and hello everyone it 's gabrielle here and i 'm so excited that we can still bring you some bush school adventures straight from our backyard it just feels so good to be out in nature so even if you 've got a small backyard or a balcony or a veranda we can all still enjoy some of the wonderful things that we can about what i love about my backyard over here i 've got a beautiful beverly and a bird bath so this space is an invitation for birds to come and visit my backyard and in the mornings this tree is full of rosellas it 's beautiful but my favorite part of my garden is right in front of me here and it is this very tall tall tree and what i love about this tree is that it shows me all of the seasons at the moment it 's got no leaves on it and i know that it 's winter time and in autumn my grass is full of leaves because so many of the leaves fall off the trees and very soon when spring arrives we 're going to see the trees start changing again and growing leaves and in summer it 's so thick with leaves it gives us plenty of shade now maybe you 've got a tree like that at home as well and maybe you can even send us a photo of the tree that you have that you notice changes as the seasons moment maybe if you haven 't got a tree in the backyard maybe you can see a tree from your veranda or your balcony or even from outside the window there 's so many wonderful things we can learn about trees so if you send us email you your buster photos we can all see everyone 's wonderful dreams thanks for listening bye hello again everybody well i have just finished drawing a tortoise on my pavers with some chalk maybe you 've been doing some chalk drawing on your pavers as well or your cement pathways and what i 've done today is to collect some treasures from nature that i 'm going to put a beautiful pattern on my tortoise shell so i 've got some of these great sticks that i 'll lie around and i 've collected all different colored leaves some brown leaves that i 'll put around the outside and some green leaves that i might put in the middle to make a really nice pattern and when i 've collected my leaves i 've just collected the leaves that have fallen off the and sheldon will probably be in lots of our videos over the next few weeks sheldon over here it 's not a very good list here let me finish putting the green leaves in the middle [Laughter] with the green leaves here we go so when i collect leaves i don 't pull them off the trees the leaves that we find on the ground because we 'll let the leaves keep growing on the trees now i 've made this beautiful decoration on the tortoise shell full of beautiful patterns and i have a story to read today to you which has got a tortoise in it as well as a hedgehog and the hedgehog is just like an echidna and he hasn 't got a smooth shell like the tortoise he 's got a very bumpy bumpy set of spikes on his back and it 's called why we can 't_''_419.759 hug by owen mclaughlin and polly dunbar while we can 't hug hedgehog and tortoise were the best of friends they wanted to give each other a great big hug but they weren 't allowed to touch to show someone you love them hedgehog tried a wave and that made tortoise smile a tortoise made a funny face and that made hedgehog laugh hedgehog wrote a letter and tortoise wrote one back and when tortoise did a little dance hedgehog joined in too hedgehog blew a kiss across the gap between them tortoise saw it and caught it and kept it and then sent three kisses back tortois sang a song and hedgehog played along then they both painted pictures so that everyone would know they were friends through rain and shine they could not touch they could not hug but they both knew that they were loved so at the moment you can 't see a lot of your friends or your family but there 's lots of ways that you can stay in touch and just like from us we 're going to send you a big wave and a big smile and we 'll be back next week with some more fun adventures in nature from our bush school connections thank you everybody bye _"
