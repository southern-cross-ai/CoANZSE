## Overview

The [Corpus of Australian and New Zealand Spoken English (CoANZSE)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FGW35AK) is a **196-million-word corpus** of **geolocated automatic speech recognition (ASR) YouTube transcripts** from local government channels in **Australia** and **New Zealand**, created for the study of lexical, grammatical, and discourse-pragmatic phenomena of spoken language, as well as for content and language analysis in digital humanities and social science fields. 

**Annotation** includes **individual word timings** and **video IDs** of transcripts, making it easy to instantly view the video(s) for any given search. The corpus was created from **55,896 ASR transcripts** from **472 YouTube channels**, corresponding to almost **24,007 hours of video**. The size of the corpus is **195,583,873 tokens**. 

The channels sampled in the corpus are associated with local government entities such as **local, city, county, district, and regional councils**, and transcripts are from a range of video types. Recordings of public meetings are well-represented. Related resources are the [Corpus of North American Spoken English](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/X8QJJV) and the [Corpus of British Isles Spoken English](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/UGIIWD).

## Dataset Structure

Under `dataset`, there are 5 files inside:

- `metadata.json`: The metadata of the dataset.
- `coanzse_tokens_distributable_02072023.csv.gz`: The 303 MB untagged corpus.
- `coanzse_tokens_distributable_02072023.csv`: The 963 MB unzipped file from `coanzse_tokens_distributable_02072023.csv.gz`.
- `coanzse_textpos_distributable_02072023.csv.gz`: The 1.0 GB PoS-tagged corpus with word timings.
- `coanzse_textpos_distributable_02072023.csv`: The 3.0 GB unzipped file from `coanzse_textpos_distributable_02072023.csv.gz`.

---

The **separator** for both files is the pipe character "|". 

The files have the **columns** 'country', 'state', 'council_name', 'channel_title', 'channel_url', 'video_title', 'video_id', 'upload_date', 'video_length', 'location','nr_words', 'text_pos' (or 'text', in the untagged version), and 'latlong'.

Each **row** corresponds to an individual transcript. 

In order to comply with Fair Use provisions of US copyright law, the original ASR transcript files from YouTube have been transformed into this version of the corpus: **For every 200 words, 10 words have been replaced with "@"**. In the PoS-tagged and word-timed corpus, these tokens have the form @_XX_1.0. See also https://cc.oulu.fi/~scoats/CoANZSE.html.
